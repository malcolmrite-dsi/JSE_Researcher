COVID-19 UPDATE: OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO 85% IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK


Stakeholders are referred to the Group’s Business Update published on 19 November and are advised that,
following recent decisions of the Polish and Bulgarian Governments, tenants occupying approximately 85%
of the Group’s GLA are expected to be operational as of 28 November. A summary of the changes to trading
restrictions is set out below:

- In Poland, the restrictions imposed on non-essential stores’ trading will be lifted from 28 November,
  increasing the Group’s operational GLA by approximately 15%. Cinemas and restaurants will remain closed,
  with restaurants being allowed to operate for take away and deliveries. The remaining restrictions affect 1%
  of the Group’s GLA.

- In Bulgaria, the Government announced new trading restrictions effective from 28 November until
  21 December. These restrictions are similar to those imposed in the spring and provide for the closure of non-
  essential stores, except for food stores, pharmacies, pet shops, banks, insurance offices and payment services
  providers. Restaurants are planned to operate only for take away orders and deliveries. These restrictions are
  estimated to affect 5% of the Group’s GLA.

The Czech Republic Government extended the state of emergency up to 12 December, when the situation
will be reassessed. Current trading restrictions affect approximately 2% of the Group’s total GLA.

The temporary restrictions in the other countries where the Group operates, as announced in the recent
Business Update, continue. Most CEE governments are balancing attempts to mitigate the growing pressure
on medical services against those limiting the negative economic impact of the restrictions. Depending on
infection rates, existing restrictions can be lifted, or new ones introduced on short notice. Additional fiscal
support measures are expected to offset the effects of existing and possible new restrictions.

BUSINESS UPDATE

“After the reopening of all stores in May and June, we have seen a steady pick-up in retail activity across the entire portfolio until 30
September. Footfall in the third quarter of 2020 was 77% and tenant sales 89% of prior year levels. Negotiations with tenants
following lockdown are progressing very well and are currently 84% complete. Partially as a result of this progress, the collection rate
reached 97% for the first six months of 2020 and 90% for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020. NEPI Rockcastle’s
balance sheet strengthened after the disposal of the Romanian office portfolio in August (at the terms negotiated in 2019) and the
green bond issue in July. Consequently, the loan-to-value ratio decreased to 31.8% at 30 September and liquidity reached €1.2 billion
(including undrawn committed credit facilities), further outlining our commitment to maintaining a prudent financial policy. Since the
beginning of October, COVID-19 cases have once again increased throughout Central and Eastern Europe, raising new short-term
challenges. However, the Group’s underlying strength and the high potential of the economies where it operates will enable NEPI
Rockcastle to return to sustainable growth in the medium and long term.”
Alex Morar, CEO


BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

    •    On 30 September, 100% of the total gross lettable area (‘GLA’) was operational, as the remaining trading bans for Romanian
         indoor food service and cinemas in Romania, Croatia and Serbia were lifted in the first half of September. Since then, new
         measures have been adopted by governments in certain Central and Eastern Europe (‘CEE’) countries to contain the virus,
         causing the temporary limitation of some tenants’ operations. The restrictions affected approximately 7% of total GLA on 31
         October and 25% at 18 November.
    •    Footfall during the third quarter of 2020 (‘Q3 2020’) was 77% of the prior year level, and decreased to 72% in October, as ne w
         restrictions were introduced.
    •    Tenant sales during Q3 2020 were 89% of the third quarter of 2019 (‘Q3 2019’) value (like-for-like (‘LfL’) property,
         excluding entertainment, food service and hypermarkets), showing a strong recovery after the re-opening of non-essential
         stores.
    •    By the end of October, agreements were reached with tenants representing 94% of Gross Rental Income regarding deferral of
         payments and rent concessions, of which 84% were signed. The significant progress made is a considerable achievement and a
         credit to the great work of the Group’s asset management team.
    •    Collection rate was 97% of reported revenues (adjusted for concessions granted) for the first half of 2020 (‘H1 2020’) and 90%
         for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 (‘9M 2020’).
    •    Government imposed reliefs and negotiated concessions granted to tenants, referring to contractual receivables up to 30
         September 2020, were recognised in the Income Statement of the period, either as a reduction of rental income or as an expense
         with partial forgiveness of receivables. This had a significant impact on the 9M 2020 results with Net Operating Income (‘NOI’)
         amounting to €252 million, 16% lower than in the nine-month period ended 30 September 2019 (‘9M 2019’), reflecting the
         current economic climate in the financial results for the period (see ‘Accounting of COVID-19’s Impact on 9M 2020 Results’
         below).
    •    The net amount of expected credit losses for 9M 2020 was €1.8 million (compared to €0.4 million for 9M 2019), as a direct
         result of the economic impact of lockdowns. There were no significant insolvencies in the period.
    •    European Public Real Estate Association (‘EPRA’) occupancy rate as of 30 September 2020 was 95.7%, compared to
         approximately 95.8% as at 30 June 2020.
    •    Liquidity as at 30 September was very strong, amounting to €1.2 billion, of which €575 million in available committed credit
         facilities.
    •    The loan-to-value ratio (‘LTV’) was 31.8% as at 30 September, significantly below the 35% strategic target. During Q3 2020,
         the Group further increased the headroom under debt covenants, which was already substantial.
    •    The launch of the Green Finance Framework and successful issuance of €500 million unsecured green bonds in July 2020
         extended the average debt maturity from 3.6 years as at 30 June to 4.4 years as at 30 September.
    •    Active liability management during the second half of 2019 (‘H2 2019’) and 9M 2020 decreased weighted average cost of debt
         to 2.2% (from 2.4% in H2 2019).
    •    Investment grade credit ratings reaffirmed at BBB by Fitch Ratings (stable outlook) and S&P Global Ratings (negative outlook).
    •    EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share was €6.42 at 30 September, 3.5% lower compared to €6.65 at 30 June, mostly due to
         the recent capitalisation issue.
    •    The disposal of the Romanian office portfolio, announced on 7 August, was successfully completed on 27 August. The
         transaction terms were materially the same as initially agreed in 2019. The transaction was fully settled for net cash proceeds
         of €294.8 million and generated a net gain on disposal of €1.8 million.
    •    The property portfolio’s value is substantially unchanged, at €5.9 billion. No property valuations were undertaken in Q3 2020, in
         accordance with the Group’s policy to perform independent revaluations at half-year and year-end reporting dates.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Status of trading restrictions and government measures

By the end of September 2020, lockdown restrictions had been lifted across the portfolio and all GLA was operational. Since then, the
increase in COVID-19 cases led some governments to announce new restrictions to limit the spread of infections. The most significant
are the temporary closing of non-essential shops in Poland and Czech Republic. A summary of current relevant government measures
in each country is detailed below.

Romania (90% GLA currently operational) – All GLA was operational at 30 September. The subsequent rise in COVID-19 cases
led to the introduction of new local level restrictions commencing on 10 October, based on the infection rate over the previous 14 days
(expressed as number of new cases per 1,000 people). In cities and regions where the infection rate is 1.5-3, indoor food courts and
restaurants can operate at reduced capacity. If it is above 3, cinemas, food courts and restaurants are temporarily closed (outdoor
terraces may remain open, while takeaways and delivery services can continue). Currently the restrictions apply to several cities,
including Bucharest, and affect 4% of the Group’s total GLA.

Poland (31% GLA currently operational) – While on 30 September all GLA was operational, the government subsequently
announced the closure of cinemas and non-essential stores in shopping centres between 7-29 November. Groceries, DIY stores,
pharmacies, services, pet shops and bookstores are exempt. Restaurants and food courts can operate takeaway and delivery services.
These restrictions affect approximately 16% of the Group’s total GLA. Authorities are currently discussing a set of measures to
support the affected businesses.

Slovakia (94% GLA currently operational) – From 15 October, indoor restaurants can only operate takeaway and delivery services
and entertainment tenants are (except for cinemas and fitness centres for which restrictions have been partially lifted on 16 November
and are now allowed to operate at reduced capacity). These measures affect approximately 1% of the Group’s total GLA.

Hungary (83% GLA currently operational) – Starting 11 November, there are new restrictions limiting the activities of indoor
restaurants and entertainment facilities (leisure, fitness, swimming pools, cinemas). In addition, all stores allowed to trade must close
at 7pm. The measures affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

Bulgaria (100% GLA currently operational) – There are currently no trading restrictions and all GLA has been operational since 18
May.

Croatia and Serbia (100% GLA currently operational) – At the start of September cinemas reopened, bringing operational GLA to
100%. Partial restrictions and social distancing measures are in place, such as reduced capacity and working hours for cinemas and
restaurants.

Czech Republic (35% GLA currently operational) – The Government ordered cinemas and non-essential shops, excluding
groceries, pharmacies, pet shops, opticians, tobacconists, pick-up points, IT services, florists and car washes, to close from 22 October
until 20 November. Restaurants can offer takeaway and delivery services if accessible from the street. From 28 October all stores,
except pharmacies, must close at 8pm and on Sundays. The Government is supporting affected retailers by providing a 50% subsidy
for rent for up to three months, with no assistance required from landlords. These measures affect approximately 2% of the Group’s
total GLA.

Lithuania (79% GLA currently operational) – From 7 to 29 November, cinemas and entertainment facilities are closed and indoor
restaurants can only provide takeaway and delivery services. These measures affect approximately 1% of the Group’s total GLA.

Besides measures directly affecting retail, governments also introduced more general restrictions, including mandatory masks in
crowded outdoor spaces in most countries, limitations on social gatherings, schools educating pupils entirely or partially online and
cancellation of public events. Depending on infection rates, existing restrictions can be lifted (most are in place for a period of 2-4
weeks and are subject to reassessment) or new ones introduced on short notice. Currently, most CEE governments are balancing
attempts to mitigate the growing pressure on medical services against those limiting the negative economic impact of the restrictions.
Additional fiscal support measures are expected to offset the effects of existing and possible new restrictions.

Tenant support

Constructive tenant negotiations continue, and by 31 October agreements in relation to aid regarding the impact of the spring
lockdown were reached for 94% of Gross Rental Income, out of which 84% were already signed. The total value of COVID-19 related
rent reliefs and discounts granted up to 30 September amounts to €55.6 million, of which €54.2 million was recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income in 9M 2020, and the rest was subject to straight-lining. A significant amount of this is due to
Polish regulations imposing a rent-free period for tenants, including service charges and marketing costs, during the 14 March – 4
May lockdown. Rent concessions were lower in countries where governments partially subsidised rents subject to agreements between
landlords and tenants (Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia).

In exchange for rent deferrals and concessions, the Company obtained valuable amendments to lease terms, such as:

    •    extended lease duration;
    •    higher sales-based rents with more frequent reconciliation;
    •    concession reversal if turnovers or occupancy cost ratios are better than specified thresholds;
    •    cancellation of some tenant unilateral extension options;
    •    improved occupancy cost clauses, and/or
    •    higher base rent over the lease term via the introduction, or increase, of step rents.

The Group continuously assesses the evolution of COVID-19 related restrictions and their impact on tenants’ operations, and aims to
maintain an ongoing dialogue with its partners.

Trading update

After the reopening of most non-essential stores in May and June, performance improved steadily throughout Q3 2020, with every
month showing higher sales than the previous. Overall sales in Q3 2020 were 11% lower than in Q3 2019 (on a LfL basis, excluding
entertainment, hospitality and hypermarkets). Footfall was 23% lower in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019. In October, when COVID-19
cases increased, footfall was 28% lower than prior year levels (October’s sales figures are not yet available).

The recovery is stronger in secondary cities and smaller shopping centres, while central assets in large cities, which are more reliant
on office workers, improved at a slower pace. The best tenant sales (LfL) were in Czech Republic (-1.2% compared to Q3 2019),
Serbia (-1.7% compared to Q3 2019), Poland (-2.7% compared to Q3 2019) and Slovakia (-3.0% compared to Q3 2019). Hungary (-
19.8% compared to Q3 2019), Romania (-16.8% compared to Q3 2019), Bulgaria (-10.5% compared to Q3 2019) and Lithuania (-
9.9% compared to Q3 2019) performed worst, due to their high exposure to inner city assets in large and capital cities. The best
performing product categories were sporting goods (-0.7% compared to Q3 2019), electronics (-2.3% compared to Q3 2019) and
furniture & DIY (-3.8% compared to Q3 2019), while the worst performing were kiosks (-22.6% compared to Q3 2019) and services
(-21.6% compared to Q3 2019). This reflects how consumer preferences have changed during this period, with new work/life routines
favouring sports and electronics products over services and entertainment offerings. Another feature is the sizeable increase in the
average basket per shopper (e.g. by 7.7% in September 2020 compared to the same month in 2019), which explains why sales
recovered faster than footfall.

During Q3 2020, the Group focused its communication and marketing strategy on the promotion of safety measures, such as collecting
personal data for tracing suspected cases and ensuring social distancing, and on targeted sales campaigns and events (media
partnership with TV shows, sustainability initiatives, drive-in cinemas, exhibitions and workshops, etc). The events were mainly held
outside, on terraces or parking areas, in full compliance with local restrictions.

Leasing activity

In Q3 2020 the Group signed 46 new leases and renewed 72 lease agreements (excluding lease term extensions related to tenant
support agreements), confirming the continuing appeal of NEPI Rockcastle’s properties. New leases and renewals are virtually
identical to those used pre-pandemic. Commercial terms typically include base rent, fully recoverable service charges, marketing fees
and additional turnover rent. Lease terms are a minimum of five years, with no break options or additional incentives, base rent and
marketing fees are indexed annually against consumer price indices and leases are denominated in Euro.

The Group continued to attract new retailers, improving tenant mix and quality. The highlights during Q3 2020 are detailed below.

    •   Promenada Mall, Bucharest, Romania: Burger King opened concurrently with mall’s food court reopening (1 September),
        further to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.
    •   Braila Mall, Braila, Romania: Decathlon opened in September, and toy retailer Smyk opened the city’s first branch.
    •   Mega Mall, Bucharest, Romania: there were ten openings in Q3 2020, Benvenuti (reopening), Dristor Kebap, Gatta
        (reopening), Kiehl’s, Louis Juna, Nike (refurbishment to the latest brand concept, first in the city), Orange (relocation and
        store enlargement), Profihairshop, Tavex and Vans.
    •   Vulcan Value Centre, Bucharest, Romania: KFC opened its first unit in Romania with outdoor digital menus (in addition to the
        indoor ones) and kiosks-type devices, to simplify ordering process.
    •   Shopping City Ramnicu Valcea, Ramnicu Valcea, Romania: three new stores opened in Q3 2020, Bella Italia, GRID and
        Sizeer.
    •   Shopping City Deva, Deva, Romania: the Polish athletic wear retailer Sizeer opened a new store during September.
    •   Bonarka City Center, Krakow, Poland: new openings include Awiteks, Deli Pizza and Soho.
    •   Galeria Warminska, Olsztyn, Poland: CoffeTeria opened and Guess launched a regional flagship store.
    •   Aupark Kosice Mall, Kosice, Slovakia: new lease agreements signed with Coccinelle, Grand Optical and Tosca Blu.
    •   Aupark Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia: the region’s first Samsung lease was signed with Samsung Gallery and Dr. Max opened.
    •   Forum Usti nad Labem, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic: new lease agreements signed with Running Sushi and
        Sportisimo.
    •   Serdika Center, Sofia, Bulgaria: new openings include Nespresso and eMag’s first showroom in Sofia.
    •   Arena Mall, Budapest, Hungary: Gloria Jeans Coffee opened.
    •   Mammut Shopping Centre, Budapest, Hungary: new stores include eMag, Nespresso and Tamaris.
    •   Ozas Shopping and Entertainment Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania: following the successful opening of Adventica, the
        country’s largest family entertainment park, six new lease agreements were signed, including City Jeans, Fielmann, Loois and
        Silver Fox.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants and staff is the Group’s main priority, which is why 32 NEPI Rockcastle
properties have been audited and certified ‘COVID-19 Compliant’ by the SAFE Asset Group, a global certification and advisory
company working in risk and security management. This international certification confirms that certified malls offer a secure
shopping experience during the pandemic.

All centres implement and maintain all recommended safety measures, such as: temperature and mask checks at all entrances; flow
control limiting customer numbers; social distancing; provision of sanitizers; Nano Septic self-cleaning surfaces for all frequently
touched areas; daily disinfection of critical areas, and increased heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) maintenance and
ventilation, including higher percentages of fresh air intake. Furthermore, all tenants and suppliers must adhere to strict employee
protocols.

DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

NEPI Rockcastle reduced development pipeline expenditure in order to preserve liquidity and optimise capital allocation; non-committed
capital expenditure (‘CapEx’) has been deferred, unless it would affect a project’s value.

Key committed projects, such as the extension and refurbishment of Focus Mall Zielona Gora (Zielona Gora, Poland) and Bonarka City
Center (Krakow, Poland), are progressing as per schedule. Permitting and value-enhancing investments continued in strategic projects,
such as the Promenada Mall (Bucharest, Romania) extension and the Promenada Craiova (Craiova, Romania) development. A flexible
approach to contracting enables the Group to suspend and resume developments with relative ease.

During the 9M 2020, NEPI Rockcastle spent €116 million on developments and capital expenditures. The Group continues to invest in
developments that contribute to growth and improve long-term portfolio value and income generation. Estimated capital expenditures
on developments and operating assets, to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2020 amounts to €40 million.

ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO DISPOSAL

As previously announced, NEPI Rockcastle concluded an agreement with AFI Europe on 6 August 2020 to dispose of 100% of shares
in subsidiaries holding the Romanian office portfolio, with a total GLA of 117,500m2, for a transaction value of €307 million
(equivalent to a blended yield of approximately 8%), which generated a net gain on disposal of €1.8 million. Closing took place on 27
August 2020. The net cash consideration was €294.8 million and was fully settled. No material changes were made or discounts
granted to the original terms agreed in 2019. Apart from market standard representations and warranties, the Group has no outstanding
commitments in relation to the disposed assets.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Changes to the Board of Directors

As announced on 29 September, the Board approved the appointment of Mr. Andreas Klingen, an existing Independent Non-
Executive Director, to act as member of the Nomination Committee and Lead Independent Director, effective as of 28 September.

EPRA BPR Gold Award

NEPI Rockcastle has received the EPRA Gold Award for compliance with its Best Practices Recommendations (‘BPR’) for financial
reporting, confirming the Group’s commitment to excellence in financial reporting. EPRA is the leading real estate industry
organisation in Europe. The Group joined EPRA in 2018, and won the Silver Award for BPR in 2019, as a recognition of its
commitment to transparency in reporting and compliance with industry best practices. In 2020, the Group has further improved its
financial reporting and BPR compliance, achievements which were recognised by EPRA through the Gold Award, the highest
standard for transparency of financial performance measures.

ACCOUNTING OF COVID-19’S IMPACT ON 9M 2020 RESULTS

Rent discounts

During 9M 2020, NEPI Rockcastle recognised rent concessions worth €54.2 million in its Statement of Comprehensive Income (detailed
below), resulting in €252 million NOI for the period.

Rent reliefs (reduction of rental income)
The Polish Government imposed a legally enforced rent-free period for tenants, including service charges and marketing costs, during
the State of Emergency from mid-March to early May. This relief has been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a
reduction of Gross Rental Income (€8.6 million) and Service Charge Income (€2.4 million), and as a decrease of Trade and Other
Receivables, in the Statement of Financial Position.

In some instances, the Group has agreed to variable discounts contingent upon tenant sales dropping below a certain threshold. In 9M
2020 these discounts amounted to a total of €0.5 million, recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a reduction of
Gross Rental Income (negative variable rent).

Partial forgiveness of receivables

In order to maintain a long-term functioning retail environment, and based on tenant negotiations, partial forgiveness of contractual
receivables for lockdown, and/or immediately after lockdown, was granted. Discussions with retailers regarding COVID-19 support
continued in all countries throughout Q3 2020, and by 30 September lease modifications (see definition below) were signed by tenants
representing 57% of Gross Rental Income.

For the period up to the signing of lease modifications, the forgiven receivables have not been recognised as lease incentives in the
financial statements, and therefore their financial impact was not straight-lined over the new lease term. As such, tenant concessions
granted before the signing of lease modifications corresponding to 9M 2020, amounting to €42.1 million, were fully accounted for in
the Statement of Comprehensive Income as “Partial Forgiveness of Receivables (COVID-19 Forgiveness)”, and “Trade and Other
Receivables” in the Statement of Financial Position, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 9
“Financial Instruments” (in relation to impairment of receivables). The accounting treatment is also in accordance with IFRS 16,
which allows rental income to be recognised even if recoverability is uncertain and requires rental modifications to be accounted for
only from the effective date of the modification. This approach emphasizes the Company’s commitment to fair and transparent
reporting of the impact of the pandemic and related lockdowns on financial results.

Contractually agreed and signed modifications subject to straight-lining from the effective date of the modification

Contractually agreed and signed concessions granted to, and obtained from, tenants are treated according to IFRS 16 “Leases”.

IFRS 16 defines ‘lease modification’ as a change in scope, or consideration, of the lease, not part of the original terms and conditions,
such as rent discounts, lease extensions, increase in overage/turnover rents, introduction of break options, etc. It also requires that
lease modifications are recognised prospectively over the new lease term and accounted for by the lessor from the date the
modification is contractually agreed and signed by both parties.

Agreed lease modifications are recognised as lease incentives from the date the modification was signed. Such modifications are straight-
lined over the new lease term and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a reduction of Gross Rental Income. In 9M
2020, the reduction recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income was €0.6 million. The impact of rent concessions agreed as of
30 September 2020 on future reporting periods is €1.4 million.

Trade receivables

The collection rate for H1 2020, adjusted for concessions granted, was 97%, based on rental for the six months ended 30 June 2020,
and 90% for 9M 2020 (this increased to 93% by 31 October). On 30 September 2020, uncollected receivables amounted to €76.4
million (including VAT), of which €46.2 million were overdue; these receivables related to 9M 2020 decreased to €58.1 million by 31
October, of which €26.5 million overdue. This balance is adjusted for rent relief and concessions, either legally enforced or negotiated.
The Company expects to collect the full outstanding balance when tenant negotiations are finalised, in line with the pattern already
experienced in respect of completed negotiations, which prompted a significant improvement in collections.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

The Group had a very strong liquidity profile on 30 September, with €594 million in cash and €575 million in undrawn committed
credit facilities.

NEPI Rockcastle’s gearing ratio* (interest bearing debt less cash, divided by investment property plus listed securities) was 31.8%,
significantly below the 35% target.

*The reported gearing ratio (LTV) excludes the €31.9 million right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities as at 30 September 2020

As of 30 September 2020, ratios for unsecured loans and bonds showed ample headroom compared to covenants:

     •     Solvency Ratio: 40% actual vs covenant threshold of maximum 60%;
     •     Consolidated Coverage Ratio: 5.5 actual vs covenant threshold of minimum 2;
     •     Unencumbered consolidated total assets/unsecured consolidated total debt: 264% actual vs covenant threshold of minimum
           150%.

Liability management and bond issue

In July, after meetings with European fixed-income investors, NEPI Rockcastle issued a €500 million inaugural unsecured green bond
with a seven-year maturity, carrying a 3.375% fixed coupon and an issue price of 98.172%. The green bond issue improved the
Group’s liquidity and increased the weighted average debt maturity from 3.6 years as of 30 June to 4.4 years as of 30 September.

Cost of debt

The average interest rate, including hedging, was 2.2% for 9M 2020. This is lower than it was during the same period last year, which
is mainly due to liability management initiatives implemented by the Company in H2 2019 and 9M 2020. All exposure to variable
interest rates is covered by hedges.

The Company continually evaluates its financing options, while keeping in mind the strategic objective to broaden its shareholder base
and maintain an optimal capital structure. Depending on market conditions, the Group may initiate a repurchase of issued bonds or
shares during the following reporting periods.

Credit rating

In April 2020, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (‘S&P’) reaffirmed the Group’s rating at BBB and revised the outlook from stable
to negative, reflecting the agency’s views on potential risks associated with the wider retail real estate sector due to COVID-19 related
disruptions. In September 2020, S&P maintained their rating action from April 2020.

In April and November 2020, Fitch reaffirmed the Group’s BBB credit rating and maintained the stable outlook. The agency
mentioned that the rating action reflects the Group’s large portfolio of regionally dominant shopping centres, and its robust financial
profile, underpinned by low gearing ratios and strong liquidity, providing flexibility in handling the economic impact of the current
context.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings, in accordance with its
prudent financial strategy.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE

NEPI Rockcastle’s Board of Directors had resolved in August to allot and issue fully paid ordinary shares as a capitalisation issue to
the Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding, in lieu of a cash distribution for H1 2020. During September,
25,791,534 shares were issued and listed on the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

OUTLOOK

NEPI Rockcastle issued an earnings guidance in August 2020, which stated that the contraction in distributable earnings per share for
the year ending 31 December 2020 is expected to be approximately 30% compared to the prior year. This guidance did not consider
the impact of further macroeconomic disruptions (such as those potentially caused by a new broad lockdown in CEE countries) and
assumed a continuation of the trading dynamics observed until that date.

The Group’s performance and distributable earnings until 31 October were in line with the guidance. The increase in COVID-19 cases
led some governments to announce new restrictions during November, including the temporary closing of non-essential shops in
Poland and Czech Republic. Further restrictions may be introduced, also in other countries, thus increasing the uncertainty over the
potential negative impact of such measures over the Group’s financial results.

Based on currently available information and restrictions in place, the Group estimates that the impact on its distributable earnings per
share for 2020 will be a further decrease of 2% compared to previously issued guidance. This estimate is highly dependent on
potential future measures which could be taken by governments of the CEE countries where the Group operates, such as further
restrictions on trading or state support to tenants and / or landlords.

This guidance has not been reviewed or reported on by NEPI Rockcastle’s auditors and is the responsibility of the Board of Directors.

CORRECTION TO DEALINGS IN SECURITIES ANNOUNCEMENT


Reference is made to the dealings in securities announcement published on 30 April 2019 which included, inter alia,
information on the receipt of 167 shares by Antoine Dijkstra, a director of NEPI Rockcastle, in terms of an election to
receive the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 as a return of capital by way of an issue of new shares.
Further reconciliations of the share register show that no election to receive the dividend as an issue of new shares was
made by Antoine Dijkstra and the dividend was settled in cash. Accordingly, the 167 shares were not received by Antoine
Dijkstra and the disclosure contained in the announcement published on 30 April 2019 should therefore exclude this
allocation.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEW RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED IN SOME OF THE CEE COUNTRIES
WHERE THE GROUP OPERATES


NEPI Rockcastle provided an update on the COVID-19 related government measures in some of the CEE
countries in which the Group operates in an announcement dated 23 October 2020. Since that date, the
dynamic of the COVID-19 causalities led to the reassessment of the adopted measures, as follows:

-   In Czech Republic, the Government extended the trading ban introduced on 22 October on all non-
    essential shops until 20 November, with restaurants allowed to operate for deliveries and take
    away (provided there is a direct access to the restaurant from the street). These measures affect
    approximately 2% of the Group’s total GLA.

-   In Romania, temporary closing of food courts, restaurants and entertainment tenants (including
    cinemas) continues to apply for a further period of two weeks in cities/regions where the number of
    infections has exceeded 3 cases/1,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days. Indoor restaurants in such regions
    are allowed to only operate for take away orders and deliveries. The restrictions currently apply to
    several cities in Romania, including Bucharest, and affect 3% of the Group’s GLA. The geographical
    extent of these restrictions may change, depending on the prevailing medical situation at local level.

-   The existing restrictions applied in Slovakia, consisting of indoor restaurants operating only for take
    away orders and deliveries and entertainment tenants with activities temporarily suspended, are in place
    up until the 7-day moving average number of new infections falls below 500 cases. These restrictions
    affect approximately 1% of the Group’s GLA.

    Slovakia undertook a nationwide testing programme over the last two weekends, revealing that
    approximately 1% of the population is COVID-19 positive. The extended testing and subsequent
    measures taken are expected to generate a significant reduction of the COVID-19 infections, therefore
    also reducing the need to impose additional restrictions.

-   In Poland, the Government required the majority of non-essential shops in retail locations measuring
    over 2,000 sqm to close between 7 November and 29 November. The activities not affected by the
    Government’s decisions and trading in the Group’s shopping centres are groceries, DIY stores,
    pharmacies and medical stores, cosmetics, pet stores, units selling books or newspapers,
    telecommunication stores and services. Restaurants can operate only for takeaway and deliveries. The
    introduction of the new restrictions in Poland affects approximately 16% of the Group’s total GLA.

    As of today, the Government’s decree issued in March 2020 and providing for the suspension of the
    tenants’ financial obligations for the duration of restrictions is still in place. The Government is
    currently assessing the potential support for the retailers and landlords negatively impacted by these
    measures.

-   In Lithuania, all entertainment areas (cinemas, fitness centers, dancing studios, aquaparks) are closed
    and indoor restaurants can only operate for take away orders and deliveries. These restrictions affect
    approximately 1% of the Group’s GLA.

-   In Hungary, the prime minister announced new restrictions limiting the activities of indoor restaurants
    and entertainment facilities (leisure, fitness, swimming pools, cinemas) starting 11 November. The
    measures will affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

-   There is an increasing number of new COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days in CEE, in line with the
    worldwide trend. The existing restrictions in Bulgaria, Serbia, and Croatia do not prohibit the activity
    of any sector and, as of today, 100% of the Group’s GLA in these countries is operational.

As of today, tenants representing 77% of the Group’s GLA are operating. NEPI Rockcastle continues to
engage constructively with its business partners and the wider communities, prioritising safety and aiming for
a fair and equitable approach that would ensure the long-term success of our retail ecosystem. The Group has
an ongoing dialogue with industry bodies and governments to ensure all health protocols are strictly followed
and shopping centres remain safe destinations.

The Group has a strong liquidity position of approx. €1.2 billion, which includes cash and access to committed
undrawn revolving facilities. Debt covenants show significant headroom to the required levels and there are
no significant financial liabilities due in the following two years. The Group is comfortable that its high-quality
portfolio, prudent LTV (currently at approximately 32%) and robust liquidity will allow it to successfully meet
future challenges.

Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 19 November 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE: RECENT RESTRICTIONS ADOPTED IN SOME OF THE GROUP’S CEE COUNTRIES

Subsequent to the updates concerning the impact of the COVID-19 on the Group’s operations, the most recent
dated 17 September 2020, the Group provides herewith further news on its portfolio.

New measures have been recently adopted by the governments of the CEE countries to contain the spread of
the virus. These measures include temporarily limiting the operations of some of our shopping centres’
tenants:

    -   In Czech Republic, the Government ordered all non-essential shops to close and tightened other social-
        distancing rules starting 22 October. In the past two weeks, the country registered the highest number of
        COVID-19 new infections since the beginning of the pandemic, and the highest in the CEE. While all other
        countries where the Group is present reported between 0.3 and 3.5 new cases / 1,000 inhabitants for the 14-
        day period ended 22 October, Czech Republic reported 10.6 new cases.

        The introduction of the new restrictions in Czech Republic affects approximately 2% of the Group’s total
        GLA. In addition, restaurants in Czech malls, corresponding to 0.2% of the Group’s GLA, operate only for
        take away orders and deliveries. The Government communicated its support for all affected retailers and
        provides a subsidy of 50% of the rent and related charges, with no subsidy requested from landlords. In
        addition, the government covers 100% of payroll costs for companies affected by the restrictions.

    -   In Romania, restrictions relate to temporary closing entertainment tenants in the cities/regions where the
        number of infections has exceeded 3 cases/1,000 inhabitants, while indoor restaurants in such regions can
        only operate for take away orders and deliveries. As of today, these restrictions affect 1.7% of the Group’s
        GLA.

    -   In Poland, temporary restrictions have been implemented for fitness clubs and swimming pools, accounting
        for less than 1% of the Group’s GLA. In addition, from 24 October onwards, indoor restaurants will operate
        only for take away orders and deliveries.

    -   In Slovakia, indoor restaurants only operate for take away orders and deliveries, while entertainment tenants
        temporarily suspended their activities. The restrictions affect 1% of the Group’s GLA.

These new measures currently impact approximately 6% of the Group’s total GLA, including indoor restaurants which operate
for take away orders and deliveries. All restrictions are imposed for only two weeks, at the end of which the situation 
will be reassessed.

Considering the dynamic of the new COVID-19 cases, other CEE governments where the Group operates
adjusted the safety restrictions in place, without prohibiting activities in any sectors. Wearing masks became
mandatory in the crowded outdoor spaces in most countries, while gatherings allow a limited number of
people, schools are functioning online only or in a hybrid model, and restaurants are allowed to trade at limited
capacity. The CEE governments’ approach is balanced, aiming to control the pressure on the health system
but also to limit the negative impact on economy.

At Group level, the footfall reached 75%-80% of the same period last year. The negotiations with tenants
progressed, increasing the collection rate for the first six months of the year to over 97% of the reported
revenues (adjusted for concessions granted).

Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 19 November 2020.

PORTFOLIO FULLY OPERATIONAL

NEPI Rockcastle’s portfolio is now 100% operational, as all trading restrictions in the countries where the
Group operates have ended.

Most restrictions had already ended by mid-August, except for indoor food service tenants in Romania and
cinemas in Romania, Croatia and Serbia. Romania ended the trading ban for indoor food service units on 1
September, and all indoor restaurants, food courts and coffee shops are now welcoming customers. Cinemas
opened gradually during the first two weeks of September and, as of today, they are all operating. The
remaining restrictions in Croatia and Serbia have also been lifted, with cinemas opened since the beginning
of September.

Maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants and staff continues to be NEPI Rockcastle’s top
priority. All necessary precautions for safe visits to the malls have been implemented, along with the
governments’ new measures for COVID-19 prevention in the entertainment areas. The Group is also
supporting the sales of indoor food tenants and cinemas by organising dedicated campaigns and promotions.

“We are delighted that all the Group’s properties are fully functional, and we are collaborating with our tenants
to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for visitors. We are already recording notable progress in respect
of footfall and tenants’ sales. We will continue to cooperate closely with all stakeholders in order to
successfully overcome this challenging period.” Alex Morar, CEO of NEPI Rockcastle.

CASH PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS

Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 21 August 2020 relating to the capitalisation issue
at a ratio of 4.2920 ordinary shares for every 100 ordinary shares held by NEPI Rockcastle shareholders on
Friday, 11 September 2020.

Where the application of the ratio in respect of the capitalisation issue gives rise to a fraction of a new
capitalisation share, such fraction will be rounded down to the nearest whole number with a cash payment
(“cash payment”) made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction.

The value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders has
been determined with reference to the volume weighted average traded price of a NEPI Rockcastle share on
the JSE on Wednesday, 9 September 2020, discounted by 10%. On this basis, shareholders are advised that
the gross value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders
is ZAR64.91031. For shareholders on the European register, this gross value is EUR3.27497, being the
aforementioned Rand value converted to Euro at the exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR19.8201 as at
Wednesday, 9 September 2020.

The salient dates and times announced on 21 August 2020 remain unchanged.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE


Shareholders are referred to the interim condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020
wherein shareholders were advised that the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle has resolved to allot and issue fully
paid ordinary shares of €0.01 each (“Capitalisation Shares”) as a capitalisation issue (“Capitalisation Issue”) to the
Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding at a ratio of 4.2920 ordinary shares for every 100
ordinary shares held.

The rationale for the Capitalisation Issue is to ensure that NEPI Rockcastle maintains a strong balance sheet and ample
liquidity while also returning value to shareholders during the present operating environment.

The salient dates in respect of the Capitalisation Issue are as follows:

                                                                           JSE and A2X           Euronext Amsterdam

Capitalisation Shares and Capitalisation Shares listed on
the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam

Shares may not be rematerialised or dematerialised from Wednesday, 9 September 2020 to Friday, 11 September 2020,
both days inclusive. Transfer of shares between the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam may not take place between
Tuesday, 8 September 2020 and Friday 11 September 2020, both days inclusive.

Where NEPI Rockcastle’s shareholder’s entitlement to Capitalisation Shares in relation to the Capitalisation Issue gives
rise to a fraction of a new Capitalisation Share, such fraction will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the
remaining balance will be settled in cash. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined with reference to
the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday, 9 September 2020, less 10% (converted to Euro
at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on
Thursday, 10 September 2020 before 11:00 am South African time.

Application will be made to the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam to list the new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued in terms
of the Capitalisation Issue with effect from the commencement of trade on Monday, 21 September 2020.

Tax and legal implications

The Capitalisation Issue in jurisdictions other than the Republic of South Africa may be restricted by law and failure to
comply with any of these restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdictions

The Capitalisation Issue is not a dividend and therefore will not attract dividend withholding tax in South Africa or the
Isle of Man, but may have tax implications in other jurisdictions, and NEPI Rockcastle’s shareholders are advised to
obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisors in this regard.

Exchange Control Regulations

The following is intended only as a guide and is therefore not a comprehensive statement of the Exchange Control
Regulations of South Africa issued under the Currency and Exchanges Act, 1933, as amended (“Exchange Control
Regulations”), and is applicable to shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE and A2X only.

All aspects relating to the Exchange Control Regulations will be managed by a shareholder’s CSDP or broker.
Shareholders who are in any doubt as to the appropriate course of action to take should consult their CSDP, broker or
other professional advisors.

NEPI Rockcastle shares issued in terms of the Capitalisation Issue are not freely transferable from South Africa and
must be dealt with in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations. Shareholders who hold shares traded on the JSE can
only receive shares traded on the JSE and A2X.

Capitalisation Shares issued to non-residents will be credited to their CSDP or broker accounts and a “non-resident”
annotation will appear in the CSDP or broker register. Future dividend payments will be credited directly to the bank
accounts nominated for shareholders by their CSDP or broker.

Shares issued to emigrants will be credited to the emigrant blocked share accounts at the CSDP or broker controlling
their blocked assets and a “non-resident” annotation will appear in the CSDP or broker register.

Distribution of Capitalisation Issue

The Capitalisation Shares will be distributed from NEPI Rockcastle’s share premium.

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the NEPI
Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be delivered
in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership of such shares. References to
NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue or to any shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle following the implementation of the Capitalisation Issue should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt,
issue or holding of security entitlements representing beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any
registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares.

All NEPI Rockcastle shares issued pursuant to the Capitalisation Issue will be registered in the name of Nederlands
Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V. (“Euroclear Nederland”), for and on behalf of shareholders. NEPI
Rockcastle shares traded on the JSE and A2X will be delivered in accordance with the rules of Strate and those traded
on Euronext Amsterdam will be delivered in accordance with the rules of Euroclear Nederland.

Shareholders are advised that the Company has not declared a dividend for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020.

SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT: REVIEWED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020


“The last six months were the most economically challenging in recent history. The measures taken by governments in
the fight against the spread of COVID-19 led to the temporary closure of non-essential retailers in all the countries
where NEPI Rockcastle operates, which had an adverse impact on the first half (H1 2020) results. The same strengths
that made NEPI Rockcastle the premier shopping centre owner in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), such as a well-
balanced portfolio of high-quality properties, conservative financial management and exceptional employees, are now
helping it to successfully overcome this period. Evidence is already very encouraging, 96% of total gross leasable area
(GLA) is now functional and fully-operating tenant sales are gradually returning to prior year levels (88% in June).
NEPI Rockcastle engaged constructively with its business partners and the wider communities, prioritising safety and
aiming for a fair and equitable approach that would ensure the long-term success of our retail ecosystem. Moving
forward, we intend to accelerate the digital transformation of our operations and the transition to a more integrated,
omnichannel business model. At the same time, we appreciate that the COVID-19 context might still impact the
economies of our region and we will continue to manage our capital prioritising long-term sustainability, while also
returning value to shareholders even through these unprecedented times. To this end we decided to propose a
capitalisation issue that benefits shareholders while ensuring that the Group maintains a strong balance sheet and ample
liquidity.” Alex Morar, CEO NEPI Rockcastle

DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

The Group achieved 19.66 euro cents in distributable earnings per share for the first half of 2020, 32% lower compared
to 29.02 euro cents in H1 2019, the decrease being directly attributable to the impact of COVID-19.

As over 95% of the leases were not subject to formally agreed modifications by 30 June 2020, government-imposed
reliefs and negotiated concessions during H1 2020 were recognised in the Income Statement of the period, as a reduction
of rental income (€11 million) and as an expense with partial forgiveness of receivables (€37 million). This approach
translated into a significant impact on the H1 2020 results, which reflects transparently the current business
circumstances. For more details on the accounting of rental concessions, please refer to Note 2 of the interim
consolidated financial statements.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION

Shareholders are advised that the Company has not declared a dividend for the six month period ended 30 June 2020.

CAPITALISATION ISSUE

The board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle’s has resolved to allot and issue fully paid ordinary shares as a capitalisation
issue to the Company’s shareholders, pro-rata to their current shareholding. An announcement containing full details of
the capitalisation issue will be released separately on the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam.

EXTERNAL AUDIT REVIEW AND EMPHASIS OF MATTER

The limited review report on the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements has been issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Isle of Man, after having reviewed and obtained the necessary comfort from PwC local
offices in the jurisdictions where the Group operates through its subsidiaries. The local PwC offices review the stand
alone IFRS financial statements of the respective subsidiaries and issue their interoffice review reports to PwC Isle of
Man.

PwC ‘s review report is unmodified and includes an emphasis of matter in respect of material valuation uncertainty
statement included by the external appraisers in their valuation reports, considering the current context and lack of
transactions since the pandemic. PWC’s review report is unmodified and this emphasis of matter only highlights that
assumptions included in valuation reports may change until the next valuation in December 2020. The inclusion of the
material valuation uncertainty clause does not mean that external appraisers’ valuation cannot be relied upon (see more
details in the Directors commentary and interim condensed consolidated financial statements).

FURTHER TRADING STATEMENT


Shareholders are referred to the trading statement published on 17 August 2020 and are advised that in order to
ensure that NEPI Rockcastle maintains a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity during the present operating
environment, the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (the “Board”) has adopted a prudent approach and resolved
not to declare a dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (compared to the dividend per share of 29.02 euro
cents for the prior corresponding period). In this regard, shareholders are referred to the interim consolidated
financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 which will be published on 21 August 2020.

In order to return value to shareholders during these unprecedented times, the Board has proposed a capitalisation
issue, full details of which will be released in due course.

The financial information contained in this trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the various announcements published by NEPI Rockcastle addressing the impact of
COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance, including the announcements published on 1 April and 20
May 2020 respectively, wherein shareholders were advised that NEPI Rockcastle had decided to withdraw its
earnings guidance for the financial year ending 31 December 2020.

The measures taken by governments in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the temporary closure
of non-essential retailers in the shopping centres in all the countries where NEPI Rockcastle operates, which
impacted the six months ended 30 June 2020 (“H1 2020”) results. Further to the easing of restrictions in all the
countries of operation, the vast majority of tenants are operational as of today, with only 4% of the Group’s GLA
still subject to temporary closure restrictions. Footfall and tenants’ sales are gradually recovering.

As NEPI Rockcastle uses dividend per share as its relevant measurement of financial results for trading statement
purposes, it is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes reasonably certain that the dividend
per share for the next reporting period will differ by at least 15% from that of the prior corresponding period.

Shareholders are advised that as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance,
NEPI Rockcastle expects a decline of approximately 32% or approximately 9.4 euro cents in distributable earnings
per share for H1 2020, compared to the distributable earnings per share of 29.02 euro cents for the prior
corresponding period. The Group reflected in its performance for H1 2020 concessions derived from Government
imposed laws (such as rent, service charges and marketing contributions relief during the lock-down period
imposed by Polish authorities) and concessions based on negotiations with tenants, granted as a partial forgiveness
of contractual receivables.

NEPI Rockcastle distributed 100% of distributable earnings as a dividend for the prior corresponding period.
However, given the ongoing uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operational performance
and financial position, the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (the “Board”) has postponed the decision with
regard to a dividend for H1 2020 until the Board meeting due to be held on 20 August, to ensure that all relevant
information is considered. Should the Board resolve to declare a dividend, it is expected that the decline in dividend
per share for H1 2020 will be at least equal to the decline in distributable earnings per share. The Board’s decision
will be announced as soon as possible, and further information will be available in NEPI Rockcastle’s reviewed
financial statements for H1 2020 which will be published on 21 August 2020.

The financial information contained in this trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s auditors.

CONCLUSION OF A NEW AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE DISPOSAL OF THE ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO


Reference is made to the previous announcements published in respect of the disposal of the Romanian office
portfolio (the “disposal”) by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries NE Property B.V., Ingen Europe B.V. (the
“sellers”) to AFI Europe NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFI Properties Ltd. (“AFI Europe” or the
“purchaser”), the last of which was published on 6 July 2020.

The negotiations between the parties have been successfully concluded, resulting in NEPI Rockcastle entering into
an agreement with AFI Europe on 6 August 2020 to dispose of 100% of the shares in the subsidiaries holding the
Romanian office portfolio (the “new agreement”). In accordance with the provisions of the new agreement, the
completion of the disposal is expected to occur within no more than four months, with the completion date to be
set by the purchaser. The purchaser has paid to the sellers a cash advance of €15 million as guarantee for finalising
the completion. No other conditions precedent are required to be fulfilled.

The terms of the new agreement are substantially in line with the initial agreement (as announced on 17 December
2019), and accordingly, the disposal consideration remains unchanged, with a transaction value of €307 million
and an estimated cash consideration of approximately €290 million, to be adjusted based on the subsidiaries’
financial statements as of the date of completion.

Together with the execution of the new agreement and receipt of the cash advance, the parties have also settled the
arbitration.

REVISED NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING


Shareholders are advised that a revised notice of annual general meeting of NEPI Rockcastle shareholders,
(the “Revised Notice of AGM”) was distributed today, Monday, 27 July 2020. This Revised Notice of AGM
replaces in its entirety the original notice of annual general meeting which was published on 30 April 2020.

The date of the annual general meeting (“AGM”) remains unchanged and will be held at the Company’s
registered office, being 2nd Floor, 30 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 1JB on Thursday, 20 August
2020 at 8:30am British Summer Time/9:30am South African Standard Time, for shareholders to consider and,
if deemed fit, pass with or without modification, the resolutions as set out in the Revised Notice of AGM.

The record date to be recorded in the shareholder register in order to be entitled to vote at the AGM is Friday,
14 August 2020. A copy of the Revised Notice of AGM is available on the Company’s website at,
https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NEPI-Rockcastle-Revised-Notice-of-Annual-
General-Meeting.pdf.

Under normal circumstances, the NEPI Rockcastle Board values the opportunity to meet shareholders in
person. However, given the current Isle of Man Government restrictions due to COVID-19, the Board has
concluded that it is appropriate to strongly urge shareholders not to attend the AGM in person this year and,
instead, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are encouraged to submit proxy votes.

NEPI Rockcastle’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NE Property B.V., has closed the green corporate bond
book build referred to in the announcement released earlier today. NE Property B.V. has priced a €500
million unsecured 7 year Eurobond maturing on 14 July 2027 (“the Bond”), carrying a 3.375% fixed
coupon, with an issue price of 98.172%.

S&P and Fitch assigned the Bond a BBB rating, in line with the EMTN Programme rating and the
corporate rating.

The Bond has been placed with a broad range of institutional debt investors across Europe, attracting
a strong demand with an oversubscribed book of over €1.1 billion.

NEPI Rockcastle has developed a Green Finance Framework (the “Framework”) under which the
Company has committed to use proceeds from green bonds to finance and/or refinance existing and/or
future projects which improve the environmental performance of the Group’s property portfolio and
contribute to the Company’s climate impact mitigation objectives. The Framework (available on NEPI
Rockcastle’s website) defines eligibility criteria according to two types of green assets/initiatives:
certified green buildings and energy efficiency projects. The Framework has a Second Party Opinion
provided by Sustainalytics. The net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects included in
the portfolio selected in accordance with the use of proceeds criteria and selection process as defined
in the Company’s Framework.

Application has been made for listing the Bond with Euronext Dublin.

“Fixed-income investors are more than ever committed to ESG issues, and the green bond offered today
is yet another highlight of our ESG progress and commitment for sustainable operations and strong
capital structure. The strong demand and supportive pricing demonstrate investors’ continued
confidence in NEPI Rockcastle’s strategy and management team to weather the current environment.”
Mirela Covasa, CFO of NEPI Rockcastle.

FURTHER UPDATE ON THE DISPOSAL OF THE ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO

Reference is made to the previous announcements published in respect of the disposal of the Romanian office
portfolio (the “disposal”) by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries NE Property B.V., Ingen Europe B.V. and
NEPI Bucharest Two SRL (the “sellers”) to AFI Europe NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFI Properties Ltd.
(“AFI Europe” or the “purchaser”). As per the last Business Update published on 20 May 2020 shareholders were
advised that the disposal was not completed.

NEPI Rockcastle and AFI Europe (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the parties”) initiated arbitration
proceedings (the “arbitration”) in connection with the disputed matter of the sellers requesting the purchaser to
pay the contractual guarantee, and the purchaser contesting the validity of the sellers’ claim and requesting specific
performance of the disposal.

In addition, the sellers and AFI Europe have entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”)
pursuant to which, under certain conditions, the parties may terminate the arbitration and enter into a new binding
agreement regarding the disposal, based on the pricing and other terms of the original transaction (as announced
on 17 December 2019), subject to any requisite amendments required in relation to the payment dates and
completion. The MOU has been signed on 5 July 2020 and negotiations will be conducted on a without prejudice
basis in respect of the arbitration.

The progress of the new transaction will be notified in due course.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) RATING UPDATE ISSUED BY SUSTAINALYTICS AND LAUNCH OF GREEN FINANCE FRAMEWORK
 
NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that in June 2020, Sustainalytics, a leading independent global
provider of ESG and corporate governance research and ratings, reaffirmed NEPI Rockcastle's ESG Risk
rating as Low. The Company’s ESG Risk Rating from Sustainalytics improved to 12.5/100 from 15.1/100
at the end of 2019. The new rating positions NEPI Rockcastle among the top five rated companies in its
sub-industry, Real Estate Management, as compared to 23rd place last year.

The Company’s score has improved in all assessed Material ESG Issues, being:
   - Corporate Governance
   - Human Capital
   - ESG Integration – Financials
   - Product Governance
   - Business Ethics

Sustainalytics concluded that the Company is at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from
ESG factors, due to its low exposure and strong management of material ESG issues. The Company is
noted for its strong corporate governance performance, which is reducing its overall risk. Furthermore, the
Company has not experienced significant controversies during 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle's main initiatives during 2019 focused, inter alia, around the following aspects:

   - reviewing and updating its corporate governance framework, aligning it to best practices, as well
     as voluntarily implementing provisions from the Dutch and UK corporate governance codes;
   - implementing or improving several sound risk management procedures and guidelines;
   - enhancing its business ethics programme and its compliance management system; and
   - improving its cybersecurity and data protection measures to ensure awareness and preparedness at
     Group level.

Sustainalytics reported that the Company's overall management of material ESG issues is strong. Moreover,
the Company's management score has increased significantly in the past year, and its management category
has improved.

More details on NEPI Rockcastle's practices and initiatives can be found in the Corporate Governance and
Sustainability Report sections available in the 2019 Annual Report (https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/NEPI_Rockcastle_Annual_Report_2019.pdf) and in the Sustainability section on
the corporate website (https://nepirockcastle.com/sustainability/focus-and-performance/)

In 2020, NEPI Rockcastle also updated its annual report, to align with the Global Reporting Initiative
Standards: Core option. Alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative Standard further highlights NEPI
Rockcastle’s ongoing commitment to transparency in its sustainability reporting practices.

Moreover, NEPI Rockcastle launched a Green Finance Framework which integrates the Company’s
sustainability targets with its financing activities. The Green Finance Framework allows the Group to
finance or refinance Eligible Green projects, comprising green buildings and energy efficiency spending,
through the issuance of a variety of Green Finance instruments. Currently approximately €2.8 billion of the
Group’s property portfolio is eligible for green (re)financing.

In line with best market practices, the Green Finance Framework is in accordance with the international
applicable principles (Green Bond Principles 2018 and Green Loan Principles 2020) and benefits from a
positive Second Party Opinion from Sustainalytics. The Green Finance Framework and second Party
Opinion are available at: https://nepirockcastle.com/sustainability/focus-and-performance/

“Sustainability will remain one of the Group’s priorities in 2020 and the years to come, as it is a long-term
journey that demands a continuing commitment. Now we are also able to integrate sustainability objectives
in our financing activities. The Green Finance Framework will further support NEPI Rockcastle’s
commitments to sustainability and enable us to broaden our investor base”, Mirela Covasa, CFO NEPI
Rockcastle.

ING Bank N.V. and Société Générale acted as joint green structurers in the development of the framework.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEPI ROCKCASTLE’S OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA INCREASES TO 90%


Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 5 June 2020 and are advised that, as a result of
the further easing of trading restrictions in Romania, tenants occupying approximately 90% of the Group’s
GLA are now operational. Romania ended the trading ban on stores located in large shopping centres, except
for cinemas and playgrounds, on 15 June. Indoor restaurants and food courts can only provide take-away food,
while outdoor food and beverage amenities trade normally.
All stores in all other countries in the Group’s portfolio are allowed to trade, except for cinemas and
playgrounds in some locations. The operating GLA is expected to further increase to approximately 94% by
the end of June, as a result of the gradual reopening of cinemas in some countries, while playgrounds are
expected to open at a later stage.
Average footfall exceeds 70% of the levels recorded in the same period last year in most of the Group’s
shopping centres. The Group’s top priority remains maintaining the health and safety of customers, tenants
and staff, and all necessary measures for safe visits to the malls have been implemented. Mega Mall in
Bucharest and Bonarka City Centre in Krakow are the first shopping malls in Romania and Poland certified
as COVID-19 safety compliant by SAFE Shopping Centers, confirming that the properties comply with strict
security and safety conditions related to COVID-19 and adhere to best practice and industry standards.

COVID-19 UPDATE: NEPI ROCKCASTLE EXPECTS ITS OPERATING GROSS LEASABLE AREA TO INCREASE TO 90% IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS


Shareholders are advised that as of today, tenants occupying approximately 70% of the Group’s GLA are
welcoming their visitors, in the best sanitary conditions. The proportion of the GLA hosting open stores is
expected to increase to approximately 90% by mid-June and approximately 94% by the end of June; this
estimate is based on the expected further easement of trading restrictions for stores located in large shopping
centres in Romania around mid-June (although the final decision has not yet been announced by the
authorities) and progressive reopening of entertainment facilities in most countries.

Indoor and outdoor restaurants, food courts and gyms have opened in all countries, except for Romania.
Entertainment facilities will be reopened in Poland starting 6 June, while in Romania the reopening date will
be communicated at a later stage. Although allowed to trade in some locations, most cinemas have not yet
opened, due to industry supply issues.

Romania commenced the easing of lockdown restrictions on 15 May, reopening shops with direct street access
and retail parks with a built area below 15,000 m2; outdoor terraces, bars, restaurants and coffee shops
reopened on 1 June, with social distancing measures in place. Further easing of restrictions is expected to be
announced during the following week, potentially lifting trading bans for stores in large shopping centres in
mid-June, except for entertainment facilities.

Since the gradual ending of trading restrictions during April and May in most of the CEE countries, the
shopping centres’ footfall has been continuously increasing, despite the restrictions on entertainment areas,
and reached levels above the ones anticipated by the Group. Most of the Group’s shopping centres in Poland,
Czech Republic, Serbia and Croatia, where trading restrictions ended in early May, show footfall already
exceeding 70% of the levels recorded in the same period of 2019.

While the formal May sales reporting is still in progress, tenants have generally seen higher conversion rates
and larger basket sizes than expected, as a result of customers focusing on efficient shopping.

Though many retailers placed most new investments temporarily on hold, there is still demand for letting,
some also coming from new brands looking to enter the CEE market. Lease renewals continue mainly within
previously agreed long-term conditions.

Overall collection of rent and other charges due by 30 April increased to 89%; for April and May a 60-day
rent deferral has been granted to most tenants affected by the lockdowns. Discussions related to tenant
discounts are ongoing, with long-term rent largely unaffected.

“The post-lockdown performance of our shopping centres is very encouraging, and the higher-than-expected
footfall is notable especially considering that many dining and entertainment areas are just opening. Our top
priority remains maintaining the health and safety of our customers, tenants and staff, and we have
implemented all necessary measures for safe visits to our properties. The coming period will require significant
collaboration between stakeholders in our industry to ensure the speedy recovery of the retail environment.”

BUSINESS UPDATE

“COVID-19 had limited impact on revenues during the first quarter (‘Q1’), with social distancing 
measures causing closure of most shops starting mid-March. From the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak,
our priority has been ensuring the health and safety of all our customers and staff. Over the last few
weeks, in the context of easing of restrictions, a large proportion of retailers have resumed their 
operations and 63% of the Group’s Gross Leasable Area (‘GLA’) is currently open. As we begin to collect 
post-reopening operational data, we are confident that our high-quality portfolio, robust balance sheet 
and strong liquidity together with our unparalleled know-how of the CEE region remain key strengths for 
weathering this storm well.” 
Alex Morar, CEO NEPI Rockcastle 

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

  ratio and other factors;

- marketing contribution relief for April and May for closed units; and  
- variable operating expenses during lockdown period reduced by approximately 40% relative to the 2019 comparative 
  period, on a like-for-like basis.

- availability of hand sanitising dispensers in numerous locations across each property.

DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
The Company has revised its expenditure for the development pipeline, focusing on committed on-going projects. 
NEPI Rockcastle is benefiting from a flexible approach to its development pipeline, anchored by prudent project 
management which enables the Group to reassess and adapt the project pipeline as needed. Construction costs are 
committed on a gradual basis, with the majority of works done by package. The limited use of general contractors 
enables the Group to suspend or terminate development activities at any time, exercising a high degree of control 
over the quality of works and cash flow management. 

The Group had the following committed projects at 31 March 2020:
- Focus Mall Zielona Gora (Zielona Gora, Poland): Necessary works regarding the parking and common areas of the 
  extension (15,600m2) are progressing. New tenants include: Apart, Express Marche, Millennium Bank, Rainbow Tours

  ground floor and opening of an outdoor terrace and a 6 screen cinema by Cinema City will be completed in second 
  quarter (‘Q2’) 2020;

  in Q2 2020;  
- Shopping City Targu Mures (Targu Mures, Romania): A 39,800m2 shopping mall was completed in Q1 2020. The opening 
  was scheduled for end of March and is now estimated for third quarter (‘Q3’) 2020 (after the Romanian government 
  ends trading restrictions). The tenant mix includes Carrefour, CCC, Cineplexx, Flanco, eMag, Hervis Sports, 
  Intersport, KFC, LC Waikiki, LPP (Cropp, House, Reserved and Sinsay) and New Yorker.

During Q1 2020, €50 million was spent on the pipeline projects detailed above. Following a detailed business review,
the Group actively implemented various measures aimed at optimising the allocation of capital, among which was the 
deferral of non-committed  development and capital expenditure projects. Thus, the Group will not launch new 
constructions until there is further clarity on the impact of COVID-19 on the Group’s operations. Consequently, 
the Group estimates to incur further development and capital expenditure of only €70 million in 2020.

ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO DISPOSAL
As already announced, the disposal of the Romanian office portfolio, in accordance with the agreement signed in 
December 2019, was not completed due to the purchaser’s obligations related to the completion procedures not being 
fulfilled. This lead to a breach in the agreement, which entitled the Group to terminate it and claim the 
contractual guarantee. The procedures for recovering the guarantee in accordance with the contractual mechanisms 
have been initiated. 

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT 
NEPI Rockcastle had strong liquidity at 31 March 2020, with €590 million available in cash and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group’s gearing ratio (interest bearing debt less cash, divided by investment property and listed securities, 
excluding the effect of International Financial Reporting Standard 16 (‘IFRS’)) was 32%, below the 35% target.

As of 31 March 2020, ratios for unsecured loans and bonds showed ample headroom compared to covenants:
- Solvency Ratio: 40% actual, vs requirement of maximum 60%; 
- Consolidated Coverage Ratio: 6.3 actual, vs requirement of minimum 2; 
- Unsecured consolidated total assets/unsecured consolidated total debt: 269% actual, vs requirement of minimum 180%.

The Company successfully repurchased the outstanding bond notes due February 2021, with a nominal value of €198 million 
in January 2020. 

In April 2020, the Group’s Investment Grade credit ratings were reaffirmed by Fitch Ratings (BBB, stable outlook) 
and S&P Global Ratings (BBB, negative outlook). NEPI Rockcastle is committed to further enhancing its liquidity 
and maturity profile and will continue to analyse market opportunities as they arise. Depending on market conditions, 
the Group may initiate repurchases of issued bonds or shares during the following reporting periods.

COMMUNITY SUPPORT
The Group supported the community efforts for preventing the spread of the COVID-19 and has collaborated with the 
Red Cross for the purchasing of protective medical equipment. In addition, NEPI Rockcastle started a fundraising 
campaign through the online channels (websites and social media) of its shopping centres in Romania. The entire 
amount collected will be used to support the efforts of the Red Cross organisation.

OUTLOOK
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the global economic outlook for 2020, and there is significant uncertainty about its
impact on NEPI Rockcastle’s operations. In this context, NEPI Rockcastle has decided to withdraw its 2020 earnings 
guidance, as announced on 1 April 2020. 

The recent easing of restrictions led to a significant increase in the Group’s activity, and the first signs are 
encouraging. The Group will continue to provide updates, and will announce a revised earnings guidance when it will
be in a position to reliably estimate the effect of the current context on its performance.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


Background
Since mid-March 2020, local governments in the nine Central and Eastern European (‘CEE’) countries where NEPI
Rockcastle operates have implemented rigorous measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including, among
others, the closure of all stores except those selling essential goods (such as groceries, other food stores and
pharmacies). Such measures were prompt and efficient, leading to a low rate of COVID-19 infections and fatalities
in the CEE.

Non-essential shops opening for trade and first signs of business beginning to normalise
Gradual easing of restrictions has commenced in the second half of April 2020 and is expected to continue
throughout May – June. Governments are adopting different plans for ending the lockdowns, mostly focused on a
phased approach.

Regarding the Group’s operations:
   - trading restrictions have been substantially lifted in Lithuania, with most retail shops, including those in
     shopping centres, being now open. Indoor restaurants and entertainment facilities are expected to open at
     the end of May or beginning of June. The government safety guidelines require shopping centres, among
     others, to ensure a maximum density of one person per 10 square metres. NEPI Rockcastle resumed its
     operations at Ozas Shopping Centre and Entertainment in Vilnius on 25 April 2020.
   - on 4 May 2020, Poland ended the temporary trading restrictions on the stores located in shopping centres
     larger than 2,000 square metres, and all the Group’s malls in Poland have resumed normal trading. Some
     safety guidelines imposed by the government remain in place, including wearing face masks and
     maintaining social distancing when in public spaces. Restaurants currently provide only take-away food.
     Entertainment facilities remain closed as the government continues to monitor the situation.
   - retail parks in Croatia have been open since 27 April, including the Group’s Arena Retail Park (Zagreb,
     Croatia);
   - the office portfolio continues to be functional;
   - non-essential store openings are also being accelerated in Serbia, Czech Republic and Croatia, with trading
     restrictions expected to end by mid-May; and
   - a gradual easing of the lockdown measures has been announced also by Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and
     Bulgaria, although specific dates for allowing trading of non-essential shops located in shopping malls
     have not been yet communicated.

As of today, tenants representing 43% of the Group’s GLA are open, and the number is expected to increase
progressively over the next weeks. The first trading indications in Lithuania and Poland are positive: most of the
tenants have already opened their stores, footfall is gradually increasing, and customers react positively to the new
safety rules. Further increases in footfall and turnovers are expected when the restaurants and cinemas revert to
operations, and also when the neighbouring offices have increased attendance.

Conversion rates are higher than usual, indicating that customers are focused on efficient shopping.
Targu Mures Shopping City, the Romanian mall which was initially planned for opening at the end of March, was
completed. A new opening date will be decided together with the tenants, once the Romanian government provides
more information on the phased easing of restrictions.

Extensive health and safety protocols
The Group has implemented extensive health and safety measures in its shopping centres. The protocol includes,
amongst others:
   - social distancing rules are enforced through markings in seating areas, corridors, elevators, escalators, etc;
   - shopping centres’ staff and customers are expected to wear masks and apply other precautionary measures;
   - communication with visitors is done through various channels, such as radio, posters, videos on electronic
     panels, website and social media messages, and outlines the most significant preventive measures
     customers are expected to apply when visiting the centres;
   - NEPI Rockcastle, its tenants and suppliers strictly monitor their employees for COVID-19 symptoms, and
     instruct them on additional safety norms and procedures;
   - buildings are ventilated with 100% fresh air;
   - additional cleaning and disinfection are performed regularly;
   - frequently used furniture and equipment (such as handrails, food court tables and trays) are disinfected
     every hour; and
   - hand sanitizing dispensers are available in numerous locations across each property.

Measures to support retailers and collections
Governments across the Group’s CEE region have adopted laws implementing measures to assist tenants, ranging
from allowing the ability to defer rental payments for businesses impacted by COVID-19 until the end of 2020
(such as in Romania, although the law is not yet enforced), to providing state financial aid covering part of the
payments due by tenants (Lithuania) or suspending tenants’ financial obligations for the duration of the restrictions
(Poland). Also, CEE governments allow deferral of various tax and social contributions payments, with some
governments implementing suspension of the loan instalments for specific periods. The Group encourages its
tenants to use the fiscal and monetary stimuli provided by governments.

NEPI Rockcastle has an ongoing, active dialogue with its tenants regarding their business performance and ability
to pay. The Group usually collects over 99% of its income. Over 90% of the rent and other charges invoiced for
Q1 2020 have been collected. Although rent payment obligations regarding closed units for April and May (where
already invoiced) have been deferred for 60 days without penalties, as a mean to supporting tenants, collection is
progressing well.

The asset management team is committed to working together with tenants to maintain sustainable, long-term
relationships. Any discounts will be agreed on case-by-case basis, based on a thorough analysis of the tenants’
financial situation, occupancy cost ratio and other factors, and will be focused on maintaining a functioning retail
environment for the long term.

Strong balance sheet and liquidity
The Group is committed to its prudent financial policy, focused on a conservative gearing level (32% as at
December 2019) and robust liquidity. In response to the recent events, NEPI Rockcastle actively implemented
various measures focused on optimising the allocation of capital, including:
    - reducing non-critical operating expenses, especially for the period in which most of the retailers in the
      shopping centres were not trading;
    - deferring non-committed development projects; and
    - deferring non-essential capital expenditure.

The Group estimates strict compliance with all debt-related obligations throughout 2020 and going further, without
any need to obtain deferrals or waivers for any of its unsecured or secured debt. Financial covenants show
significant headroom to the required levels.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to further enhancing its liquidity and maturity profile and will continue to analyse
various options in this respect.

BBB ratings reaffirmed by S&P and Fitch
At the beginning of April 2020, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) Rating Services reaffirmed BBB credit rating for the
Group. The outlook was revised from stable to negative, reflecting the agency’s views on potential risks associated
with the wider retail real estate sector due to COVID-19 related disruptions and, at that time, lack of information
on when non-essential retailers will resume activities. S&P noted that NEPI Rockcastle's liquidity profile remains
robust.

On 30 April 2020, Fitch reaffirmed the Group’s BBB credit rating, and maintained the stable outlook. The agency
mentioned that the rating action reflects the Group's large portfolio of regionally dominant shopping centres, and
its significant financial headroom that will provide flexibility in handling the economic impact of lockdown
measures due to the coronavirus pandemic.

NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining and further improving its credit ratings.

Q1 business update
The Group continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and updates will be communicated as events unfold.
Further details on the Group’s operational performance and financial position will be included in the quarterly
Business update, which will be released on 20 May 2020.

IM1 1JB on Thursday, 20 August 2020 at 8:30am British Summer Time/9:30am South African Standard Time, for

UPDATE ON DISPOSAL OF ROMANIAN OFFICE PORTFOLIO


The company refers to the announcement dated 16 December 2019 indicating that through its wholly owned
subsidiaries mentioned therein and collectively referred to as the “sellers”, it had entered into an agreement (the
“agreement”) to dispose of the Romanian office portfolio (“Portfolio”) to AFI Europe NV (“AFI Europe” or
the “purchaser”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Africa Israel Properties Limited (the “disposal”). As announced,
the disposal was subject to the fulfilment of conditions precedent, being the unconditional approval of the
Romanian Competition Council and the successful conclusion of formalities with Trade Registry.

The Company advises that the conditions precedent have been fulfilled within the contractually agreed timeline
and, according to the agreement, the completion of the transaction should have occurred on 31 March 2020.
However, the disposal was not completed as the purchaser’s obligations related to the completion procedures
were not fulfilled, leading to a breach in the agreement which entitled the sellers to terminate the agreement and
claim the contractual guarantee.

The current restrictions due to the situation generated by COVID-19 did not prevent completion, as the authorities
involved in processing the share transfer (i.e. the Trade Registry) were open to the public, and the contractual
mechanism allowed for electronic completion. Moreover, legislation recently passed specifically requires public
authorities and professionals, including law firms and notaries, to continue exercising their functions and
providing services, while observing the precautionary measures imposed by the authorities, thus permitting also
in-person completion, using, if needed, power of attorney.

Following its legal assessment, the Company’s stand is that the sellers have duly fulfilled their contractual
obligations, while also considering the emergency orders issued by the authorities in Romania. Discussions on
extending the completion date included both parties proposing terms, and the Company’s recent announcement
noted an estimated postponement until April; however, consensus on those terms was not reached.

The sellers are currently assessing a suitable course of action in accordance with the contractual mechanisms in
place and claiming the contractual guarantee provided by the purchaser regarding the closing procedures.

COVID-19 UPDATE


Subsequent to NEPI Rockcastle’s updates concerning the impact of the COVID-19 on its operations, dated
17 March 2020 and 23 March 2020, there have been significant developments around the COVID-19 situation.
As governments, national authorities and companies continue to implement rigorous measures, there is a high
degree of uncertainty about the impact of this on the Group’s operations. As a result, NEPI Rockcastle withdraws
its earnings guidance for 2020 and expects to provide an update when the Group will be in a position to estimate
the effects of the current situation reliably.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to maintaining its conservative gearing level and a robust liquidity. At this stage,
NEPI Rockcastle is actively implementing various measures focused on achieving the most suitable allocation of
capital, including:

- reducing non-critical operating expenses;
- deferring non-committed development projects and non-essential capital expenditure; and
- utilising any relevant facilities provided by national authorities to assist companies in the current context.

The Group continues to assess the situation and will provide further updates when appropriate.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


NEPI Rockcastle provided an initial update concerning the impact of the COVID-19 related government
measures on its activities in an announcement dated 17 March 2020. Since that date, the authorities in
Romania, Serbia and Croatia have increased the safety measures to contain the spreading of COVID-19. New
measures include temporarily limiting the operations of some of our shopping centres’ tenants.

Businesses deemed non-essential by the authorities which are located in the Group’s shopping centres in
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia are now temporarily
closed, while pharmacies, groceries and other food stores remain open in all locations. In some properties, the
food court tenants are operating only for deliveries or pick-ups. All shops in the Group’s Hungarian properties
are open, except for cinemas and entertainment operators. Office properties are fully-functional, although
many businesses (including NEPI Rockcastle) have implemented work-from-home policies to limit social
interactions.

NEPI Rockcastle’s priority remains the health and wellbeing of its customers, partners and employees, and
the appropriate measures have been enforced in all properties. All buildings remain open and are serviced,
with a continuous focus on cleaning and ensuring customer safety. NEPI Rockcastle continues to support the
communities where it operates by donating to the Red Cross and working on implementing other platforms to
encourage donations to and cooperation with NGOs.

The Group notes that large international and national tenants (companies with assets and/or turnover in excess
of €200 million) occupy 67% of its lettable area, lowering the risk of tenant default. Also, Auchan and
Carrefour, which are estimated to have higher-than-usual sales in the coming period, are two of its largest
tenants. Approximately 91.2% of the Group’s gross rental income is fixed rent, and only 3.3% is overage rent
(paid based on sales, on top of fixed rent). The occupancy cost ratio of its tenants was 11.9% in 2019, which
is prudent by industry standards. The Group continues to have regular dialogue with its partners and
encourages the use of the fiscal and monetary stimulus provided by governments.

Zagreb earthquake
The region surrounding Zagreb, Croatia, was impacted by a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in the early morning of
22 March 2020, followed by several aftershocks. NEPI Rockcastle’s local team is unharmed and no damage
to its shopping centre and adjacent retail park has been identified.

NEPI Rockcastle will continue to assess the situation and provide further updates when appropriate.

UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19


NEPI Rockcastle, the premier owner and operator of commercial real estate across nine countries in Central
and Eastern Europe, continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving situation concerning COVID-19 and
follow the advice issued by governments in the countries in which it operates.

In recent days the governments in several markets in which the Company owns and operates commercial real
estate have taken measures to contain the spread of the virus, in line with the World Health Organization
recommendations. Such measures currently include closing non-essential businesses and shops in shopping
centres in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia, except for pharmacies, groceries and
other food stores. Other services such as banking and insurance are still functional in some locations. The
Group’s properties in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Croatia are open, except for cinemas in Hungary. NEPI
Rockcastle has decided to implement shorter trading hours in some locations, as a preventive measure. The
above is subject to change as per information to be made available by the authorities in the respective
countries.

NEPI Rockcastle is focusing on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its employees, tenants and visitors, while
minimising disruption. Extra sanitising measures have been implemented in all properties. All major events
scheduled by the shopping centres until the end of March have been postponed, and the centres’ digital
networks display prevention messages focused on increasing visitors’ awareness. The Group has also been in
touch with international NGOs and plans to redirect its CSR budget to helping local communities navigate the
current challenges.

Footfall and tenants’ sales in 2020 were comparable to the similar period of 2019, apart from the past two
weeks, when decreases were noted in most locations. Rent and service charges for the first quarter of 2020
were generally invoiced in advance and the majority have already been collected. At this stage, determining
the impact on the Group’s contractual obligations in relation to its tenants is difficult. NEPI Rockcastle has
regular dialogue with its partners, and any support offered will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This
assessment depends on other measures to be implemented by governments, including various forms of fiscal
stimulus already announced in some countries, which the Group intends to use.

The Group has a strong liquidity position which includes significant cash and access to undrawn revolving
facilities. Debt covenants show significant headroom to the required levels. As a result of the active liability
management programme executed in 2019, the Group has no significant financial liabilities due in the
following three years. The cash flow allocated to the development pipeline is currently unaffected. The
Romanian office portfolio sale is expected to be finalised in April 2020. The Group will optimise non-urgent
operational expenses, aiming to reduce service charges and their impact on tenants’ costs. The payment of the
dividend corresponding to the second half of 2019, due in early April 2020, will proceed as planned.

NEPI Rockcastle will continue to assess the situation and provide further updates when appropriate. Once
sufficient information is available, the Group will revert with any expected impact on the 2020 earnings. The
Group is confident that its strong balance sheet and geographically diversified, dominant portfolio will prove
resilient against this economic uncertainty.

ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL: FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the circular issued on 21 February 2020, in respect of an election
to receive the final dividend (the ""final dividend"") for the year ended 31 December 2019, either as a cash
dividend or as a return of capital and are advised as follows:

-     Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand
      converted from Euro at an exchange rate determined as on Monday, 2 March 2020 of
      EUR1.00:ZAR 17.2640. Accordingly, the cash dividend of 27.31 eurocents per share will be equal to
      ZAR 4.7148 per share.

-     Equity markets showed significant volatility since the publication of the circular. NEPI Rockcastle is
      confident that its business fundamentals and growth prospects remain sound, and that these are not fully
      reflected in its recent share price movement. Hence, the company will offer shareholders the option of
      receiving their distribution in shares instead of cash at a price which equals EPRA NAV per share of
      EUR 7.32 (""reference price""). The reference price for NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on JSE is
      ZAR 126.3725 (being the reference price of EUR 7.32 converted to ZAR at the exchange rate of
      EUR1.00:ZAR 17.2640), which includes a 13.15% premium to the five-day volume weighted average
      traded price (less distribution) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at 2 March 2020. For NEPI
      Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price is EUR 7.32.

-     Shareholders electing to receive the return of capital will receive 3.7309 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for
      every 100 NEPI Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday, 13 March 2020,
      representing the ratio that the cash dividend bears to the reference price. The final dividend will be paid
      from the Isle of Man.

If no shareholders were to elect to receive the return of capital, the value of the dividends would amount to
EUR 163 804 616. Should all shareholders elect to receive the return of capital, the maximum total number
of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the return of capital will be 
22 377 676.

The share capital of the company as at the date of this announcement is as follows:
                                                                                                  000 EUR

per share for shareholders liable to pay the dividends tax rate of 20%. There is no withholding tax payable in
the Isle of Man.

ZAR:EUR conversion rate announced on Tuesday, 3 March 2020, before 11:00 South African time (""exchange
rate"").

The cash dividend will be paid out of the company's distributable profits.

Return of capital
The rationale for the return of capital is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle and to retain flexibility with regard to the company's cash resources.

The number of NEPI Rockcastle shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the return of capital is entitled
will be determined with reference to the ratio that 27.31 eurocents per share bears to a reference price. The reference
price will be calculated based on the five-day volume weighted average traded price (less the cash dividend) of
NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE, to be announced on Tuesday, 3 March 2020.

NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing
shareholder in respect of the return of capital if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be
acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require
the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover,
capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances, the shareholder will receive the balance of their
entitlement as a cash dividend. The company further reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the return of capital, on a pro rata basis. In such
circumstance, shareholders will receive the balance of their final dividend (net of withholding tax), in cash.

The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the return of
capital will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a
NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (""cash payment"")
made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined
with reference to the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday, 11 March 2020, less 10%
(converted to Euro at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount
will be announced on Thursday, 12 March 2020 before 11:00 South African time.

The new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the return of capital will be funded by way of a reduction
of part of the company's share premium account (which is a reduction of capital).

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the
NEPI Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the return of capital. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be
delivered to shareholders in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership
of such shares. References throughout this announcement to NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant
to the return of capital or to any shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle before or after the implementation of the return
of capital should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt, issue or holding of security entitlements representing
beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares.
All NEPI Rockcastle shares are and will be registered in the name of Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal
Effectenverkeer B.V. (""Euroclear Nederland"") for and on behalf of shareholders.

As at the date of this announcement, the company has 599 797 201 ordinary shares of E0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS
South African resident shareholders
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders.

For those South African resident shareholders receiving the cash dividend, such amount will be regarded as a
foreign dividend and may be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%, unless an
exemption as set out in the South African tax legislation applies.

The receipt of NEPI Rockcastle shares by South African resident shareholders pursuant to the return of capital
should not be classified as a dividend or a foreign dividend for South African tax purposes and accordingly, South
African dividends withholding tax should not be levied on the new NEPI Rockcastle shares so received. However,
the legislation in this regard is complex and its implementation is uncertain. Shareholders should therefore seek
independent professional tax advice.

The gross local dividend amount for shareholders exempt from paying South African dividends tax, as well as the
net local dividend amount for shareholders liable to pay South African dividends tax, will be announced on
Tuesday, 3 March 2020.

NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are advised to consult their professional advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the cash dividend and the return of capital or should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to take.
There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.
Shareholders residing outside South Africa
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders who are resident outside South Africa and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice
from their professional advisors in this regard.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

SHORT-FORM: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019


DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

“We are delighted to report that the Group has achieved the targeted results in a competitive market. Twelve
years since inception and three since the successful merger, our assets continue to outperform. Solidly growing
footfall and retail sales are driven by our continued asset management efforts, focused on delivering locally-
optimal tenant mixes and customer experience. The retail portfolio has further increased with the opening of
high-quality developments and remains the largest and most dominant in the CEE. As we maintain a sound
business profile with strong liquidity, we are delivering on our growing development pipeline and are
confident of our ability to take advantage of all attractive opportunities in our markets.” Alex Morar, CEO.

The Group achieved 27.31 eurocents in distributable earnings per share for the second half of 2019, which,
aggregated with the 29.02 eurocents distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2019, resulted in a total
distribution of 56.33 eurocents for the year ended 31 December 2019. The 2019 distribution is 6.6% higher
than 2018’s 52.86 eurocents, and slightly above previously issued guidance. The strong results reflect the solid
performance of assets and management, and the quality of developments completed.

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 27.31 eurocents per share for the second half of 2019.

Shareholders can elect to receive the distribution either in cash or as an issue of fully-paid shares based on a
ratio between distribution declared and the reference price. The reference price will be calculated based on the
five-day volume-weighted average traded price, less distribution, of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE. The
Group reserves the right to limit the total allocation of shares as a percentage of the total distribution. A circular
containing full details of the election being offered to shareholders, accompanied by announcements on the
Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam will be issued in due course.

Distributable earnings per share for 2020 are expected to be approximately 6% higher than the 2019
distribution. This guidance is based on the assumptions that acquisitions are concluded as planned,
developments are delivered as scheduled, a stable macroeconomic environment prevails and no major
corporate failures occur.

EXTERNAL AUDIT AND KEY AUDIT MATTERS

The audit report on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements has been issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Isle of Man, after having reviewed and obtained the necessary comfort from PwC
local offices in the jurisdictions where the Group operates through its subsidiaries. The local PwC offices audit
the stand alone IFRS financial statements of the respective subsidiaries and issue their interoffice audit reports
to PricewaterhouseCoopers Isle of Man.

The auditors have issued their unmodified audit report on the annual financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2019 and a copy of the audit opinion, together with the underlying audited annual financial
statements is available on the Company’s website.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor’s professional judgement, were of most significance in
the audit of the financial statements. The only key audit matter identified in relation to the 2019 audit was
Valuation of investment property, which is significant due to its magnitude and because the valuation is
complex and highly dependent on a range of estimates (amongst others, rental value, vacancy rates, non-
recoverable expenses, lease incentives, maintenance costs, discount rates and estimated terminal value). The
directors used external appraisers to support their determination of the individual fair values of the investment
property semi-annually.

PwC’s procedures in relation to the key audit matter included evaluation of the objectivity, independence and
expertise of the external appraisers; assessing the methodologies used and the appropriateness of the key
assumptions based on their knowledge of the property industry; using auditor’s experts in valuation of real
estate to assess the appropriateness of the estimates used; and checking on a sample basis, the appropriateness
of the inputs, by reconciling them to contracts and rent roll data. PwC noted that investment property related
data and the key valuation assumptions were supported by available evidence. PwC also assessed the
appropriateness of the disclosures relating to the assumptions. For more information reference is made to the

NEPI ROCKCASTLE SIGNS A E175 MILLION ESG-LINKED SYNDICATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY


On 16 December 2019, NEPI Rockcastle's wholly-owned subsidiary, NE Property BV, signed a E175 million
three-year unsecured revolving credit facility (""RCF"") with two one-year extension options. The facility includes
a non-committed accordion clause that allows the increase of the facility size by up to an additional E150 million.

The RCF also includes an environmental, social and corporate governance (""ESG"") pricing mechanism linking the
margin of the RCF to NEPI Rockcastle's ESG risk rating score. Should the ESG risk rating score increase, the
margin of the RCF will increase, and vice versa.

NEPI Rockcastle's ESG rating has been assessed by Sustainalytics, a leading independent ESG and corporate
governance research provider, ratings and analytics firm that supports investors around the world with the
development and implementation of responsible investment strategies. ESG Risk Rating data licensed by
Sustainalytics may be used as part of the process of setting an interest rate by a lender. The ESG Risk Rating and
Report produced by Sustainalytics is intended for use in the overall assessment of the borrower, being at the sole
discretion of the lenders.

The RCF is to be used for general corporate purposes and has been provided by a syndicate of four banks: Citibank,
Deutsche Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, where Deutsche Bank acted as coordinator, facility agent and
sustainability agent.

In 2018 NEPI Rockcastle extended its existing revolving credit facilities to the amount of E400 million with BRD
- Group Societe Generale, Garanti BBVA International NV, Garanti BBVA Romania, ING Bank NV Amsterdam,
Bucharest Branch, Raiffeisen Bank International and Societe Generale.

This new RCF increases NEPI Rockcastle's total unsecured revolving financing capacity to E575 million, all of
which is currently available for drawdown. The Company enjoys a comfortable liquidity level, according to its
prudent financial policy, allowing it to further invest in its acquisitions and development pipeline.

""We are delighted to put in place this liquidity facility which will strengthen our position while NEPI Rockcastle
continues to grow. The linking of our sustainability scores to our cost of capital demonstrates NEPI Rockcastle's
strong commitment towards ensuring our robust Environmental, Social and Governance practices"" said Mirela
Covasa, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of NEPI Rockcastle.

and entertainment areas and over 2,500 parking bays. Planning permission is pending and opening is
scheduled for Q3 2021.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

The Company completed the 8,600m2 Krusevac Retail Park in Serbia, at the end of September 2019. It is
fully occupied, with 17 well-known national and international brands.

Construction is ongoing on several other projects:
   -   Shopping City Buzau, Romania: 17,900m2 GLA refurbishment scheduled for completion in Q2
       2020;

   -   Promenada Mall Plovdiv, Bulgaria: zoning approved and building permit pending; the mall’s
       opening is scheduled for Q3 2021.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

The Group has a strong liquidity profile, with €301 million in cash, €400 million in available unsecured
revolving facilities and €69 million net listed securities (which comprises a portfolio of listed securities
less related debt) as at 30 September 2019. NEPI Rockcastle’s gearing ratio (interest bearing debt less
cash, divided by investment property, including investment property held for sale, plus listed securities)
was 31.4%, below the 35% strategic target. The reported gearing ratio (LTV) excludes the impact of IFRS
16, which is considered immaterial (€32.2 million in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as at 30
September 2019).

The average interest rate, including hedging, was 2.5% for the nine months ended 30 September 2019. All
interest rate exposure related to long-term loans is hedged (excluding revolving facilities), with a
remaining weighted average hedge term of 3.5 years.

In October 2019, after a roadshow with European fixed-income investors, NEPI Rockcastle issued €500
million of unsecured, seven-year Eurobond, carrying a 1.875% fixed coupon, with an issue price of
98.927%. This was the second bond issue during the year, increasing the total amount raised in 2019 from
European investors to €1 billion, and enabling the Company to compete more effectively long-term, in
CEE real estate markets. The proceeds of this second issue were used for liability management, including
refinancing of secured loans and the repurchase of €200 million nominal value of the bonds due in
February 2021. Further to this bond issue, the estimated average debt maturity term increased to over four
years.

During October 2019, shareholders representing approximately 61% of the Group’s share capital elected
to receive the distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2019 as a return of capital, by way of an issue
of new shares. This marks another success in the Company’s equity capital markets activity, with equity
of €104 million issued at 2% premium to NAV.

OUTLOOK

Distributable earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be approximately 6.5% higher than 2018. The
variance to February’s guidance is positively impacted by the extended disposal process of the Romanian
office portfolio, partly offset by a stronger scrip dividend take-up than initially forecast. This guidance is
based on the assumptions that a stable macroeconomic environment prevails, no major corporate failures
occur, and developments remain on schedule. This forecast has not been audited or reviewed by NEPI

ZAR118.2810. For shareholders on the European register, this gross value is EUR7.1255, being the
aforementioned Rand value converted to Euro at the exchange rate of EUR 1.00:ZAR 16.5997 as announced

ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL: FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the circular issued on Monday, 23 September 2019, in respect
of an election to receive the interim dividend (the ""interim dividend"") for the six months ended 30 June 2019,
either as a cash dividend or as a return of capital and are advised as follows:

-   Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand
    converted from Euro at an exchange rate determined on Monday, 30 September 2019 of EUR1.00:ZAR
    16.5997. Accordingly, the cash dividend of 29.02 eurocents per share will be equal to ZAR 4.8172 per
    share.

-   The reference price is ZAR 123.3589 (""reference price""), being a 5% discount to the five-day volume
    weighted average traded price (less distribution) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at Monday,
    30 September 2019. For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price is
    EUR 7.4314 (being the reference price of ZAR 123.3589 converted to Euro at the Rand exchange rate of
    EUR1.00:ZAR 16.5997).

-   Shareholders electing to receive the return of capital will receive 3.9050 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for
    every 100 NEPI Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday,
    11 October 2019, representing the ratio that the cash dividend bears to the reference price. The interim
    dividend will be paid from the Isle of Man.

If no shareholders were to elect to receive the return of capital, the value of the dividends would amount to
EUR 170 010 445.01. Should all shareholders elect to receive the return of capital, the maximum total number
of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the return of capital will be
22 877 310.

The share capital of the company as at the date of this announcement is as follows:

Circular to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders in respect of election to receive either cash dividend or return of capital,23 Sep 2019,"NRP : Circular to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders in respect of election to receive either cash dividend or return of capital: 
NEPI Rockcastle plc
Incorporated and registered in the Isle of Man
Registered number 014178V
JSE and Euronext share code: NRP
ISIN: IM00BDD7WV31
(""NEPI Rockcastle"" or ""the company"")


CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN 
OF CAPITAL


Shareholders are referred to the condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2019
released on SENS and Euronext Amsterdam on 23 August 2019 (the ""results announcement""), wherein it was
stated that the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle had declared a distribution of 29.02 eurocents per share for
the first half of 2019. The results announcement stated further that shareholders would be afforded the opportunity
to elect to receive the distribution either in cash (the ""cash dividend"") or as an issue of fully-paid shares (the
""return of capital""). The election is available in respect of all or part of a shareholder's shareholding as at Friday,
11 October 2019.

Cash dividend

The cash dividend will be paid to shareholders unless a shareholder elects to receive a return of capital.
Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive the cash dividend in South African Rand converted
from Euro at an exchange rate to be announced on Tuesday, 1 October 2019 (""reference price""). For
NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price will be converted to Euro at a
ZAR:EUR conversion rate announced on Tuesday, 1 October 2019, before 11:00 South African time (""exchange
rate"").

The cash dividend will be paid out of the company's distributable profits.

Return of capital

The rationale for the return of capital is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle and to retain flexibility with regard to the company's cash resources.

The number of NEPI Rockcastle shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the return of capital is entitled
will be determined with reference to the ratio that 29.02 eurocents per share bears to a reference price of up to a
5% discount to the five-day volume weighted average traded price (less the cash dividend) of NEPI Rockcastle
shares on the JSE, to be announced on Tuesday, 1 October 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing
shareholder in respect of the return of capital if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be
acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require
the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover,
capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances, the shareholder will receive the balance of their
entitlement as a cash dividend. The company further reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the return of capital, on a pro rata basis. In such
circumstance, shareholders will receive the balance of their interim dividend (net of withholding tax), in cash.

The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the return of
capital will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a
NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (""cash payment"")
made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined
with reference to the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday, 9 October 2019, less 10%
(converted to Euro at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount
will be announced on Thursday, 10 October 2019 before 11:00 South African time.

The new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the return of capital will be funded by way of a reduction
of part of the company's share premium account (which is a reduction of capital).

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the
NEPI Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the return of capital. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be
delivered to shareholders in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership
of such shares. References throughout this announcement to NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant
to the return of capital or to any shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle before or after the implementation of the return
of capital should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt, issue or holding of security entitlements representing
beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares.
All NEPI Rockcastle shares are and will be registered in the name of Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal
Effectenverkeer B.V. (""Euroclear Nederland"") for and on behalf of shareholders.

As at the date of this announcement, the company has 585 838 887 ordinary shares of E0.01 each in issue.

SALIENT DATES AND TIMES
The salient dates and times in the announcement published on SENS and Euronext Amsterdam on 20 September
2019 remain unchanged.

TAX IMPLICATIONS
South African resident shareholders
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders.
For those South African resident shareholders receiving the cash dividend, such amount will be regarded as a
foreign dividend and may be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%, unless an
exemption as set out in the South African tax legislation applies.

The receipt of NEPI Rockcastle shares by South African resident shareholders pursuant to the return of capital
should not be classified as a dividend or a foreign dividend for South African tax purposes and accordingly, South
African dividends withholding tax should not be levied on the new NEPI Rockcastle shares so received. However,
the legislation in this regard is complex and its implementation is uncertain. Shareholders should therefore seek
independent professional tax advice.

The gross local dividend amount for shareholders exempt from paying South African dividends tax, as well as the
net local dividend amount for shareholders liable to pay South African dividends tax, will be announced on
Tuesday, 1 October 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are advised to consult their professional advisors regarding the tax consequences of
the cash dividend and the return of capital or should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to take.
There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.

Shareholders residing outside South Africa
The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders who are resident outside South Africa and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice
from their professional advisors in this regard.

A circular to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders in respect of the election being offered to NEPI Rockcastle
shareholders to receive either the cash dividend or the return of capital will be posted to shareholders on Monday,
23 September 2019 and will be made available on the company's website at https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/Nepi-Rockcastle-Circular-to-NEPI-Rockcastle-shareholders-in-respect-of-the-dividend-

SHORT-FORM: INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2019


""NEPI Rockcastle continues to leverage on its strengths and consolidate its position as the dominant, high-quality
shopping centre owner with the most robust management platform in Europe's highest growth region. We constantly
enhance our properties via extension, reconfiguration and modernising capital expenditure, active asset management
and marketing activities. We focus on the implementation of technological solutions that would further enhance our
CEE leadership and stakeholder value. We continue to pursue a development and acquisition pipeline that improves the
overall quality of the portfolio and adds to the business's long-term sustainability. Our approach balances between
pursuing commercial opportunities and maintaining a prudent balance sheet, and we are confident that our dominant
position in the CEE will allow us to further grow our business,"" said Alex Morar, CEO.

DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

The Group achieved 29.02 eurocents in distributable earnings per share for the first half of 2019, 9.6% higher
than the distribution per share of 26.49 eurocents for the first half of 2018. This increase is due to the effect
of acquisitions and developments finalised in 2018, being concentrated around mid-year and the second half
of the year. The distributable earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be approximately 6% higher than
the 2018 distribution, in line with the guidance issued in February 2019.

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 29.02 euro cents per share for this period. Shareholders can
elect to receive the distribution either in cash or as an issue of fully-paid shares, based on a ratio between
distribution declared and the reference price. The reference price will be calculated using a maximum 5%
discount to the five-day volume-weighted average traded price, less distribution, of NEPI Rockcastle shares
on the JSE.

The Company reserves the right to limit the total allocation of shares as a percent of the total distribution.
A circular containing full details of the election being offered to shareholders, accompanied by announcements
on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam will be issued in due course.

CLOSURE OF FSCA INVESTIGATIONS


The Company is pleased to inform stakeholders that the Financial Services Conduct Authority in South Africa
(the ""FSCA"") has closed the last pending investigation related to trading in shares of NEPI Rockcastle
(""prohibited trading"").

The FSCA has decided that based on evidence obtained there is no substance in the allegations made that
directors, related parties and other parties believed to be related to NEPI Rockcastle or to Resilient REIT
Limited, Fortress REIT Limited and Lighthouse Capital, were supporting the Company's share price during
the period under investigation. Furthermore, the FSCA concluded that the share trades completed on the
Company by the alleged related parties' accounts did not contravene section 80 of the Financial Markets Act
19 of 2012 relating to prohibited trading practices (price manipulation).

Following this closure, NEPI Rockcastle is no longer involved in any investigation conducted by the FSCA.

""We welcome the FSCA's announcement and the conclusion of this remaining investigation. Although this
was not an investigation in the Company's affairs (as the Company hadn't traded in its own shares), its closure
reconfirms our position towards this matter. NEPI Rockcastle adheres to best practice in corporate
governance. The conclusion of this matter allows us to continue to focus on our core business and generating
long-term value for all our stakeholders."" – Alex Morar, CEO

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

revolving facilities and €227 million listed securities as at 31 March 2019. NEPI Rockcastle's gearing ratio
(interest bearing debt less cash, divided by investment property and listed securities) was 32%, below the

 Solvency ratio                      36%                                      <60%
 Consolidated coverage ratio         7.7                                      >2
 Unsecured Consolidated Total        322%                                     >180% / 150%
 Assets/ Unsecured Consolidated
 Total Indebtedness

In March 2019, the Company refinanced €140 million of unsecured financing expiring in 2019 with a loan
maturing in March 2022.

In May 2019, after a roadshow with European fixed-income investors, the Group issued €500 million of
unsecured, 4 year Eurobonds, carrying a 2.625% fixed coupon, with an issue price of 98.15%. This successful
transaction enables the Group to compete more effectively in the Central and Eastern European real estate
markets in the long-term. The Group has a broad bondholder base, which was further diversified through this
issue, ranging from large asset managers, banks, pension and insurance companies to international financial
institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The proceeds will be used for
debt refinancing, developments, acquisitions and working capital.

OUTLOOK

The Company reaffirms its guidance released on 27 February 2019 that, based on strategic options currently
under management's control, distributable earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be approximately 6%
higher than the 2018 distribution. This guidance is based on the assumptions that a stable macroeconomic
environment prevails, no major corporate failures occur, and controlled developments remain on schedule.
This forecast has not been audited or reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of the
Board of Directors.

CLOSURE OF FSCA POSSIBLE FALSE OR MISLEADING REPORTING INVESTIGATION


Stakeholders' attention is drawn to the announcement issued on 6 May 2019 by South Africa's Financial
Services Conduct Authority (""FSCA""). This states that the investigation in relation to a potential breach
of section 81 of the Financial Markets Act No. 19 of 2012 (the ""FMA""), relating to possible false and
misleading reporting, has been closed. The FSCA found ""no substance in the allegations that NEPI
Rockcastle intentionally and negligently made / published false statements in respect of the past or future
performance, being the 31 December 2017 financial statements"". The Company welcomes the
conclusion of this investigation, which reconfirms its position and previous communications to the
market.

On 4 March 2019, the FSCA stated that it had closed its investigation in respect of possible insider
trading related to the Company (Section 78 of the FMA), with no issue raised against the Company.
Following these announcements, the FSCA's only pending investigation related to the Company
concerns possible prohibited trading practices. As stated by the FSCA, this investigation is not into the
affairs of the Company, but into trading of its shares on the stock exchanges, by third parties.

NEPI Rockcastle reiterates that it follows strict corporate governance rules and that its board and
management are comfortable with the integrity of its business practices. Alex Morar, CEO, said: ""We
welcome the conclusion of the FSCA's investigation and note that no claims were made against the
Company, as the allegations raised by certain third parties were groundless. NEPI Rockcastle has
demonstrated exceptional business performance and adheres to best practice in financial reporting and
corporate governance. We will continue to focus on delivering strong results and generating long-term
value for our stakeholders.""

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (""ESG"") RATING ISSUED BY SUSTAINALYTICS


The Company is pleased to announce that in April 2019, Sustainalytics, a leading independent global provider of ESG
and corporate governance research and ratings, rated NEPI Rockcastle's ESG Risk as Low (16.4/100). Sustainalytics
concluded that the Company is at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors, due to its low
exposure to and average management of material ESG issues. The Company is noted for its strong corporate
governance performance, which is reducing its overall risk.

NEPI Rockcastle sees strong corporate governance as an enabler of responsible corporate citizenship. The Group
follows the King IV Report on Corporate Governance (mandatory for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange) and the Euronext Amsterdam guidelines. These governance guidelines include areas such as: leadership,
ethics and corporate citizenship, governing structures and delegation of responsibility and authority, strategy,
performance and reporting, functional areas governance and stakeholder relationship management.

The Company is committed to achieving the highest standards of sustainability and to being a responsible corporate
citizen through several specific actions, such as increasing the number of green certified buildings in its portfolio,
monitoring closely and implementing measures to minimise its impact on the environment, being a relevant supporter
and developer of the communities where it operates, and to overall constantly improving its approach to sustainability,
structured on the following four pillars:

   1. Sustainable resource management - an initiative that covers biodiversity, water, energy and gas consumption,
      waste management and gas emissions, to improve both the impact of consumption as well as efficiency.
   2. Sustainability through green buildings – the majority of the Group's buildings have been certified at high
      sustainability standards in the real estate industry, which acknowledges the Group's investment in sustainable
      buildings during construction and operational stages.
   3. Community engagement – NEPI Rockcastle believes in the importance of giving back to the communities in
      which it operates and seeks to contribute to sustainable social development.
   4. Business integrity - integrity is embedded in all business processes and in the Group's culture, to ensure
      compliance with laws and regulations and that operations are conducted according to the highest standards of
      business ethics.

NEPI Rockcastle aims to have a diversified board of directors (the ""Board"") in terms of knowledge and experience.
The Board's structure has been continuously updated over the past years. The Board recently appointed a new
independent non-executive director, Mr. Andreas Klingen, an experienced professional with strong expertise in
financial markets, investments, real estate and retail.

More details on the company's ESG practices and initiatives can be found in the Corporate Insights section of the
2018 Annual Report (https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NEPI-Rockcastle-Annual-Report-

discounted by 10%. On this basis, shareholders are advised that the gross value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in

CASH PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS


Shareholders are referred to previous announcements relating to the election to receive the final dividend for the year ended
31 December 2018, either as a cash dividend or as a return of capital, the last of which was released on 9 April 2019.

Where a shareholder elects to receive the return of capital by way of an issue of new NEPI Rockcastle shares, any entitlement 
to receive a fraction of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (""cash
payment"") made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction.

The value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders has been determined 
with reference to the volume weighted average traded price of a NEPI Rockcastle share on the JSE on Wednesday, 10 April 2019,
discounted by 10%. On this basis, shareholders are advised that the gross value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in
determining the cash payment due to shareholders is ZAR 107.25539. For shareholders on the European register, this gross 
value is EUR 6.74350, being the aforementioned Rand value converted to Euro at the exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR 15.9050 
announced on Tuesday, 9 April 2019.

The receipt of the cash payment may have tax implications for shareholders. For those South African resident shareholders 
receiving the cash payment, such amount may be regarded as a foreign dividend and, if it is, may be subject to South African 
dividends tax at a rate of 20%, unless an exemption as set out in the South African Income Tax legislation applies. For 
shareholders liable to pay dividends tax at the rate of 20%, the net value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in 
determining the cash payment due to shareholders is ZAR 85.80431.

The salient dates and times announced on Thursday, 14 March 2019 remain unchanged.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and on Euronext Amsterdam.

ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL: FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the circular issued on Wednesday, 20 March 2019, in respect of an election to receive
the final dividend (the ""final dividend"") for the year ended 31 December 2018, either as a cash dividend or as a return of capital
and are advised as follows:

-   Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand converted from Euro at
    an exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR 15.9050. Accordingly, the cash dividend of 26.37 Euro cents per share will be equal to ZAR
    4.1941 per share.

-   The reference price is ZAR 112.6894 (""reference price""), being a 5% discount to the five-day volume weighted average traded
    price (less distribution) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at Friday, 5 April 2019. For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded
    on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price is EUR 7.0852 (being the reference price of ZAR 112.6894 converted to Euro at
    the Rand exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR 15.9050).

-   Shareholders electing to receive the return of capital will receive 3.7218 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for every 100 NEPI
    Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday, 12 April 2019, representing the ratio that the cash
    dividend bears to the reference price. The final dividend will be paid from the Isle of Man.

If no shareholders were to elect to receive the return of capital, the value of the dividends would amount to EUR 152 366 053.56.
Should all shareholders elect to receive the return of capital, the maximum total number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued
by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the return of capital will be 21 504 969.

(""NEPI Rockcastle"" or ""the company"")


CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR 
A RETURN OF CAPITAL


Shareholders are referred to the condensed consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 December 2018
released on SENS and Euronext Amsterdam on 27 February 2019 (the ""results announcement""), wherein it
was stated that the board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle had declared a distribution of 26.37 euro cents per
share for the second half of 2018. The results announcement stated further that shareholders would be afforded
the opportunity to elect to receive the distribution either in cash (the ""cash dividend"") or as an issue of fully-
paid shares (the ""return of capital""). The election is available in respect of all or part of a shareholder's
shareholding as at Friday, 12 April 2019.

Cash dividend

The cash dividend will be paid to shareholders unless a shareholder elects to receive a return of capital.
Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive the cash dividend in South African Rand converted
from Euro at an exchange rate to be announced on Tuesday, 9 April 2019 (""reference price""). For NEPI
Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price will be converted to Euro at a ZAR:EUR
conversion rate announced on Tuesday, 9 April, before 11:00 South African time.

The cash dividend will be paid out of the company's distributable profits.

Return of capital

The rationale for the return of capital is to offer shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in
NEPI Rockcastle and to retain flexibility with regard to the company's cash resources.

The number of NEPI Rockcastle shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the return of capital is
entitled will be determined with reference to the ratio that 26.37 euro cents per share bears to a reference price
of up to a 5% discount to the five-day volume weighted average traded price (less the cash dividend) of NEPI
Rockcastle shares on the JSE, to be announced on Tuesday, 9 April 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing
shareholder in respect of the return of capital if the issue of such shareholder's full allocation of new NEPI
Rockcastle shares would result in that shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to
be acting in concert with such shareholder) having an interest in NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily
require the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any
applicable takeover, capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances, the shareholder will
receive the balance of their entitlement as a cash dividend. The company further reserves the right to reduce
the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to electing shareholders in terms of the return capital, on a
pro rata basis. In such circumstance, shareholders will receive the balance of their final dividend (net of
withholding tax), in cash.

The allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the return
of capital will not be allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction
of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (""cash
payment"") made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders
will be determined with reference to the weighted average traded price of shares on the JSE on Wednesday,
10 April 2019, less 10% (converted to Euro at the exchange rate in respect of those shares traded on Euronext
Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on Thursday, 11 April 2019 before 11:00 South African time.

The new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the return of capital will be funded by way of a
reduction of part of the company's share premium account (which is a reduction of capital).

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of
the NEPI Rockcastle shares that they receive pursuant to the return of capital. NEPI Rockcastle shares will
instead be delivered to shareholders in the form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the
beneficial ownership of such shares. References throughout this announcement to NEPI Rockcastle shares
received or issued pursuant to the return of capital or to any shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle before or after
the implementation of the return of capital should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt, issue or holding
of security entitlements representing beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any
registered ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares. All NEPI Rockcastle shares are and will be registered in the
name of Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V. (""Euroclear Nederland"") for and
on behalf of shareholders.

As at the date of this announcement, the company has 577 800 734 ordinary shares of €0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

South African resident shareholders

The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders.

For those South African resident shareholders receiving the cash dividend, such amount will be regarded as a
foreign dividend and may be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%, unless an
exemption as set out in the South African tax legislation applies.

The receipt of NEPI Rockcastle shares by South African resident shareholders pursuant to the return of capital
should not be classified as a dividend or a foreign dividend for South African tax purposes and accordingly,
South African dividends withholding tax should not be levied on the new NEPI Rockcastle shares so received.
However, the legislation in this regard is complex and its implementation is uncertain. Shareholders should
therefore seek independent professional tax advice.

The gross local dividend amount for shareholders exempt from paying South African dividends tax, as well
as the net local dividend amount for shareholders liable to pay South African dividends tax, will be announced
on Tuesday, 9 April 2019.

NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are advised to consult their professional advisors regarding the tax
consequences of the cash dividend and the return of capital or should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate
action to take.

There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.

Shareholders residing outside South Africa

The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for
shareholders who are resident outside South Africa and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate
advice from their professional advisors in this regard.

A circular to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders in respect of the election being offered to NEPI Rockcastle
shareholders to receive either the cash dividend or the return of capital will be posted to shareholders on
Wednesday, 20 March 2019 and will be made available on the company's website at www.nepirockcastle.com
on the same date.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

SALIENT DATES AND TIMES WITH REGARD TO AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

DIRECTORS' COMMENTARY

All information below excludes joint ventures, unless otherwise stated

In 2018 NEPI Rockcastle has maintained and further strengthened its position
as the CEE's leading property operator, investor and developer. We continued
to deliver strong results, in line with guidance, in a challenging year. The Group
expanded its geographical coverage and benefitted from strong performance
of its properties while managing through competitive markets and changes in
its own management structure.

The Company has continuously adapted its strategy to generate value for its
stakeholders, by prioritising long-term earnings quality and growth and the
stability of its balance sheet. Acquisitions of dominant properties in excess of
EUR594 million were completed, and over EUR260 million were invested in land and
prime developments during 2018. These were funded by a material divestment
from the listed securities portfolio, despite less favourable equity markets, as
well as tapping into the Company's debt capacity while maintaining a safe
credit profile.

Active management of our property portfolio has been and will continue to
be the pillar of our business and we have deployed significant investments
into our properties to ensure they remain the destination of choice in their
respective catchment areas. Considering the recent merger and the addition of
professionals in new countries, having a unified and interconnected team is
an essential component to the continuing success of the Group, which receives
our utmost attention.

With more than eleven years of successful track record in the CEE, NEPI
Rockcastle has accumulated significant know-how of managing retail real
estate operations and a portfolio of dominant assets across a growing number
of diverse jurisdictions. NEPI Rockcastle and its team remain confident and best
placed to benefit from opportunities and growth in its markets to generate
stability and value for its stakeholders.

RETAIL TRANSFORMATION

Penetration of e-commerce and retail area supply relative to population in
the Group's region are on average lower in CEE as compared to the Western
markets. Even though the CEE region is not under the same pressure for retail
transformation, the Company is embedding international trends in changing
consumer preferences into its business model. Active dialogue with leading
online retailers led to high-profile online brands within the region such as
epantofi.ro, eobuwie.com.pl, Notino and eMag opening brick-and-mortar shops
in our malls in Poland and Romania.

It is notable that the overall supply of shopping centres per capita is lower in
CEE than Western Europe or the US, and CEE malls are relatively newer and
more modern. Furthermore, online penetration in Eastern Europe is low at 3%,
compared to Western Europe at 9%. North America has the highest global
penetration rate: 11% (GlobalData source).

NEPI Rockcastle is focused on offering customers preferred social and
recreational destinations by actively upgrading the leisure and entertainment
activities in its shopping centres. In 2018, the Group refurbished and extended
food courts and leisure areas in Kragujevac Plaza, Shopping City Timisoara,
Shopping City Ploiesti, Braila Mall and City Park Constanta and started the
refurbishment of food court in Mega Mall Bucharest, Shopping City Sibiu and
Aurora Mall Buzau. For newly development shopping centers the Group applied
new design trends, resulting in more attractive leisure areas (e.g: Shopping City
Satu Mare and Promenada Novi Sad).

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO

NEPI Rockcastle's direct property geographic profile as at 31 December 2018
by asset value was:

Romania 36%   Croatia 4%
Poland 24%    Czech Republic 3%
Hungary 10%   Serbia 3%
Slovakia 9%   Lithuania 2%

Bulgaria 9%

NEPI Rockcastle implemented its announced strategy of converting the
majority of its portfolio of liquid listed securities into direct property
investment, decreasing the listed securities exposure to EUR197 million, from
EUR593 million at December 2017. The remaining exposure consists of shares in
two large companies, Unibail Rodamco Westfield and Klepierre, that operate
primarily in the US, UK, and Continental Europe.

ACQUISITIONS

NEPI Rockcastle completed acquisitions of EUR594 million and added a total
of over 176,300m2 GLA to its direct property portfolio during 2018. The main
acquisitions are detailed below.

side of the city. The centre offers 61,300m2 of total GLA (out of which 56,100m2
is owned by NEPI Rockcastle) in two buildings connected via a double-level
pedestrian bridge and includes key anchors such as Cinema Pink, H&M, Hervis,
Interspar, Media Markt, New Yorker and Reserved. Mammut is the second
dominant asset that the Group controls in the Hungarian capital.
Budapest is one of the largest cities in the CEE: it is inhabited by 1.75 million
people and its metropolitan area houses a third of the country's population.
The centre is visited by 15.6 million people each year.

DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

The Group has and will continue to invest strategically in developments that
contribute to growth in distributable earnings per share or improve long-term
prospects for its portfolio. NEPI Rockcastle is pursuing a development pipeline
which exceeds EUR1 billion (including redevelopments and extensions, estimated
at cost), of which EUR200 million was spent until 31 December 2018. Out of the
remaining investments, only 24% have already been committed, which gives
the Group flexibility regarding prioritisation and timing of its pipeline projects.

COMPLETED DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

Platan Shopping Centre Extension (Zabrze, Poland, 26 October 2018)

After 15 months of works, the extension of over 14,000m2 of Platan Shopping
Centre opened in October 2018. The city of Zabrze has a population of 175,000
residents and is part of the Silesian metropolitan area that has 4.6 million
residents. The centre serves a 30-minute catchment of 1,968,000 people. The
center has an EPRA occupancy rate of 93.6%. The extension positioned Platan
as an upgraded, fourth generation, upscale shopping centre with a total GLA of
39,400m2; the centre now includes previously missing functions, such as a food
court, fitness centre, cinema and intelligent parking, as well as new brands such
as Carry, Cropp, Home & You, House, Kids Play, KIK, Martes Sport, Maxi Zoo,
Neonet, Pepco, Reserved, Super-pharm and TEDi.

Promenada Novi Sad (Novi Sad, Serbia, 15 November 2018)

After 16 months of works, NEPI Rockcastle opened its first greenfield
development in Serbia. With a 49,200m2 GLA, it is the largest mall in Serbia. It
is located in Novi Sad, the country's second largest city, with a population of
approximately 320,000 inhabitants. The centre serves a 45-minute catchment
of 607,000 people. The city is also 2019's European Youth Capital, was named
Lonely Planet's third best city to visit in 2019 and, in 2021, will be the first non-
European Union city to be the European Capital of Culture.

The centre has an EPRA occupancy of 98.2% and boasts an attractive tenant
mix such as: Adidas, Armani Exchange, Cineplexx, Diesel, Guess, Inditex (Zara,
Massimo Dutti, Zara Home, Oysho, Bershka, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius), KFC,
Lacoste, LC Waikiki, LPP (Reserved, Cropp, Sinsay, House, Mohito), McDonald's,
New Yorker, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger and Univerexport Supermarket.

The Group's strategy to increase the size and quality of the food and leisure
offering was implemented by accommodating a Cosmoland playground, Pro
Fitness, two outdoor terraces used by four restaurants and a large, naturally-lit
food court with cozy seating areas.

Shopping City Satu Mare (Romania, 5 December 2018)

The Group successfully completed the construction of the 29,200m2 GLA
modern retail and entertainment destination in the heart of Satu Mare, a city
of 123,000 residents, with a history going back to the Middle Ages. The centre
is the prime shopping destination for the 288,000 inhabitants that live within
a 45-minute catchment area. Satu Mare Shopping Centre is anchored by
the city's first Carrefour hypermarket and has over 1,000 parking bays. The
centre has a 97.3% EPRA occupancy, hosting tenants such as: Carrefour, CCC,
Cineplexx (the first in Romania), Deichmann, Douglas, Hervis, Intersport, KFC,
LC Waikiki, New Yorker, Pepco, Reserved and Smyk.

The centre features an outdoor terrace of over 1,000m2, overlooking Somes
River, which will be connected to the historical city center by a pedestrian
bridge. The terrace has three outdoor dining areas with selected regional
restaurants. With a welcoming design that includes an integrated green
area, the terrace complements the entertainment offering and is expected to
become the main social hub of the region.

DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS PIPELINE

Solaris Shopping Centre - extension (Opole, Poland)

Construction work on the approximately 8,900m2 extension, including the
development of a multi-level basement parking and a new town square in
front of the main entrance, are ongoing. Tenant demand is strong: C&A, CCC,
Deichmann, Guess, Just Gym, KFC, LPP group brands, McDonald's and Smyk
have signed lease agreements.

Following the extension, Solaris will be a 26,000m2 dominant shopping centre
serving the 128,000 citizens of Opole, a beautiful historical city. The project's
expected delivery date is in the second quarter of 2019.

Developments in Sibiu: Festival development and Shopping City Sibiu
reconfiguration and extension (Romania)

The Group is continuing the development work on its two projects in Sibiu,
one of the most developed and affluent cities in Romania, a major tourist
destination and home to over 170,000 citizens. The two projects will satisfy a
45-minute catchment of 286,000 residents and complement each
other's offering.

Festival is conveniently located in the inner city. The mall will have a 42,200m2
GLA, with the first Kaufland supermarket located in a shopping centre in
Romania, and a strong fashion and entertainment offering: Cinegold, H&M,
Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Bershka, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius) and
New Yorker. The project is expected to be delivered by the end of 2019. Its
architectural concept will be unique, allowing the centre to seamlessly blend
into the city's medieval skyline.

Shopping City Sibiu will remain the larger destination shopping centre, with a
83,100m2 GLA post-reconfiguration and extension, catering to a wider range
of product demand via its two hypermarkets as well as a DIY store. Shopping
City Sibiu was recently refurbished and extended, with several fashion brands
added, such as Cropp, De Facto (first store in the country), House, LC Waikiki,
Mohito, Reserved and Smyk. Some of the existing stores were refurbished
and extended: CCC, Douglas, Humanic and Norriel. The second phase of the
extension will open in spring 2019, with the food court, cinema and open-air
terrace served by new tenants such as KFC, Pepp&Pepper, Salad Box
and Taco Bell.

Aurora Shopping Mall - extension (Buzau, Romania)

In October 2018, the Group started the development work on the 6,000m2 GLA
extension and reconfiguration of Aurora Mall. The centre is a top performer
due to its unique location and access; it is now being refurbished to include a
Cinema City, a food court and several new fashion tenants. Buzau, a city with
a population of 133,000 residents, is a major transit-hub that links Bucharest to
the Moldavia region. Buzau is the seat of a county with over 430,000 residents
that substantially overlaps with the centre's 45-minute catchment area.

The extension and reconfiguration will be done in several phases expected to
be completed by the end of the year, with the exception of the Cinema City
that will open in spring 2020.

Arena Centar - shopping centre extension and reconfiguration, and retail
park development (Zagreb, Croatia)

Arena Centar is one of the most successful assets in the Group's portfolio, and
the top retail destination in Zagreb. The city is the capital of Croatia and has
a population of over 800,000 residents; its metropolitan area houses almost a
quarter of the country's population.

The Group has planned to extend the centre since its acquisition; the extensive
reconfiguration will be fully completed during 2019, bringing the total GLA to
67,200m2 and adding brands such as CK, Gap, Muller, Peek and Cloppenburg,
TAF and Under Armour, together with the extensions of Adidas, Fashion
Friends, Sport Vision and Stradivarius.

In addition, a new retail park adjacent to the shopping centre is almost
completed and expected to open in May 2019, adding 8,300m2 of GLA. The
retail park will extend the range of tenant mix available to Arena Zagreb with
Extra Sport, Intersport, Jysk, LC Waikiki (market entry in Croatia), Pepco, Pitta
Rosso and Sancta Domenica.

Focus Mall Zielona Gora - extension (Zielona Gora, Poland)

The Company has started the 15,000m2 GLA extension of Focus Mall Zielona
Gora, a vibrant city well known for its annual wine festival, the largest
municipality and the seat of Lubuskie voivodeship. It is well connected to several
international roads and rail routes.

Once completed, the 43,900m2 GLA mall will be the main retail destination
for 140,000 inhabitants in a 30-minute catchment area, including the 284,000
citizens of the city. The extension is expected to be finalised in Q4 2020.

Targu Mures - development (Romania)

The Company is in process of obtaining a building permit for the development
of a 41,300m2 GLA shopping mall in the south-eastern part of Targu Mures, the
seat of Mures county. A vibrant and multi-cultural city of 148,000 inhabitants,
Targu Mures is also home to the largest urban Hungarian community in Romania.

The project aims to become the regional dominant mall and offer to the
390,000 residents estimated to be living in a 45-minute catchment area access
to a large hypermarket, numerous fashion stores, food court and cinema with
leisure areas. Targu Mures Shopping City is currently 30% pre-leased and will
be anchored by a Carrefour hypermarket.
The project is expected to be completed in Q2 2020, depending on permitting.

The Group is pursuing several other development projects which are subject to
permitting and market circumstances.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

The Group has a strong liquidity profile, with EUR97 million in cash, EUR236 million
in available unsecured revolving facilities, and EUR197 million net available in the
listed securities portfolio at 31 December 2018.

NEPI Rockcastle's gearing ratio (interest bearing debt less cash, divided by
investment property and listed securities) was 33%, below the gearing ratio
target of 35%.

The average interest rate, including hedging costs, was 2.3% during 2018. As at
31 December 2018, fixed-coupon bonds represented 43% of NEPI Rockcastle's
outstanding debt, and out of the remaining long-term debt exposed to Euribor,
30% was hedged with interest rate caps and 48% with interest rate swaps (the
difference relates to the outstanding revolving facilities).

Depending on market conditions, the Group may initiate a repurchase of issued
bonds or shares during the upcoming reporting periods.

In February 2019, NEPI Rockcastle has decided to discontinue the credit rating
agreement with Moody's with a view of optimising costs and management time.

ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT MATTERS

Valuation

NEPI Rockcastle reassesses the valuation of its property portfolio twice a
year. Fair value is determined by external, independent professional valuers,
with appropriate and recognised qualifications, and recent experience in
the location and category of property being valued. The valuations as at 31
December 2018 were performed by Cushman&Wakefield, Cushman&Wakefield
Affiliate Partners and Jones Lang La Salle, and reviewed by the Company's
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC (""PwC""), as part of the year-end audit
procedures.

External audit

The Group's consolidated financial statements are audited by PwC Isle of
Man, by relying on the work of PwC firms in the jurisdictions where the Group
operates. The local PwC firms audit the standalone IFRS financial information of
the subsidiaries, for the purpose of issuing an audit report on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group, prepared in accordance with IFRS. For
2018, all property-owning subsidiaries requiring statutory audit will be audited
by PwC, except for Ploiesti Shopping City. For statutory reporting purposes,
audit requirements are driven by local regulations, and not all subsidiaries are
required to submit statutory audited financial statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The membership of the Board of Directors went through several changes in
2018. As announced on 12 June 2018, the executive management evolved into
a sole CEO structure. In line with best practice and corporate governance
principles, the Company rotates its board members to achieve a Board
comprised of highly qualified and experienced directors. The Company would
like to thank once more its former directors, Mr. Dan Pascariu, Mr. Michael Mills,
Mr. Spiro Noussis and Mr. Nicholas Matulovich for their valuable contribution
and at the same time welcome its new directors: Mr. George Aase and Mr. Vuso Majija.

With respect to the investigations conducted by the Financial Services
Conduct Authority in South Africa (the ""FSCA""), the Board highlights that
the Company has been fully cooperating with the regulator. Considering
the Group's recent communication with its stakeholders and continuous
engagement to ensure transparency, supporting the FSCA towards a swift
resolution of the ongoing investigation is a priority. NEPI Rockcastle looks
forward to the FSCA concluding the pending investigations involving trading of
the Company's shares.

A group of ten investors have raised concerns during 2018 following which
the Board established a special committee to analyse and respond to matters
raised, engaged in fully transparent communications with its investors, and
improved the already existing whistle-blower facilities. The special committee
and the Board consider the respective matters as addressed and reconfirm
that no substantiated allegations were made. The Company maintains its
commitment that any future substantiated allegations will be properly
scrutinised.

NEPI Rockcastle has also initiated the process for obtaining an ESG rating.
Further improvements to corporate governance and other related initiatives
will be detailed in the Annual Report.

DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS

The Group achieved 26.37 eurocents in distributable earnings per share for
the second half of 2018, which, aggregated with the distribution achieved
for the six months ended 30 June 2018 of 26.49 eurocents per share, results
in a total distribution per share of 52.86 euro-cents for the year ended 31
December 2018. The 2018 distribution is 9.5% higher than the 2017 distribution
of 48.26 eurocents per share. This growth is in line with previously announced
guidance, although macroeconomic circumstances proved more challenging
than initially envisaged. The strong results reflect the solid performance of
the Group's assets and management team, and the quality of acquisitions and
developments completed during the year.

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 26.37 euro cents per share for
the second half of 2018. Shareholders can elect to receive distribution either in
cash or as an issue of fully-paid shares based on a ratio between distribution
declared and the reference price. The reference price will be calculated using
a maximum 5% discount to the five-day volume-weighted average traded
price, less distribution, of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE. The Company
reserves the right to limit the total allocation of shares as a percent of the total
distribution. A circular containing full details of the election being offered to
shareholders, accompanied by announcements on the Stock Exchange News
Service (SENS) of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam will be issued in due course.

PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE

NEPI Rockcastle's strategy is to continue focusing on the long-term
performance of its portfolio and selective expansion via developments
and acquisitions. Leveraging on the quality of the existing portfolio and
management platform, future results are expected to outperform those of
the Company's peers operating in the same markets. Moreover, superior GDP
growth between 2.8% and 4.5% is expected to continue in CEE, relative to
EU average of 2.2%, driving up retail consumption and tenant turnovers in
the countries where NEPI Rockcastle operates. The Company will maintain
a flexible approach to new development and acquisition opportunities,
considering the availability and cost of funding, with the aim of optimising the
long-term benefit to its stakeholders.

Based on strategic options currently under management's control, distributable
earnings per share for 2019 are expected to be approximately 6% higher
than the 2018 distribution. This guidance is based on the assumptions that a
stable macroeconomic environment prevails, no major corporate failures occur
and controlled developments remain on schedule. This forecast has not been
audited or reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of
the Board of Directors.

BASIS OF PREPARATION

The condensed consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 December 2018 have
been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of the
International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and interpretations adopted by the
International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB""), the presentation and the disclosure
requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the JSE Listings Requirements.
The accounting policies which have been applied are consistent with those used in the
preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, with
the exception of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 starting 1 January 2018. The directors
take full responsibility for the preparation of this preliminary report. This condensed report
contains information extracted from the audited financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2018, but is not itself audited. The directors take full responsibility for the
preparation of the condensed report and for ensuring that the financial information has
been correctly extracted from the underlying audited annual financial statements. The
Directors confirm that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 as well as
the comparative period presented. The auditors, PwC, have issued their unmodified audit
report on the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 and a copy
of the audit opinion, together with the underlying audited annual financial statements are
available for inspection at the company's registered office as well as on the Company's
official website.

For the comparative information, in accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, the
merger between New Europe Property Investments (NEPI) and Rockcastle Global Real
Estate Company (Rockcastle) was classified as a purchase of Rockcastle by NEPI, with NEPI
Rockcastle being assessed in substance as a continuation of NEPI. Consequently, in these
consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IFRS, NEPI Rockcastle presents the
results of former NEPI Group before the merger date (11 July 2017), and the results of the
combined Group from the merger date onwards.

The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in
these financial results. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full
understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should obtain a copy of the
auditor's report together with the accompanying financial statements.

(the ""acquisition""). The acquisition was subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent and conclusion of a final purchase
agreement.

The company advises that the remaining conditions precedent to the acquisition (including receipt of certain of the
required regulatory approvals and the waiver of a right of first refusal) were not fulfilled by 31 December 2018, pursuant
to which the agreement has been terminated.

The company reconfirms the earnings guidance previously provided in respect of the growth in distribution per share in
2018 compared to 2017.

MOODY'S AFFIRMS NEPI ROCKCASTLE'S BAA3 LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING AND CHANGES OUTLOOK TO STABLE


Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") has affirmed NEPI Rockcastle's long-term credit rating and senior unsecured
rating at 'Baa3' and changed the outlook from positive to stable.

The rating reflects, among others, the good quality of the Group's shopping centres, as illustrated by their consistently
high occupancy and strong like-for-like rental growth, and the favourable macroeconomic fundamentals across the
Central and Eastern European countries where the Group is present. The rating is also underpinned by the Company's
track record of moderate debt metrics.

The change of outlook to stable from positive reflects the agency's view that the Company's liquidity management
needs to strengthen. Moody's also note that ""the Company's debt metrics remain strong for the rating and that its
investment needs are currently more than covered by internally generated funds"".

The report issued by Moody's is available on the Company's website, https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-

NEPI ROCKASTLE REQUESTS INVESTIGATION BY REGULATORS FOLLOWING VICEROY REPORT


The Company requests investigation by regulators following Viceroy Report

Following the publication of a report on NEPI Rockcastle by Viceroy Research (the ""Viceroy Report""), and
further to our various announcements in response thereto, the Company has made a written submission to each of
the JSE Limited, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority in South Africa, the Dutch Authority for the Financial
Markets and Euronext Amsterdam requesting inter alia an investigation into trading in NEPI Rockcastle shares in
the days leading up to and immediately following the publication of the Viceroy Report.

Having discredited with full transparency all accusations and allegations made, NEPI Rockcastle believes that the
only purpose of the said report was to knowingly disseminate false and/or misleading information regarding the
Company.

As such, the Company has requested the above-mentioned authorities to investigate any market manipulation
offences that may have occurred in terms of the Financial Markets Act 2012 (in South Africa) and the Dutch
Financial Supervision Act (in the Netherlands).

Further report issued by Viceroy Research

NEPI Rockcastle notes Viceroy's latest report, released today, 6 December 2018. Despite the Company's public
commitment to discuss any concerns regarding its activities directly, Viceroy has published a new report without
contacting the Company for comment or to confirm the accuracy of the information contained therein.

Viceroy's latest report continues to spread inaccurate information, which the Company considers to be a further
instance of market manipulation. Some of the erroneous information included in today's report has already been
addressed in the Company's previous announcements or during the global investor call held on 29 November 2018,
including (i) matters relating to the transparency into corporate governance, (ii) that intra-group finance expenses
are not fully deducted for tax purposes, and (iii) that new tax legislation implementing the Anti-Tax Avoidance
Directive rules has already been introduced in Romania from 1 January 2018 and has been applied by the Company
since its introduction.

NEPI Rockcastle again requests Viceroy to disclose how it generates its income and if it has knowledge of any
parties that stood to profit from the publication of their reports.

A more detailed response to each of the allegations made in Viceroy's latest report is set out below:

   -   As previously announced, the Company is aware that the Financial Services Conduct Authority in South
       Africa (""FSCA"") is currently investigating possible prohibited trading practices in respect of NEPI
       Rockcastle shares traded on the JSE. Importantly, this is not an investigation into the business affairs of
       the Company. NEPI Rockcastle has and will continue to co-operate fully with the FSCA investigation. The
       Company confirms that it is not responsible for the trading activity of third parties, including shareholders.
   -   The Company's Transfer Pricing files and related documentation, including intra-group loan agreements
       and interest rates used, are prepared and reviewed by transfer pricing experts. NEPI Rockcastle is
       comfortable that the interest rates used for intra-group funding purposes are in compliance with local tax
       legislation and transfer pricing regulations, and withstand the scrutiny of tax authorities.
   -   Viceroy continues to ignore that finance expenses deducted for tax purposes are different (and much lower)
       than finance expenses recognised for accounting purposes, and that the extent of tax deduction is defined
       by local tax legislation. The recent amendments to Romanian tax legislation regarding the deductibility of
       finance expenses were implemented through the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 79/2017,
       amending law no. 227/2015 on the Fiscal Code, and became effective as of 1 January 2018. NEPI
       Rockcastle's subsidiaries in Romania have been applying this legislation since its introduction.
   -   It is apparent from its latest report that Viceroy does not understand NEPI Rockcastle's business (and
       especially its accounting and tax processes and procedures) sufficiently to be able to draw conclusions as
       to what impacts the operations of the group. The report also ignores the fact that dividends declared in 2018
       (corresponding to the distribution for the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018) were fully paid in
       cash, without any scrip dividend being offered to shareholders.
   -   The deferred tax included in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017 was determined
       in accordance with IFRS, and audited by the group's external auditors. The distributable earnings are a
       measure of the underlying operating performance of an investment property company, excluding fair value
       gains, investment property disposals, deferred tax, and items that are not considered to be part of its core
       activity. The Company is preparing the calculation of its distributable earnings based on EPRA and the
       Best Practice Recommendations of the South African REIT Association, which note that deferred taxes on
       unrealised capital gains on assets should be excluded.
   -   The Company's dividend yield is a function of its share price, which is outside of the Company's control;
       management's main role is to drive the operational performance of the Company.
   -   The changes to the Company's board of directors have been extensively discussed in the Company's reports
       and presentations, and did not result from any investigation by the FSCA or other regulator.

The Company maintains that Viceroy's allegations are based on incorrect and incomplete information, and it does
not appear that they have consulted any accounting or tax experts. The Company considers that it has now
addressed all allegations in detail and stakeholders that have concerns about the Company's activities are invited
to contact management directly. As previously mentioned, the Company is working on preparing a Q&A section
which will be available on its website.

The Company is willing to entertain detailed discussions with its stakeholders only if done in a direct and
transparent manner. Stakeholders that have concerns about the Company's activity are invited to contact
management directly at OfficeIOM@nepirockcastle.com.

Shareholders are reminded that S&P and Fitch have recently confirmed NEPI Rockcastle's ratings remain
unchanged following the publication of the Viceroy Report, due to its lack of conclusive evidence and
unsubstantiated allegations.

The Company expressly reserves its rights against Viceroy and any related party or contributor to the latest report.

UPDATE ON VICEROY REPORT ON NEPI ROCKCASTLE


The Company refers to its SENS announcement of 28 November 2018 regarding the issuance of a report by
Viceroy Research (""Viceroy"") on NEPI Rockcastle (the ""Report""), as well as to the follow-up statement
made by Viceroy on the same day (which the Company has considered to form part of the Report).

Upon thorough review of the Report, the Company informs stakeholders that:

   (i)     the Report (although publicly stated by Viceroy to have been prepared over a period of 6 months,
           but without reaching out to the company for feedback) contains material errors, builds on incorrect
           assumptions, make unsubstantiated claims, and is grossly misleading;
   (ii)    Viceroy has ignored or does not understand the reporting regulations that the Company is obliged
           to observe locally and internationally (in particular, the differences between local accounting
           standards and IFRS);
   (iii)   Viceroy's analysis of publicly available information ignores basic accounting principles;
   (iv)    Viceroy ignores that the merger of New Europe Property Investments plc (""NEPI"") and Rockcastle
           Global Real Estate Company Limited (""Rockcastle"") to form NEPI Rockcastle (the ""merger"")
           was an all-share merger of two listed companies, based on a share swap ratio which reflected the
           fact that the market priced the shares of both companies at similar premiums to net asset value.
           NEPI shareholders benefitted from an uplift in net asset value and earnings per share immediately
           after the merger;
   (v)     Viceroy's comments regarding Mr. Pascariu's affairs ignore NEPI's public disclosure from 2008
           regarding the recusal of Mr. Pascariu from any decision in respect of the referenced transactions,
           all of which were appropriately disclosed by the Company; and
   (vi)    in respect of the letter received by NEPI Rockcastle from ten signatories dated 8 August 2018 (the
           ""August 2018 letter""), and following on from the Company's SENS announcements of 31 August
           2018 , 1 October 2018 (referring to the Company's open conference call of 28 September 2018
           during which no specific substantiated allegations were presented) and 12 November 2018, the
           board sub-committee has engaged with the signatories, and considers that it has adequately
           addressed the concerns raised. The Company has also thoroughly investigated comments made
           about the Company's recent transactions in Bulgaria and has found no irregularities.

The Company's detailed responses to the Report are presented below.

While Viceroy states that the Report has been prepared for educational purposes only"", and that the Report
and any statements made within it are ""not statements of fact"", it is clear that the issuance of the Report by
Viceroy seeks to materially impact NEPI Rockcastle and its stakeholders. NEPI Rockcastle stakeholders are
accordingly advised to consider the Company's response to the Report as contained in this announcement and
act prudently when reacting to the allegations set out in the Report. In addition, the Company echoes the
February 2018 request of South African National Treasury, made following Viceroy's report on Capitec Bank,
that the Financial Sector Conduct Authority urgently consider whether it should initiate a market abuse
investigation into the conduct of Viceroy, and to alert relevant overseas regulators to consider whether Viceroy
is regulated appropriately and operating in line with their market conduct and market abuse laws. In this
regard and to facilitate proper investigation, the Company considers it appropriate that Viceroy and its
associates declare any trading positions they may have in NEPI Rockcastle as at the date the report was issued.
Stakeholders are advised that the Company expressly reserved its rights against Viceroy and any related party
or contributor to the Report.

Responses to main allegations raised in the Report

1. AUGUST 2018 LETTER

As announced on 31 August 2018, the members of the special sub-committee of the board constituted to
consider the August 2018 letter (the ""sub-committee"") are the chair of the board (Robert Emslie), the chair
of the audit committee (Andre van der Veer), the chief executive officer (Alex Morar) and the chief financial
officer (Mirela Covasa).

NEPI Rockcastle has not rejected an independent investigation on any specific substantiated claims made
against the Company. It has taken reasonable measures to ensure that the concerns raised in the August 2018
letter have been properly addressed, but does not believe that it has been presented with sufficient information
regarding concerns over the activities of NEPI Rockcastle to form a basis for a clear scope of investigation at
this stage.

The Company is committed to transparency in addressing stakeholder concerns and in this regard stakeholders
are reminded that it has taken, inter alia, the following actions following receipt of the August 2018 letter:
    (i)   the sub-committee was immediately constituted;
    (ii)  a conference call with all signatories of the letter was held on 29 September 2018, with the unedited
          contents of the call made publicly available on the Company's website;
          existing whistleblowing facilities have been improved to provide stakeholders with a secure line
          facilitated by an independent service provider to report and substantiate claims against the
          Company; and
    (iii) the chair of the board and chair of the audit committee met with representatives of each of the ten
          signatories of the letter on an individual basis.

It is noted that following the above, no claims made in the August 2018 letter have been substantiated and the
Company has received no indication from any signatory of the letter (or any other stakeholder) of
dissatisfaction with the manner in which the letter has been addressed by NEPI Rockcastle.

2. OPERATIONS OF THE GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

   2.1 Differences between NEPI Rockcastle's financial reporting and major links to an established
       financial fraud

Viceroy's claim that NEPI Rockcastle's earnings figures are overstated is blatantly incorrect. As shown below,
Viceroy compares consolidated IFRS accounts to mathematically-added (not consolidated) statutory
standalone financials, thereby ignoring both the differences between IFRS and Romanian accounting
principles (Romanian GAAP) as well as basic consolidation mechanics, such as the exclusion of intra-Group
transactions.

NEPI Rockcastle prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, showing the position
and the transactions of the Group with non-related parties and excluding any intra-group balances and
transactions. The information from local filings in the Report appears to have been extracted from statutory
standalone financial statements submitted by the Group's Romanian property holding subsidiaries (""SPVs"")
to local authorities, which were prepared based on Romanian GAAP, as required in terms of Romanian law.
The main differences between IFRS and Romanian GAAP applicable to NEPI Rockcastle and relevant for
this comparison are:

   2.2 Allegation regarding taxes reported at the Group level versus local Romanian subsidiaries

The allegations set out in the Report regarding taxes reported at the Group level versus local Romanian
subsidiaries is misleading and disregards the presentation in the Group's 2017 IFRS consolidated financial
statements of two line items: Current Income Tax expense of €1.67 million and Deferred Income Tax of
€35 million. This information is further detailed and disclosed separately at the level of each jurisdiction,
including Romania, on page 168 of NEPI Rockcastle's 2017 Annual Report available at
https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NEPI-Rockcastle_Annual-Report_2017_online.pdf
(the ""2017 Annual Report"").

Romanian GAAP requires only the recognition of the current tax expense. Therefore, deferred tax is
recognised only in the Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements (according to IAS 12 ""Income Taxes"")
and it is computed as the net of:

-      deferred tax assets, arising from fiscal losses carried forward; and
-      deferred tax liabilities, resulting mostly from differences between the fiscal base (i.e. historical cost of
       the properties diminished by tax depreciation) and the accounting base (IFRS fair value) of the
       investment property.

Fiscal losses accumulate during the construction period of a development (including extensions and
refurbishments) and can be used for up to seven years after the property becomes income-producing. The taxes
reported and paid by the Group in Romania are correctly computed in accordance with the local tax legislation
and transfer pricing regulations.

    2.3 Allegations on inconsistencies relating to analysed income-generating subsidiaries in Romania

Page 6 of the Report contains notably incomplete and erroneous statements, which do not correctly match the
schedule of properties and the SPVs owning each property.

              -   The Office Cluj Napoca should have been excluded from IFRS numbers, as joint ventures
                  are accounted for using the equity method.
              -   Shopping City Galati is presented twice, with two different sets of values. The Company
                  has reviewed this information and concluded that the revenues/expenses/profits stated for
                  the first appearance of Shopping City Galati correspond to Ploiesti Shopping City. Ploiesti
                  Shopping City is also a joint venture, accounted for using the equity method under IFRS
                  and therefore should not be included in this reconciliation.
              -   Shopping City Sibiu is presented twice, however the first set of data corresponds to Targu
                  Jiu Shopping City. The buildings and land that form Shopping City Sibiu are indeed owned
                  by two SPVs, only one of which is presented in the analysis on page 6 of the Report (Sibiu
                  Shopping City 2 SRL, former Bel Rom Trei SRL, is missing).
              -   The figures presented in the Report for Regional Strip Centres in fact correspond to the
                  revenues generated by Vulcan Value Centre. the SPVs which form the ""Regional Strip
                  Centres"" are not included in the analysis;
              -   City Business Centre, which is a five building office complex, is partially presented by
                  including only one SPV, Timisoara City Business Centre One, which owns only two of the
                  five buildings. The other two SPVs, Timisoara Office Building (which owns one building)
                  and Modatim Business Facility (which owns two buildings) are missing from the analysis.
              -   City Park Constanta is held via two SPVs, City Park Constanta and Constanta Shopping
                  City. Only one entity has been included in the Report.

    2.4 Allegation on auditor spread

PricewaterhouseCoopers (""PwC"") is the Group auditor and reports directly to the Company's Audit
Committee. As detailed in the audit opinion included in the 2017 Annual Report, PwC has confirmed their
independence, has continuous unrestricted access to communication within the Group, and has complied with
all International Standards of Auditing (ISAs), PwC internal controls and best practices in providing its
services.

The audit report on the Group's consolidated financial statements is issued by PwC Isle of Man, after having
reviewed the work of the PwC offices in the jurisdictions where the Group operates. This local audit work is
required on account of the various jurisdictions have differing accounting and tax rules, as well as being
subject to other regulations that impact their activity.

PwC performs over 15 000 hours of review and audit work annually on NEPI Rockcastle. The local PwC
offices audit the standalone IFRS financial statements of the SPVs, for the purpose of issuing an audit report
on the consolidated IFRS accounts. They also perform statutory audits for some SPVs where it is required by
local legislation, which criteria is usually based on size (assets, revenues and number of employees).

All 10 entities in Romania under full control of the Group (100% shareholding) for which statutory audit was
required in 2017 have been audited by PwC Romania. The joint ventures' auditors (PwC Romania and KPMG
Romania) have been selected together with the joint venture partners.

   2.5 Allegation on 'ballooning' receivables balance

In its allegation of NEPI Rockcastle ""ballooning"" its receivables balance, Viceroy has again mixed concepts
of IFRS consolidation and statutory accounts aggregation. The Report highlights the outstanding receivables
days as over 81, which has been incorrectly determined by including:

      -   Romanian GAAP Revenues, which include intra-Group transactions and unrealised foreign exchange
          gains which should be excluded for IFRS consolidation purposes (as further detailed in 2.1 above);
      -   Romanian GAAP receivable balances, which include intra-Group balances; and
      -   an incorrect assumption that fair value differences (which have been incorrectly estimated) should be
          deducted from total Romanian GAAP revenues.

The 2017 Annual Report includes a comprehensive analysis of NEPI Rockcastle's third-party receivable
balances in note 6.1 to the financial statements (Credit Risk). The analysis clearly shows that a majority of
receivables were not due in 2017 (€26.6 million of the total tenant receivables of €34 million). Based on the
2017 financial statements, the Group collects its receivables in approximately 29 days. The computation of
the 99.9% collection rate is based on the amount of €103 000 which was considered unrecoverable in respect
of revenues for 2017 (€337 million).

It is not clear how Viceroy has determined the Ramnicu Valcea Shopping City's 1 800 receivable days. As at
31 December 2017, the mall had been open for 24 days, had receivable balances of €120 000 and revenues
for the period of €800 000.

The Group has strict collection procedures and this process is proactively managed. The Company's asset
management team closely monitors tenants and their effort rates, so as to prevent tenants' defaulting. All
provisions are assessed individually and are regularly followed up.

   2.6 Other allegations included in the Report

There is numerous other erroneous information included in the Report, which relies on several assumptions
and principles with little regard to fact.

3. THE ROCKCASTLE ACQUISITION

The Report includes a calculation that indicates that Rockcastle was acquired by NEPI at a 62% premium to
book value and a 78.2% premium after adjusting listed investments. Viceroy makes no mention of the fact
that NEPI's share price also traded at a significant premium to book value, which is unpacked further below.

The table below sets out the Company's calculated market price premium to net tangible asset value and
investment property for both NEPI and Rockcastle as at 12 May 2017, the day subsequent to the combined
NEPI and Rockcastle announcement of a revised swap ratio of one NEPI share for every 4.7 Rockcastle
shares. Based on ruling market prices, NEPI had a higher price percentage premium to net tangible asset
value (""NTAV"") of 97.1% as opposed to Rockcastle's premium to NTAV of 56.0%. If the premium is
allocated to investment property only (excluding all other statement of financial position balances including
listed investments), the premia are very similar at 66.9% for NEPI and 67.8% for Rockcastle.

The acquisition was a merger of NEPI and Rockcastle using the respective company's shares as currency to
acquire shares in NEPI Rockcastle with reference to an agreed share swap ratio. Full details of the merger
transaction are set out in the circulars (and NEPI Rockcastle prospectus) issued to NEPI and Rockcastle
shareholders on 9 June 2017.

The share swap ratio utilized in the merger was calculated based on factors including the market price of the
shares involved in the merger (NEPI and Rockcastle) and valuations undertaken by reputable advisors.
Moreover, the Company notes that the merger (including by implication the share swap ratio) was reviewed
and approved by (i) 87.47% of NEPI shareholders voting(representing 84.30% of the total number of NEPI
shares that could have been voted at the general meeting) (see https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-
content/uploads/2018/10/en-2017-07-06.pdf) and by 99.9% of Rockcastle shareholders voting (representing
85.2% of the total number of Rockcastle shares that could have been voted at the general meeting) (see
https://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/en-2017-07-03.pdf). -

From an IFRS 3 perspective, the merger between NEPI and Rockcastle was treated as an acquisition by NEPI
of Rockcastle, with the goodwill generated as the difference between the actual value of the Rockcastle group
(total equity at June 2017 – €1.44 billion) and the consideration paid to acquire the business, which was based
on NEPI's trading share price at the date of the merger (€2.32 billion). At the time of the merger, NEPI and
Rockcastle shares were trading on the JSE at a premium to net asset value, therefore generating a gap of €0.88
billion between the value of NEPI Rockcastle shares issued and Rockcastle's net asset value. The accounting
of this transaction would have increased the balance sheet by the generated goodwill of €0.88 billion, and the
NEPI Rockcastle Group would have had a significant difference between its net asset value and adjusted net
asset value. In accordance with IFRS 3 – Business Combinations, the acquirer (NEPI) has the ability to fair
value its acquisition and adjust the goodwill recorded for a period of one year from the date of combination.
This fair valuation took place at 31 December 2017.

The write-off of goodwill in NEPI Rockcastle's financial statements subsequent to the merger is consistent
with the accounting treatment adopted and disclosed in NEPI Rockcastle's prospectus issued on 9 June 2017.
The consolidated pro forma financial information is set out in Annexure 18 of the prospectus. Note 9 to the
pro forma consolidated statement of financial position states: ""According to NEPI Rockcastle's accounting
policy, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and goodwill is tested annually
for impairment. Goodwill arising from the transaction is expected to be impaired and an impairment of
EUR739.38 million is recognised. The additional goodwill arising from the merger transaction of EUR739.38
million is assumed to represent the future potential increase in fair value of the acquired portfolio of properties
but is not expected to be recoverable through the sale of the assets and liabilities as the assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value in the financial statements of NEPI Rockcastle. NEPI Rockcastle expects,
subsequent to the goodwill impairment through profit and loss, to transfer the loss arising from the goodwill
impairment to share premium, off-setting the effect of the impairment charge within accumulated profit."" The
Group notes that such an accounting treatment represents market practice, as it has also been applied in the
Unibail – Rodamco merger (€1.3 billion) as well as the Klepierre – Corio merger (€704.5 million).

Furthermore, we find the reference to the 36One report irrelevant, as NEPI Rockcastle does not have cross-
shareholdings with Resilient, Fortress or other shareholders.

As regards the allegations of enriching management, the current executive directors of NEPI Rockcastle had
less than 0.5% of NEPI before the merger, and less afterwards, as further detailed in the relevant disclosures
made in the merger documentation and thereafter in the 2017 Annual Report.

The Company also notes that NEPI and Rockcastle's respective boards were independent of each other and
that the companies negotiated and contracted the merger at arm's length.

4. ACCUSATIONS OF IMPLICATIONS WITH PEREGRINE FINANCIAL & CEEIF

The Report misleadingly alleges the existence of fraudulent behaviour by NEPI related to its acquisition of
assets from a party indirectly related to Mr. Dan Pascariu (the chairman of NEPI at the time, and former
chairman of NEPI Rockcastle). In this regard, shareholders are advised as follows:

               -   Mr. Dan Pascariu was appointed as a director of NEPI on 28 November 2007.
               -   The initial announcement on future acquisitions of General Investments and General
                   Building Management (Raiffeisen Office portfolio) was issued on 11 February 2008 (see
                   https://nepirockcastle.com/further-investment-2/ (the ""Raiffeisen Announcement""),
               -   The rationale of the transaction was that it provided NEPI country-wide coverage with a
                   portfolio mainly occupied by an A-grade tenant with a long leases, ensuring an income
                   producing asset base for the Company.
               -   The Raiffeisen Announcement states the following: The vendor of the companies is Central
                   Eastern European Real Estate Shareholdings BV, part of the Avrig 35 Group (""Avrig"").
                   Avrig is also a 20% shareholder in the Company's investment advisor and one of Avrig's
                   directors is also a director of the Company's investment advisor. Only the independent
                   directors of the Company's investment advisor advised the Company on the transaction.
                   Dan Pascariu, one of the Company's directors, is also a minority shareholder in Avrig
                   35. Mr Pascariu did not participate in the board discussions on the transaction and
                   abstained from voting on the transaction.""


               -   Proper disclosure of the transaction was in place, as well as in respect of the following
                   related transactions:

5. RESIGNATION OF MR. DAN PASCARIU

Mr. Dan Pascariu was the chairman of the board of NEPI and NEPI Rockcastle for a period of nine years. His
resignation from the board and as chairman of NEPI Rockcastle was a personal decision, during a year in
which the board had already undergone several changes.

6. STATEMENT THAT THE COMPANY IS ""FUNDAMENTALLY OVERPRICED""

The Company or its board is not in the position to comment on the adequacy of the share price.
Nevertheless, the Company highlights that the section of the Report relating to the pricing of the Company's
shares incorrectly states that NEPI Rockcastle's most recent reported EPRA NAV was €6.8 per share, as
opposed to the correct €7.14 per share, as at 30 June 2018.

It appears that Viceroy has used EPRA (adjusted) NAV for most peers, except for NEPI Rockcastle, and that
the indicators used in the comparison are aimed at deception.

The Report's allegations relating to cash generation are also misleading, as operating cash flows (as
presented in the Group's consolidated cash flow statement) are correlated with the distributable earnings for
2017 and 2018. In addition, all distributions during 2018 have been fully paid out to shareholders in cash.

7. ALLEGATION IN THE FOLLOW-UP STATEMENT ISSUED BY VICEROY ON 28 NOVEMBER 2018

NEPI Rockcastle updates the valuation of its property portfolio twice a year, with fair value being determined
by external, independent professional valuers with appropriate and recognised qualifications, and experience
in the locations of properties being valued. All valuers are members of the Royal Institute of Chartered
Surveyors and apply global valuation standards required by the profession. These standards require, for
example, that all properties are physically inspected on an annual basis.

The 2016 report issued by Cushman & Wakefield and referred to by Viceroy in the Report does not include
any reservations or qualifications. The valuations were made under the assumption of best use of the
properties, in the context of the market. In this respect, the valuers used assumptions based on factors such as
market context, age of the asset and location. They may require a management assessment of specific
variables, but in most cases the valuers rely on self-assessments. The enquiries made by Cushman & Wakefield
were appropriate and sufficient given the purpose of the valuation. The individual valuation reports were also
reviewed by PwC, the Group's auditors.

       a decrease from 10% to 4% of the total assets, delivering on the planned redeployment of the listed

       decrease further to approximately 3% of total assets by year-end.

NEPI Rockcastle updates the valuation of its property portfolio in June and December each year. Fair value
is determined by external, independent professional valuers with appropriate and recognised qualifications,
and recent experience in the locations and category of properties being valued. Valuations for each property

& Poor's and Fitch), with Fitch recently reaffirming its rating.

strategy of converting the listed securities portfolio into direct property investments through acquisitions and
developments. With a high-quality asset base and operating platform, the Group is best positioned to remain
the leading real estate investor and operator in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The macroeconomic factors
combined with the retail specific dynamics of the region in which the Group operates to provide long-term
growth opportunities for the Company.""

CURRENT REDEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

The occupancy rate across the entire income-producing portfolio was 95.9% as of 30 September 2018.
Excluding the recent acquisitions and main assets under extension, details of which are set out below, the
occupancy rate was 97.3%.

   -   Shopping City Sibiu (Romania) is undergoing extensive redevelopment, optimizing and improving
       tenant mix and redesigning common areas and retail units to improve the accessibility and sightlines.
       In addition, a 1,800m2 cinema will be added, meeting customer demand and significantly improving
       the entertainment offering, positioning Shopping City Sibiu as the premier mall in the region;

   -   Paradise Centre's (Bulgaria) first retail level is being fully-refurbished, creating additional retail units
       and reconfiguring the former hypermarket space. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be
       inaugurated in March 2019, and will add a large supermarket together with 25 additional shops, which
       will further improve the already dominant tenant mix;

   -   Arena Centar (Croatia) is currently undergoing extensive upgrade and expansion works, aimed at
       improving layout and circulation, as well as the overall customer experience. These extensive works
       are scheduled in three phases, of which the first two phases are almost completed, with 37 tenants
       involved in the upgrade and two major anchors relocated;
   -   Forum Liberec Shopping Centre (Czech Republic) is under redevelopment to simplify vertical
       communication and redesign ceilings and lights; there will also be new relaxing areas, restrooms and
       a completely renovated food court. The tenant mix will be enriched with new international tenants,
       while a number of existing tenants will also upgrade their areas in line with the new concept;

UPDATE ON THE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS PIPELINE

ACQUISITION OF THE CONTROLLING STAKE IN MAMMUT SHOPPING CENTRE
(HUNGARY, 11 SEPTEMBER 2018)

In September 2018, the Group announced the acquisition of the controlling stake in Mammut Shopping Centre,
its second Hungarian property, making NEPI Rockcastle the largest shopping centre owner in Budapest,
Hungary's capital city and economic centre. With over 1.7 million inhabitants, Budapest is the most populous
and wealthiest city in the country. It has a unique location, that benefits from its proximity to Vienna (250km)
and Bratislava (200km), and together the three cities create one of the leading clusters of cross-border activity
in the CEE. The city boasts high-quality infrastructure and is an attractive destination for international
companies.

Mammut is one of Budapest's largest and most successful shopping and entertainment destinations. It is
located in Kalman Square, the busiest interchange on the Buda side of the city, and benefits from an annual
footfall of 15.6 million. This provides an outstanding opportunity to enhance leisure and shopping facilities in
a city that has one of the lowest retail supply densities amongst CEE capitals.

Key facts

   -   Total Gross Leasable Area (""GLA""): 61,300m2, split across two buildings; NEPI Rockcastle owns
       56,400m2 GLA.
   -   Tenants include: Burger King, CCC, Cinema Pink, Deichmann, Hervis, H&M, Interspar, KFC, Libri,
       Media Markt, New Yorker and Reserved.

       bowling alley, children's playground and a selection of restaurants.

PLATAN SHOPPING CENTRE EXTENSION (POLAND, 26 OCTOBER 2018)

After 15 months of extensive works, the extension of Platan Shopping Centre opened in October 2018. The
project involved the redevelopment of the existing shopping centre, including its façade, common area and
parking, and increasing GLA by over 14,000m2. The extension sees Platan upgraded to a fourth generation,
upscale shopping centre.

The redevelopment and extension introduced previously missing functions, such as a food court, fitness centre,
cinema and intelligent parking, rightsized CCC and Reserved, and added new brands such as Carry, Cropp,
Home & You, House, Kids Play, KIK, Martes Sport, Maxi Zoo, Neonet, Pepco, Super-pharm and TEDi (new
to Poland). The negotiations for leasing the remaining units are advanced and the centre is over 95% let.

The development and asset management teams ensured that the shopping centre remained fully operational
throughout the entire period of the redevelopment and extension works.
PROMENADA NOVI SAD (SERBIA, 15 NOVEMBER 2018)

NEPI Rockcastle recently opened its first greenfield development in Serbia, Promenada Novi Sad. This is
Serbia's largest mall, and is located in the country's second largest city, which has a population of
approximately 320,000 inhabitants. Novi Sad has a regional university centre and is popular with tech
companies. It is also 2019's European Youth Capital, was named Lonely Planet's third best city to visit in
2019 and, in 2021, will be the first non-European Union city to be European Capital of Culture.

Promenada has four levels, took 16 months to build, and was delivered on time. It is situated in a prime location
in the city centre, at the crossing of two main boulevards, adjacent to a sports complex and high-density
residential areas. The architectural design was selected through an international competition. The shopping
centre has a unique façade lighting system, utilising state-of-the-art technology.

Promenada has raised the city's retail offering standard: it has over 160 tenants, including upmarket,
international brands, and introduced LPP brands such as Cropp, House and Mohito to Serbia. It also boasts an
entire lifestyle floor with 14 restaurants, an eight-screen Cineplexx (including Serbia's first MX4D studio), a
play area that has a laser tag and laser maze, as well as over 800m2 of gym and fitness facilities.

The centre also has two spacious terraces, one with views of the historic Petrovaradin Fortress, which is now
an arts centre and home to the EXIT festival. Promenada Novi Sad's outdoor basketball courts integrate
seamlessly into the surrounding Vojvodina Sports and Recreation Center and the Karadjordje Stadium.

SATU MARE SHOPPING CENTRE (ROMANIA, DECEMBER 2018)

NEPI Rockcastle is currently developing Satu Mare Shopping Centre, the only modern retail and
entertainment destination in Satu Mare, scheduled to open on 5 December 2018.

Satu Mare, located in north-west Romania, near the Hungarian border, has 123,000 inhabitants, with 288,000
people within 45-minute drive from the development.

centre will feature an outdoor terrace of over 1,000m2, overlooking Somes River, which will be connected to
the historical city center by a pedestrian bridge.

The terrace will have three outdoor dining areas with selected regional restaurants. With a welcoming design
that includes an integrated green area, the terrace will complement the entertainment offering and is expected
to become the main social hub of the region.

The mall will have a diverse mix of tenants, including regional and international fashion and beauty brands as
well as a food court, coffee shops and the city's first cinema operated by Cineplexx.
Key facts:

-   Tenants include: CCC, Deichmann, Douglas, dm, Hervis, Intersport, KFC, LC Waikiki, New Yorker, Orsay,
    Reserved, Samsonite, Tom Tailor and Smyk

OUTLOOK

The Company reaffirms its guidance included in its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the
six months ended 30 June 2018, that distributable earnings per share for the year ending 31 December 2018
are expected to be approximately 10% higher than the 2017 distribution of 48.26 euro cents per share. This
guidance remains based on the assumptions that a stable macroeconomic environment prevails, no major
corporate failures occur and that planned developments remain on schedule. This guidance has not been
audited or reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of the Board.

UPDATED WHISTLEBLOWING PORTAL


Shareholders are referred to the announcement of 1 October 2018 regarding the actions taken by the special board sub-
committee (the ""sub-committee"").

With effect from 09 November 2018, updated and improved Whistleblower facilities are available at
http://nepirockcastle.com/whistleblowing-portal/, incorporating the following additional items while maintaining the
previously existing online facility:

    1. A Safe Call* administered hotline service for those seeking to make a whistleblowing report by phone (phone
       number available on the company's website under the ""About us > Corporate Governance > Whistleblowing
       Policy"" section) with a dedicated trained operator.
    2. All whistleblowing reports placed via the existing online portal shall also be directed to: (i) a Safe Call e-mail
       address and (ii) a dedicated sub-committee e-mail address. Thus, the reports will be received by Safe Call and
       by the sub-committee directly, in addition to the current contacts (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
       Financial Officer and Compliance Officer).

In order to ensure that the sub-committee is properly informed on all whistleblowing reports, Safe Call will provide the
sub-committee on a weekly basis with the reports received, filtered and categorized as relating either to (i) trading in
NEPI Rockcastle shares, (ii) the Market Abuse Regulation, (iii) book build processes, (iv) preferential treatment of
shareholders, (v) independence of directors, or, if not falling in any of these categories, (vi) not related to the above
specific matters.

*Safe Call (www.safecall.co.uk) is a leading independent worldwide 24/7 provider of ethics telephone hotline and
online reporting system, that is focused on safely allowing transparency between companies and their stakeholders. All
Safe Call's call handlers are based in the UK and represent skilled professional individuals (former police officers) who
own the necessary skills and knowledge required to correctly engage with callers.

Shareholders, employees, and other interested parties are invited and encouraged to use the updated Whistleblowing
Portal facilities to report serious concerns to be addressed by the company and/or the sub-committee, substantiate any
concerns, or otherwise to make any related suggestions. All reports received via this channel, or by any member of the
sub-committee directly, will be appropriately analyzed by the sub-committee. The sub-committee will update
shareholders on the status of whistleblowing activities and its decision on any raised and substantiated matters.

Shareholders are also advised that, up to date, no reports have been made via the existing Whistleblowing Portal
regarding any matter raised in the letter received on 23 August 2018 or any connected matters.

FITCH AFFIRMS NEPI ROCKCASTLE'S BBB LONG-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATING


Fitch Ratings (""Fitch"") has affirmed NEPI Rockcastle's Long-Term Corporate Credit Rating and senior unsecured
rating at 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook.

The ratings reflect the group's expanding retail portfolio of dominant shopping centres in large and medium-sized
urban conglomerations across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).

Fitch underlines that, despite rapid growth, the Company has maintained a conservative financial profile with
good liquidity and a high degree of financial flexibility. In addition, Fitch emphasizes that the group's expansion
is steadily reducing asset concentration and continues to increase geographic diversification into higher-rated
countries, which positively impacts on its credit rating assessment.

The Stable Outlook reflects the rating agency's expectations that NEPI Rockcastle will continue its expansion
and effectively integrate the properties acquired into the existing portfolio, while maintaining its strong
operational and financial profile.

The report issued by Fitch is available on the Company's website, http://nepirockcastle.com/wp-

BOARD SUB-COMMITTEE CALL FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT DATED 31 AUGUST 2018


Shareholders are referred to the announcement of 31 August 2018 regarding the special board sub-committee
(the ""sub-committee"") established to address a letter received by the Company on 23 August 2018 from ten
South African institutional investors requesting an independent investigation of certain matters raised as
""allegations made against the Company, its directors and closely associated parties"" (the ""letter""). The sub-
committee comprises Robert Emslie (Chairman of the Board), Andre van der Veer (Chairman of the Audit
Committee), Alex Morar (Chief Executive Officer) and Mirela Covasa (Chief Financial Officer).

On 28 September 2018, the sub-committee engaged with representatives of signatories of the letter who
accepted the invitation, via a pre-arranged conference call. The Company's approach to the conference call
was to ask the participants for clarification of any specific issues and concerns relating to NEPI Rockcastle,
and to discuss and respond to these openly and fully. In line with the Company's commitment to complete
transparency towards its shareholders, an unedited recording of the conference call is available on the NEPI
Rockcastle website at http://nepirockcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180928call.mp3.

The sub-committee welcomes the dialogue with investors and will continue to engage with them regarding
any issues or concerns and the proposals raised by the signatories to the letter.

At this stage, the sub-committee does not believe it has been presented with information or queries regarding
the activities of NEPI Rockcastle to form a basis for a clear scope of investigation. It should be noted that
other shareholders have communicated to the sub-committee that they do not share the concerns and views as
to the recommended course of action included in the letter. However, in response to the letter, the Company
makes the following undertakings:
    -   In respect of the shareholders' request for a whistleblowing line, the Company reminds shareholders
        that it established a whistleblowing policy in July 2017 which has been available since then at
        http://nepirockcastle.com/about-us/corporate-governance/whistleblowing-policy/. Shareholders may
        use this communication channel to substantiate any concerns. To date, no submissions have been made
        via the whistleblowing line regarding any related topics. The Company is planning to improve the
        process by rerouting the whistleblowing line to an independent professional firm.
    -   The Company will appropriately investigate all submissions received via the whistleblowing line and
        continue to communicate openly and transparently in this regard;
    -   The Company will continue to engage in dialogue with its investors and invites any that have specific
        concerns or suggestions to present them either through the whistleblowing line or to any member of
        the sub-committee.

The Company acknowledges shareholders' concerns regarding dealings in its shares. While the Company
cannot investigate this matter because it does not have access to third party trading information, it recognises
that this is a matter under the Financial Services Conduct Authority's (FSCA) mandate. The Company
continues to fully support and facilitate the FSCA's review process into the trading of its shares, with a view
to reaching a prompt resolution.

The Company has recently contacted the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, which has informed that it is not
currently investigating any specific matter in relation to NEPI Rockcastle.
Robert Emslie, the Chairman of the sub-committee and of the Board, noted: ""We acknowledged shareholders'
request for communication, and had an open and fruitful discussion, which we consider to have addressed in
detail the concerns raised. While we are open to any specific and substantiated requests, any future actions by
the Company will be limited to NEPI Rockcastle, independent of the other companies with which shareholders
may be concerned.""

Alex Morar, CEO, mentioned: ""We are confident of the adequacy of our corporate governance processes and
remain engaged in a transparent interaction with all our stakeholders. The management team continues to
focus on operations and delivering value to our shareholders. Further to the excellent operational results
achieved in the first half of 2018, along with the four acquisitions concluded during the year, the two greenfield
developments and one extension on track to open this year, the Company is best placed to perform among its
peers.""

ACQUISITION OF THE CONTROLLING STAKE IN MAMMUT SHOPPING CENTRE IN BUDAPEST, HUNGARY


1.    INTRODUCTION

      NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce the acquisition of 100% of Mammut 2 and 81% of
      Mammut 1 (""the Project""), which jointly form the Mammut shopping centre in Budapest, Hungary
      (""Mammut"" or ""the Shopping Centre"").

2.    RATIONALE

      Mammut is one of the largest and most successful shopping and entertainment destinations in
      Budapest. It is prominently located at Kalman Square, the busiest interchange hub in the Buda side
      of the city, and benefits from a strong annual footfall of 15.6 million people. The Shopping Centre
      offers 61,300 m2 of total gross lettable area (""GLA"") in two buildings connected via a double-level
      pedestrian bridge.

      With a GLA of 56,400 m2 (weighted for control), the Project is 89% let, including key anchors such
      as Cinema Pink, Hervis, H&M, Interspar, Media Markt and Reserved, as well as a New Yorker
      which is opening in November 2018. The existing vacant space is primarily due to intense asset
      management initiatives, a redevelopment of existing units that is currently being undertaken, and
      the process of acquiring additional retail condominium units in Mammut 1, all of which are
      expected to significantly improve the net operating income of the Project once completed.

      The weighted average rental of the Project is EUR 22.1/m2 per month, based on rent rolls as at the
      effective date of the acquisition. It has a current net operating income of EUR 14.6 million per
      annum, excluding potential income from vacancies.

      Budapest is inhabited by 1.75 million people and is the most populous city in Hungary and one of
      the largest in Central and Eastern Europe. Due to its capital status and size, it is the primary centre
      of economic activity in Hungary and the country's main office destination. Budapest also benefits
      from its close proximity to Vienna (250km) and Bratislava (200km).

      The acquisition of the Project positions NEPI Rockcastle as the largest shopping centre owner in
      Budapest, following last year's purchase of Arena Plaza located on the opposite side of the city
      centre. The Company's strengthened position in the city and its retail expertise allows for the
      development of an ambitious asset management plan for Mammut.

3.   TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION

     3.1.   The acquisition

            On 11 September 2018, NE Property Cooperative U.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NEPI
            Rockcastle, entered into an agreement (the ""agreement"") to acquire 100% of the shares in
            Mammut Zrt, Tummam Kft and Mammut Management Kft (the ""acquisition entities"") from
            MANTAPRO Investments Limited, LSREF3 TUMMAM Holdings sarl and LSREF3
            Mammut Dutch BV (together, the ""sellers"") (the ""acquisition""). The acquisition entities
            together own 100% of Mammut 1 and 81% of Mammut 2, respectively. The acquisition was
            effective on 11 September 2018 (the ""effective date"") and there are no outstanding
            conditions precedent.

     3.2.   Purchase price and funding

            The aggregate net purchase price for the acquisition is EUR 254 million, which was paid to
            the sellers in cash, funded by existing liquidity resources and debt facilities. The value of the
            net assets that are the subject of the acquisition, as determined by the directors of NEPI
            Rockcastle, is EUR 254 million.

            The purchase price of the Project is considered to be its fair market value as at the effective
            date, as determined by the directors of NEPI Rockcastle. The directors of NEPI Rockcastle
            are not independent and are not registered as professional valuers or as professional associate
            valuers in terms of the South African Property Valuers Professional Act, No 47 of 2000.

     3.3.   Material terms

            The agreement contains warranties typically associated with transactions of this nature.

            The acquisition entities will become subsidiaries of NEPI Rockcastle. The Company will
            ensure that there are no provisions in the constitutional documents of either of the acquisition
            entities that will frustrate or relieve NEPI Rockcastle from compliance with the JSE Listings
            Requirements.

        Profit available for distribution                                           4,326                14,687

      The forecast incorporates the following material assumptions in respect of revenue and expenses for the acquisition
      entities, post the effective date:
      1. The forecast is based on information derived from the management accounts, budgets, and rental contracts
         provided by the sellers and reviewed by the Company.
      2. Rental income is derived from the rental agreements in place provided to the Company by the Sellers.
      3. The effects of straight lining rental income are negligible and are accordingly not provided for.
      4. Contracted revenue is based on existing lease agreements including stipulated increases, all of which are valid
         and enforceable.
      5. Leases expiring during the forecast period have been forecast on a lease-by-lease basis, and have been assumed
         to renew at current market rates unless the lessee has indicated its intention to terminate the lease. The near-
         contracted portion is not material.
      6. Property operating expenditure has been forecast by the property manager on a line-by-line basis based on
         management's review of historical expenditure, where available, and discussion with the property manager.
      7. Finance costs have not been forecasted at property level as the acquisition has been funded by the Company's
         existing liquidity resources and debt facilities.
      8. No fair value adjustment is recognised.
      9. There will be no unforeseen economic factors that will affect the lessee's ability to meet their commitments in
         terms of existing lease agreements.

5.    CATEGORISATION OF THE ACQUISITION

      The acquisition is classified as a category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements
      and is accordingly not subject to approval by shareholders.

WRITTEN REQUEST FOR INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION


The board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (the ""board"") has received a letter from ten South African institutional
investors, delivered via the office of Coronation Fund Managers on 23 August 2018, requesting an independent
investigation of all allegations made against the Company, its directors and closely associated parties (the ""letter""). The
Company has not yet been able to verify the shareholding of each of the signatories of the letter in NEPI Rockcastle.

While the Company is not aware of any specific allegations related to the business, and is satisfied with the integrity of
its business practices, the board regards the letter and its requests in a serious light and has accordingly established a
special board sub-committee (the ""sub-committee"") to address the matter. The members of the sub-committee are the
chair of the board (Robert Emslie), the chair of the audit committee (Andre van der Veer), the chief executive officer
(Alex Morar) and the chief financial officer (Mirela Covasa).

The sub-committee has been mandated by the board to, independently of the other three companies to which the
letter is addressed:
     - engage with those signatories of the letter who are shareholders in the Company (i) to clarify the specific issues
       or concerns that they may have pertaining to NEPI Rockcastle and (ii) to determine if and how such shareholders
       would like the Company to investigate these matters;
     - engage with significant shareholders that are not signatories of the letter to obtain their views on the content and
       requests set out therein and ascertain whether they support the requested investigation; and
     - determine the scope and costs of any independent investigation and the impact thereof on the shareholders of
       the Company.

Shareholders are further advised that the Company is aware that the Financial Services Conduct Authority in South
Africa (“FSCA”) is currently investigating possible prohibited trading practices in respect of NEPI Rockcastle shares
traded on the JSE. Although not an investigation into the business affairs of the Company, NEPI Rockcastle has and
will continue to co-operate fully with the FSCA investigation. The sub-committee has been mandated by the board as
far as possible to ascertain the status of the FSCA investigation.

Shareholders will be kept informed about the progress of the sub-committee's work in due course.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

All financial information below is based on IFRS (and excludes joint ventures).

DIRECTORS' COMMENTARY
In the first half of 2018, NEPI Rockcastle continued to focus on consolidating the Group's
operations across nine Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, through pro-active management,  
refurbishment and extension of owned properties, as well as greenfield development and selective 
acquisition of high quality assets.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

-    Portfolio valued at EUR5.3 billion, compared to EUR4.9 billion at the end of 2017, with retail
     properties delivering like-for-like growth in net rental income of 4.1% compared to the six
     months ended 30 June 2017.

-    Three dominant centres were acquired, one of which provided entry into the attractive
     Lithuanian market.

-    Major new centres in Serbia and Romania on track to open in the second half of 2018.

-    Direct property portfolio delivered like-for-like tenants' turnover increase of 7.7%, with
     EPRA vacancy rate of 3.8% and a collection rate of 99.9%.

-    Net listed securities portfolio represents 6.3% of total assets, down from 10% as at
     31 December 2017, in line with previously announced strategy.

-    Strong balance sheet: loan-to-value ratio of 28% below the Group's target of 35% and
     conservative in comparison to real-estate peers in Europe.

-    Investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies (Moody's,
     Standard & Poor's and Fitch).

-    Distributable earnings per share for the first half of 2018 of 26.49 euro cents, 12.9% higher
     than the combined distribution of New Europe Property Investments plc (NEPI) and
     Rockcastle Global Real Estate Company Limited (Rockcastle) for the six-month period
     ended 30 June 2017. This increase is due to the effect of acquisitions and developments 
     finalised in 2017 being concentrated in the second half of the year.

-    EPRA NAV per share reached EUR7.14,6% higher than the combined NEPI and Rockcastle
     EPRA NAV per share of EUR6.74 as at 30 June 2017.

NEPI Rockcastle delivered strong operational performance in H1 and we continue to implement our 
strategy as CEE's premier owner and operator of shopping centres"", said Alex Morar, CEO.

""During the first half of the year we have consolidated our portfolio in existing markets through
further acquisitions of high-quality retail properties and asset management initiatives, while
expanding into the affluent Baltic states with our first deal in Lithuania. With our focus on
dominant retail assets in the high-growth markets of the CEE region, we continue to reinforce our
standing as a partner of choice for both international and regional retailers. We are confident
that NEPI Rockcastle is well placed to maintain its leading position in our markets, and to
continue to create value for its shareholders.""

Leasing activity was strong in the first half of 2018, with retailers seeking to expand into
CEE due to increased consumption across the region. The Group consolidated its position as
strategic partner for major retailers targeting the CEE countries, and tenant relationships are
managed at Group level with a focus on cross-country collaboration. The Group benefits from
exposure to a large number of tenants and retail concepts and offers a wide regional platform
for their expansion.

During H1 2018 the Group signed 360 new lease agreements covering over 107,000m2 of GLA,
of which 242 leases (54,000m2) for units located in existing shopping centres
(excluding extensions of lease agreements) and 118 leases (53,000m2 GLA) in relation to projects 
under development.

NEPI Rockcastle has made three acquisitions since December 2017 for a total consideration
of EUR311 million, at a weighted average yield of 7.2%. The acquisitions fit the Group's strategy
of investing in dominant, centrally located assets with significant growth potential. These
acquisitions include Ozas Shopping and Entertainment Centre in Vilnius, the Company's first
mall in Lithuania, a high-growth investment-grade country. The other two acquisitions
consolidated the Group's leading positions in Slovakia (Galeria Mlyny) and Poland (Aura
Centrum). Details of the property acquisitions completed during the period are provided below.
The location and effective date are included in brackets. Population figures are estimates.

Ozas Shopping and Entertainment Centre (Vilnius, Lithuania - 31 May 2018)
Ozas is a 62,300m2 GLA modern shopping centre with a strong fashion and entertainment-
oriented tenant mix, benefitting from an excellent location in Vilnius. The top five tenants by
rented area are Maxima, H&M, Zara, Multikino and Peek&Cloppenburg.

Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania, has a population of 574,000 residents, with 432,000
inhabitants within a 15-minute drive from Ozas. The acquisition of Ozas marked the Group's entry
point into the Baltic region, one of the most developed areas in CEE with an affluent and highly
educated population.

The expansion into the Baltics further enhances the geographic diversification of the Group,
consolidating NEPI Rockcastle's market position in CEE and its ability to leverage its
best-in-class operating platform.

Galeria Mlyny Shopping Centre (Nitra, Slovakia - 31 May 2018)
With a GLA of over 33,200m2, Galeria Mlyny is the largest and most central shopping and
entertainment destination in Nitra, Slovakia. Footfall exceeded 9 million in the last year. The top
five tenants by rented area are H&M, Billa, Mlyny Cinemas, C&A and New Yorker.

The city is inhabited by approximately 79,000 people and is the capital of the Nitra region,
populated by over 689,000 people. It is an important university and industrial centre.
Approximately 356,000 inhabitants are within a 30-minute drive from the shopping centre.

The acquisition of Galeria Mlyny strengthens the Company's competitive position in Slovakia,
NEPI Rockcastle becoming the largest retail landlord in the country. The Group envisages several
asset management initiatives, including enhancements to the tenant mix and improvements
to common areas. Although the transaction was completed in July 2018, and thus it is not
reflected in the results for the six months ended 30 June 2018, the economic effective date of
the acquisition was 31 May 2018.

Aura Centrum (Olsztyn, Poland - 30 May 2018)
Aura Centrum is a prominent shopping and entertainment destination in the heart of Olsztyn city
centre, with 25,400m2 GLA. The shopping centre attracts 5.5 million people on an annual
basis. The top five tenants by rented area are Kino Helios, H&M, Carrefour, Reserved and
New Yorker.

Olsztyn is located in north-eastern Poland and is the capital of the Warmian-Masurian province.
The city has 173,000 inhabitants, whilst the province's population is over 1.4 million people. It
is a popular tourist destination due to its rich history and picturesque medieval old town and is
considered one of the best places in Poland to live and work. The shopping centre is within a
15-minute drive for over 180,000 inhabitants.

The acquisition of Aura Centrum creates regional synergies for NEPI Rockcastle, which also owns
Galeria Warminska, the dominant shopping centre in Olsztyn. Consolidation of these properties
allows for a more bespoke positioning of the two centres and a tailoring of the offering to their
respective customers in the regional catchment area.

Serenada and Krokus Shopping Centres (Krakow, Poland)
NEPI Rockcastle entered into an agreement in October 2017 to acquire Serenada and Krokus
Shopping Centres, which will be effective subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions precedent, which were expected to occur in Q3 2018. The timelines relating to the
zoning condition precedent have shifted and the transaction is now expected to conclude
in Q4 2018.

The shopping centres have a current GLA of 68,900m2 and the envisaged extension will result
in a single integrated shopping centre with a GLA of over 100,000m2 with a planned completion
date in 2021.

The acquisition consolidates the Group's position as one of the largest retail landlords in Poland.
Krakow, Poland's second largest city, has a population of 767,000 residents, with 336,000
inhabitants within a 15-minute drive of the two shopping centres.

DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

The Group is one of the most active developers in CEE, specializing in developments of large
dominant shopping malls. The development pipeline includes the largest retail schemes to be
opened this year in Serbia (Novi Sad) and Romania (Satu Mare) and several other greenfield and
brownfield projects.

The Group invests strategically in developments that strengthen the property portfolio and
contribute to growth in distributable earnings per share. NEPI Rockcastle has a development
pipeline of over EUR1.3 billion (including redevelopments and extensions, estimated at cost), of
which EUR259 million were spent by 30 June 2018.

A key focus of the Group is to redevelop and extend existing cash generative assets, for which
there is retailer and consumer demand and which therefore carry a lower development risk.

Size and opening dates below are estimates dependent on various external factors.

Promenada Novi Sad (Serbia)
The project is the largest retail development in Serbia outside of Belgrade and will become one
of the landmark shopping centres in the country. It is located in the inner city centre of Novi
Sad, the second largest city in Serbia, with 319,000 inhabitants. The shopping mall's first phase
of 48,900m2 GLA is scheduled to open for trading in November 2018, a record time given the
project's size and complexity.

Tenant demand is very strong with various international brands joining the scheme, such as
Armani Exchange, Calvin Klein, Cineplexx, LC Waikiki, LPP (Cropp, House, Mohito, Reserved,
Sinsay), New Yorker and Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius,
Zara Home).

Satu Mare Shopping City (Romania)
The Group is working towards opening the only modern shopping and entertainment destination
in Satu Mare in December 2018. Satu Mare has a population of 123,000 inhabitants, with 182,000
people living within 30-minute drive of Satu Mare Shopping City. It is located in the north-west of
Romania near the border with Hungary. The centre will have 29,100m2 GLA (as a first phase) and
will include tenants such as Carrefour, CCC, Cineplexx, Deichmann, Douglas, Hervis, Intersport,
KFC, LC Waikiki, New Yorker, Orsay, Reserved and Smyk.

Platan Shopping Centre extension (Poland)
Extension and refurbishment works will increase the shopping centre's GLA to 36,700m2 and
include the construction of a multi-level car park. The extension of 14,000m2 GLA is scheduled to
open in October 2018. The centre is located in the city of Zabrze which has 175,000 inhabitants.
Several international brands have been signed, including Cropp, House, KIK, Pepco,
Planet Cinema, Reserved and Smyk.

Solaris Shopping Centre extension (Poland)
Works for the 9,000m2 GLA extension, including the development of a 300 bay multi-level
basement car park and a new town square in front of the centre's main entrance, are progressing.
The extension is scheduled to be completed in Q1 2019. The centre, located in the city of Opole,
which has 128,000 inhabitants, will have a total GLA of over 26,000m2 after the extension.

Festival Sibiu (Romania)
Works have started on a 42,200m2 GLA development of Festival mall, the second NEPI
Rockcastle asset in Sibiu which will complement the Group's other retail property in the city
(Shopping City Sibiu). Festival has an excellent location within walking distance from both Sibiu's
historical city centre and the main train station.

Sibiu has a population of 170,000 residents and is one of the most vibrant economic centres in
Romania. The city has a high rate of foreign investments, is an important university centre and is
visited by a large number of tourists (400,000 in 2017).

Several tenants have been signed, including: CineGold, Inditex (Zara, Bershka, Massimo Dutti,
Oysho, Pull & Bear, Stradivarius), Kaufland (their first unit in a shopping mall in Romania) and
New Yorker. Opening is planned for the end of 2019. Together with Shopping City Sibiu, Festival
will give the Group a unique position in one of Romania's most dynamic cities.

Aurora Mall Buzau extension and refurbishment (Romania)
The necessary permits and approvals for the development of an extension of Aurora Mall in
Buzau, Romania, were obtained in August 2018. Following the extension and refurbishment,
the centre will have a GLA of 23,400m2 and will serve a catchment area of 250,000 inhabitants
within a 30-minute drive. The extension will include a new Cinema City multiplex with 6 screens
and a new food-court area with an exterior terrace. The development is expected to be finalised
in the first half of 2019.

Aurora Mall is the only modern shopping mall within a 70km radius and perfectly complements
the Group's presence in this region of Romania. The Group also has dominant properties in the
nearby cities of Ploiesti, Braila and Galati.

Shopping City Targu Mures (Romania)
Zoning has been obtained and permitting is underway for the construction of a 33,600m2
(phase I) GLA regional, new generation shopping centre in Targu Mures (140,000 inhabitants).
Targu Mures is a historical town in the heart of Transylvania, with a strong industrial base and an
important university centre. The Group's shopping centre will be the second to open in the city,
although its superior location and design is expected to make it dominant in the city
and its surroundings. Site preparation has started and construction is envisaged to commence
by the end of 2018. Tenant demand is strong and Carrefour has already signed a lease agreement
for 10,000m(2) GLA.

Plovdiv (Bulgaria)
During the first half of 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of a land plot of over 2.9 ha
in Plovdiv (the 2nd largest city in Bulgaria), adjacent to another recently acquired plot. NEPI
Rockcastle currently owns over 6.5 ha in the city and is planning a 59,500m2 GLA shopping mall.
Tenant interest is high and permitting efforts are ongoing with works targeted to commence in
the second quarter of 2019. The mall is estimated to become the dominant shopping centre in Plovdiv,
which is currently underserved by modern retail.

Arena Zagreb - retail park development (Croatia)
The Group will start developing a 8,000m2 GLA retail park adjacent to its shopping mall in
Zagreb, Croatia. Permitting for the development is ongoing. The retail park will bring additional
large-format tenants to the mall, creating a complete offering that will contribute to making
Arena the premier retail destination in Zagreb. Several tenants have already shown interest in the
project. It is expected that the works will be finalised by the end of Q1 2019.

Focus Mall Zielona Gora (Poland)
The Group has commenced construction of multilevel parking, which is the first phase of the
redevelopment and extension of Focus Mall Zielona Gora. Once completed, construction of the
second phase, a 15,000m2 GLA extension of the mall will commence. The extension is scheduled
to open in Q1 2020.

Other extensions
The Group is undertaking other extensions of existing properties in Poland (e.g. Pogoria Dabrowa
Gornicza) and Romania (e.g. Sighisoara) that will generate additional areas of up to 1,000m2 GLA
at each project.

VALUATION

NEPI Rockcastle updates the valuation of its property portfolio twice a year. Fair value is
determined by external, independent professional valuers with appropriate and recognised
qualifications, and recent experience in the locations and category of properties being
valued. Valuations for each property in all categories (Investment property in use, Investment
property held for sale and Land held for developments), as at 30 June 2018 were performed by
Cushman&Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Following the merger of NEPI and Rockcastle in July 2017, Mr. Alex Morar and Mr. Spiro Noussis
were appointed as joint Chief Executive Officers of NEPI Rockcastle. The joint CEOs have since worked 
together to implement the Company's strategy. As announced on 12 June 2018, Mr. Morar has been appointed 
as the sole Chief Executive Officer of NEPI Rockcastle, and will, in this capacity, further integrate the 
business of the Group. To facilitate the Group's transition to a sole-CEO structure, Mr. Noussis will remain 
as an executive director of the Group until December 2018, after which he will pursue other opportunities.

As announced on 12 July 2018, Mr. Dan Pascariu retired from his position as non-executive
director and Chairman with effect from 28 August 2018. The Board has appointed Mr. Robert
Reinhardt Emslie as the new independent non-executive Chairman of the Company.

Mr. Michael Mills will also be retiring from his professional activity. The Group warmly thanks Mr.
Pascariu and Mr. Mills for their substantial contribution to the Company since the inception of
NEPI in 2007.

Mr. Nick Matulovich did not offer himself for re-election at the Company's annual general meeting
held on 28 August 2018 (AGM). Mr. Matulovich will work with the Group until February 2019 to
ensure a smooth transition in his areas of responsibility. The Company thanks Mr. Matulovich for 
his contribution as Executive Director. 

All other existing Board members were re-elected at the AGM, including Mr. Sipho Vuso Majija,
who was appointed by the Board as a non-independent non-executive director of the Group with
effect from 6 June 2018. Mr. Majija has 13 years' experience in property and asset management,
and is an executive director of Fortress, NEPI Rockcastle's largest shareholder.

Mr. George Aase, who was recommended for appointment by the Board, was also appointed as
a director at the AGM. Mr. Aase has extensive experience in leadership roles, with core specialties
including corporate finance, capital markets, international finance and controlling and more than
12 years of experience in the real estate sector.

HALF-YEAR DISTRIBUTION

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 26.49 euro cents per share for the first half of
2018, which will be paid in cash in September 2018. An announcement in this respect will be
issued on the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam
in due course.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

During the year, the Group extended its EUR250 million unsecured revolving facilities from ING,
Societe Generale and Garanti Bank for a period of three years.

NEPI Rockcastle benefits from a diversified funding base. The Company's loan-to-value (interest
bearing debt less cash divided by investment property and net listed securities) was 28%, below
the gearing ratio target of 35%.

The weighted average interest rate, including hedging costs, was 2.3% during the six month
period ended 30 June 2018. 45% of the Euribor-linked debt was hedged with interest rate caps
and 55% with interest rate swaps.

The Group had a strong liquidity profile at 30 June 2018, with over EUR120 million in cash, EUR300
million in available unsecured revolving facilities and EUR382 million net available in the listed 
security portfolio.

Depending on market conditions, the Group may initiate a repurchase of issued bonds or shares
during the following reporting periods.

PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE

The Group pursues a sizeable development and acquisition pipeline, while maintaining a key
focus on a strong liquidity profile and balance sheet. With a quality asset base and operating
platform, the Group is best positioned to remain the leading CEE real estate investor.

Distributable earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2018 are expected to be
approximately 10% higher than the 2017 distribution of 48.26 euro cents per share. 
This guidance remains based on the assumptionsthat a stable macroeconomic environment prevails, 
no major corporate failures occur and that planned developments and acquisitions remain on schedule.

This forecast has not been audited or reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the
responsibility of the Board.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
In accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, the merger between NEPI and Rockcastle was classified as a purchase of Rockcastle by NEPI, with 
NEPI Rockcastle being assessed in substance as a continuation of NEPI. Consequently, in these consolidated financial statements and in accordance 
with IFRS, NEPI Rockcastle presents the results of the former NEPI Group before the merger date (11 July 2017), and the results of the combined Group 
from the merger date onwards. The comparatives are the audited consolidated financial results of NEPI Rockcastle for the year ended 31 December 2017 
and the unaudited consolidated financial results of NEPI for the six months ended 30 June 2017. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial results
for the six months ended 30 June 2018 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for interim 
reports. These require interim reports to be prepared in accordance with, and containing the information required by IAS 34: Interim Financial 
Reporting, as well as the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as 
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council. The accounting policies 
which have been applied are consistent with those used in the preparation of the Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
These financial results have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors.

The listed securities portfolio is measured at fair value being the quoted closing price at the reporting date and is categorized as a Level 1 
investment, according to IFRS 13 - Fair value measurement. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these 
investments are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income as incurred. The listed securities portfolio includes physical shares with a fair value of EUR300.1 million presented as 
Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The equity derivative collateral 
of EUR76.8 million represents the cash held at Prime Brokers and provides the Group with gross exposure to equity derivative swaps. The Group's equity 
derivatives swaps have a net fair value of EUR4.9 million from Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of EUR6.1 million and Financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss of EUR1.2 million. Within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Income from financial 
investments at fair value through profit or loss of EUR29.6 million includes the gross income from dividends that the Group earns on the gross exposure 
netted off with the interest expense on the gross liability. The Fair value and net result on sale of financial investments shows the change in fair 
value of the financial instruments as well as the net result on sales of such instruments.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS


The board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle (""the Board"") has recommended, subject to shareholder approval, the
appointment of Mr. George Aase as an independent non-executive director of the Company with effect from

membership of the Company's Audit Committee at the close of the upcoming annual general meeting.

Mr. George Aase is an experienced CFO in publicly traded real estate firms, technology companies and Fortune 100
U.S. multinational industrial firms. He is a highly strategic and business-oriented senior finance executive with extensive
experience in leadership roles. Mr. Aase's core specialties include corporate finance, capital markets, IPO transactions,
debt financing, international financial operations, international finance and controlling, and investor relations, with at
least 12 years' experience in the real estate sector. He has led the process of three major initial public offering projects
in London, Zurich and Frankfurt. Mr. Aase also possesses extensive financing and debt restructuring experience, and
has managed various portfolios connected with major acquisitions and underwriting. He has a strong financial
background in Central Eastern Europe countries, including Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.

Shareholders are further advised that Mr. Nick Matulovich, due to retire by rotation, has indicated that he will not offer

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS


Shareholders are advised that Mr. Dan Pascariu has notified the board of directors (""the Board"") that, after
serving as independent chairman of NEPI Rockcastle and its predecessor, New Europe Property Investments
plc (""NEPI""), for over 9 years, he intends to retire and not stand for re-election at the annual general meeting
of shareholders to be held on 28 August 2018 (""the AGM""). A revised notice of AGM will be issued in due
course.

Dan was appointed as the independent non-executive chairman of NEPI in 2009 and served in that capacity
until the merger of NEPI and Rockcastle Global Real Estate Company Limited in July 2017 (""the merger""),
when NEPI Rockcastle was formed. Following the merger, Dan continued as independent non-executive
chairman of NEPI Rockcastle.

The Board thanks Dan for his invaluable contribution to the boards of both NEPI and NEPI Rockcastle over
the years and, in particular, for his leadership in integrating the Board following the merger.

The Board has appointed Mr. Robert Reinhardt Emslie as the new independent non-executive chairman of the
Company, with effect from the date of the AGM.

Robert is a Chartered Accountant, with more than 30 years' experience in financial services and property
management. He held various positions within the ABSA Group during a period of 21 years, more recently as
Head of ABSA Corporate and Business Bank, Head of ABSA Africa and member of ABSA Group's
Executive Committee. He retired in 2009 and currently holds independent non-executive directorship
positions in a small number of private and public companies.

Robert was appointed as an independent non-executive director of NEPI in February 2016, and served as a
member of NEPI's Audit Committee and chairman of NEPI's Remuneration Committee. Following the
merger, Robert continued in these roles at NEPI Rockcastle and was also appointed as a member of the
Company's Investment Committee. The Board looks forward to Robert's continued contribution to the
Company in his new role.

Shareholders are further advised that the Nomination Committee has identified several candidates to replace
Mr. Michael Mills, independent non-executive director of the Company and Chairman of the Audit
Committee, who recently announced his intention to retire at the AGM. All candidates are European citizens
and have extensive business and property experience in Central and Eastern Europe. The Board expects to
finalise the appointment in the coming weeks. As required in terms of the Company's articles of association,
any additional appointments to the Board will hold office until the annual general meeting following their
appointment, at which time they shall be eligible for re-election.

The composition of the Board subcommittees will be revised once the appointment of the new chairman
becomes effective, having regard to the potential appointments of new directors.

ACQUISITION OF GALERIA MLYNY SHOPPING CENTRE IN NITRA, SLOVAKIA


NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that, on 21 June 2018, through its subsidiary NRP Shopping Centre Project Two
s.r.o., it has signed a binding agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in MLYNY, a.s., being the owner of Galeria Mlyny
shopping centre in the city of Nitra in Slovakia (""Galeria Mlyny"" or ""the Property"") from a group of local investors.

Galeria Mlyny is a shopping and entertainment mall in the city centre of Nitra with a gross lettable area (""GLA"") of
33,200 sqm. Opened in 2009, the Property was extended in 2015 with a new wing, which includes a five-screen multiplex
cinema. Galeria Mlyny is 98% let, including key anchors such as Billa supermarket, Bershka, C&A, CCC, Deichmann, Gant,
Geox, Guess, H&M, Humanic, Intersport, Lindex New Yorker, Orsay, Takko, Tommy Hilfiger and US Polo Assn.. The
Property is located in the heart of the city, on a main intersection and next to the university residential quarters, and benefits
from an annual footfall of 9 million people.

Galeria Mlyny is the main retail destination in Nitra, a city of 79,000 people in western Slovakia and the capital of the region
with the same name, populated by over 689,000 people. The city has an important regional function as the administrative and
educational centre of the county, with two universities enrolling over 24,000 students. The city's economy is expected to
benefit from a new automotive assembly plant which will open in the second part of 2018 and offer up to 2,800 jobs by 2020.

The acquisition of Galeria Mlyny will further strengthen NEPI Rockcastle's Slovakian portfolio, which previously consisted
of four shopping centres, making NEPI Rockcastle the largest retail landlord in the country.

The aggregate purchase price for Galeria Mlyny was EUR 121.8 million. The Property has a current net operating income of
EUR 8.4 million per annum, excluding potential income from vacancies.

FUNDING OF THE TRANSACTION, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

The acquisition of Galeria Mlyny will be funded by divestments from various listed security positions (consistent with
management's strategy of decreasing this exposure), supplemented by existing liquidity resources and debt facilities. The
transaction will be closed once the outstanding conditions precedent are fulfilled.

The purchase agreement for the transaction contains warranties typically associated with a transaction of this nature.

CATEGORISATION OF THE TRANSACTION

The acquisition of Galeria Mlyny is not categorisable in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

UPDATE ON ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS


ACQUISITION OF AURA SHOPPING CENTRE IN OLSZTYN, POLAND

NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that, on 30 May 2018, through its subsidiary Rockcastle Global Real
Estate Holdings B.V, it acquired 100% of the shares in Milvus sp. z o.o., which owns Aura shopping centre
in the city of Olsztyn in Poland (""Aura Centrum""), from Rockspring NPS European Alfa B.V.

Aura Centrum is a prominent shopping and entertainment destination in the heart of Olsztyn city centre with
a gross lettable area (""GLA"") of over 25,000m2 and annual footfall of 5.5 million people. Opened in 2005, the
centre was extended in 2009 and was further modernised in 2013 and 2016 to keep it at the forefront of modern
shopping. Aura Centrum is 94.2% let, including key anchors such as Carrefour, H&M, Helios cinema, LPP
brands (Reserved, Cropp, House, Mohito, Sinsay, Home & You), Martes Sport, New Yorker, RTV Euro AGD
and Smyk.

Olsztyn is a city of 173,000 people in north-eastern Poland and the capital of the Warminsko-Mazurskie
province, which has a population of over 1.4 million. Olsztyn has large regional importance as it is the only
major city in a c.100km radius. It hosts a wide range of administrative functions and is the only city in the
province with developed industry, including manufacturers that supply the automobile industry. With
35,000 students currently enrolled at the university in Olsztyn and entering the job market over time, the city
is also well-positioned to become a hub for high-tech industry in the region. Olsztyn has recently undergone
a major infrastructure upgrade, aimed at modernising the city and marked by the introduction of an 11km tram
line as well as a vast road and public infrastructure redevelopment.

The acquisition of Aura Centrum creates regional synergies for NEPI Rockcastle, which also owns Galeria
Warminska, the dominant shopping centre in Olsztyn. Consolidation of both properties in the Company's
portfolio allows for a more bespoke positioning of the two centres and a tailoring of the offering to their
respective customers in the regional catchment area, thereby creating a more diversified shopping and leisure
selection.

The aggregate purchase price for Aura Centrum was EUR 64.9 million. The centre has a current net operating
income of EUR 5.3 million per annum, excluding potential income from vacancies.

ACQUISITION OF OZAS SHOPPING AND ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE

NEPI Rockcastle is also pleased to announce that, on 31 May 2018, through its subsidiary UAB ""Ozas
property"", it acquired 100% of the shares in Uzdaroji akcine bendrove ""Ozantis"", which owns Ozas Shopping
and Entertainment Centre (""Ozas"") in Vilnius, Lithuania, from ARENA Zweite Verwaltungs GmbH.

Ozas is located in Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania, and has a GLA of over 60,000m2. The centre has a
strong fashion and entertainment-oriented tenant mix and attracts an affluent customer base with above
average disposable income. Ozas opened in 2009 and benefits from a simple and effective layout. It has a
wide retail offering, including numerous international tenants such as Adidas, Bershka, CCC, Deichmann,
Gant, H&M, Karen Millen, Jack&Jones, Lindex, LPP brands (Reserved, Cropp, House, Mohito, Sinsay),
Maxima, Multikino, New Yorker, Peek & Cloppenburg, Pierre Cardin, Salamander, Swarovski, Timberland,
Tommy Hilfiger, Top Shop, and Zara.

The catchment area of 432,000 inhabitants within 30 minutes includes residential districts and the main office
area of Vilnius. The centre is located at the crossing of two highly frequented north-south traffic axes,
benefitting from excellent transportation links within its catchment area.

With 574,000 inhabitants, Vilnius is the economic and cultural centre of Lithuania. Lithuania is an investment
grade country (A3/A/A-) that has recently shown robust development, with GDP growth of 2.3% in 2016 and
3.8% in 2017. According to European Commission forecast data, growth in GDP for 2018 and 2019 is
expected to be 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively.

The acquisition of Ozas marks the Company's entry point into the Baltic region, one of the most developed
areas in Central and Eastern Europe (""CEE"") with an affluent and highly educated population. It also
consolidates NEPI Rockcastle's market position in the CEE and its ability to leverage off its best-in-class
operating platform. A presence in the Baltics provides the Company's stakeholders with additional geographic
diversification and further strengthens the Company's offering as CEE's leading retail-focused landlord.

The aggregate purchase price for Ozas was EUR 124.6 million. The centre has a current net operating income
of EUR 8.8 million per annum, excluding potential income from vacancies.

FUNDING OF THE TRANSACTIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

The acquisitions of Aura Centrum and Ozas have been funded by divestments from various listed security
positions (consistent with management's strategy of decreasing this exposure), supplemented by existing
liquidity resources.

The purchase agreements for the acquisitions contain warranties typically associated with transactions of this
nature and there are no outstanding conditions precedent.

CATEGORISATION

The acquisitions of Aura Centrum and Ozas are not categorisable in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

OTHER UPDATES

The Company is well advanced with several transactions at various stages of the due diligence process. Further
announcements in this regard will be made in due course.

FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE DIVIDEND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the announcement published on SENS and Euronext Amsterdam on
20 February 2018 regarding the distribution of 24.80 euro cents per share declared by the board of directors for the six
months ended 31 December 2017.

Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand converted from
Euro at an exchange rate of EUR1.00: ZAR14.6217. Accordingly, the cash dividend of 24.80 euro cents per share will
be equal to ZAR3.62618 per share. Shareholders holding shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam will receive the dividend
in euros.

Dividend tax (and therefore the information provided in this paragraph) is only of direct application to shareholders
holding shares traded on the JSE. The gross local dividend amount is ZAR3.62618 per share for shareholders exempt
from paying South African dividends tax. The net local divided amount is ZAR2.90094 per share for shareholders liable
to pay the dividends tax rate of 20%. There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.

The salient dates and times announced on Tuesday, 20 February 2018 remain unchanged.

which will be effective subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions precedent,
which is expected to occur in Q3 2018. The shopping centres have a current GLA of 68,900m(2)

100,000m(2) with a planned completion date in 2021. This acquisition consolidates the Group's
position as one of the largest retail owners in Poland. Krakow, Poland's second largest city, has
a population of 767,000 residents, and 336,000 inhabitants are within a 15-minute drive of the
two shopping centres.

DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

The Group invests strategically in developments that contribute significantly to growth in
distributable earnings per share. NEPI Rockcastle is pursuing a development pipeline which
exceeds EUR1,200 million (including redevelopments and extensions, estimated at cost), of which
EUR190 million were spent during 2017. Undertaking redevelopments and extensions to existing properties 
is a driver for future growth, ensuring that the Group maintains its pre-eminent position in the market 
and its superior retail relationships thus de-risking the business and delivering higher quality earnings.

Other extensions
The group is also pursuing several other extensions to its existing assets which will be
announced in due course.

LISTED SECURITY PORTFOLIO

NEPI Rockcastle invests in listed securities primarily to provide liquidity for the execution of
attractive acquisitions and developments. There has been an increasing focus on diversifying the
portfolio to facilitate the efficient deployment of capital into direct property assets during 2018.

Various changes have been implemented in this respect:
- During 2017 the portfolio has been tilted more towards Continental Europe than other regions.
- Additionally, the portfolio has been diversified further and exposure increased to highly liquid
  counters, while the exposure to the US dollar has been reduced since Q3 2016;

Following the merger of NEPI and Rockcastle and due to the above mentioned changes within
the portfolio, the functional currency of the entity owning the listed securities portfolio was
changed from US dollar to Euro.

As indicated, the Group's current pipeline of acquisitions and developments expected to be
completed this year is substantial and will be in part funded through the listed security portfolio.

A portion of the funds raised by the Group through equity and debt issues during 2017 was
temporarily invested in the listed portfolio, awaiting the gradual implementation of the current
acquisition pipeline.

NEPI Rockcastle uses physical shares and equity derivative positions to obtain exposure to
listed real estate companies. The principal counter parties in all listed securities transactions are
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and BoA Merrill Lynch.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

Following the merger, Moody's have revised the outlook on the Baa3 rating from stable to
positive, and Standard and Poor's have upgraded NEPI Rockcastle from BBB- to BBB, with a
stable outlook. The Group also obtained a BBB rating with a stable outlook from Fitch. After a
roadshow with European fixed-income investors in November 2017, the Group issued
EUR500 million of unsecured, 7-year Eurobonds maturing on 23 November 2024, carrying a
1.75% fixed coupon, with an issue price of 99.051%. This is the second time the Group has
raised material amounts from European investors, enabling it to compete more effectively in
the Central and Eastern European real estate markets in the long term. The Group has a broad
bondholder base, ranging from large asset managers, banks, pension and insurance companies
to international financial institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (part of the
World Bank group) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The proceeds
have been partly used for the acquisition of Paradise Center (Sofia, Bulgaria), while the balance
of the proceeds will be used for funding the acquisitions and developments pipeline.

During the year, the Group contracted on a combined basis EUR250 million in unsecured revolving
facilities from ING, Societe Generale and Garanti Bank, and EUR196 million in secured debt from
Berlin Hyp, Erste Bank, ING, Helaba, PBB and Raiffeisen Bank (including joint ventures). NEPI
Rockcastle benefits from a diversified funding base, and was complying with all debt covenants
as at 31 December 2017. NEPI Rockcastle's Loan to Value (interest bearing debt less cash divided
by investment property and listed securities) was 26%, below the gearing ratio target of 35%.
The average interest rate, including hedging costs, was 2.2% during 2017, due to contracting new
debt at lower rates and decreasing the interest margin on the existing debt. As at 31 December
2017, fixed-coupon bonds represented 53% of NEPI Rockcastle's outstanding debt, and out of
the remaining debt exposed to Euribor, 38% was hedged with interest rate caps and 62% with
interest rate swaps (including joint ventures).

The Group raised EUR593 million during 2017 pre-and post-merger by issuing new ordinary
shares, comprising EUR397 million from accelerated book builds and EUR196 million from scrip
dividends (which represented approximately 73% of the total dividend declared for the
corresponding period).

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had a strong liquidity profile, with EUR196 million in cash, EUR380
million in available unsecured revolving facilities, and EUR593 million net available in the listed
security portfolio.

NEPI ROCKCASTLE BUSINESS COMBINATION

In accordance with IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, the merger between NEPI and Rockcastle
was classified as a purchase of Rockcastle by NEPI. The attached condensed financial
statements and notes include:
-  A consolidated statement of financial position, which includes all assets of the resulting entity,
   NEPI Rockcastle; the comparative is NEPI's statement of financial position at
   31 December 2016;
-  A statement of comprehensive income, which includes the financial results of NEPI until the
   merger date (11 July 2017), and the results of the combined group afterwards; the comparative
   is NEPI's statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2016.
For the calculation of distributable earnings, an antecedent dividend equal to Rockcastle's
distribution for the first half of the year was added.

Goodwill of EUR886 million resulted from Rockcastle's premium to net asset value at the date of
the merger. All assets and liabilities were recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date, therefore the resulting goodwill was considered a mechanical
result of the merger accounting, and consequently unallocated and requiring an accounting impairment.

This impairment of goodwill does not impact any of the key indicators: recurring earnings per
share, adjusted net asset value per share, cash flow, distributable earnings, overall financial profile,
synergies from the merger or the forecasted earnings per share. Consequently, the Group's
balance sheet includes almost exclusively tangible assets, marked to market every six months, in
line with the industry practice (e.g. Unibail - Rodamco and Kleppiere - Corio mergers).

VALUATION

NEPI Rockcastle assesses the valuation of its property portfolio twice a year. Fair value is
determined by external, independent professional valuers, with appropriate and recognised
qualifications, and recent experience in the locations and category of properties being valued.
The valuations as at 31 December 2017 were performed by Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers.

Information relating to fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3
according to IFRS 13 - Fair value measurement) for 2017 is presented in the table below:

SHARE PRICE MOVEMENT

Considering the unusual share price movement that NEPI Rockcastle has experienced since the
start of 2018, the Board felt it appropriate to draw shareholders' attention to the following points:
-  The Board of NEPI Rockcastle confirms there has been no change in the Group's operations or
   financial position that would justify the recent movements in its share price;
-  The Board and management of NEPI Rockcastle have always been, and remain, committed
   to the highest standards of transparency and corporate governance. The Group maintains an
   open dialogue with equity and credit investors;
-  The Group does not hold any shares in Resilient, Fortress or Greenbay, nor does it have any
   financing arrangements with any of these parties.
In terms of the Articles of Association of the Company and the approval granted by the Board of Directors, 
the Company may implement a repurchase of NEPI Rockcastle shares.

DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS AND DECLARATION OF DISTRIBUTION

The Group achieved 24.80 euro cents in distributable earnings per share for the six months ended
31 December 2017. Aggregated with the combined distribution achieved by NEPI and Rockcastle
for the first half of 2017, and declared by NEPI Rockcastle, of 23.46 euro cents per share, it results
in 48.26 euro cents per share; this is 17.1% higher than the 2016 pro-forma distribution of 41.21 euro
cents per share for 2016, as published in the NEPI Rockcastle Prospectus. This growth is in line
with previously announced guidance, and is due to the strong performance of the Group's assets
and acquisitions and developments completed during the year.

The Board of Directors declares a distribution of 24.80 euro cents per share for the second
half of 2017, which will be paid in cash in March 2018. An announcement in this
respect will be issued on the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE and Euronext
Amsterdam in due course.

PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE

Distributable earnings per share for the year 2018 are expected to be approximately 10% higher
than the 2017 combined distribution of 48.26 euro cents per share. This guidance is based on
the assumptions that a stable macroeconomic environment prevails, no major corporate failures
occur, and planned developments and acquisitions remain on schedule. This forecast has not
been audited or reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of the Board.

NEPI, with NEPI Rockcastle being assessed in substance as a continuation of NEPI. Consequently, in these consolidated financial statements, 
in accordance with IFRS, NEPI Rockcastle presents the results of former NEPI Group before the merger date (11 July 2017), and the results of 
the combined Group from the merger date onwards. The comparatives are the audited consolidated financial results of NEPI for the year ended

Level 1 investments, according to IFRS 13 - Fair value measurement. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the 
air value of these investments are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Attributable transaction costs are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. The listed security portfolio includes physical shares with a fair value 
of EUR326.6 million presented within the Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss within the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position. The equity derivative collateral of EUR265.5 million represents the cash held at Prime Brokers and provides the Group 
with gross exposure to equity derivative swaps. The Group's equity derivatives swaps have a net fair value of EUR998 thousand from Financial

The Company’s condensed consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 will be reviewed by its
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and are scheduled for release on 20 February 2018. Its annual report for the same

Company’s results presentations will be held on 21 February 2018 in Johannesburg and 22 February 2018 in Cape
Town, and shareholders interested in meeting with management are invited to contact the Company for further details.

The Board of Directors notes the movement in the Company’s share price and assures shareholders that the governance,
operations and affairs of the Company remain sound. The Company has not received or been asked in any way to
comment on any allegations to the contrary. The Board notes that the Company is investment-grade rated by the three
major rating agencies. Credit ratings previously assigned by Moody’s and S&P have improved post-merger. The
Company has a strong balance sheet with high liquidity, low gearing and a diverse debt structure with no risk arising
from the Company’s share price volatility. The Company does not have any crossholdings into its shareholders.

Accordingly, the Board has no reason to provide any update to its stated guidance for growth in distribution or to advise
shareholders to exercise caution in their dealings in NEPI Rockcastle shares.

UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF NEPI AND ROCKCASTLE


Pursuant to the merger of New Europe Property Investments plc (“old NEPI”) and Rockcastle Global Real Estate
Company Limited (“old Rockcastle”) (the “merger transaction”), the company issued NEPI Rockcastle shares (“NRP
shares”) in settlement of the rights to NRP shares distributed by old NEPI and old Rockcastle as dividends or capital.
On 18 July 2017, old NEPI was delisted from the JSE Limited (“JSE”) and the Bucharest Stock Exchange, and old
Rockcastle was delisted from the JSE and the Mauritius Stock Exchange Ltd. Shareholders (other than old NEPI
shareholders who elected to have their old NEPI shares repurchased) were issued share statements reflecting their
unlisted shareholding in each company (“unlisted shares”).

To implement the merger transaction, old NEPI and old Rockcastle transferred 100% of their respective assets and
liabilities to NEPI Rockcastle. Old NEPI and old Rockcastle no longer own any assets and are effectively shell
companies. Unlisted shares evidenced by old NEPI and old Rockcastle share statements therefore do not have any
underlying value, with the NEPI Rockcastle shares that were received by shareholders pursuant to the implementation
of the merger transaction reflecting the full value of the merged old NEPI and old Rockcastle entities.

At the extraordinary general meeting of old NEPI shareholders held on 6 July 2017, shareholders authorised the
administrative dissolution of old NEPI as soon as reasonably practicable following the settlement of all liabilities of old
NEPI. This administrative dissolution is well advanced and is expected to be completed by 31 January 2018. Similarly,
at the general meeting of old Rockcastle shareholders held on 3 July 2017, shareholders authorised the board of directors
to initiate, as and when it deems fit, procedures for the winding-up of the company under section 102 of the Mauritian
Insolvency Act or an application for removal of the company from the register of companies in Mauritius under section
309 of the Mauritian Companies Act at any time following the implementation of the merger transaction.

Shareholders will be advised if and when the above processes have been completed. There will be no distribution to
shareholders upon dissolution or winding-up of either old NEPI or old Rockcastle.

ACQUISITION OF ALFA CENTRUM BIALYSTOK, POLAND


NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that it has acquired Alfa Centrum shopping centre in the city of
Bialystok in Poland (“Alfa Bialystok”) from A-JWK Management sp. z o.o., effective from
9 November 2017.

RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

With a gross lettable area of 37,000m2, Alfa Bialystok is the largest, most dominant fashion destination in
Bialystok, Poland. The city is inhabited by approximately 290,000 people and is the most populous urban area
within a radius of 200km in the north-east region of the country. Bialystok has strong local macro-economic
fundamentals and benefits from cross-border retail trade due to its proximity to the Belarussian border. Alfa
Bialystok is located near the city centre and is close to the internal ring road, ensuring connectivity to the
immediate catchment from central areas and the densely inhabited districts of the city.

Alfa Bialystok was opened in 2008 and is a modern three-level shopping mall with 150 retail units including
key tenants such as C&A, CCC, Euro RTV AGD, H&M, Helios Cinema, Inditex brands (Zara, Stradivarius,
Bershka, Pull & Bear, Oysho, Zara Home), LPP brands (Reserved, Cropp, House, Mohito, Sinsay, Home &
You) and Piotr i Pawel supermarket. A positive economic environment has contributed to average tenants’
turnover growth exceeding 10% and a footfall increase of over 7% to 5.5 million in the last 12 months. Planned
future asset management initiatives by NEPI Rockcastle include improvements to the food court, the leisure
and entertainment offering and tenant diversity.

The acquisition of Alfa Bialystok reflects NEPI Rockcastle’s strategy of establishing the company’s presence
in the largest Central Eastern European cities by acquiring or developing dominant shopping centres in these
markets.

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION

The aggregate purchase price for Alfa Bialystok was EUR 92.3 million, representing an acquisition yield of
approximately 6.7%.

FUNDING

The acquisition of Alfa Bialystok was funded by a combination of the sale of various listed securities held by
NEPI Rockcastle, in line with management’s strategy of decreasing this exposure, as well as a drawdown of
the EUR76 million, 7-year secured investment facility provided by Berlin Hyp for the purposes of refinancing
Galeria Warminska at a rate consistent with the company’s other secured funding for similar assets.

CATEGORISATION

The acquisition of Alfa Bialystok is not categorisable in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the
information in this announcement is accordingly presented for information purposes only.

ACQUISITION OF SERENADA AND KROKUS SHOPPING CENTRES, POLAND


1.   INTRODUCTION

     Shareholders are advised that a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, Tuvalu sp.z.o.o (“Tuvalu”),
     has entered into an agreement to acquire Serenada shopping centre (with a GLA of 41,170m2, opening
     in October 2017) and the adjacent Krokus shopping centre (with a GLA of 27,728m2), located in
     Kraków, Poland (together, the “properties”), for an aggregate purchase consideration of
     EUR249.4 million (the “acquisition”), to be increased by future payments of approximately
     EUR212 million, dependant on the completion of an extension which will result in a single integrated
     shopping centre with a GLA of over 100,000m2 (the “extension”).

2.   RATIONALE

     The key investment considerations for concluding the acquisition include:

      -   further advancing the company’s strategy of acquiring and developing dominant retail centres in
          Central and Eastern European cities with attractive macro-economic fundamentals;
      -   the opportunity to acquire and further develop a top 10 super regional shopping centre in Poland;
          and
      -   consolidating the company’s position as one of the largest dominant retail owners in Poland, the
          most populous country in Central and Eastern Europe.

3.   TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION

     3.1. The acquisition

          Tuvalu has entered into an agreement (the “agreement”) with Centrum Krokus sp. z o.o. and
          Centrum Serenada sp. z o.o. (together, the “sellers”) to acquire two adjacent shopping centres in
          Kraków, Poland’s second largest city, with a further expansion opportunity of approximately
          30,000m2, for an aggregate purchase consideration of EUR249.4 million (the “purchase price”).
          The acquisition will be effective on fulfilment of conditions precedent and conclusion of the final
          purchase agreement (the “effective date”), which is expected to occur in Q1 2018.

     3.2. Purchase price

          The purchase price of EUR249.4 million is payable on the effective date, in cash.
          EUR245.7 million relates to the capitalised net operating income (“NOI”) of the shopping centres
          and EUR3.7 million pertains to the balances attributed to other assets acquired as part of the
          enterprise transaction. Additional purchase price commitments to be paid in future tranches are:

          -     EUR115 million, consisting of regular monthly development drawdowns during the period
                of construction of the extension;
          -     approximately EUR34 million on and subject to completion of the extension works (planned
                to be in 2020), depending on specified commercial parameters of the extension; and
          -     approximately EUR63 million on the 2nd anniversary of the completion of extension works,
                depending on specified parameters for the commercial success of the extension (the “final
                payment”),
          on the basis that the aggregate of the initial payment and subsequent tranches may not exceed
          EUR469.3 million.

          For the period between the effective date and the 2nd anniversary of the completion of extension
          works, the NOI of the shopping centre/s will be guaranteed by the sellers. The NOI of the complete
          integrated shopping centre, calculated for the purpose of making the final payment, is capped at
          EUR23.826 million per annum.

     3.3. Conditions precedent

          The acquisition is subject to the fulfilment or waiver, as the case may be, of the following
          conditions precedent:

          -     the opening of the Serenada shopping centre, scheduled for October 2017;
          -     receipt of all relevant regulatory approvals and permits required or customary in order to
                implement an acquisition of this nature;
          -     tax rulings customary in order to implement an acquisition of this nature; and
          -     the waiver of a right of first refusal to acquire the shopping centres granted to a tenant of
                Centrum Krokus sp. z.o.o. in terms of an existing lease agreement.

     3.4. Material terms

          The agreement contains undertakings, warranties and indemnities which are normal for an
          acquisition of this nature.

     3.5. Source of funding

          This acquisition will be initially funded by a combination of NEPI Rockcastle’s existing cash and
          debt resources.

       The forecast incorporates the following material assumptions in respect of revenue and expenses:
        1.  The forecast is based on information derived from the management accounts, budgets, and
            rental contracts provided by the sellers and reviewed by the company.
        2.  Rental income is derived from the forecasts provided to the company by the sellers.
        3.  The effects of straight lining rental income are negligible and are accordingly not included
            in net property income.
        4.  Finance costs are computed with reference to the cost of funding on the portion of the debt
            facilities which are anticipated to be utilised to fund the acquisition.
        5.  Contracted revenue is based on existing lease agreements including stipulated increases, all
            of which are valid and enforceable.
        6.  Leases expiring during the forecast period have been forecast on a lease-by-lease basis, and
            have been assumed to renew at current market rates unless the lessee has indicated its
            intention to terminate the lease.
        7.  Of the rental income of EUR18,206 million, 100% relates to contracted rental.
        8.  Property operating expenditure has been forecast by the property manager on a line-by-line
            basis based on management’s review of historical expenditure, where available, and
            discussion with the property manager.
        9.  No fair value adjustment is recognised.
        10. There will be no unforeseen economic factors that will affect the lessee's ability to meet their
            commitments in terms of existing lease agreements.

6.   CATEGORISATION OF THE ACQUISITION

     The acquisition is classified as a category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.
     Accordingly, it is not subject to approval by shareholders.

ordinary shares (the “equity raise”). The equity raise is subject to pricing acceptable to NEPI Rockcastle and

The vendor consideration placing will be utilised partly to refinance the acquisition of the Serdika Center and
Office in Sofia, Bulgaria and Arena Plaza shopping centre in Budapest, Hungary, announced on 13 June 2017
and 18 September 2017 respectively.

The equity raise will be offered to qualifying investors through an accelerated book build process (the “book

CASH PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS


Shareholders are referred to previous announcements relating to the election to receive the interim dividend for the 
six months ended 30 June 2017 either as a cash dividend or as a return of capital, the last of which was released on
26 September 2017.

Where a shareholder elects to receive the return of capital by way of an issue of new NEPI Rockcastle shares, any
entitlement to receive a fraction of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a
cash payment (“cash payment”) made to the relevant shareholder in respect of the fraction.

The value of a NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders has been
determined with reference to the volume weighted average traded price of a NEPI Rockcastle share on the JSE on
Tuesday, 26 September 2017, discounted by 10%. On this basis, shareholders are advised that the gross value of a
NEPI Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders is ZAR 167.90. For
shareholders on the European register, this gross value is EUR 10.66573, being the aforementioned Rand value
converted to Euro at the exchange rate of EUR1.00:ZAR 15.74200 announced on Tuesday, 26 September 2017.

The receipt of the cash payment may have tax implications for shareholders. For those South African resident
shareholders receiving the cash payment, such amount may be regarded as a foreign dividend and, if it is, may be
subject to South African dividends tax at a rate of 20%, unless an exemption as set out in the South African Income
Tax legislation applies. For shareholders liable to pay dividends tax at the rate of 20%, the net value of a NEPI
Rockcastle share to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to shareholders is ZAR 134.32.

The salient dates and times announced on Friday, 8 September 2017 remain unchanged.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and on Euronext Amsterdam.

ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL:
FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT


NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are referred to the circular issued on Friday, 8 September 2017, in respect of
an election to receive the interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2017 either as a cash dividend or
as a return of capital and are advised as follows:

-    Shareholders holding shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand
     converted from Euro at an exchange rate of EUR1.00: ZAR 15.74200. Accordingly, the cash dividend of
     23.46 Euro cents per share will be equal to ZAR 3.69307 per share.

-    The reference price is ZAR 173.22650 (“reference price”), being a 7% discount to the five-day volume
     weighted average traded price (less distribution) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE as at Friday,
     22 September 2017. For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the reference price is
     EUR 11.00410 (being the reference price of ZAR 173.22650 converted to Euro at the Rand exchange rate
     of EUR1.00: ZAR 15.74200).

-    Shareholders electing to receive the return of capital will receive 2.13193 new NEPI Rockcastle shares for
     every 100 NEPI Rockcastle shares held by such shareholders on the record date of Friday,
     29 September 2017, representing the ratio that the cash dividend bears to the reference price.

If no shareholders were to elect to receive the return of capital, the value of the dividends would amount to
EUR 126 438 560. Should all shareholders elect to receive the return of capital, the maximum total number
of new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued by NEPI Rockcastle pursuant to the return of capital will be
11,490,117.

The share capital of the company as at the date of this announcement is as follows:

ACQUISITION OF PARADISE CENTER, BULGARIA


INTRODUCTION

NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that, on 21 September 2017, through its subsidiary NEPI Project two EOOD, it has
acquired all the issued shares in, and claims against, BULFELD EOOD, the owner of Paradise Center in Sofia, Bulgaria (“the
Transaction”). The Transaction will be effective upon obtaining approval of the Bulgarian Competition Authority.

This acquisition strengthens NEPI Rockcastle’s position as the largest listed retail real estate company in Central and Eastern
Europe (“CEE”), and together with the acquisition of Serdika Center earlier this year, its presence in the Bulgarian market.

RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

With a gross lettable area of 82,000m2, Paradise Center is the largest retail centre in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. The 
centre is located in the wealthy southern part of the city, which is undergoing strong development. Opened in 2013 and benefitting 
from a corner location at the intersection between two main traffic arteries and direct access to the newly built M2 metro line, 
Paradise Center has an annual footfall in excess of 10 million visitors. The mall is let to major national and international tenants 
such as Bershka, Cinema City, Forever 21, H&M, LC Waikiki, Massimo Dutti, New Yorker, Pull & Bear, Reserved, Sephora, Sport
Vision, Sofia Event Center (a conference facility), Stradivarius, Technopolis and Zara. The centre has a strong food and
entertainment area, which includes both a complete fast and slow food line up, a fitness facility with a 25m swimming pool, as
well as a playground. Several asset management initiatives, including major improvements to the basement and the terrace level
together with enhancements to the tenant mix, will further strengthen its dominant market position.

With a growing population of over 1.32 million inhabitants, Sofia is the economic and cultural centre of Bulgaria and an attractive
head office destination for international companies. Benefitting from a developing infrastructure and strategic location, Sofia is a
major hub for international railway and automobile transport, with three Pan-European corridors crossing the city. During the last
couple of years, Bulgaria’s economy has shown robust growth, with GDP growth of 3.6% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016. Growth is
forecast to remain strong at 2.8%-2.9% per year in 2017-21 (compared to a forecast growth of 1.4%-1.5% in the European Union),
as domestic and external demand continues to increase (according to the Economist Intelligence Unit).

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION

The aggregate purchase price for the Transaction is EUR 252.9 million, resulting in an acquisition yield of approximately 7%. The
acquisition has initially been funded by a combination of the Company’s existing cash resources and debt facilities, combined
with sale of listed securities held, in line with management’s strategy of decreasing this exposure.

The transaction is not categorisable in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the information in this announcement is
presented for information purposes only.

ACQUISITION OF ARENA PLAZA BUDAPEST, HUNGARY

INTRODUCTION

NEPI Rockcastle is pleased to announce that, on 15 September 2017, through its subsidiary, Arena Property KFT, it has
acquired all the issued shares in, and claims against, Symmetry Arena Ingatlankezelo Korlatolt Felelossegu Tarsasag, the
owner of Arena Plaza Shopping centre in Budapest, Hungary (‘the Transaction”).

RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION

With a gross lettable area of 66,000m2, Arena Plaza is the second largest retail centre in Budapest, the capital city of
Hungary, the second most populous city in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”). Centrally located in the eastern part of the
city, close to the country’s main international railway station, the shopping mall was opened in November 2007 and has
since grown its annual footfall to more than 10 million people. Its modern layout over two floors, convenient parking and
attractive tenant mix has resulted in turnover growth exceeding 7% per annum over the last two years. The shopping centre
is fully let to major national and international tenants such as Bershka, H&M, IMAX Cinema City, KFC, Massimo Dutti,
McDonalds, Media Markt, New Yorker, Peek & Cloppenburg, Pull & Bear, Sports Direct, Starbucks, Stradivarius, Tesco
and Zara. Several envisaged asset management initiatives, including major improvements to the leisure and entertainment
offering, the introduction of new international tenants and a major refurbishment, will further strengthen its dominant
market position.

Further to the recovery of its investment grade rating in 2016, Hungary is on a growth path, with GDP growth forecast to be
2.8% in 2017 and 2.9% in 2018, compared to 1.4% and 1.5% respectively in the European Union (according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit). Budapest is the economic centre of Hungary, with over 1.7 million inhabitants, being the
most populous and wealthiest city in the country. It has a unique location advantage from its proximity to Vienna (250 km)
and Bratislava (200 km), the three cities creating one of the leading clusters of cross-border activities in the entire CEE. 
The city boasts high quality infrastructure and is an attractive head office destination for international companies. NEPI
Rockcastle is the largest listed retail centre owner in CEE and this acquisition, in the fourth largest CEE economy,
completes the company’s entry into the eight largest markets in the region.

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION

The Transaction was completed on 15 September 2017 (“Effective date”).

The aggregate purchase price paid for the transaction was EUR 275 million, resulting in an acquisition yield of
approximately 6.2%. This acquisition has initially been funded by a combination of NEPI Rockcastle’s existing cash
resources, debt facilities, vendor finance and sale of various listed securities held, in line with management’s strategy of
decreasing this exposure.

CIRCULAR TO NEPI ROCKCASTLE SHAREHOLDERS IN RESPECT OF AN ELECTION TO RECEIVE EITHER A CASH DIVIDEND OR A RETURN OF CAPITAL


As previously announced, on 11 July 2017, a merger transaction between New Europe Property Investments plc (“NEPI”) and
Rockcastle Global Real Estate Company Limited (“Rockcastle”) was implemented, such that NEPI Rockcastle acquired 100% of
the assets and liabilities of both NEPI and Rockcastle. On 22 August 2017, NEPI Rockcastle released the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial results for each of NEPI and Rockcastle for the six months ended 30 June 2017 and announced an interim
dividend of 23.46 euro cents per NEPI Rockcastle ordinary share (“share” or “NEPI Rockcastle share”) in respect of the six
months ended 30 June 2017 (“interim dividend”).

The board of directors has resolved to offer to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders the election to receive the interim dividend as a
return of capital by way of an issue of new shares of €0.01 each (of the same class as existing shares) credited as fully paid up
(“return of capital”) and/or as a cash dividend. The election is available in respect of all or part of a shareholder’s shareholdings
as at Friday, 29 September 2017.

A circular to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders in respect of the election being offered to NEPI Rockcastle shareholders to receive
either the cash dividend or the return of capital has been posted to shareholders on Friday, 8 September 2017 and is available on
the company’s website at www.nepirockcastle.com.

Cash dividend

The cash dividend will be paid to shareholders unless a shareholder elects to receive a return of capital. Shareholders holding
shares traded on the JSE will receive their cash dividend in South African Rand converted from Euro at an exchange rate to be
announced on Tuesday, 26 September 2017(“reference price”). For NEPI Rockcastle shares traded on Euronext Amsterdam, the
reference price will be converted to Euro at a ZAR: EUR conversion rate announced on Tuesday, 26 September 2017, before
11:00.

The cash dividend will be paid out of the company’s distributable profits.

Return of capital

The rationale for the return of capital is to afford shareholders the opportunity to increase their shareholding in NEPI Rockcastle
and to retain flexibility with regard to the company’s cash resources.

The number of NEPI Rockcastle shares to which a shareholder electing to receive the return of capital is entitled will be
determined with reference to the ratio that 23.46 euro cents per share bears to a reference price of up to a 7% discount to the five-
day volume weighted average traded price (less the cash dividend) of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE, to be announced on
Tuesday, 26 September 2017.

NEPI Rockcastle reserves the right to reduce the number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares issued to an electing shareholder in
respect of the return of capital if the issue of such shareholder’s full allocation of new NEPI Rockcastle shares would result in that
shareholder (individually or together with any shareholders deemed to be acting in concert with such shareholder) having an
interest in new NEPI Rockcastle shares that would ordinarily require the shareholder (or group of shareholders) to make a
mandatory takeover offer pursuant to any applicable takeover, capital market or equivalent legislation. In such circumstances, the
shareholder will receive the balance of their entitlement as a cash dividend.

The allocation of NEPI Rockcastle shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the return of capital will not be
allocated a fraction of a new NEPI Rockcastle share. Any entitlement to receive a fraction of a NEPI Rockcastle share will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a cash payment (“cash payment”) made to the relevant shareholder in respect of
the fraction. The cash payment due to shareholders will be determined with reference to the weighted average traded price of
shares on the JSE on Tuesday, 26 September 2017, less 10% (converted to Euro at the exchange rate in respect of those shares
traded on Euronext Amsterdam) which amount will be announced on Thursday, 28 September 2017 before 11:00.

The new NEPI Rockcastle shares to be issued pursuant to the return of capital will be funded by way of a reduction of part of the
company’s share premium account (which is a reduction of capital).

As required in terms of Isle of Man law, NEPI Rockcastle shareholders will not have registered ownership of the NEPI Rockcastle
shares that they receive pursuant to the return of capital. NEPI Rockcastle shares will instead be delivered to shareholders in the
form of dematerialised security entitlements representing the beneficial ownership of such shares. References throughout this
announcement to NEPI Rockcastle shares received or issued pursuant to the return of capital or to any shareholding in NEPI
Rockcastle before or after the implementation of the return of capital should therefore be read as a reference to a receipt, issue or
holding of security entitlements representing beneficial ownership of NEPI Rockcastle shares, and not to any registered ownership
of NEPI Rockcastle shares. All NEPI Rockcastle shares are and will be registered in the name of Nederlands Centraal Instituut
voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V. (Euroclear Nederland) for and on behalf of shareholders.

As at the date of this announcement, the company has 538 953 794 ordinary shares of €0.01 each in issue.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

South African resident shareholders

The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for shareholders.

For those South African resident shareholders receiving the cash dividend, such amount will be regarded as a foreign dividend and
may be subject to South African dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%, unless an exemption as set out in the South African
tax legislation applies.

The receipt of NEPI Rockcastle shares by South African resident shareholders pursuant to the return of capital should not be
classified as a dividend or a foreign dividend for South African tax purposes and accordingly, South African dividends
withholding tax should not be levied on the new NEPI Rockcastle shares so received. However, the legislation in this regard is
complex and its implementation is uncertain. Shareholders should therefore seek independent professional tax advice.

The gross local dividend amount for shareholders exempt from paying South African dividends tax, as well as the net local
dividend amount for shareholders liable to pay South African dividends tax, will be announced on Tuesday, 26 September 2017.

NEPI Rockcastle shareholders are advised to consult their professional advisors regarding the tax consequences of the cash
dividend and the return of capital or should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to take.

There is no withholding tax payable in the Isle of Man.

Shareholders residing outside South Africa

The receipt of the cash dividend or election to receive the return of capital may have tax implications for shareholders who are
resident outside South Africa and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisors in
this regard.

NEPI Rockcastle has a dual primary listing on the Main Board of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam.

UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR NEPI AND ROCKCASTLE
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

All information below excludes joint ventures, unless otherwise stated

DIRECTORS' COMMENTARY

STRUCTURE AND LISTING

The merger of New Europe Property Investments plc (NEPI) and Rockcastle Global Real Estate Company Limited 
(Rockcastle) was successfully concluded with effect from 11 July 2017. The new holding company, NEPI 
Rockcastle plc, acquired the businesses of NEPI and Rockcastle (including all properties and listed shares 
portfolios) thereby becoming the largest listed real estate player in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and 
one of the top ten listed real estate companies in Continental Europe by market capitalisation.

Following the merger, NEPI Rockcastle shares were listed and started trading on the Johannesburg Stock 
Exchange (JSE) and Euronext Amsterdam, while the individual companies ceased trading on their respective 
stock markets. As the merger implementation date was after the reporting date, the condensed consolidated 
financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 are reported on a stand-alone basis for each of the 
two former groups, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

HALF-YEAR DISTRIBUTION AND OPTION TO RECEIVE CAPITAL RETURN

NEPI achieved 23.02 euro cents in distributable earnings per share for the six-months ended 30 June 2017, 
and Rockcastle achieved 5.775 USD cents in distributable earnings per share for the same period. The resulting 
combined distribution declared by NEPI Rockcastle is 23.46 euro cents per share. This distribution is calculated 
by dividing the aggregated NEPI and Rockcastle distributable earnings (EUR126.4 million, using an exchange rate 
of 1.1229 USD / 1 EUR) by the NEPI Rockcastle shares in issue (538,953,794).

This distribution will be paid by NEPI Rockcastle to shareholders on behalf of NEPI and Rockcastle. Shareholders can 
elect to receive this distribution in cash or as a return of capital by way of an issue of fully paid shares, the 
number of which will be determined based on a ratio between distribution declared and the reference price. The 
reference price will be calculated using a maximum 7% discount to the five-day volume weighted average traded price, 
less distribution, of NEPI Rockcastle shares on the JSE.

A circular containing full details of the election being offered to shareholders, accompanied by announcements on 
the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam (Euronext), will be issued in due course.

STRATEGY

NEPI Rockcastle focuses on investments in dominant retail real estate assets in high-growth CEE markets, with 
leading positions in Romania, Poland and Slovakia and a strong presence in Croatia, Czech Republic and Serbia. 
The Group owns, and manages, 50 income-producing assets mainly located in the previously mentioned countries with 
a total value (based on pro-forma accounts as at 30 June 2017) of approximately EUR3.8 billion, with six additional 
assets under development. The Group has just entered its seventh CEE market, Bulgaria, through the acquisition of 
Serdika Center and Office in Sofia.

NEPI Rockcastle holds a portfolio of highly liquid listed securities of large companies which dominate their markets 
and consistently outperform their competitors, operating primarily in the US, UK, and Continental Europe. Going forward, 
in line with Company strategy of migrating from listed investments to direct property, this portfolio is envisaged to be 
converted into new strategic direct property acquisitions. The listed security portfolio was valued at $1.33 billion 
(equivalent of EUR1.16 billion) at 30 June 2017, representing 23% of the combined Group's investment assets based on 
pro-forma accounts, and is expected to reduce as the strategy is implemented.

ACQUISITIONS OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY

Acquisition pipeline
NEPI and Rockcastle have been actively pursuing numerous investment opportunities during the first half 
of the year. This resulted in maintaining a significant investment pipeline, which, in addition to
Serdika Center and Office, includes acquisitions:
-   for which the due diligence has been completed and legal agreements are progressing, in excess of
    EUR350 million;
-   in exclusivity and under due diligence, in excess of EUR600 million.

In total, these acquisitions, if successfully concluded, will add over 280,000m(2) of Gross Lettable Area 
(GLA) to NEPI Rockcastle's direct property portfolio.
NEPI Rockcastle will announce details of acquisitions when appropriate. In addition to its existing pipeline, 
NEPI Rockcastle is evaluating further significant direct retail property opportunities in the CEE region.

acquisition received the approval of the Bulgarian Competition Authority in July 2017 and will become 
effective during August 2017.

DEVELOPMENTS AND EXTENSIONS

Development pipeline
The Group invests strategically in developments that significantly contribute to growth in distributable 
earnings per share. NEPI Rockcastle is pursuing a development pipeline which exceeds EUR1.3 billion 
(including redevelopments and extensions, estimated at cost), of which EUR175 million were spent in aggregate 
by NEPI and Rockcastle by 30 June 2017. 

During the period, NEPI completed the development of Victoriei Office 
in Bucharest and the third phase of The Office, Cluj-Napoca. Additionally, NEPI and Rockcastle commenced 
construction on several projects in Romania, Serbia and Poland, including developments located in Galati, 
Novi Sad, Ramnicu Valcea, Wolomin and Zabrze, while zoning has been received for a shopping centre in Satu Mare, 
Romania. No substantial progress has been made with zoning and permitting for the Promenada Mall extension.

complex to 63,600m(2). The third phase is 96% leased with tenants gradually taking possession of their premises

continues, and is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Ramnicu Valcea Mall (Romania)
The building permit has been received and construction commenced for the 27,900m(2) GLA regional mall , which 
is scheduled to open by the end of 2017. Currently, 89% of the centre is leased or subject to advanced 
negotiations. Tenants include Carrefour, Cinema City, Hervis, Jysk, NewYorker, Orsay and Textil Market.

Platan Shopping Centre extension (Poland)

Solaris Shopping Centre extension (Poland)
The building permit for the extension of the shopping centre by approximately 9,200m(2) has been received and

various international brands are interested.

LISTED SECURITY PORTFOLIO

NEPI Rockcastle invests in listed securities whose portfolios consist predominantly of quality assets, which 
outperform competitors and reduce the impact of negative market fluctuations. There is an increasing focus on 
positioning the portfolio to facilitate the efficient deployment of capital into direct property assets. 
Various changes have been implemented in this respect:
-   during the first six months of 2017 the portfolio has been focused on Continental Europe, as economic 
    prospects in the region are improving, and this bias will continue as long as applicable;
-   the portfolio has been diversified further, and exposure increased to highly liquid assets;
-   exposure to the USD has been reduced since third quarter of 2016; and
-   following the merger of NEPI and Rockcastle, the functional currency of the listed portfolio was changed
    from USD to EUR.

As indicated, the Company's current pipeline of acquisitions and developments expected to be completed this 
year is substantial and will necessitate a reduction in the quantum of the listed portfolio.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT

As of 30 June 2017, NEPI and Rockcastle had in aggregate EUR63.6 million in cash and undrawn unsecured revolving 
facilities of EUR305 million. NEPI Rockcastle's pro-forma gearing ratio (interest bearing debt less cash divided 
by investment property and listed property shares) was 24%.

The average interest rate for NEPI, including hedging costs was 3.3%. As of 30 June 2017, fixed-coupon bonds 
represented 61.1% of NEPI's outstanding debt, and out of the remaining debt exposed to Euribor, 92% was hedged 
with interest rate caps and 8% with interest rate swaps (including joint ventures).

The average interest rate for Rockcastle, including hedging costs was 1.8%. As of 30 June 2017, the outstanding 
debt exposed to Euribor was 93.1% hedged.

PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE

Distributable earnings per share for the year 2017 are expected to be approximately 17% higher than the 2016 
pro-forma distribution of 41.21 euro cents per share published in the NEPI Rockcastle Prospectus, in line with 
guidance previously announced by NEPI and Rockcastle. This guidance is based on the assumptions that a stable 
macroeconomic environment prevails, no major corporate failures occur, planned developments remain on schedule, 
and is sensitive to the impact of acquisitions currently in the pipeline. This forecast has not been audited or 
reviewed by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of the Board.

UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2017


As previously announced, the merger of New Europe Property Investments plc (“NEPI”) and Rockcastle Global Real
Estate Company Limited (“Rockcastle”) (the “merger transaction”), in a new entity, NEPI Rockcastle plc, was
effective on 11 July 2017. Pursuant to the merger transaction, NEPI Rockcastle shares commenced trading on the
Main Board of the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam on Wednesday, 12 July 2017; NEPI and Rockcastle were de-listed
from the Main Board of the JSE and from the Bucharest Stock Exchange and Stock Exchange of Mauritius Ltd
respectively on Tuesday, 18 July 2017.

Given that the merger implementation date was subsequent to the reporting date, the condensed consolidated financial
results for the six months ended 30 June 2017 will be reported on a stand-alone basis for each of the two former
groups, according to IFRS.

The NEPI and Rockcastle interim results will include the calculation of a distribution per NEPI and Rockcastle share
for the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2017, respectively. A distribution per NEPI Rockcastle share, being the
aggregate of the NEPI and Rockcastle distributable earnings divided by the number of NEPI Rockcastle shares in
issue, will ultimately be paid by NEPI Rockcastle to its shareholders.

The NEPI and Rockcastle interim results will be made available on NEPI Rockcastle’s website
(www.nepirockcastle.com) and released on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE by NEPI Rockcastle on
22 August 2017.

ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS: LISTING BY INTRODUCTION OF NEPI ROCKCASTLE ON THE JSE


Abridged prospectus relating to the listing by introduction of all the issued ordinary shares of NEPI Rockcastle on the Main Board
of the JSE Limited (the “JSE”), under the abbreviated name: “NEPIROCK”, JSE share code: NRO and ISIN: IM00BDD7WV31
(the “JSE listing”). The company will be listed in the “Real Estate – Real Estate Holdings and Development” sector.

INTRODUCTION

As previously announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE (“SENS”) and the websites of the Bucharest Stock
Exchange (“BVB”) and the Stock Exchange of Mauritius Ltd (“SEM”), New Europe Property Investments plc (“NEPI”) and
Rockcastle Global Real Estate Company Limited (“Rockcastle”) intend merging their businesses in NEPI Rockcastle (the
“merger transaction”). Investors are referred to the joint announcements released by NEPI and Rockcastle on SENS and the
websites of the BVB and SEM on 14 December 2016, 13 February 2017, 28 April 2017, 11 May 2017, 31 May 2017 and
9 June 2017 for further details of the merger transaction.

Set out below are the salient details of NEPI Rockcastle, more fully described in the prospectus which will be made available to
NEPI and Rockcastle shareholders from today, a copy of which was registered in terms of the South African Companies Act 71 of
2008 (“SA Companies Act”) with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission on Friday, 2 June 2017 (the “full
prospectus”). For a comprehensive appreciation and understanding of NEPI Rockcastle, the full prospectus should be read in its
entirety.

This abridged prospectus is not an invitation to the public to subscribe for shares. It is issued in compliance with the
Listings Requirements of the JSE (“JSE Listings Requirements”).

The full prospectus has been prepared for the purpose of providing information regarding the business and affairs of NEPI
Rockcastle as at the time of listing on the JSE by introduction, on the assumption that the merger transaction will be implemented
in accordance with its terms. In addition, the full prospectus is issued to provide information regarding the business and affairs of
NEPI Rockcastle for the benefit of NEPI shareholders who, in terms of the merger transaction, have an opportunity to voluntarily
sell their NEPI shares to NEPI in consideration for which NEPI will transfer to participating shareholders the right to be issued
such number of new NEPI Rockcastle shares as is determined based on the swap ratio of 1 NEPI share for every 4.7 Rockcastle
shares and pursuant to which shareholders will receive 1 NEPI Rockcastle share for every 1 NEPI share repurchased (the “NEPI
repurchase”). In terms of the SA Companies Act, the NEPI repurchase constitutes an initial public offering by way of a
secondary offer by NEPI of NEPI Rockcastle shares and thus requires the issue of a registered prospectus.

All information included in both the full prospectus and this abridged prospectus reflects the business and affairs of NEPI
Rockcastle at the time of listing on the JSE, determined with reference to all relevant information as it relates to NEPI and
Rockcastle (and as it relates to the NEPI assets and Rockcastle assets that are the subject of the merger transaction) as at
12 May 2017.

NATURE OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS

NEPI Rockcastle was incorporated in the Isle of Man on 1 December 2016. NEPI Rockcastle will, in terms of the merger
transaction, acquire 100% of NEPI and Rockcastle’s assets and liabilities (excluding any shares in NEPI Rockcastle itself). Upon
implementation of the merger transaction, the company will operate as an internally managed commercial property investor and
developer owning and managing dominant retail assets and A-grade offices in the Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) region,
with a complementary portfolio of global real estate listed securities.

NEPI Rockcastle is expected to have a substantially enlarged market capitalisation in comparison to NEPI and Rockcastle,
respectively, with all shareholders benefitting from enhanced liquidity. As the vehicle for the merged NEPI and Rockcastle
businesses, the company will benefit from an extensive operational platform and both companies’ strong track record of
completing value-enhancing acquisitions and developments. The company also integrates two complementary management teams
with experience in adjacent jurisdictions, positioned to unlock strategic synergies and create further value for shareholders.

NEPI Rockcastle is well positioned for growth, driven by expansion of a best-in-class operating platform, as well as a reduction in
exposure to listed securities in favour of increasing direct property investments. Geographically diverse management skills will
allow NEPI Rockcastle to pursue CEE property opportunities more efficiently, giving it a strategic advantage in the acquisition,
development and management of properties.

On 31 May 2017, Moody's Investors Service (“Moody's”) changed the outlook on NEPI’s Baa3 long-term issuer rating and senior
unsecured bond rating from stable to positive, considering NEPI’s planned merger with Rockcastle in NEPI Rockcastle. The
positive outlook primarily reflects the significantly larger property portfolio and improved geographical diversification of NEPI
Rockcastle. In Moody’s view, NEPI Rockcastle will become a leading owner of shopping centres in Eastern Europe. Furthermore,
on 1 June 2017, S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) assigned NEPI Rockcastle a 'BBB' preliminary long-term corporate credit rating
with a stable outlook. S&P noted that NEPI Rockcastle should emerge as a leading real estate investment group in CEE following
the merger of NEPI and Rockcastle. Investors are referred to the joint announcement released by NEPI and Rockcastle on SENS
and the websites of the BVB and SEM on 5 June 2017 for further information.

Given the nature of its business, and as it is considered a more relevant performance measure than earnings or headline earnings
per share, NEPI Rockcastle will use distribution per share as its key performance measure.

DIRECTORS

The board of directors of NEPI Rockcastle comprises eleven directors of whom five are executive and six are non-executive (all
of whom are independent). As joint chief executive officers, Alex Morar and Spiros Noussis will work together in the integrated
management of the group and implementation of NEPI Rockcastle’s investment strategy, with Alex focusing primarily on
countries in which NEPI is currently invested (namely, Romania, Slovakia, Croatia and Serbia) and Spiros focusing primarily on
countries in which Rockcastle is currently invested (namely, Poland and Czech Republic).

complement that is familiar with NEPI Rockcastle’s portfolio of properties. Following implementation of the merger transaction,
the group will bring together the asset management platforms developed by NEPI in Romania, Slovakia, Croatia, Czech Republic
and Serbia, and Rockcastle’s asset management team in Poland. The integrated platform will be led by a multi-national group of
senior asset managers with extensive commercial real estate experience.
