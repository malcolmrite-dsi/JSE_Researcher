Unless otherwise stated, financial growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis and are year-on-year (YoY,
9M to September 2020 vs 9M to September 2019). Non-financial growth rates are presented as quarter-on-quarter
(QoQ, 3Q20 vs 2Q20).

Service revenue excludes device and SIM card revenue. Data revenue is mobile and fixed access data and excludes roaming and wholesale.
Fintech includes MoMo, insurance, airtime lending and e-commerce. Active data users is a count of all subscribers at a point in time which
had a revenue generating event in the specified period of time (90 days) prior to that point in time and also during the past 30 days had data
usage greater than or equal to 5 megabytes. MoMo users are 30-day active users.


                                                                                                                                            
Group president and CEO, Ralph Mupita comments:

“As the Covid-19 pandemic has continued to impact lives and livelihoods across our markets, the group
has demonstrated strong operational execution and resilience during the period under review.
Although trading conditions remain challenging, we delivered a solid performance in Q3 2020 during
which the positive momentum achieved in key traffic and revenue trends towards the end of H1 2020
was sustained.

We continued to drive good growth in our subscriber base, enabled by strong commercial execution
across our markets. In the quarter we added 12 million subscribers and 5,3 million active data users.
We reached a significant milestone in our goal to enable greater financial inclusion by surpassing the
40 million MoMo subscribers mark, an addition of 3,5 million in the quarter. In Nigeria, we added over
90 000 agents to end Q3 at 311 770 registered agents for our fintech business. Apart from greater
adoption brought on by COVID-19, more people used MoMo because of enhancements to the
functionality of the MoMo app, the large increase in registered MoMo agents, as well as the
integration of MoMo into our instant messaging platform Ayoba in some of our markets.

Service revenue grew by 11,4% and EBITDA grew by 13,9%, with the group EBITDA margin improving
by 1,4pp to 43,3%, in line with our medium-term targets. Group leverage remains comfortably within
covenant limits and improved to 0,9x, from 1,1x at June 2020. Although our group holding company
(holdco) leverage continues to be impacted by timing delays in upstreaming from key operating
companies, it improved slightly to 2,6x from 2,7x at June 2020. As lockdown restrictions interrupted
new network rollout, particularly in Q2, we continued to focus our investment of R16,1 billion on
network capacity and resilience and modernising our IT systems. Pleasingly, we were able to accelerate
some of our investment as lockdown restrictions eased.

The group results were supported by the strong performance of our larger operations. MTN South
Africa sustained its turnaround, with an acceleration in its core consumer and enterprise business units
in Q3. MTN Nigeria recorded a solid result with some recovery in revenue growth under difficult
operating conditions, and MTN Ghana’s continued strong operational execution drove the delivery of
another good performance.

We recorded solid growth in voice revenue of 3,9%, which reflects an encouraging recovery supported
by the easing of lockdown restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economies in our markets.
Data revenue grew by 31,9%, bolstered by increased demand for work from home services, digital
entertainment as well as online education offerings. We also delivered pleasing growth in fintech and
digital revenue of 21,0% and 37,5% respectively, driven by increased adoption and usage of our digital
channels and offerings.

As we continue to navigate the impacts of the pandemic, we remain focused on our people, customers,
networks and efficiency, supporting our broad range of stakeholders through our Y’ello Hope and other
initiatives. While managing the risks, we are also alive to the opportunities presented by COVID-19,
particularly the accelerated need for digitalisation evidenced in the adoption and usage of our services.

Our balance sheet and liquidity position is supported by our focus on prudent capital allocation.

                                                                                                       
We have completed the exit from our 18,9% investment in Jumia as well as the localisation of an 8%
shareholding in MTN Zambia, realising net proceeds of approximately R2,3 billion and R204 million
respectively.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to providing leading network service; building and scaling our
digital and fintech businesses; securing greater efficiency through cost discipline; and executing on our
pan-African strategy and asset realisation programme.


The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa
and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and their
respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted), eSwatini (joint
venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea
Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

MTN South Africa
MTN SA delivered an encouraging performance, with strong commercial execution sustaining the
growth of consumer prepaid, consumer postpaid and enterprise business units. Service revenue grew
by 2,1% with an improved performance in Q3, when it increased by 11,8% YoY.

Service revenue growth was supported by the strong performance in the consumer prepaid business,
continued growth of the enterprise business and the resilience of the consumer postpaid business. All
three business units continue to benefit from the growth in data usage driving the increase in data
revenue by 16,0% YoY in the nine months to September 2020.

MTN SA’s results were negatively impacted by the discontinuation of our roaming agreement with
Telkom which concluded in June 2019 and the effect of accounting for Cell C roaming revenue on a
cash basis. Excluding the impact of national roaming, MTN SA would have recorded service revenue
growth of 3,4% in the first nine months of the year and 5,7% YoY in Q3.

Total subscribers increased by 1,9 million in the quarter, to 30,9 million. The majority of additions
were prepaid customers, reaching a total of 24,3 million and marking the largest quarterly increase in
nearly 18 months. Postpaid subscriber numbers remained broadly flat at 6,6 million, primarily as a
result of churn on short-term COVID-19 related deals. Excluding the net impact of these deals, the
postpaid subscriber base increased 168 100 for the quarter.

Strong data traffic growth of 80,6% coupled with a 0,5 million increase in active data users to 14,7
million supported a solid 16,0% increase in overall mobile data revenue. In line with the commitment
to improving the affordability of data for its customers, MTN SA has reduced its effective data tariff
by approximately 34,7% since September 2019.

The execution of MTN SA’s prepaid strategy resulted in a solid performance in the consumer prepaid
business, which remained on an improving trajectory with service revenue up 3,1%, benefiting from a
strong third quarter when service revenue increased by 5,7% YoY. The business benefited from
increased data usage and customer additions as well as an increased uptake in data packages as it
focuses on affordability and customer value management (CVM) initiatives.

                                                                                                                                           
The consumer postpaid business recorded a 3,1% growth in service revenue, achieved in a highly
competitive environment. The business benefited from efforts to reduce churn as well as Data First
(Mega Deals) offers driving uptake of data-rich contracts.

The enterprise business continued recording growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Service
revenue was up 17,2%, boosted by customised data deals for universities to facilitate ‘learn from
home’ initiatives as well as the uptake of ‘work from home’ solutions. As these deals were on a short-
term basis, there was a slowdown in the quarter reflecting the university churn, however the focus
remains on base retention as well as on adding new corporate customers.

Wholesale revenue declined by 14,4%, impacted by the lost national roaming revenue from the
discontinuation of the agreement with Telkom and the effect of continuing to account for Cell C
revenue on a cash basis. MTN SA recognised approximately R1,3 billion in national roaming revenue
in the nine months to 30 September 2020 (taking into consideration that no Cell C revenue was
recognised in Q3 2019), while R698 million of Cell C revenue remained unrecognised as at
September 2020. The implementation continues of Phase 2 of the Cell C roaming agreement, which
commenced on 1 May 2020.

MTN SA produced a solid EBITDA margin of 39,3%, expanding by 2,7pp, aided by the reductions in
device volumes and subsidies, execution of the cost efficiency programme as well as channel
optimisation.

Since launching MoMo in South Africa in January 2020, this service continues to scale, with
approximately 2,0 million registered users at 30 September 2020. The focus remains on growing the
platform through innovative and relevant service offerings.

In the quarter, MTN SA maintained its leading network experience ranking and once again achieved
the highest ranking on the MyBroadband Network Quality Score in all main areas of the country.

Since launching MTN 5G in June, MTN SA continued to deliver 5G connectivity with more than 100
sites and across multiple spectrum bands. Our network resilience programme is mitigating the impacts
of load shedding and load reduction in order to guarantee the best customer experience, despite a
further increase in power outages in September.

This very strong network performance has also been assisted by the Independent Communications
Authority of South Africa (ICASA) issuing certain high demand frequency spectrum to MTN on a
temporary basis. Such frequencies were deployed in urban and rural areas to alleviate congestion and
provide further world-class quality and speeds to our customers during the COVID-19 lockdown
period. On 30 September, ICASA announced the broad terms of the planned spectrum auction and
the wholesale open access network (WOAN), as well as the decision to extend the temporary
allocation of spectrum.

Q3 saw MTN SA staff continuing with work from home arrangements, with most remaining at home.
This includes many of the in-house call centre agents who have been set-up at home so they can
continue serving our customers. Staff in our branded stores continued to adhere to the strict COVID-
19 social distancing and sanitation protocols and during the quarter, MTN SA concluded its mass
testing of customer-facing employees. Through the MTN Y’ello Hope programme, the MTN
Foundation provided 16 NGOs with support in the form of PPE and food parcels. MTN SA has now
zero-rated over 950 health, education and employment websites, including all public universities,
TVET colleges, as well as hundreds of schools and NPOs, as guided by the Department of
Communications and Digital Technology working group, including the Department of Basic Education.
MTN SA also collaborated on the national launch of the COVID SA Alert app which is also zero-rated.


MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria delivered a solid performance in a challenging operating environment, with service
revenue growth of 13,8% and an acceleration in Q3 growth to 16,5% YoY. This performance was largely
driven by continued growth in data and a recovery in voice against a backdrop of ongoing oil price
volatility, COVID-19-related pressures and scarcity of foreign exchange.

Voice revenue grew by 4,0%, with a recovery in the trend to 7,0% YoY in Q3, on the back of expanded
customer acquisition touch points, rural telephony initiatives as well as revamped offers and CVM
toolkits to increase usage and traffic. MTN Nigeria added 3,9 million customers in Q3, bringing the
overall base to 75 million subscribers.

Data continued on a strong trajectory of growth with revenue up 57,1%. Continuing the momentum
from H1, Q3 growth was 56,0% YoY and was delivered through a combination of increased active data
users and usage, which drove higher traffic. The number of active data subscribers increased by
1,7 million, to close the quarter at 30,7 million. Some 2,9 million new smartphones connected to the
MTN Nigeria network, increasing smartphone penetration to 45,2% of the base – up from 43,5% in Q2
and 41,7% in Q3 2019.

Growth in the digital business remained strong off a low base, increasing by 116,1% and 103% YoY in
Q3. This was supported by increased adoption of digital products and services offered into the
1,5 million active user base.

Fintech revenue rose by 28,2%, and by 25,9% YoY in Q3. Increased adoption of airtime lending service
MTN Xtratime remains the key driver of growth in the business. The strategic and commercial
initiatives to scale the business are ahead of schedule with over 90 000 new MoMo agents added in
the quarter, which ended with 311 770 registered agents – this exceeded the year-end target of
300 000. MTN Nigeria increased its fintech subscribers by 1,2 million to reach 3,4 million in Q3, and
the volume of transactions processed increased by 101,0% in the period to 29,4 million.

Enterprise revenue grew by 2,0% but declined in Q3 by 2,1% YoY largely due to the economic impact
of the lockdown on the businesses we support. However, there was some improvement in the Q3
performance compared to Q2 as economic activity started to recover.

EBITDA rose by 7,9% and the EBITDA margin was 51,0%, from 53,7%. This was impacted by the
combined effects of a 2,5% increase in value-added tax (VAT), the change in the treatment of non-
recoverable VAT on lease payments, and COVID-19-related costs. The EBITDA margin was also affected
by the accelerated 4G site rollout, which commenced in Q4 2019, resulting in the full impact of
increased lease rentals coming through in 2020. This put upward pressure on lease rental costs in the
period, along with the effects of a 23,9% adjustment in the official exchange rate.


Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region
The SEAGHA region delivered another solid performance, navigating the challenging trading
conditions brought about by COVID-19 and aided by the revival in some economic activity into Q3 as
lockdown restrictions were eased. SEAGHA recorded a strong increase in service revenue of 19,2%,
with all operating companies improving in Q3 to drive aggregate regional growth of 19,8% YoY. The
region increased subscribers by 3,8 million to 55,1 million.

MTN Ghana produced another good performance, with service revenue growing by 18,8%, driven by
double-digit improvements in voice (up 12,0%) and data (up 21,0%) revenue along with further solid
fintech revenue growth (up 24,8%). The growth in revenue was supported by strong increases in
overall subscribers as well as in active data and fintech users, while the ongoing deployment of CVM
helped to manage churn and improve adoption and usage of product and service offerings.

The EBITDA margin for MTN Ghana expanded by 3,2pp to 53,3%, supported by various cost efficiency
initiatives including enhanced penetration of electronic distribution channels and optimising network
costs.

MTN Uganda increased service revenue by 9,6%, with a recovery in most revenue lines. Notably, the
pleasing growth in voice (up 4,4%), data (up 30,1%) and fintech revenue (up 10,5%) was supported by
increases in the user base and usage. The EBITDA margin expanded by 1,4pp to 49,0%, supported by
higher revenue and cost efficiency initiatives.

Overall, the SEAGHA portfolio excluding MTN Ghana delivered healthy service revenue growth of
19,6%, and 22,0% YoY in Q3.


West and Central Africa (WECA) region
The WECA region grew service revenue by 7,8%, and by 9,3% YoY in Q3 – well-above the blended
average inflation of approximately 3,0% across the region. This was a pleasing outcome in light of
ongoing uncertainty in the political and economic environment in various markets within the WECA
portfolio. Q3 showed some signs of economic recovery, although there remains pressure from the
effects of COVID-19. The overall service revenue performance was enabled by continued subscriber
growth of 1,5 million QoQ to 38,6 million, and improvements in fintech and data revenue.

MTN Ivory Coast recorded an increase in service revenue of 8,3%, supported by net additions of
0,6 million in Q3 as well as ongoing strong revenue growth in data (up 25,1%) and fintech (up 14,2%).
The effective execution of marketing, sales and distribution initiatives implemented during the period
helped to drive gains in market share and an acceleration in voice revenue, which increased by 2,8%
(up 5,7% YoY in Q3). The EBITDA margin widened by 5,9pp to 34,2%.

MTN Cameroon’s service revenue grew by 4,7%, achieving further market and value share gains, in a
challenging environment as the conflict in the Northwest/Southwest regions continued. Data revenue
was up by 19,7% and fintech revenue increased by 40,8%. The EBITDA margin for MTN Cameroon
improved by 2,4pp to 33,0%.

Excluding MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast, the WECA markets grew their service revenue by an
aggregate of 9,2%, and 10,1% YoY in Q3.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region
The performance delivered by the MENA region was pleasing in a persistently difficult operating
environment, with double-digit service revenue growth of 22,7%, and of 24,7% in Q3. This was largely
supported by solid growth in data revenue (up 46,2%) with an 11,2% YoY increase in active data
subscribers in the nine months to September 2020. Total subscribers (excluding MTN Irancell)
increased by 0,2 million in the quarter to 25,5 million.

MTN Syria grew service revenue by 23,9%, driven by growth in voice (up 9,6%) and data (up 33,5%).
The EBITDA margin declined by 15,4pp to 23,2% as a result of a material devaluation in the local
currency, which put pressure on foreign-denominated operational expenditure.

MTN Sudan increased service revenue by 71,4%, underpinned by growth in voice (up 53,1%) and data
(up 122,8%) on the back of increased active data subscribers and usage. The EBITDA margin expanded
by 10,4pp to 39,9%, driven by strong growth in revenue.

MTN Irancell, our equity-accounted joint venture, again delivered strong underlying growth despite a
challenging operating environment including the depreciation of the currency and the high rate of
inflation. Service revenue grew by 34,4%, with data revenue up by 51,2%, benefiting from increased
usage (up 82,2%) particularly during the hard lockdown period. The EBITDA margin increased by 0,7pp
to 37,5%.


Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme (ARP)
Our ARP, initially launched in March 2019 and enhanced in March 2020, aims to reduce debt, simplify
our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise capital of at least an additional R25 billion over
three to five years. In August 2020, the group announced its decision to focus on its pan-African
strategy and exit the Middle East region in an orderly manner over the medium term.

Discussions regarding the potential sale of our 20% shareholding in Belgacom International Carrier
Services SA (BICS) are ongoing and we will update the market of any further developments in this
regard.

MTN Syria is included in those assets classified as held for sale and it remains the group’s intention to
exit its 75% stake in the business.

The group has now fully exited its 18,9% investment in Jumia Technologies AG (Jumia), realising a total
consideration of approximately R2,3 billion (US$138 million). We are proud to have been a partner in
the evolution of one of Africa’s pioneering online marketplace businesses and will continue our
relationship with Jumia through ongoing operational partnerships in some markets.


                                                                                                        
We are pleased to announce that a sale and purchase agreement has been concluded to transfer an
8% holding in MTN Zambia to the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) in Zambia. This forms
part of the localisation strategy within our broader portfolio optimisation and ARP. The group has
received net proceeds of approximately R204 million for the transaction.

In September 2018, MTN Ghana completed an initial public offer in which 12.5% of its shares were
listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and nearly 130,000 Ghanaians were welcomed as
shareholders in the company. MTN Group intends to sell down a further 12.5% of its investment in
MTN Ghana, with a focus on local shareholding, which will increase MTN Ghana’s free-float on the
GSE to 25%.


Update on regulatory and legal considerations
MTN Afghanistan anti-terrorism complaint
On 27 December 2019, a complaint for violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act was filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia (the Complaint). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009
and 2017, and on behalf of their families. The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses
supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure.
The defendants named in the Complaint are made up of a number of different groups of affiliated
companies, one of which is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies, including MTN Afghanistan.

In late April 2020, MTN filed a ‘motion to dismiss’ that asked the court to end the lawsuit and grant a
judgment in MTN’s favour for two independent reasons: because the court lacks jurisdiction over
MTN, which does not operate in the United States, and because the complaint does not allege any
conduct by MTN that would have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.

In June 2020, the plaintiffs in the matter filed an amended Complaint to which further complainants,
defendants and allegations were added. MTN believes that the amended Complaint suffers from the
same fundamental defects in the case explained in the April motion. The plaintiffs proceeded to
amend their initial Complaint, following the June 2020 motion to dismiss. With the Complaint having
been amended with new allegations, MTN filed another motion to dismiss in September 2020. This
motion to dismiss takes into account the new allegations made in the amended Complaint. MTN
remains of the view that the court should dismiss this claim on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and
that the amended Complaint still does not allege any conduct by MTN that is in violation of the Anti-
Terrorism Act.

MTN conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories and will defend
its position where necessary.

MTN Ghana classification as a significant market power
In June 2020, the National Communications Authority (NCA) classified MTN Ghana as a significant
market power (SMP) and determined that special regulatory restrictions would be enforced on MTN
Ghana.

Following consultations as well as engagements on the matter with regulatory and other stakeholders,
MTN Ghana applied to the courts – on procedural grounds – for relief in the form of a judicial review
of the NCA’s decision. Given the progress made in further engagements with the NCA and Ghana’s
Ministry of Communications, MTN Ghana, on 13 October 2020, withdrew its legal challenge filed at
the Supreme Court in order to pave the way for further discussions and an amicable resolution. These
discussions are ongoing.

MTN Ghana is a responsible market player in a highly competitive market and does not engage in anti-
competitive behaviour.

Spectrum allocation and auction in South Africa
On 2 October 2020, ICASA released the full terms of the spectrum auction and WOAN. The auction
will include spectrum in the 700-800 MHz band, 2,6 GHz band and 3,5 GHz band. The 2,3 GHz will be
auctioned at a later stage to be determined. The temporary spectrum allocated at the start of
lockdown, and which was due to expire in November 2020, has been extended to March 2021. This
continues to significantly ease the congestion in hotspots across the country where data traffic has
surged. MTN welcomes the planned spectrum auction, which will be critical in further broadening
access in South Africa in a sustainable manner.


COVID-19 pandemic impact on the business
Although the trading environment remains quite challenging, the easing of lockdown regulations and
restrictions that have arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some improvement in economic
activity and market conditions. We remain focused on the key areas impacting our business, namely:
social (our people, communities and stakeholders); commercial (including our customers); network
and supply chain; and funding and liquidity.

Social
We continue to implement strict health measures and monitoring to ensure the safety of our people,
who remain empowered to work remotely although some have started returning to workplaces. The
group provides ongoing support through the MTN Global Staff Emergency Fund, Y’ello Hope Packages
for our stakeholders as well as MTN foundations and various government-led initiatives in our
markets, including the Solidarity Fund in South Africa.

In September, MTN added its voice to global efforts to encourage the wearing of masks to fight the
spread of COVID-19, committing our marketing resources in the month to our #WearItForMe
campaign across our markets.

Commercial
Our commercial trends have been encouraging as COVID-19 restrictions have eased across the MTN
footprint. Overall data traffic has remained resilient at elevated levels, although we have observed
some easing from the peaks. Voice traffic and revenue, which initially came under significant pressure,
have been in recovery and the month-to-month trajectory of fintech drivers has trended upwards
following a dip in April 2020.

Comparing the September 2020 level for the group’s data traffic against April 2020, the level of activity
was 10,2% higher, and up 8,9% QoQ in Q3. For our largest markets on the same basis: MTN SA was up
by 2,0% (and 4,1% QoQ), MTN Nigeria increased by 22,1% (and 15,2% QoQ), while MTN Ghana was
up by 9,3% (and 5,6% QoQ). These trends demonstrate the resilience of data traffic relative to the
elevated activity prompted by COVID-19 during Q2.

On the whole, data demand benefited from shifts in consumer spending patterns during the peak
periods of lockdowns and restrictions as spend that would have otherwise been directed elsewhere
(such as travel, entertainment etc) was channelled into data and other digital services. As restrictions
have been lifted, we have observed some reversal in this trend.

Since April 2020, during which the effects of COVID-19 were the most severe, the trajectory for voice
has been encouraging. Group voice traffic was up by 11,5% at the end of September 2020 compared
to the April 2020 level. For MTN SA, voice traffic was 7,0% higher in September versus April, MTN
Nigeria was up by 14,1% and MTN Ghana had increased by 5,6%. These trends are evidence of the
recovery in voice traffic since the most severe impacts of COVID-19.

The commercial trends in fintech have also recovered strongly from the April 2020 low, with group
fintech transaction volumes in September 2020 up by 38,7% on the April 2020 level and up 23,1%
QoQ. On the same basis, the value of fintech transactions in US dollar terms was up by 64,7% and
33,7% respectively.

As we continue our focus on managing the risks posed by the pandemic, we are also focused on
continued commercial execution around the opportunities it presents. In particular, we are well
positioned for the accelerated need for digitalisation, which is already evident in the trajectory of our
data, fintech and digital businesses.

Network and supply chain
Throughout the pandemic we have maintained the capacity and resilience of our networks. As
lockdown regulations have lifted in our markets, we have been able to resume a more regular rollout
of network investment as restrictions on movement and logistical bottlenecks have eased. This has
also enabled us to increase the headroom in our networks, notably in South Africa and Nigeria among
our larger markets.

To ensure there are no significant interruptions to our business, we continue to closely monitor and
manage the impact of the pandemic on our network and supply chain. At the end of September 2020,
the headroom on our data networks was 45,0% in South Africa, 58,0% in Nigeria and 30,0% in Ghana.

Funding and liquidity
The strength and resilience of our balance sheet has been evidenced in our ability to weather the
volatility brought about by COVID-19. Year to date we have successfully fast-tracked and closed
R18,2 billion in funding to mitigate refinance risk around upcoming maturities. We continued to
manage and focus on liquidity as a priority. At 30 September 2020, our group net debt was
R60,6 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0,9x, well within our covenant of 2,5x. Our interest
cover was 9,0x, comparing favourably with the covenant limit of no less than 5,0x.

At the holdco level we maintained a healthy liquidity position, with holdco net debt of R55,5 billion
slightly higher than the December 2019 level. At the end of September 2020, our holdco leverage was
2,6x, affected mainly by timing effects of cash upstreaming from our opcos, although slightly improved
on the June 2020 level of 2,7x.

MTN Nigeria has declared and paid its final dividend for 2019 as well as its interim 2020 dividend
(totalling R5,4 billion as at September 2020). The upstreaming of this cash to the group remained
delayed in Q3 due to challenges in securing foreign currency in that market, however we expect the
availability of US dollars to improve in the last quarter of the year and some upstreaming of dividends
to resume.

Our approach to liquidity management continues to be prudent and focused on cash preservation. At
30 September 2020, our holdco liquidity headroom stood at approximately R39,0 billion – comprising
R13,4 billion in cash and R25,6 billion in committed, undrawn credit facilities.

Our medium-term focus remains to reduce our exposure to US dollar debt and improve the funding
mix at the holdco level through improved cash flows which will be supported by proceeds from our
ARP.

Management changes
On 26 October 2020, we announced two important new appointments: that of CEO of major subsidiary
MTN Nigeria and that of MTN Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO), a new group executive committee
(exco) position. Both are effective from 1 March 2021.

Karl Toriola, current vice president for MTN Group’s WECA region, will take over as MTN Nigeria CEO
from Ferdi Moolman, who has served MTN Nigeria with distinction for the past five years. Ferdi will
return to South Africa, where he will assume the new role of GCRO and lead the evolution of our
enterprise-wide risk management system. Both will remain members of the group’s exco.

Karl’s successor as Vice President for WECA will be announced after the group strategy review is
completed by the end of November 2020.

Outlook
Despite the relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions across our markets, the operating
environment remains challenging and uncertain. We will continue to focus our efforts and capital
investments on ensuring we provide our customers with reliable connectivity and digital services
during these challenging times.

While we continue to manage the risks brought about by COVID-19, we are also well-positioned to
unlock the opportunities that have arisen. The pandemic and its effects have highlighted the
importance of connectivity, financial inclusion and digital services, and we are reviewing and refining
our strategy to position the business to capture growth going forward.

As we continue to strengthen our operational and financial position – focusing on expense
management and efficiencies, as well as liquidity and cash preservation – we are well placed to sustain
growth and meet our targets over the medium term. Our capital expenditure (capex) programme
prioritises the resilience and capacity of our networks, while we execute our strategy to deliver
sustainable growth across our operations.

We target capex of at least R26,0 billion for 2020, revised up from the previous guidance of
R24,0 billion as the overall visibility and ability to roll out the network investment in our footprint has
improved following the relaxation of COVID-19 related regulations and restrictions.

presenting the pro forma financial information and for the completeness and accuracy of the pro forma financial information is that of the
directors of MTN. This is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information may not fairly
present MTN’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows. It has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has not been reviewed and
reported on by MTN’s external auditors. Constant currency information has been presented to remove the impact of movement in currency
rates on the group's results and has been calculated by translating the prior financial reporting period’s results at the current period’s average
rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira.
The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results compared to the current
year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has
been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary
for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Commentary
The year to date has been characterised largely by the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on the business.
COVID-19 has had a significant effect on the economy with the informal sector severely impacted. Consequently,
GDP growth has been revised downwards from 6.8% to about 1%, as announced by the Ghanaian Finance
Minister during the presentation of the mid-year review of the Budget Statement and Economic Policy for the
2020 financial year.

COVID-19 has led to shifts in consumer behaviour with the dependency on, and usage of, digital options
increasing significantly. The increase in demand for digital and data services have placed significant pressure on
our network infrastructure. This has necessitated our capex spend of GH¢876 million in network capacity and
infrastructure expansion projects to meet the needs of Ghanaians in this era of accelerated digitalisation and we
are committed to the further investments required.

Our investments to date will support and enable continued economic productivity. In the period, we have rolled
out 115 2G, 115 3G and 547 LTE sites, which has supported a significant improvement in network coverage,
customer experience and quality of service (QoS). This has helped us to accommodate the demand for digital
and data services that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Service revenue increased by 18.8%, supported by growth in voice, data, MoMo and digital revenue.

Voice revenue grew by 12.1%, benefitting from an increase in the number of subscribers * (+8.7%) during the
period, as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage churn and
improve usage. The contribution of voice to service revenue declined from 45.0% to 42.5% YoY in favour of our
new growth areas in line with our revenue diversification strategy and building a digital operator.

Data revenue growth of 20.7% was driven by an increase in active data subscribers # (+8.3%), a higher number of
smartphones on the network (+12.6%) and a general increase in demand and 58.9% growth in usage. Data
revenue contribution to service revenue increased from 28.5% to 29.0% YoY.

The growth in MoMo revenue (up 27.3%) was supported by an increase in the number of active users * (+4.3%)
from new activations in the period, higher person-to-person (P2P) transactional activity and broader penetration
of more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and international remittances. MoMo revenue
contribution to service revenue increased from 18.5% to 19.9% YoY.

Digital revenue continued its recovery (up 52.9%), driven by growth in the number of active subscribers *
(+13.7%) as well as improvements to our video and gaming offerings and increased adoption of our MyMTN and
Ayoba messaging apps. Digital revenue contribution to service revenue increased from 3.4% to 4.4% YoY.

Reported EBITDA grew by 26.7%, with a corresponding margin expansion of 3.3 pp to 53.3%. Our margin
improvement continued to benefit from our cost efficiency initiatives, digital distribution efficiencies and other
transformation activities.

Growth in top-line revenue, coupled with short-term cuts in expenses and cash preservation as a response to
COVID-19, resulted in an increase (+53.1%) in profit after tax.


COVID-19
Over the period we have seen a progressive removal of COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the President of Ghana
earlier in the year and the economy continues to open up. We have also seen the level of active cases drop
below 500 following proactive interventions from the Government. Despite the positive developments, we
continue to experience some supply chain challenges, as well as the overall effects of the economic slowdown
on our manufacturing and hospitality customers. We are seeing some improvements in activity from our small
and medium enterprise (SME) customers, though the level of activity following the general decline due to COVID-
19 remains subdued.

The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity and consumer incomes showed some easing through the third
quarter and this trend is expected to continue through the final quarter of the year.

In our bid to continue supporting Government’s efforts and promote activities that are in the best interest of
the safety of our customers, MobileMoney Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scancom PLC, extended the
offer for free MoMo P2P transfers up to a value of GH¢100 per day to the end of 2020. This will save customers
an estimated total of at least GH¢90 million in transaction fees while promoting the safety of Ghanaians and
deepening financial inclusion.

MTN Ghana continues to support Government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic by providing free
access to over 200 websites for online education for public and private institutions until the end of the pandemic.
To date, we have supported over 4.5 million students and teachers with over 150 Terabytes of free data valued
at more than GH¢3 million. To augment this effort, MTN through the MTN Ghana Foundation donated GH¢5
million worth of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff
through the Government’s COVID-19 Trust Fund activities.

In support of Government’s efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic and to keep Ghanaians safe, MTN Ghana
launched the ‘BE WISE’ campaign aimed at encouraging Ghanaians across the nation to keep wearing their face
masks and wear them the correct way to protect themselves and their loved ones. Together with donations of
PPEs, this campaign has created awareness to protecting one another through a selfless act of wear ones’ face
mask. Today, this campaign has transitioned into the MTN’s global ‘Wear It For Me’ campaign which seeks to
continue creating awareness of wearing face masks in order to protect our loved ones, future generations and
prevent another wave of the pandemic.

We will continue to provide PPEs and sanitizers, and ensure all safety protocols are adhered to, across our branch
network. The cumulative value of our efforts in the fight against COVID-19 stood at approximately GH¢100
million as at end of September 2020.

We remain focused on our people, customers, network resilience and efficiency in delivering on our quest to
make the lives of our customers a whole lot BRIGHTer in these uncertain times.

Regulatory update
On September 1st, 2020, the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) dismissed the company’s application –
made on procedural grounds – for a judicial review of the declaration by the National Communications Authority
(NCA) of MTN Ghana as a significant market power (SMP).

On September 4th, MTN Ghana filed an application with the Supreme Court to review the High Court’s
judgement. Following that, MTN Ghana embarked on a series of engagements with the regulator and other key
stakeholders to have the concerns raised addressed in an amicable manner.

Given the progress made, in good faith, on settlement discussions with the NCA and Ministry of
Communications, the company on October 13th, 2020 withdrew its application filed at the Supreme Court. It is
our expectation that this action will pave the way for further discussions and an amicable resolution, using the
renewed channels of engagement. We remain grateful to the NCA, the Ministry of Communications and key
stakeholders for their openness and commitment to engage with the view to resolve the issues amicably.

MTN Ghana remains focused on providing the enabling technology to support Ghana’s digital economy through
partnerships with the Government of Ghana and other Ghanaian telecommunications players.

Further Localisation of Scancom PLC
In September 2018, Scancom PLC completed an initial public offer in which 12.5% of its shares was listed on the
Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) and nearly 130,000 Ghanaians were welcomed as shareholders in the company.
MTN Group has agreed with the Government of Ghana to sell down a further 12.5% of its investment in Scancom
PLC, with a focus on local shareholding, which will increase Scancom PLC’s shareholding on the GSE to 25%. This
process of further increasing localisation and deepening shared value is underway and we look forward to
providing updates in future performance updates.

2021 marks MTN Ghana’s 25th Anniversary
2021 marks the 25th anniversary of MTN Ghana and as part of the celebrations, MTN is committing the
equivalent of $25 million (or GH¢150 million) to a fund supporting Ghana’s post-COVID-19 recovery efforts. MTN
Ghana will seek to further its strategic partnership with the Government of Ghana through investments in digital
ecosystem projects as part of Governments long-term transformation agenda. We will share more details in H1
2021, about this exciting development when plans are finalised with Government and partners .

Outlook
Although a progressive recovery is expected into 2021, the macro outlook for the rest of 2020 remains relatively
uncertain. As a business, we remain cautious of the uncertainties surrounding the extent of economic impact of
COVID-19 although the continued gradual opening up of the economy is encouraging. We expect business
performance to continue to be influenced by the shifts in consumer behaviour towards accelerated digital
adoption and usage as well as the rate of economic recovery following the easing of COVID-19 regulations and
restrictions imposed earlier in the year. There would be continuous need for more capex and related opex to
accommodate the usage growth and build resilience in all areas including cyber security. Certain costs had to be
postponed whilst managing the COVID-related uncertainties would start to be incurred as the local and global
economies open up more and more.

Our focus remains our employees’ and customers’ safety; regulatory risk; supply chain challenges mitigation;
liquidity, currency and counterparty risk management; and the potential revenue impact of reduced consumer
spend. Our social support programs towards those severely impacted by the pandemic will continue.

In the fourth quarter of the year, we continue our journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications
operator to an emerging digital operator, with 2020 being the ‘Year of the customer: the digital experience’.

MTN Nigeria is one of Africa’s largest providers of communications services, connecting over 75 million people in communities across the
country with each other and the world. Guided by a vision to lead the delivery of a bold new digital world, MTN Nigeria’s leadership position
in coverage, capacity and innovation has remained constant since its launch in 2001. MTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group – a multinational
telecommunications group which operates in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East.



MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:
“The year 2020 has been challenging for everyone. The COVID-19 pandemic was first reported in Nigeria during
the first quarter of 2020 and the country has, to date, registered over 62,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths
according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Many share a common distressing story of health,
social and financial consequences of the pandemic. The recent agitations across the country are of further
concern and our thoughts and prayers are with all those directly and indirectly affected.

Through all these, we recognise that we must keep rising the best way we have learnt to do, which is together.
That is why our priorities have remained focused on continuing to provide and invest in a network that brings
people together and provides a platform for everyone’s voice to be heard. It also enables the accelerated need
for digitalisation where more people work from home with increasing reliance on a ubiquitous and effective
digital network.

As part of our COVID-19 response, we launched various initiatives to provide support for our people, customers
and the various levels of government. We were pleased that over 75% of our customers benefitted from the free
SMS under our Y’ello Hope package aimed mainly at the vulnerable in the society. This initiative enabled our
customers to send over 4.3 billion messages and stay connected to family and friends in the midst of social
distancing imperatives.

We provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers and facilitated zero-rated access to
healthcare websites, also aimed at supporting individuals and institutions, mindful that all hands must be on
deck to stem the pandemic. When we deployed our Wear-it-for-me campaign, we leveraged on the power of
community and the family ties that bind us, to help create awareness around wearing masks, again as part of
Y’ello Hope.

Continuing our national support in relation to the disruptive effect of the pandemic, we launched The MTN Revv
Programme in August to expand our support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across the country. The
programme is designed to help SMEs reposition their businesses for growth in the emerging digital economy, and
includes masterclasses, advisory services, marketing and technology support. The first phase, which is the
masterclass, has engaged more than 18,000 SME participants so far. Based on the popularity of the programme,
we now plan to hold it annually.

We are humbled that MTN Nigeria was named the ‘Most Responsive Organisation to COVID-19’ at the 2020
Nigerian Risk Awards. This is a reflection of our commitment to the initiatives we implemented in response to
the pandemic. We will continue to provide support as the country navigates the pandemic and its associated
impact.

During the period under review, we saw volatility in both voice and data revenue, affecting the trajectory of our
overall service revenue, as well as pressure on costs, which continues to impact our operating margins,
dampening profitability.

Following a decline in voice traffic and an acceleration in data during lockdowns in Q2, we have seen a
normalisation of traffic as restrictions have been removed, with a recovery in voice traffic and continued growth
in data. This has supported a 13.9% growth in service revenue, with an acceleration of growth to 16.5% in Q3
specifically.

Data revenue rose by 57.0%, with an increase in data usage and traffic. Revenue from digital and fintech services
rose by 114.3% and 28.3% respectively, while voice revenue growth was 4.2%.

We saw a significant increase in our subscriber base with the addition of 3.9 million customers in Q3, bringing
total subscribers to 75 million. Cumulative net additions totalled 10.7 million in the nine months to September
2020 the first time we have exceeded 10 million additions in an annual cycle with one quarter remaining. We
also connected 1.7 million new users to the internet in Q3 (5.5 million for the nine months), bringing our active
data subscribers to 30.7 million.

To accommodate the increase in traffic and enhance service quality for all our customers, we continued to invest
in the capacity and resilience of our network, accelerating our 4G rollout and expanding our investments in rural
connectivity. Our 4G network now covers 52.9% of the population, up from 48.6% in Q2 and 35.4% in Q3 2019.

The growth in our digital business continued to accelerate from a low base, and our fintech business delivered
impressive results. In Q3, we surpassed our year-end target of 300,000 registered Mobile Money (MoMo) agents,
as we continued to convert our traditional airtime agents. Our fintech subscribers increased by 1.2 million in the
quarter to 3.4 million, driving higher transaction volumes and fintech revenue growth.

EBITDA rose by 9.1%, supported by service revenue growth. However, the EBITDA margin declined by 2.3pp to
51.0% due to cost pressures arising mainly from increased investments in our network and the impact on costs
of the depreciation to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and NAFEX exchange rates, affecting in particular the
costs of our lease contracts. PBT and EPS declined by 0.6% and 3.3% respectively; however, we saw a recovery in
Q3 with a growth of 2.2% YoY in PBT and a marginal decline of 0.7% YoY in EPS.

Finally, we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Rob Shuter, former Group CEO of MTN Group
and former Board member of MTN Nigeria, who resigned with effect from 1 September 2020. We appreciate his
exemplary leadership and commitment to the Company.”

Operational review
We made significant progress in building the base for our business, with 75.0 million subscribers connected to
our networks and accessing communication services as of September 2020. The growth in our subscriber base
provided support for voice revenue, which accounted for 67.2% of service revenue and rose by 4.2%, with an
acceleration in growth to 7.0% YoY in Q3. The key drivers for this were our expanded customer acquisition
touchpoints, rural telephony initiatives and revamped acquisition offers using our customer value management
toolkit.

Data revenue (24.8% of service revenue) continued to grow strongly, building on the positive momentum from
H1. The performance in data was delivered through a combination of increased subscribers, usage (MB per user)
and ultimately traffic, supported by increased network capacity and 4G penetration. Data traffic rose by 135.6%
YoY and average usage by 70.4%. We added 2.9 million new smartphones to our network in the quarter, bringing
smartphone penetration to 45.2% of our base, up from 43.5% in Q2 and 41.7% in Q3 2019.

Digital revenue improved strongly off a low base, rising by 114.3%. This was driven by the increased uptake of
our enhanced digital offerings, supported by our active base of 1.5 million users and partnerships with digital
content providers.

Our fintech business continued to grow, with MTN Xtratime as a key revenue driver. We expanded our MoMo
agent network with the addition of over 90,000 registered agents during the quarter and broadened our service
offerings to include bill payments as well as bank deposit and withdrawals through the agents. At the end of Q3,
we recorded 311,770 registered MoMo agents, surpassing our year-end target and processing more than 29.4
million transactions (up 101% QoQ in Q3), from an active base of 3.4 million subscribers.

Enterprise revenue grew by 2.0% YoY in the first nine months but declined by 2.1% YoY in Q3 due to the
economic impact of the lockdown on the businesses we support. However, we are encouraged by the recovery
we saw on a sequential QoQ basis as economic activity started to pick up in the quarter. Our enterprise business
includes revenue from mobile and fixed connectivity, cloud and ICT solutions, and devices. It cuts across voice,
data and digital services for SMEs, the public sector and large enterprise customers.

Capital expenditure (“capex”) was N194.2 billion, up 26.1%. Excluding right of use assets, capex was down by
2.5% to N130.1 billion. In Q3, we were able to ramp up site rollout by 46.2% YoY, following a slowdown in Q2
due to a scarcity of foreign exchange and port congestion.

The aggressive 4G site rollout, which commenced in Q4 2019, resulted in the full impact of increased lease
rentals coming through in 2020. This, together with the effects of a 23.9% adjustment to the official exchange
rate, put upward pressure on lease rental costs in the period. In addition to this, the combined effect of the 2.5%
increase in value-added tax (“VAT”), the change in the treatment of non-recoverable VAT on lease payments,
and COVID-19-related costs led to a 24.9% increase in operating expenses with a commensurate knock-on effect
on EBITDA.

EBITDA rose by 9.1%, and the EBITDA margin was 51.0%. We delivered a healthy free cash flow of N303.6 billion,
up 0.4%. Overall, PBT declined marginally by 0.6%, mainly due to an increase in finance costs arising from higher
borrowings. PAT and EPS declined by 3.3% respectively, reflecting an increase in taxation mainly due to lower
investment allowance and exempt income.

CEO succession
We have previously announced the appointment of Mr Karl Toriola as the CEO designate for MTN Nigeria. His
appointment is effective 1 March 2021, when he will take over from the current CEO, Mr Ferdi Moolman.

Mr. Toriola is currently the Vice President, West and Central Africa (WECA) for MTN Group, a role he has held
since 2016. During this period, he has overseen the steady progress of the operating companies in that region
as well as the significant commercial and strategic strides made in some if its markets. This includes the
development of mobile financial services which is an important driver of our medium to long-term growth
strategy. Mr Toriola has held a number of senior operational roles since joining the MTN Group, including CEO
of MTN Cameroon and Chief Technical Officer for Nigeria, and also serves on the boards of a number of its
subsidiary companies, including MTN Nigeria.

Mr Moolman will exit his current role as MTN Nigeria’s CEO with effect from 1 March 2021 and assume a new
role as MTN Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO). Mr Moolman joined MTN Nigeria, first as CFO in 2014 and became
CEO in 2015. Under his leadership, significant progress has been made in stabilising the business and setting it
on a sustainable growth path. He will remain on the Board of MTN Nigeria in his new role as the MTN GCRO.

Outlook
Despite the relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, the operating environment remains challenging. We will
continue to build on our operational and financial resilience and execute on our strategy to position the business
for sustained growth over the medium and long term. The availability of foreign exchange remains a constraint
even as we strive to minimise its impact on the business.

In the remaining quarter of 2020, we will build on the momentum from Q3 to further expand 4G coverage and
broaden rural connectivity. This, backed by our revamped acquisition offers, will help to boost subscriber
acquisition as well as support the continued growth in voice and data revenue.

For our digital business, we will focus on growing the active base and building partnerships with digital content
providers to stimulate increased adoption and usage of our services. Progress in our MoMo business remains on
track as we continue to expand the agent network and financial service offerings to drive adoption.

While the exchange rate impact on our lease rental costs continues to put downward pressure on EBITDA margin
into Q4, we will continue to drive service revenue growth and optimise our balance sheet to unlock efficiency
and support margins.

Iran. He has spent the past five years as the CEO of MTN Nigeria and during that time, significant
progress has been made in stabilizing the business and setting it on a sustainable growth path.

The management of enterprise-wide risk is integral to MTN’s growth strategy and Ferdi will bring
extensive operational and financial experience to the role given his deep knowledge of the Group, its
markets and the telecoms sector. As such, this appointment establishes the role of a chief risk officer

MTN is pleased to announce the appointment of Karl Toriola as the MTN Nigeria CEO, effective

companies (“OpCo’s”) in the region, notably the turnaround of MTN Ivory Coast and MTN Cameroon
over the past two years.

In addition, the WECA markets have made significant commercial and strategic strides, including the
improvement of market shares within the region and the development of mobile financial services,
which is an important driver of the Group’s medium to long-term growth strategy.

Karl (48) has also held a number of senior operational roles at MTN, since joining the Group in 2006,
including Chief Technical Officer of MTN Nigeria and CEO of MTN Cameroon. He is also a board

treatment of foreign currency translation reserves (“FCTR”)

In its trading statement dated 31 July 2020, and its interim financial results released on 6 August 2020, MTN
communicated a voluntary change in accounting policy relating to the treatment of FCTR. IAS 21 - The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, requires that, on the disposal of a foreign business operation, the cumulative
amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign business operation recognised in equity on the
statement of financial position over time, shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification
adjustment when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

MTN is hosting a workshop for sell-side analysts to discuss the principles and implications of this above-mentioned
voluntary change in accounting policy on the Group financial statements. The briefing will be held via a
teleconference today, 13 August 2020.

Condensed consolidated financial results for the six months ended
30 June 2020

MTN is an emerging market mobile operator with a clear vision to lead the delivery of
a bold, new digital world to our 262 million subscribers across 21 operations. We are
inspired by our belief that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.


Highlights
-   Subscribers increased by 10,6 million to 261,5 million
-   Group service revenue grew by 9,4%*
-   EBITDA margin improved by 6,4pp to 49,7% (up 1,2pp* to 43,1%*)

    increased to 2,7x
-   Return on equity (ROE) improved to 14,1%
-   No interim dividend declared due to uncertainties resulting from COVID-19
    impacts

-   Future focus on pan-African strategy, orderly exit of Middle Eastern assets
    announced


* Constant currency information after accounting for the impact of the pro forma adjustments as defined.
- EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income and finance costs (which includes gains or losses
on foreign exchange transactions), tax, depreciation and amortisation, and is also presented before
recognising the following items: impairment of goodwill and joint ventures; net monetary gain resulting
from the application of hyperinflation; share of results of associates and joint ventures after tax;
hyperinflation; gain on disposal of tower associates; impairment loss on remeasurement of disposal
group; and gain on disposal/dilution of investment in associates and joint ventures (Travelstart and
Jumia). EBITDA including once-off items increased 33,1%
ROE is calculated based on reported group HEPS of 430 cps after adjusting for non-operational impacts
of 46 cps

                                                                                                      
Any forward-looking financial information disclosed in this results announcement has not been reviewed
or audited or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

                                                                                                    
Certain information presented in these results constitutes pro forma financial information. The
responsibility for preparing and presenting the pro forma financial information and for the
completeness and accuracy of the pro forma financial information is that of the directors of the
company. This is presented for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial
information may not fairly present MTN’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations
or cash flows. It has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by our external joint auditors.

Certain financial information presented in these consolidated financial results has been prepared
excluding the impact of hyperinflation, impairments of goodwill; PP&E and associates, gain on disposal
of tower associates; impairment loss on remeasurement of disposal group, the Nigerian regulatory
fine (consisting of the re-measurement impact when the settlement was entered into and the finance
costs recognised as a result of the unwind of the initial discounting of the liability), gain on dilution of
Jumia, impairment of investment in MEIH, impairment of Iran receivable, gain on Travelstart disposal
and impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (the pro forma adjustments) and constitutes pro forma financial
information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure included in the reviewed
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2020. This pro
forma financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments
from the consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable (YoY) analysis. The pro forma
adjustments have been calculated in terms of the group accounting policies which are consistent with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for the changes in accounting policies as a
result of the adoption of the accounting standards effective 1 January 2019 and the voluntary change
in policy relating to the treatment of foreign currency translation reserves (FCTR).

IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (IAS 21) requires that on the disposal of a
foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign
operation, recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FCTR in equity, shall be
reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the gain or loss on
disposal is recognised. Two accepted methods exist for recycling FCTR where the investments in
foreign operations are held by an intermediate parent with a different functional currency than the
entity disposed of and the ultimate parent, the step-by-step approach and the direct approach. The
group has accordingly changed its accounting policy on the reclassification of FCTR on disposal of
foreign operations held by an intermediate parent where the functional currency of the foreign
operation and intermediate parent is different to that of the ultimate parent from the step-by-step
method to the direct method.

Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates
on the group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the prior financial
reporting period’s results have been adjusted to the current period average exchange rates determined
as the weighted average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each
of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant
currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results
compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South
Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of
hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary
for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors and represents only a summary of
the information contained in the full interim financial results. Consequently, it does not contain full or

The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa,
Nigeria, the Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA)
region and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-
equity accounted), eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region
includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin, Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau.
The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

Although Iran, Botswana and eSwatini form part of their respective regions geographically and
operationally, they are excluded from their respective regional results because they are equity
accounted for by the group.

                                                                                                      
Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:


“MTN delivered strong results for the period against the backdrop of difficult trading
conditions, exacerbated by the unprecedented socio and macroeconomic challenges
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With service revenue growth of 9,4%* and EBITDA
growth of 10,9%*, the group’s EBITDA margin improved by 1,2pp* to 43,1%* as our
group efficiency programme continued to bear fruit. Group leverage remained stable
at a group net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.1x. The holding company (holdco) leverage
ratio increased to 2,7x from 2,2x at December 2019, impacted by the weaker rand and
lower upstreaming from operating companies. We invested R10,1 billion in our
networks, focussing on capacity and resilience as COVID-19 lockdown constraints
impacted network rollout.

Amongst the larger opco’s, MTN Ghana delivered another strong performance in H1,
while MTN Nigeria achieved continued solid growth in a challenging environment. MTN
South Africa (MTN SA) reported a pleasing turnaround in its underlying consumer and
enterprise business units as well as an expansion in EBITDA margin.

Commercial momentum continued, and we added 10,6 million subscribers to reach a
total base of 261,5 million and reached a significant milestone in surpassing the 100
million mark of active data users. We recorded 38,3 million MoMo users and in Nigeria
added 114 000 agents to reach 222 000 registered agents. Following the peak impact
of COVID-19 effects in April 2020, we are encouraged by the sequential recovery we
have observed in key voice, data and fintech trends as restrictions have been
gradually eased.

As we navigate the pandemic and its effects, we have prioritised looking after our
people, customers and networks while focusing on efficiencies. Work from home
programmes continue for our people; our Y’ello Hope Packages are helping to ease
customers’ financial pressures and we continue to support various other initiatives
across our markets to limit the impact of the pandemic on society as a whole.

Our balance sheet and liquidity remain resilient despite the challenging environment
and was supported by strong operating free cash flows, which increased by 117,8%.
Given the significant uncertainties in our operating environment brought about by
COVID-19 we have resolved not to declare an interim dividend for 2020. Should
conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390c per share,
aligned to the current dividend policy.

MTN has resolved to simplify its portfolio and focus on its pan-African strategy and
will therefore be exiting its Middle Eastern assets in an orderly manner over the
medium-term. As a first step we are in advanced discussions to sell our 75% stake in
MTN Syria.”


                                                                                    
Service revenue
Group service revenue increased by 9,4%* to R80,2 billion (2019: R67,9 billion). This
was led by growth of 12,4%* in MTN Nigeria and 19,4%* in MTN Ghana. MTN SA
recorded a 2.5% decline in service revenue, as a result of the lost national roaming
revenues arising from the discontinuation of our roaming agreement with Telkom
and effects of the continued accounting for Cell C revenue on a cash basis. The
continued turnaround in MTN SA’s consumer and enterprise businesses has however
supported a pleasing improvement in sequential service revenue growth trend in the
second quarter.

EPS
Basic earnings per share, which includes the gain on disposal of our tower
associates, increased by 165,4% to 674 cents from 254 cents (June 2019), supported
by the weaker rand, an overall healthier operational performance as well as an
improved contribution of share of profits from JVs and associates.

HEPS
Reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 120,5% to 430 cents from
195 cents in June 2019. HEPS were positively impacted in aggregate by 46 cents from
the following items: 0 cents relating to the Nigeria fine interest (-8 cents in 2019);
hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of 10 cents (-8 cents in 2019); the impact of
foreign exchange gains and losses of 28 cents (-39 cents in 2019) and reversal of the
time value loss recognised on the Iran receivable of 8 cents (0 cents in 2019).




                                                                                    
Portfolio optimisation and asset realisation programme
Our asset realisation programme (ARP), launched in March 2019 and enhanced in
March 2020, aims to reduce debt, simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns
and realise capital of at least a further R25 billion over three to five years.

Interco B.V. and Uganda Tower Interco B.V to AT Sher Netherlands Cooperatief U.A.,
and received cash proceeds of US$524 million. This completed the first phase of our
ARP, with the full cR15 billion of the initial three-year plan realised within the first 12
months.

The COVID-19 pandemic and flux in global oil prices has brought about extraordinary
macroeconomic uncertainty and major volatility in financial markets. This has
impacted our ability to continue with further realisations in the short-term. We remain
committed to execute on the ARP over the medium-term and have made significant
progress in laying the groundwork for when conditions become more conducive.

Our 20% shareholding in the carrier business Belgacom International Carrier
Services SA (BICS) is included in those assets classified as not long-term strategic.
MTN and its co-shareholders in BICS are in discussions regarding a potential sale of
a controlling stake in the business. BICS has accordingly been classified as a non-
current asset held for sale on 5 August 2020. At 30 June 2020, the carrying amount
of the investment in associate was R2,3 billion and the accumulated FCTR gain
related to BICS was R1,4 billion.

MTN to focus on its pan-African strategy
As part of the review of our portfolio, we believe the group is best served to focus on
its pan-African strategy and to simplify its portfolio by exiting the Middle East region
in an orderly manner over the medium-term. The Middle East assets contributed less
than 4% to group EBITDA in H1.

As part of this process we are in advanced discussions to sell our 75% stake in MTN
Syria to TeleInvest, which is the minority shareholder in MTN Syria with a 25% holding.

MTN Syria contributed 0,7% to MTN’s reported EBITDA in H1 2020. The net assets
attributable to MTN Syria in the MTN Group accounts have been written down to the
estimated recoverable amount of R1,4 billion (US$80 million). The foreign currency
translation loss of R4,8 billion as at 30 June 2020, that has accumulated over time,
will be released to the income statement on conclusion of the transaction. This will
negatively impact EPS, but will have no material impact on HEPS, cash flow and the
balance sheet.

                                                                                         
Capital allocation priorities and suspension of interim dividend
We are committed to a disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritises the
deployment of our resources to growth, supported by investment in our network;
reduction of debt and management of our funding mix and liquidity; and dividend
growth.

We are pleased with the performance and resilience of our networks, which have ably
sustained the explosion of growth in traffic, not only during the recent COVID-19
crisis, but over the past few years as we have connected more users. Our financial
position continues on a steady path of improvement and optimisation and, as
mentioned, places the group well to navigate the prevailing volatility.

We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our financial position and
maintaining a healthy liquidity position. As announced in our trading statement dated
31 July 2020, in order to sustain this progress, and in line with our capital allocation
framework, the board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend (2019:
195cps) in the context of the COVID-19 impacts and the material uncertainties these
present. Should conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390
cents per share, aligned to the current dividend policy. The key factors to consider
will include the general macro-economic environment, the status of cash
upstreaming from operating companies and the outlook for the holding company
leverage ratio.

                                                                                      
Prospects and guidance
Well positioned to deliver growth
The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant volatility and
uncertainty across our markets, placing unprecedented pressure on the various
economies and affecting the daily lives of our people, customers and other
stakeholders.

The operational performance of our portfolio in H1 has demonstrated the resilience
and agility of the MTN business model, as well as our operations’ ability to sustain
growth in challenging circumstances as our products and services are fundamental
to the people and economies of our markets. This lies at the heart of MTN’s digital
operator strategy. While we expect the remainder of the year to be shaped by the
ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we believe that MTN will remain
comparatively resilient in the current environment and is well-placed to sustain its
growth over the medium-term.

As we weather the prevailing storm, focusing on managing the risks brought about
by COVID-19, through strict cost-control measures and enhanced oversight of
expenditure, we are also alive to the opportunities the pandemic has presented,
particularly the accelerated need for digitisation. This was embodied in the strong H1
performance of our data, digital and fintech growth curves as the impacts of COVID-
19 took hold.

As we continue building a digital operator, we are well-positioned to further unlock
this opportunity over time, on the foundation of our strong position in high-growth
markets where the populations are youthful and fast-growing. The opportunity to
increase the adoption and usage of our data, digital and fintech services over the
medium to long-term remains substantial.

We are pleased with the turnaround in the core consumer and enterprise businesses
in MTN SA against a challenging macro environment. Whilst COVID-19 impacts will
present ongoing headwinds in the second half of the year we are pleased with the
work done to build the operational resilience of MTN SA and believe it is well-
positioned to navigate the volatility.

In Nigeria, we will continue to invest in our network and ramp up the rollout of 4G,
which was slowed down by the impact of COVID-19 during H1. The increased
adoption and growth in usage of data remains a key priority to drive further data
revenue growth. We remain committed to expanding our fintech and digital service
offerings, as we continue to expand our MoMo agent network with the conversion of
our existing airtime agents into MoMo agents and broaden our service offerings. We
remain on track to achieve our agent network target of 300,000 by year-end.

                                                                                    
We will further strengthen and grow our digital offerings. The work is ongoing to scale
Ayoba and build on the progress already achieved in increasing conversion and
retention rates, as well as engagement on the channel which is gaining some traction.
In the broader digital business, advancements continue in broadening the
accessibility of services for our customers and stimulating increased engagement.


Medium-term guidance
We remain committed to delivering on our guidance framework over the medium-
term (3 to 5 years), although, as mentioned, we expect the remainder of the year to
be challenging. Within this context, we maintain our medium-term target of double-
digit growth in group service revenue in constant currency terms; double-digit
growth in MTN Nigeria’s service revenue and mid-single-digit growth in service
revenue from MTN South Africa.

We expect to continue to improve our group EBITDA margin through the execution of
our group efficiency programme and to deliver on our ROE target.

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an
increasing revenue contribution from our digital businesses, we expect the group
capex intensity to improve steadily over the medium term on an IFRS reported basis.

We aim to secure at least a further R25 billion in asset realisations over the medium-
term. This is within the context of our localisation ambitions, MTN’s portfolio of assets
that have been identified as not long-term strategic and market conditions being
conducive. Our holdco leverage ratio target over the medium-term is ‘below 2,0x’ and
we remain focused on delivering on our capital allocation priorities.

We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our financial position, and we
maintain a healthy liquidity position. As mentioned, in order to sustain this,
particularly in context of COVID-19 impacts and the material uncertainty these
present, the board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend. Should
conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no more than 390c per share,
aligned to the current dividend policy.

In light of the ongoing assessment of our networks and the disruptions in supply
chain and challenges in rolling out coverage in the current COVID-19 environment,
we revise our guidance for capex in 2020 to at least R24,0 billion – this is up from the
guidance of R22,0 billion provided in our Q1 2020 trading update.

MTN Group Limited
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
(Registration number 1994/009584/06)
(Share code MTN)
(ISIN: ZAE000042164)
(“MTN” or “the Company” or “the Group”)

Trading statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the six months ended 30 June 2020. These
will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Ltd. (""SENS"") on or about Thursday,
6 August 2020.

Following the trading statement published on Friday, 24 July 2020, shareholders are further advised
that MTN expects to report growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) of between 160% and 170% (or
406 cents to 432 cents). Considering the restated EPS of 254 cents for the corresponding six-month
period ended 30 June 2019 (restatement explained further below), this translates into a range of 660
cents to 686 cents for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020.

EPS includes the benefit from gains amounting to 341 cents on the disposal of the ATC Uganda and
ATC Ghana tower joint ventures as announced in March 2020 (2019: includes 74 cents benefit from
gains on disposal).

Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) growth is expected to be between 115% and 125% (or 224 cents
to 244 cents). Considering the HEPS of 195 cents for the corresponding six-month period ended 30
June 2019, this translates into a range of 419 cents to 439 cents.

HEPS benefited from non-operational items for the six months ended 30 June 2020 totalling
approximately 46 cents per share (June 2019: 55 cents negative impact on HEPS) of which more than
half related to foreign exchange gains.

The Group has implemented a voluntary accounting policy change relating to the treatment of foreign
currency translation reserves (“FCTR”). IAS 21 requires that, on the disposal of a foreign operation,
the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in
equity on the balance sheet over time, shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a
reclassification adjustment when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised. In this regard, the Group
has changed its accounting policy on the calculation of this reclassification of FCTR from the step-by-
step method to the direct method, which provides a more reliable and relevant view of the gain or
loss realised in the context of the Group’s functional currency.

This change in accounting policy impacted the FCTR gain reclassified to profit in the current period on
the disposal of the Group’s investments in the ATC Uganda and ATC Ghana tower joint ventures. The
impact of the change in policy on EPS is an increase of 47 cents (2019: 7 cents, resulting in a
restatement of the 2019 EPS). The change in accounting policy had no impact on HEPS in the current
or prior comparative period.

Dividend update

MTN has made meaningful progress in strengthening its financial position and maintaining a healthy
liquidity position. In order to sustain this, and in line with MTN’s capital allocation framework, the
board has decided not to declare a 2020 interim dividend in the context of the COVID-19 impacts and
the material uncertainties these present. Should conditions warrant a final dividend, this would be no
more than 390 cents per share, aligned to the current dividend policy. The key factors to consider will
include the general macro-economic environment, the status of cash upstreaming from operating
companies and the outlook for the holding company leverage ratio.

MTN succession process on track

The succession process for the MTN Group CEO role is on track and MTN expects to make an
announcement in this regard in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Current Group CEO Rob Shuter will complete
his fixed four-year contract in March 2021 as announced earlier this year and this timing will enable a
seamless handover to his successor.

MTN notes the announcement issued today by BT Group Plc that Rob has been appointed as the CEO
of BT Enterprise. Rob will relocate to the UK and start with BT Group Plc in 2021 after finishing at MTN.
MTN thanks Rob for his contribution over the years and wishes him well in his new endeavours.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

Commentary
MTN Ghana delivered a robust performance for the period, despite macroeconomic challenges
following the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Service revenue increased by 19.3%,
underpinned by strong growth in voice, data, Mobile Money and digital revenue.

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 14.1%) was driven by a 4.1% increase in the number of active
subscribers* as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage
churn and improve usage. The contribution of voice to total service revenue declined from 45.4% to
43.3%, as other lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional business in line with our
revenue diversification objective.

Strong data revenue growth (up 21.7%) was attributable to the increase in active data users# (+5.2%),
continued growth in the number of smartphones on the network (+4.2%) and a general increase in
demand and usage. Data revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased marginally from 28.0%
to 28.5%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to show strong growth (up 24.9%) and benefited from an increase
in the number of active subscribers* (+5.1%), growth in person-to-person (P2P) transactional activity
and broader penetration of more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and
international remittances. Mobile Money revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from
18.3% to 19.2%.

Digital revenue was robust, growing by 27.7% on the back of a 44.5% increase in the number of active
subscribers* to 2.2 million. This performance was supported by the expansion of our digital portfolio
including new gaming offerings, the renewal of our MyMTN app and the launch of Ayoba messaging
app, which allows non-smartphone users to communicate with smartphone users on the app. Digital
revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from 4.0% to 4.3%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 29.1%, with an EBITDA
margin expansion of 4.1 percentage points (pp) to 53.6%. This margin improvement was a result of
our cost efficiency initiatives, underpinned by continued distribution efficiencies.

Our growth in revenue, coupled with our cost efficiency initiatives, resulted in a strong growth
(+52.3%) in profit after tax.


Due to ongoing discussions on the potential change in regulatory subscriber definitions, subscriber data in this report will be limited to the MTN Group definition until the regulatory
definitions are finalized.

* Aligned with the MTN Group definition, subscribers are SIMs which generate or participate in an event that generates revenue for MTN Ghana.
# Active data subscribers as per MTN Group definition are data subscribers who have used more than 5MB in a month.
^ Capex under IFRS 16 is made up of core capex spend of GH¢301.2m, intangibles of GH¢404.3m (Network license, Software, etc) and right of use (RoU) assets of GH¢10.1m for the period.




Commentary (continued)

MTN Ghana continues to prioritize its investments in infrastructure expansion and have invested
GH¢715.6 million in capex^ to date (2019 capex: GH¢803.1 million) supporting significant
improvement in network coverage, customer experience and quality of service (QoS). As part of the
network expansion and quality of service improvement, we rolled out 11 2G and 11 3G sites; and
upgraded 300 LTE 2600MHz sites. Our continued belief in the Ghana market and our significant
investments in capex of US$470 million over the past 3 years has led to improvement in customer
experience and sustained subscriber growth.

MTN accepted and signed a GH¢450 million, five-year medium-term financing arrangement – out of a
total offer of GH¢816 million received, with seven local lenders to support the renewal of our 2G
license and the acquisition of additional spectrum. We maintained a strong balance sheet, managing
it in line with existing banking covenants.

COVID-19

COVID-19 had a significant impact on our business performance through the second quarter despite
the easing of restrictions that had been imposed by the President of the Republic of Ghana from 15
March 2020 through to 01 June 2020. As a business, we continued to experience delays in supply
chain, as well as the overall effects of the economic slowdown on our manufacturing and hospitality
customers plus a general decline in activity for our SME customers.

In our continued support of the fight against COVID-19, MobileMoney Limited, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Scancom PLC, extended the free offer for all Mobile Money P2P transfers up to GH¢100
per day including increased limits on daily transactions and wallet balances to the end of September
2020. We were pleased to receive approval from the Bank of Ghana for our voluntary request to
extend the free P2P transfers offer. This offer will save customers an estimated GH¢60 million to
GH¢70 million in transaction fees while promoting the safety of Ghanaians and deepening financial
inclusion.

The MTN Ghana Foundation committed to Government, GH¢5 million worth of personal protective
equipment (PPE) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff and government in the fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic. Internally, we have deployed PPEs and sanitizers across our branch
network and implemented extended safety measures for our people at an estimated cost of GH¢22
million.

MTN Ghana has also supported Government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic by providing
free access to over 200 websites for online education for public and private institutions. This effort
has supported over 4.5 million students and teachers, who have consumed over 150 Terabytes at a
cost of over GH¢3 million as at the end of June 2020. In addition, MTN Ghana has also provided
GH¢10,000 worth of free data to all its 200 university students on its MTN Bright Scholarship scheme.

Commentary (continued)

We remain focused on our people, customers, network resilience and efficiency in delivering on our
quest to make the lives of our customers a whole lot BRIGHTer in these uncertain times.

In June, the National Communications Authority (NCA) classified MTN Ghana as a significant market
power (SMP) meaning that special regulatory restrictions would be enforced on MTN Ghana, to
potentially limit the company’s growth, performance, innovativeness and its competitiveness in the
telecoms market.

Broadly, the NCA has proposed measures that include the application of a 30% asymmetrical
interconnect rate for two years; a price floor/ceiling on voice, data, SMS and Mobile Money; the
review and approval of all MTN pricing by the NCA; the removal of on-net/off-net price differentials;
and the implementation of a national roaming scheme.

MTN Ghana acknowledges the NCA’s duty and powers to promote fair competition amongst licensed
operators in Ghana’s telecommunications sector, however, the manner of the recent declaration of
MTN as an SMP raises concerns about clear procedural breaches and substantive issues. After
engaging and sharing our views on the matter with regulatory and other stakeholders, and after
further consultations, MTN Ghana has made the difficult decision, and as a last resort, to resort to the
law courts for redress in the form of a judicial review of the NCA’s decision, to ensure the observance
of the requirements of procedural fairness. We remain open to dialogue to achieve an amicable
resolution to this matter.

MTN Ghana is an ethical business committed to its regulatory obligations and would like to reassure
Government and its cherished shareholders and customers that our commitment to the delivery of a
bold new digital world in Ghana continues to be paramount and that the company remains focused
on providing the enabling technology to support Ghana’s digital economy particularly during the
Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.

Annual General Meeting and 2019 Final Dividend

Notice has been served of the annual general meeting of Scancom PLC which will be held virtually and
streamed live from MTN Ghana’s head office at MTN House in Accra on the 13 August 2020 at 11am
Ghana time. Amongst the business for the day will be the approval of the 2019 final dividend of 4
pesewas which will be paid on 28 August 2020 following shareholder approval.

Outlook

Following a strong overall performance in the first half of the year, we are cautious of the uncertainties
surrounding the likely duration and related economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the rest
of the year. The potential areas of impact and focus remain our employee and customers’ safety;
regulatory risk; supply chain delays and availability; liquidity, currency and counterparty risks
management; and the potential revenue impact from reduced consumer spend.

We remain focused on our journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an
emerging digital operator, with 2020 being the ‘Year of the customer: the digital experience’ with
focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value for our
shareholders.

MTN NIGERIA RELEASES UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Shareholders are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria), one of Africa’s largest
providers of communications services, which has a clear vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new
digital world, today, announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2020.

Salient features:

    •   Mobile subscribers increased by 6.8 million to 71.1 million
    •   Active data users increased by 3.8 million to 29.0 million
    •   Service revenue increased by 12.6% to NGN637.0 billion
    •   Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 8.2% to
        N327.1 billion
    •   EBITDA margin declined by 2.0 pp to 51.3%
    •   Profit before tax (PBT) declined by 2.0% to N139.6 billion
    •   Earnings per share (EPS) declined by 4.7% to N4.66kobo
    •   Interim dividend per share of N3.50 kobo

Unless otherwise stated, financial information is year-on-year (YoY, H1 2020 versus H1 2019) and non-
financial information is year-to-date (June 2020 versus December 2019).

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

“Following a strong first quarter, we experienced a challenging operating environment in the second
quarter characterised by COVID-19 induced lockdowns and the broader macro-economic impact it has
had. Despite this, we have maintained double-digit service revenue growth of 12.6% for H1, driven by
strong growth in our key revenue lines.

Data revenue rose by 57.6% supported by an increase in data users and traffic. Revenue from digital
and fintech services rose by 121.8% and 29.6% respectively, while voice revenue growth was 2.8%
amidst a change in traffic pattern following the lockdowns. However, costs also increased leading to
an overall decline in profit before tax and earnings per share.



In the first half of the year, we achieved 6.8 million in net additions, to connect over 71.1 million
customers to our network. We also connected 3.8 million new users to the internet, bringing our active
data subscribers to 29 million. Our MoMo subscribers increased by 1.6 million to 2.2 million, the
majority of which were in Q2. We prioritised the upgrade of our network capacity to accommodate
growth in traffic, while continuing to expand 4G network coverage, albeit at a slower pace given the
constraints presented by COVID-19.

As part of several initiatives under our Y’ello Hope Package launched in Q1, we offered our subscribers
free SMS targeted at providing value to the vulnerable in the society. It is pleasing that 75% of our
subscribers benefitted, sending over 4.3 billion messages through the SMS platform. We also offered
free money transfers using the MoMo Agent Network with over 100,000 customers utilising the
service.

During the period, we changed the accounting treatment of the Value Added Tax (VAT) component of
our lease payments resulting in some impact on margins. In addition to this, the combined effect of
the foreign exchange rate adjustments, the 2.5% increase in value-added tax and the associated costs
of COVID-19 initiatives have impacted margins. As a result, growth in EBITDA was 8.2% in H1, while
EBITDA margin declined by 2.0pp to 51.3% and profit before tax and EPS declined by 2.0% and 4.7%,
respectively.

In line with our dividend policy, the Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend of N3.50 kobo
per share to be paid out of distributable net income.”

COVID-19 Impact

Our response to the global pandemic and its impact was focused in four broad areas, namely social,
commercial, network and supply chain as well as funding and liquidity considerations.

In terms of the social impact, health concerns, along with the restriction on movement and lockdown
of certain parts of the economy, impacted our peoples’ working routine. To address this, we
implemented work from home initiatives to ensure business continuity. We also intensified health and
safety measures, including the increased use of personal protective equipment and hand sanitisers to
preserve the wellbeing of our staff.

Through various contributions and initiatives, we supported our customers, communities and
government in the transition through this unique situation. This includes support for the Federal
Inland Revenue Services’ (FIRS) revenue acceleration efforts with an early payment of our taxes ahead
of established deadlines.



We launched a free SMS initiative in early April targeted at the low-income mass market, which
concluded at the end of June, with more than 4.3 billion free SMS’s sent by more than 53 million
customers. Customers used more than 3,000TB of free data to access zero-rated healthcare websites.
We have now expanded this initiative to include a range of education platforms endorsed by Nigerian
federal and state governments. This is in addition to the N1 billion donation we have made to the
Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), the N250 million of personal protective equipment (PPE)
delivered to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) through MTN Nigeria Foundation, and the
logistical and communications support provided to the Nigerian Governors Forum, NCDC and State
Governments.

From a commercial perspective, demand for data and digital services grew significantly, but we saw a
decline in demand for voice services as our customer base, especially in the mass market segment,
our largest, was impacted by the economic constraints caused by lockdowns in the country. The
acceleration in data and digital revenue only partially offset the decline in voice revenue. As lockdown
restrictions have eased, we have seen an encouraging recovery in voice revenue.

With regards to our network and supply chain, the movement restrictions and scarcity of foreign
exchange affected site rollout. We have mitigated these effects through building up inventories of
critical spares as well as closer control and management of our supply chain.

Our funding and liquidity remain well-managed, supported by strong cash flows and approved
headroom facilities. Our headroom to leverage is comfortably within banking covenants and are able
to meet our operational, investment and financial requirements and obligations. Our foreign currency
exposure is within manageable limits, with 95% of our debt in local currency, so that our balance sheet
can withstand currency volatility.

Further impacts of COVID-19 are very uncertain and will depend on the evolution of the virus
throughout the remainder of the year, any reinstatement or intensification of lockdowns and any
other economic impacts caused by the global situation. However, we remain confident in the
resilience of the business, and the ability of our employees to adapt as the situation develops.

Trading statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020

MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and, in
accordance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements paragraph 3.4(b)(iii)(3), provides this trading
statement on its results which will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE
Limited (""SENS"") on or about Thursday, 6 August 2020. The JSE Listings Requirements specify that
issuers must publish a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least
20% from the financial results for the previous corresponding period.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised that MTN expects to report an increase in earnings per share
(“EPS”) of at least 345 cents or 140%, representing EPS of greater than 592 cents for the six months
ended 30 June 2020, compared with EPS of 247 cents for the corresponding six-month period ended
30 June 2019.

Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) is expected to be at least 195 cents or 100% higher, representing
HEPS of greater than 390 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared with HEPS of 195
cents for the corresponding six-month period ended 30 June 2019.

EPS includes the benefit from gains amounting to 341 cents on the disposal of the ATC Uganda and
ATC Ghana tower joint ventures as announced in March 2020. HEPS benefited from non-operational
items for the six months ended 30 June 2020 totalling approximately 50 cents per share (June 2019:
55 cents negative impact on HEPS) of which more than half related to foreign exchange gains.

MTN will provide a further update on the expected EPS and HEPS growth ranges once it has reasonable
certainty of such ranges.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of MTN.

MTN Nigeria Communications Plc and Global Independent Connect Limited, INT Towers Limited, IHS
(Nigeria) Limited and IHS Towers NG Limited, Nigerian affiliates of IHS Holding Limited amend
service agreement

Shareholders are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications PLC (MTN Nigeria) and Global
Independent Connect Limited, INT Towers Limited, IHS (Nigeria) Limited and IHS Towers NG Limited,
the affiliates of IHS Holding Limited (together, IHS) have reached an agreement to expand the scope
of their current service agreement, and amend the currency conversion provision for tower services.

In 2014, MTN Nigeria took a strategic decision to sell its passive infrastructure (including towers) and
focus on its core business. Although MTN Nigeria retains a small number of towers, it currently has
agreements in place with a number of tower providers across the country, including IHS.

MTN Nigeria leases the majority of the tower/site space required for its network equipment from IHS
and has concluded a renegotiation of certain terms of its tower rental agreements. These include an
increased focus on rural connectivity and fibre deployment. Furthermore, the changes will result in
improved cost for future technology evolution and backhaul in the network, which will bear fruit in
the longer term, whilst agreeing to move the reference rates for conversions to Naira from the Central
Bank of Nigeria's official rate (CBN) to the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate (NAFEX).

This change in reference rate currently at N360 (CBN) to N385 (NAFEX) reduces the EBITDA margin in
2020 by approximately 0.4pp on an IFRS16 basis. This is however offset over time by the improved
pricing and increased focus on rural connectivity and backhaul in the network. MTN Nigeria will
continue to focus on operational efficiencies to further mitigate these impacts.

Commenting on the agreements, MTN Nigeria’s CEO Ferdi Moolman said: “We are pleased to have
agreed a mutually beneficial update to our agreements with IHS. These changes provide clarity for
both parties on foreign exchange denomination with Naira payments, while also extending our
relationship into key new areas. I am particularly excited about the partnership to expand fibre
connectivity and deliver accelerated rural telephony. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the
huge importance of digital infrastructure, and these agreements enable us to enhance fibre networks,
while rapidly connecting those Nigerians in rural areas who are currently unable to access
telecommunications services.

MTN Group Limited-Credit Rating Review by S&P Global(“S&P”)

Noteholders are advised that on 12 May 2020, S&P took rating
actions on corporate issuers exposed to South Africa.

S&P lowered MTN Group and the Issuer’s long-term credit rating
to 'BB-' from 'BB' with a stable outlook.

S&P stated that the rating on the Company was constrained by
the foreign currency ratings on South Africa and Nigeria.

S&P’s rationale for the rating review was that in South Africa
they expect pressures on the consumer and wholesale businesses
with recovery expected beyond fiscal 2020 and further that for
MTN’s Nigerian business, oil exposure in the economy could lead
to lower affordability of mobile voice, data, and payments
services as well as possible margin pressure.

Furthermore, S&P believes that devaluation of the Nigerian naira
and higher value-added tax rates would likely place upward
pressure on the cost base and lower cash flow generation from
Nigeria.


Notwithstanding the above, S&P stated that they expect COVID-19
to have a moderate effect on the Company’s financial metrics,
given the heightened importance of telecommunications during
restricted mobility and expected voice and data demand to be
reasonably    well-supported,    although     lower    consumer
affordability and the impact of negative GDP growth on
enterprise customers cannot be discounted.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:

“The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy have brought about unprecedented
uncertainty, volatility and challenges which are impacting our markets at both the socio-economic and
macroeconomic levels. The impact of the pandemic on our quarter one performance was not
significant as lockdown restrictions for our consolidated subsidiaries were only implemented from the
last week of March 2020.

For the first quarter, MTN delivered a solid performance by increasing service revenue by 11,1% and
EBITDA by 15,6% with the EBITDA margin improving by 2,1pp to 43,2%, in line with our medium-term
targets.

MTN Nigeria and MTN Ghana generated strong double-digit service revenue growth and improving
EBITDA margins, contributing to the solid group performance.

MTN South Africa’s (MTN SA) performance was negatively impacted by the wholesale business, as we
continue to account for Cell C roaming revenue on a cash basis, as well as the loss of revenue from the
Telkom roaming agreement which came to an end in June 2019. We are encouraged by the
stabilisation of the consumer prepaid business which was affected by the implementation of the new
out-of-bundle data usage rules. Also pleasing was the continued progress in the enterprise business,
which recorded 8,2% service revenue growth.

The group recorded voice, data and fintech revenue growth of 6,3%, 26,4% and 26,0% respectively as
we continued to execute on our strategic objectives and progress toward becoming a digital operator.
Digital revenue has returned to growth, increasing by 15,6%.

We continued to build commercial momentum, adding 6,6 million subscribers in the quarter, with
active data users increasing by 2,9 million and MoMo subscribers by 0,4 million. We continued to scale
our Ayoba platform, recording 2,6 million monthly active users. We accelerated our MoMo agency
network in Nigeria under our super-agent licence, adding 70 000 agents in the first quarter and
bringing the total number of registered agents to 178 000.

In these difficult times we continue to focus on our key priorities: looking after our people, our
customers and our networks while we focus on efficiencies. For our people, the immediate priority is
their health and safety, where the work-from-home programmes across our markets empower our
staff to work remotely while ensuring continuity in our operations. For our customers, we have ramped
up our digital channels as a service alternative to enable them to continue purchasing airtime and
accessing our products and services seamlessly as well as launching Y’ello Hope Packages in most of
our markets. Our various initiatives support governments across our markets with communication
systems and connectivity as we do our part to help minimise the economic and social impact.

The COVID-19 situation is an evolving one and will undoubtedly affect the year ahead. Given the
uncertainties associated with the duration and economic impact of the pandemic, it is difficult to
reliably quantify the direct and indirect financial effects on the business at this early stage. The group
will continue to focus on business continuity and efficiency, and we have implemented strict measures
to preserve resources and strengthen our resilience.

We maintain our medium-term guidance and will update the market in the future of any changes in
that regard. The group remains committed to delivering on its strategy including delivering on our
asset realisation programme, which aims to simplify our portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and
realise capital of at least a further R25 billion over the medium-term.”


                                                                                                        
The group’s results are presented in line with the group’s operational structure. This is South Africa, Nigeria, the Southern
and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA) region, the West and Central Africa (WECA) region and the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region and their respective underlying operations.

The SEAGHA region includes Ghana, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Botswana (joint venture-equity accounted),
eSwatini (joint venture-equity accounted) and Business Group. The WECA region includes Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Benin,
Congo-Brazzaville, Liberia, Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau. The MENA region includes Iran (joint venture-equity
accounted), Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.

MTN South Africa
MTN SA has seen its prepaid business starting to recover, following the impact of regulation changes,
while the postpaid customer base saw an increase in net additions in challenging macro and
competitive environment. The revival in the enterprise business continued, with growth for a second
consecutive quarter. This progress validates the investment made in MTN SA’s leading network, which
once again won the Best in Test Award for the third successive year.

MTN SA recorded a slight increase in total subscribers (by 75 000 QoQ) to end the quarter with a
base of 29,0 million. Service revenue declined by 6,2% owing largely to a sharp reduction in
wholesale revenue resulting from the effects of a change to cash accounting for Cell C roaming
revenue and the loss of the Telkom roaming agreement. If we adjust the numbers by removing
national roaming (both Cell C and Telkom), then overall Q1 service revenue for MTN SA would have
been flat, highlighting the progress made in the underlying business. The momentum in overall data
revenue in MTN SA has also been pleasing and grew by 7.1%, supported by a 53% YoY increase in
traffic.

The overall first quarter performance was impacted by a challenging trading environment brought
about by weak macroeconomic conditions compounded by the global outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, currency depreciation and loadshedding.

The consumer prepaid business continued on its improving trajectory, with service revenue coming
in flat YoY, compared to a decline of 4,1% in 2019. The performance of the business remained affected
by the base effects of ICASA’s end-user subscriber regulations, with out-of-bundle (OOB) data revenue
still included in the first two months of the prior period before the new regulations took effect from 1
March 2019. There was encouraging momentum in prepaid data revenue, which increased by 3,3%
YoY. This was driven by a 31,0% increase in prepaid data traffic following a slight decline of 0,7% in
2019.

MTN SA made further progress in lowering churn and stabilising the quality of the prepaid base. In
2019, these interventions included the discontinuation of the loss-generating 1GB acquisition
promotion along with similar incentives in prepaid, which helped to drive distribution cost efficiencies.
The trajectory in net additions has stabilised and started to show a steady recovery over the past few
quarters, with a 0,1 million QoQ reduction in prepaid subscribers in Q1, to a closing base of around
22,7 million. MTN SA continues to focus on making data more affordable for its customers, which is
evident in the 21,0% YoY reduction in the effective prepaid data tariff.

The consumer postpaid business service revenue was flat YoY in a competitive market. The postpaid
subscriber base was also flat, reflective of the tight competitive environment and pressure on                                                                                                                        3
consumers due to tough economic conditions. The slower acquisition volumes were also a result of
stricter vetting rules aimed at reducing credit risk.

Wholesale revenue declined by 44,0% YoY. This resulted from our roaming agreement with Telkom
having concluded at the end of June 2019 as well as lower revenue recognised from Cell C due to the
ongoing cash basis of accounting.

For Cell C specifically, roaming revenue continued to be accounted for on a cash basis in line with
IFRS 15 and MTN SA recognised approximately R292 million in revenue during the quarter. At 31
March 2020, R450 million in Cell C revenue remained unrecognised. MTN SA commenced phase two
of the roaming agreement with Cell C, effective 1 May 2020.

The progress made in the enterprise business continued in Q1 2020, where growth was achieved for
the second consecutive quarter with service revenue up 8,2% YoY. The business continued to benefit
from interventions aimed at stabilising churn, adding new corporate customers and driving growth in
our ICT offering.

MTN SA’s EBITDA margin was 36,6%, a decrease of 2,2pp due to the factors mentioned above,
including the reduction in OOB data and national roaming revenue.

As part of the group-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic detailed later in this report, MTN SA
has implemented several initiatives to assist in reducing cash circulation and containing the spread of
COVID-19. The MTN MoMo app allows free person-to-person cash payments under R200, while a
number of electronic transfer and payment channels on our platforms will also be zero-rated. To
further ease the burden on consumers, MTN SA has also launched discounted social bundle prices to
MoMo users and waived in-app cash service fees.

For our communities, MTN has eased the COVID-19 disruption with digital innovations, including zero-
rated channels for the benefit of businesses, schoolchildren and families across South Africa. MTN SA
has also zero-rated USSD lines and other COVID-19 channels, including Ayoba, to report infections and
other critical information.

In aid of the Department of Basic Education academic recovery plan, MTN SA is supporting learners
by providing access to a number of e-learning platforms, which are zero-rated for all MTN customers.
The MTN Foundation has also contributed R3 million to sponsor students to have full access to a broad
range of learning materials.

The assistance in combating COVID-19 in South Africa extends to the Department of Health through
the supply of personal protective equipment including the delivery of more than 30 000 face masks
and 18 000 bottles of hand sanitisers to provincial health departments to date.


MTN Nigeria
MTN Nigeria followed the encouraging momentum achieved in Q4 2019 with another solid
performance in Q1 2020, where double-digit service revenue growth accelerated to 16,7% YoY,
supported by voice and data growth.

                                                                                                     
Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 7,4%, supported by subscriber growth. MTN Nigeria
continued to gain market share and added 4,2 million subscribers to its network to end the quarter at
68,5 million. This was underpinned by the deployment of additional subscriber registration devices,
while the continued implementation of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives also
helped to increased voice traffic.

Data revenue continued to accelerate with growth of 59,2% YoY. This was achieved through a higher
number of active data subscribers, which increased by 1,7 million to 26,8 million, as well as improved
4G penetration, which supported traffic growth of 130,4% YoY. Some 1,6 million new smartphones
joined the network, bringing smartphone penetration to 42,6% of the base.

The digital business returned to growth, with revenue increasing 63,7% supported by an improved
uptake of products within our portfolio of digital offerings and improvements in the customer journey
experience. During the quarter, we added 1,7 million new users, bringing the active base for digital
subscriptions to 3,8 million users.

Fintech revenue grew by 36,3% in Q1 2020, driven by an increase in the adoption of MTN Xtratime,
an airtime lending service. MTN Nigeria added 70 000 MoMo agents in the quarter, bringing the total
number of registered agents to 178 000 nationwide. As part of the Y’ello Hope Package, transaction
fees were suspended for all money transfers using the MoMo agent network for an initial period of
one month starting 23 March 2020.

The enterprise business segment continued to improve, with revenue growth of 12,7%.

EBITDA rose by 15,3% YoY, while the EBITDA margin moderated by 0,7pp to 52,7% due to the increase
in costs relating mainly to higher lease rentals following an aggressive 4G roll site rollout, as well as
once-off costs relating to litigation and value added tax (VAT) that was implemented during the period.

In terms of the agreements MTN Nigeria has with tower companies, a component of the payments
are quantified in foreign currency. The recent reset by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to a naira/US
dollar exchange rate of N360, from N305, will apply to the relevant contracts with effect from
1 April 2020 and will have an impact on MTN Nigeria margins going forward. MTN Nigeria is in
continued discussions with tower providers to optimise the terms of these long-term contracts.


Southern and East Africa and Ghana (SEAGHA)
The SEAGHA region recorded solid service revenue growth of 21,2%, with all operations achieving
growth in Q1 2020. The region recorded a 1,5 million increase in subscribers to 50 million.

MTN Ghana was once again a key contributor to the region’s strong performance, with service
revenue up 20,6%, supported by voice and data growing in double digits as well as continued strong
growth in fintech revenue (up 31,6%). The EBITDA margin expansion achieved of 5,3pp, to 53,3%, was
supported by various cost efficiency initiatives including enhanced penetration of electronic
distribution channels, realigning the device strategy and optimising network costs.

                                                                                                       
MTN Uganda also delivered a solid performance with service revenue up 13,4%, driven by accelerated
growth in voice (up 9,5%), data (up 29,1%) and fintech revenue (up 15,2%). The EBITDA margin
declined 1,2pp to 48,5% because of higher provisions.

Overall, the SEAGHA portfolio excluding MTN Ghana delivered pleasing service revenue growth of
21,9% in the quarter.


West and Central Africa (WECA)
The WECA region delivered a solid performance. Service revenue grew by 9,8% YoY, significantly
above the blended average inflation of approximately 3,5% across the region. This performance was
enabled by improvements in fintech and data revenue and continued customer growth across the
markets of 0,4 million QoQ to 36,6 million.

MTN Ivory Coast delivered a 6,7% increase in service revenue, supported by growth in data (up 18,9%)
and fintech (up 11,6%). The EBITDA margin expanded by 4,9pp to 25,7%.

MTN Cameroon recorded service revenue growth of 8,7%, supported by double-digit growth in data
(up 22,6%) and fintech (up 50,4%), notwithstanding the continued challenging environment marked
by conflict in the Northwest/Southwest regions. The EBITDA margin for MTN Cameroon widened by
3,0pp to 32,8%.

Excluding MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast, the WECA markets grew their service revenue by an
aggregate of 12,9%, driven by double-digit service revenue growth in MTN Benin, MTN Conakry and
MTN Liberia.

Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
In a challenging operating environment, the MENA region achieved a pleasing performance in the
quarter, with service revenue up 24,0%, supported by solid growth in data revenue. Subscribers
(excluding MTN Irancell) were stable at 26,1 million.

MTN Syria grew service revenue by 20,7%, driven by growth in voice (up 8,3%) and data (up 19,8%).
The EBITDA margin improved by 6,5pp to 42,1%. MTN Sudan grew service revenue by 62,7%,
underpinned by growth in voice (up 47,6%) and data (up 92,3%) on the back of higher usage. The
EBITDA margin expanded by 3,8pp to 36,5%. MTN Afghanistan and MTN Yemen also delivered
growth, with service revenue up by 16,2% and 7,3% respectively.

MTN Irancell, our equity-accounted joint venture, delivered a solid performance despite its
challenging operating environment, the depreciation of the currency and the high rate of inflation.
MTN Irancell was the only operation to be significantly affected by COVID-19 during Q1, as Iran was
one of the countries experiencing the pandemic early on. Against this backdrop, service revenue grew
by 29,8%, with data revenue up by 43,5%, and the EBITDA margin improving by 1,8pp to 37,9%.

                                                                                                  
Regulatory and legal considerations

MTN Afghanistan anti-terrorism complaint
On 27 December 2019 a complaint for violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia (the Complaint). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan between 2009
and 2017, and on behalf of their families. The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses
supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure.
The defendants named in the Complaint are six different groups of affiliated companies, one of which
is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies, including MTN Afghanistan.

In late April 2020, MTN filed a “motion to dismiss” that asks the U.S. court to end the lawsuit and grant
a judgment in MTN’s favour for two independent reasons: because the court lacks jurisdiction over
MTN, which does not operate in the United States, and because the complaint does not allege any
conduct by MTN that would have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.

MTN remains of the view that it conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its
territories and will defend its position where necessary.

MTN South Africa Competition Commission inquiry
In March 2020 MTN SA announced the outcomes from its engagement with the Competition
Commission (CompCom) and its response to the Data Service Market Inquiry. The announcement set
out a range of voluntary solutions to deepen our ongoing drive to reduce the cost to communicate.
These focused on the affordability of monthly prepaid data bundles, the provision of lifeline data
access utilising the Ayoba app and the zero-rating of data for public benefit service websites.

In late April 2020, MTN SA concluded its consent agreement with the CompCom to regulate these
arrangements and the agreement has been submitted to the Competition Tribunal.

Spectrum temporary allocation and auction in South Africa
On 17 April 2020, ICASA released free emergency spectrum for use by operators during the national
state of disaster. The allocation of spectrum to MTN SA was: 40 MHz from the 700-800 MHz band, 50
MHz from the 2,6 GHz band and 50 MHz from the 3,5 GHz band. The temporary allocation is subject
to certain minimum obligations. MTN SA will be ready to make use of the additional spectrum
allocation within six weeks of it being issued, and we expect it to significantly ease the congestion in
hotspots across the country where data traffic has surged. The temporary spectrum will be available
for use until November 2020.

Uganda licence renewal
We have agreed with the authorities in Uganda to extend our licence in that market to June 2032, for
a consideration of US$100 million. We made an initial payment of US$50 million in March 2020 and
the final payment will be made on settlement of the detailed terms and conditions of the licence.


COVID-19 pandemic impact on the business

For MTN, the main considerations arising from the COVID-19 impact revolve around four areas                                                                                                       7
namely: social (our people and communities), commercial (including our customers), network and
supply chain as well as funding and liquidity. Our operating companies (opcos) have customised their
respective responses within this framework.

Social
Our immediate priority has been the health and safety of our people and playing our part in slowing
down the transmission of the virus. We initiated work-from-home programmes across our markets,
enabling our staff to work remotely while ensuring the continuity in our operations. Our daily health
monitor survey allows us to ascertain the wellbeing of our staff and their families and we have
increased our health and safety measures including the compulsory wearing of masks, as well as the
use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers and other personal protective equipment (PPE) across our offices,
branches and experience centres for use by customers and employees.

More broadly, in addition to our employees, our social response also focuses on our customers,
vulnerable groups, support of government efforts and participating in industry interventions. To this
end MTN Group has announced a R250 million relief package to be deployed in four areas. Firstly, we
established the MTN Global Staff Emergency Fund for employees impacted by the pandemic. The
relief fund has been launched in part through the contributions of MTN Group directors, executives
and staff. This includes a pledge from the chairman, group CEO, group CFO and a number of directors
to contribute 30% of their board fees and salaries for the second quarter.

Secondly, we have invested in Y’ello Hope Packages for customers. This includes free SMS services,
the waiving of fees for certain Mobile Money transactions, discounted calling during off-peak periods,
zero-rating of certain health, social services and educational sites and payment concessions to our
business customers.

Thirdly, the group will contribute towards the MTN Foundations across our markets, which have been
mobilised to reach those most vulnerable through contributions towards tackling health emergencies
to minimise the spread of COVID-19 (disease commodity packages and ICT services needed for health
ministries and health professionals) and enabling students to remain productive by accessing vital
school and university content. Finally, MTN will contribute R70 million to the government’s Solidarity
Fund in South Africa, the market of its birth.

Many of these initiatives are also being amplified at an opco level in our various markets.

Commercial
From March 2020, countries within our footprint implemented a series of restrictions on people’s
movements and business operations to varying timelines and degrees ranging from full lockdowns,
partial lockdowns to “business as usual”. We have observed varying impacts on our commercial
performance, including a slowdown in subscriber additions and recharges.

There has been some counterbalance to this from reduced churn and increased electronic recharges
as we have ramped up our digital channels as a service alternative, to ensure that customers are able
to continue purchasing airtime and accessing our products and services seamlessly. This has also
provided some mitigation for distribution costs. From a revenue viewpoint, the trends have indicated                                                                                               8
some shift in mix, with data revenue increasing, roaming declining and voice revenue coming under
pressure. Fintech revenue has also come under pressure due to the restriction of movement and as
our opcos have discounted many of their fintech services in support of COVID-19 initiatives.

The increase in demand for our data and digital services has driven a surge in usage and traffic on our
networks. In addition to the effects of increased teleworking and home data usage, the increase in
data traffic has also been driven by some of the relief packages and additional value we have put into
the market in support of customers and stakeholders during this time.

Data traffic on our networks has, on aggregate, accelerated by more than 30% when comparing traffic
levels at the end of April 2020 against February 2020, which is before COVID-19-related behaviour
such as work-from-home began in earnest. In our three largest markets on this basis, data traffic in
MTN Nigeria was up 32% (and 156% YoY), in MTN SA was up 56% (and 85% YoY) and in MTN Ghana
was up 39% (181% YoY).

The picture for voice revenue has thus far been mixed across our opcos. The disruption of COVID-19
has resulted in a slowdown in voice usage due to lower economic activity, which has been
compounded by the abovementioned migration to digital connectivity arising from increased
teleworking. For voice traffic, we have observed aggregate declines averaging in the mid- to upper-
single-digits in most markets when comparing 2020 traffic levels for end-April against end-February.
On the same basis, voice traffic in MTN Nigeria was down 9% (and 9% YoY), in MTN SA was down 3%
(and 10% YoY) while in MTN Ghana it was up 10% (and 31% YoY).

How these dynamics will settle remains uncertain at this relatively early stage, and we expect this to
become clearer in the coming quarters depending on how national responses and the economic
impact thereof unfold. The initial trends from April indicate pressure on voice revenue because of
lockdowns, particularly in those of our markets with lower penetration of electronic recharges.
However, we are encouraged that in markets where some lifting of restrictions has started to happen,
such as Nigeria and Ghana, we have already noted signs of recovery in subscriber additions, recharges
and voice traffic while data traffic appears to be holding up at current elevated levels.

Network and supply chain
Our core connectivity services have become more critical over this period and we have prioritised
network continuity, focusing on the availability of spares and equipment as well as the upgrading of
capacity. We note that in some markets like South Africa, the regulator has provided free additional
spectrum on a temporary basis which will help alleviate the pressure on network from increased traffic
in these markets. Our biggest focus for the remainder of the year is ensuring the resilience and
capacity of our networks.

To date, there has been moderate disruption to our supply chain. We have put measures in place to
ensure resilience of our networks and mitigate supply chain risk and are working closely with our
suppliers and partners in implementing increased visibility and control processes. We have built up
inventory and have procured critical spares for at least 12 months. MTN SA, our principal device
market, is experiencing some challenges with the availability of top-end handsets and there are also
some impacts on procurement of SIM cards. We continue to closely monitor our inventory to minimise
significant interruptions.

Funding and liquidity
We have worked to ensure balance sheet strength and resilience over the past few years, which
positions us relatively well to weather the prevailing volatility. Our holdco net debt stood at R55,4
billion at March 2020, which is slightly lower than the December 2019 level. As at the end of
March 2020, our holdco leverage was at 2,5x, primarily affected by the 21,5% weakening of the rand
against the US dollar as at the end of the period.


We are comfortably within our debt covenants, which are gauged on a group consolidated basis. Our
group net-debt/EBITDA ratio stood at 1,1x as at 31 March 2020 (31 December 2019: 1,3x) against our
covenant of 2,5x and our interest cover ratio at 31 March 2020 was 9,4x (31 December 2020: 6,6x)
compared to the covenant of 5,0x. Our group cash balance at the end of March 2020 stood at
R42,1 billion.

We continue to actively manage our maturity profile and have made good progress on our 2020/2021
refinancing priorities, with approximately R15 billion (R12,5 billion in term and revolving credit
facilities, plus R2,5 billion in a domestic medium-term note (DMTN) programme) in debt maturing over
the next 10 months that we are refinancing this year. Of the total refinancing, we have already
concluded R1 billion in local capital markets (under DMTN). This transaction was successfully closed
amid volatile and uncertain local market conditions. We are at an advanced stage in securing
R11 billion of the R12,5 billion of bank funding by the end of June 2020.

We continue to be prudent in our approach around liquidity management and note that, as at
31 March 2020, our holding company liquidity headroom stood at approximately R45,2 billion –
comprising R19,3 billion in cash and R25,8 billion in committed, undrawn credit facilities. The final
dividend payment of approximately R6,7 billion was paid after the quarter-end. Our debt maturity
profile for 2020 and 2021 is R6,5 billion and R12,2 billion respectively.

In terms of dividend upstreaming from our two larger markets, MTN Ghana declared an interim
dividend in April of which approximately US$61 million is attributable to the group, and MTN Nigeria
declared its final 2019 dividend in February of which approximately US$131 million is attributable to
the group subject to shareholder approval at its AGM on 15 May 2020.

Our medium-term priorities remain to reduce our exposure to US dollar debt and improve the funding
mix at the holdco level. Amid the nearer-term risks and uncertainties of the impact of COVID-19 on
markets, we remain focused on preservation of cash and maintaining a healthy liquidity position.


                                                                                                  
Outlook
Looking ahead, the current environment is marked by significant uncertainties. It is still too early to
assess the economic impact of the pandemic on our customers and reliably quantify the direct or
indirect financial effects on our business. The remainder of the year will be shaped by the ramifications
of the pandemic, and we will continue to update shareholders as the effects become clearer.

The effects of COVID-19, and other macro developments, have increased risks such as exchange rate
volatility, economic growth and capital flows in our markets. We have seen the sovereign credit ratings
of our two largest markets, South Africa and Nigeria, downgraded by credit ratings agencies in the
past few months. This will have an impact on economic prospects of the markets as well as MTN at a
group and opco levels. We monitor these developments very closely to assess their implications, and
manage our responses, in order to mitigate these risks. In the meantime, we believe that our extensive
interventions already being implemented will safeguard the sustainability of the business, its people
and its customers in the prevailing challenging environment.

In addition to the work we have done around further strengthening our operational and financial
position, we have implemented cost control measures, focusing on mission critical expenses and
enhanced oversight of expenditure.

Our capital expenditure (capex) focus will be on ensuring the resilience and capacity of our networks.
We anticipate that disruptions in the supply chain and challenges in rolling out coverage under
lockdown rules combined with our emphasis on liquidity will impact on our capex programme for the
year. Our updated capex guidance for 2020 is between R21 billion and R22,0 billion, from R28,3 billion
guided at the 2019 results.

We are not only focused on managing the risks brought about by COVID-19, but also on the
opportunities it creates in the accelerated digitalisation it has brought about. We are well positioned
as a company to benefit from this evolution, especially given our focus on growth in our data, digital
and financial services businesses. The group remains focused on the execution of our BRIGHT strategy
to deliver sustainable growth in our operations.

While the current financial year will be challenging, at this stage we are maintaining our medium-term
framework. We are progressing with the expense efficiency initiatives across our markets that will
support margin management and liquidity across the business. Over the next three to five years we
remain committed to growing service revenue, improving efficiencies, executing on our asset
realisation programme and reducing our holdco leverage ratio. The board will continue to monitor the
environment in the context of our clearly defined capital allocation framework and provide any update
in this regard with our interim results in August 2020.

The financial information on which this quarterly update is based, including constant currency information, has
not been reviewed and reported on by MTN’s external auditors. Constant currency information has been
presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the group's results. In determining the change
in constant currency terms, the prior financial reporting period’s results have been adjusted to the current period
average exchange rates determined as the weighted average of the monthly exchange rates. The measurement
has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira.
The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based on the prior year constant currency results
compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and
MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The
economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be hyperinflationary for the period under review
and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

SUMMARY OF MTN GHANA UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

Shareholders of MTN Group are advised that Scancom PLC (MTN Ghana), has today announced its
unaudited results for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) as follows:

Salient features

    -       Subscribers (QoQ)

        •    Subscribers increased by 6.2% to 23.9 million (+4.5% to 20.7 million*).

        •    Data subscribers increased by 5.4% to 21.2 million (active data subscribers up by 6.1% to 8.6
             million#).

        •    Registered Mobile Money (MoMo) subscribers increased by 6.9% to 15.5 million (active
             MoMo subscribers up by 2.1% to 9.3 million*).

    -       Service revenue up by 20.4% to GH¢1,427 million.

    -       EBITDA up by 34.5% to GH¢768 million.

    -       EBITDA margin up by 5.5 percentage points (pp) to 53.4%.

    -       Capex for the period was GH¢605.2 million^ (GH¢597.2 million under IAS 17).

    -       Outlook: Market conditions are expected to be more challenging for the remainder of the
            financial year as the extent and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are uncertain. As
            such, we are leaning toward a more measured outlook in the near-term.


* Aligned with the MTN Group definition, subscribers are SIMs which generate or participate in an event that
generates revenue for the company. Out of bracket numbers conform to the respective regulator subscriber
definition.

# Active data subscribers as per MTN Group definition are data subscribers who have used more than 5MB in a
month.

^ Capex under IFRS 16 is made up of core capex spend of GH¢215.1m, intangibles of GH¢382.1m and right of use
(RoU) assets of GH¢8.0m for the period.



MTN Ghana delivered a strong performance for the period, despite macro-economic challenges
arising in Ghana in the last month of the quarter from the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Service revenue increased by 20.4%, underpinned by double-digit growth in voice, data and Mobile
Money revenue.

Voice growth was resilient (up 16.6%), driven by an increase in the number of active subscribers*
(+4.5%) as well as various customer value management (CVM) initiatives, which helped to manage
churn and support usage. The contribution of voice to total service revenue decreased from 47.1% to
45.6%, as other lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional business in line with our
revenue diversification strategy.

The double-digit increase in data revenue (up 19.4%) was attributable to growth in active data users#
(+6.1%) and growth in the number of smartphones on the network (+2.1%). Data revenue’s
contribution to service revenue decreased marginally from 26.7% to 26.5%.

Mobile Money revenue grew strongly (up 30.4%) and benefited from an increase in the number of
active subscribers* (+2.1%), higher transactional activity of person-to-person (P2P) and growth in
more advanced services such as retail merchant payments and international remittances. Mobile
Money revenue’s contribution to service revenue increased from 17.9% to 19.4%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 34.5% with an EBITDA
margin expansion of 5.5 percentage points (pp) to 53.4%. This margin improvement was a result of
our cost efficiency initiatives underpinned by continued distribution efficiencies.

Our strong growth in revenue coupled with our cash management initiatives resulted in a strong
growth (+62.1%) in profit after tax and improved our cash generation from our operation by 12.5%.

We invested GH¢215.1 million in core capex^ as we continued to improve our network.

In line with existing banking covenants, there was no breach to any of the financial covenants and we
continue to maintain a strong balance sheet.

In Q1 2020, a series of restrictions on people’s movements and business operations were
implemented through executive directives by the President of the Republic of Ghana to mitigate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in some disruptions in demand and supply chains and
consequently led to dampening of the levels of economic activity in the country. The impact of the
pandemic on the global economy, coupled with the sharp fall in oil prices, is likely to significantly
slowdown GDP growth in Ghana.

The government – through the Bank of Ghana (BoG) – announced certain regulatory measures to help
with the fight against the pandemic. These include the zero-rating of all Mobile Money peer-to-peer
(P2P) transfers up to GH¢100 daily for a period of 90 days and simplified registration for merchant and
person-to-person (P2P) wallets and purchases from e-commerce and other platforms. The
government also increased the daily transaction limits and balances for the various wallet types to
promote customer safety through non-cash transactions. The BoG also extended the deadline to meet
the minimum capital requirements for Payment Service Providers and Electronic Money Issuers, from
the original date of 30 June 2020 to 31 December 2020.

In support of government’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19, MTN Ghana – through the MTN
Ghana Foundation – donated GH¢5 million for the procurement of medical supplies. These include
personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essentials to support frontline medical staff. We also
increased our focus on four key areas: our people, our customers, our network and our efficiency.

For our people, the immediate priority is their health and safety. Our work-from-home programme
enables our staff to work remotely while ensuring the continuity in our operations. Our daily health
monitor survey allows us to ascertain the wellbeing of our staff and their families. We have also
launched a Ghana Staff Care Emergency Fund in support of MTN Ghana’s extended workforce who
may be affected by the pandemic. We have also positioned alcohol-based hand sanitizers across our
offices, branches and experience centres for use by customers and employees to augment the
deployment and use of temperature guns, PPEs and the practising of social distancing.

For our customers, we have ramped up our digital channels as a service alternative, to ensure that
they are able to continue purchasing airtime and accessing our products and services seamlessly.
Through zero-rating, MTN Ghana has also offered free access to over 100 educational online sites to
support students’ and teachers’ remote learning and research activities during this period. So far, this
supports more than 250,000 customers, consuming over 3.5TB of free data per day for educational
purposes. MTN Ghana has also provided GH¢10,000 worth of free data to all university students on
our MTN Bright Scholarship scheme.

MTN Ghana is collaborating with the National Information Technology Authority (NITA) to offer free
access to Government of Ghana’s Smart Workplace Portal to enable government workers work from
home. In addition, MTN Ghana has already offered free access through the zero-rating of several
government websites that are providing health and other COVID-19 related information such as the
Ghana Health Service website and others. MTN has also provisioned short codes to facilitate
information flow on COVID-19 for the Ministry of Information to be used for social media services. To
augment efforts in spreading information, MTN Ghana is also assisting with the circulation of safety
tips received from the Ghana Health Service and promotion of the national emergency hotline to our
customers.

MTN Ghana has also brought to bear its leadership in the technology space by supporting the infection
monitoring and contact tracing team in line with the requisite legal procedures. To support this
further, MTN Ghana has initiated the provision of 800 sim cards with 8TB of data to National Security
and 10 Turbonet devices with 2.25TB of data to the National COVID-19 Response Team for use by
contact tracers.

During the period leading to the imposition and lifting of the lockdown, MTN Ghana experienced
increased traffic on its network as students, government agencies, businesses and individuals adopted
social distancing measures such as working from home, increased use of eLearning platforms and
more social media engagements. We have put in place measures to ensure that our network remains
resilient and supports round-the-clock connectivity during this period and beyond.

We had started the year with a strong Q1 performance and optimism about the financial year 2020.
However, given the uncertainty associated with the likely duration and related economic impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic calls for a more measured outlook in the near-term. The potential areas of
impact and focus include employee safety; supply chain delays and availability; management of credit
and liquidity; currency risk; counterparty risk; and the potential revenue impact from reduced
consumer spend.

Voice and Mobile Money revenue have experienced an immediate impact from the current macro
disruptions and Government interventions to manage the COVID-19 situation, based on early
trends. The decline in voice traffic and Mobile Money transactional activity is largely due to a
slowdown in economic activity and a reduction in consumer discretionary spend.

Although we have witnessed growth in data revenue, due to shifts in behaviour to work-from-home
and school-from-home schemes, this does not fully offset the slowdown in voice and Mobile Money
revenue.

While we continue to monitor and analyse the current situation and explore various scenarios in a bid
to mitigate its impact on our business, we remain cautious of the uncertainties and heightened risks
associated with the COVID-19 impact and acknowledge that the remainder of the financial year will
be shaped by the impact of these developments on the Ghanaian economy and consequently, on our
business.

In line with our transition journey from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an
emerging digital operator, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the ‘Year of the customer: the digital
experience’ with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create
value for our shareholders.



Notice is hereby given that a gross interim dividend of GH¢ 0.03 per share for the period to 31 March
2020 has been declared. This is subject to deduction of appropriate taxes. The number of ordinary
shares in issue at the date of this declaration is 12,290,474,360.

Scancom PLC’s tax reference number is C0003632776. In compliance with the requirements of GSE
rules, the salient dates relating to the payment of the dividend are as follows:

Ex-Dividend Date                                                  Wednesday, 13 May 2020

Qualifying Date                                                      Friday, 15 May 2020

Dividend Payment Date                                                Friday, 29 May 2020

All shareholders registered in the books of Scancom PLC at close of business on Friday, 15 May 2020
qualify for the interim dividend.

In view of the foregoing, the ex-dividend date has been set as Wednesday, 13 May 2020.
Consequently, an investor purchasing MTNGH shares before this date will be entitled to the interim
dividend. However, an investor buying MTNGH shares on or after Wednesday, 13 May 2020 will not
be entitled to the interim dividend.

On Friday, 29 May 2020 the dividend will be transferred electronically to the bank accounts or mobile
money wallets of shareholders who make use of these facilities.

SUMMARY OF MTN NIGERIA UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

Shareholders of MTN Group are advised that MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria),
announced its unaudited results for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 on 28 April 2020 on the Nigerian
Stock Exchange (NSE) as follows:



Salient features:



    •   Mobile subscribers increased by 4.2 million to 68.5 million

    •   Active data users increased by 1.7 million to 26.8 million

financial information is quarter-on-quarter (QoQ, March 2020 versus December 2019).



MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

“We recorded a solid performance in the first quarter, building on the growth momentum we achieved
in Q4 2019. Service revenue was strong and rose by 16.7% driven by voice and data revenue. 4.2 million
subscribers were added to the network driving voice revenue growth of 7.4%. Data revenue increased
by 59.2% supported by growth in data traffic with a further 1.7 million active subscribers connecting
to the internet during the quarter. We continued to deepen data penetration with the further rollout
of 4G sites, increasing 4G population coverage to 48% in Q1 2020 from 44% as at year-end 2019.



We saw strong growth in digital and fintech revenue with digital revenue growing by 63.7%, while
fintech was up by 36.1%. Our mobile money agent network has grown to 178,000, adding 70,000
agents during the quarter.



This performance was achieved against the backdrop of several developments during the quarter.
Value added tax (VAT) was increased in February 2020 from 5% to 7.5%, which adversely affected both
revenue and costs. The situation has been exacerbated by upheavals in the global oil market, which
put significant downward pressure on oil prices leading to an exchange rate adjustment by the Central
Bank of Nigeria on 20 March, 2020, increasing some of our costs. In addition, a series of lockdown
measures began being implemented globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in
significant operational challenges and supply chain disruptions.



In response to these tough times, we have heightened our focus on four key areas – our people, our
customers, our network and our efficiency. The immediate priority for our people is their health and
safety. We have provided facilities to enable our staff to work safely and remotely, ensuring that
operations run smoothly. We run a daily health survey, which enables us to ascertain our staff’s
wellbeing, and we have launched a staff-care emergency fund to provide an added buffer for our
people who may be affected by the pandemic.



To support our customers and communities, we launched the ‘Y’ello Hope Package,’ a broad set of
initiatives deployed to support national efforts at containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, mitigate
the pandemic’s social and economic impact, and keep our customers connected to their loved ones,
critical resources and support. This includes supporting government with communication systems,
connectivity, analytical response management and risk profiling tools; and facilitating efforts of the
Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) by providing connectivity, SMS distribution of updates and
personal protective equipment for front-line health workers.



MTN has also contributed N1 billion to the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), a private-sector
task force working to increase public awareness, provide food relief to 1.7 million households
nationwide, and support the nation’s crisis response capabilities by providing medical supplies and
equipment, isolation and treatment centres, test kits and training. In addition, MTN customers have
been granted free daily access to key health-related websites, and fees for local money transfers via
the MoMo Agent Network have been waived. Finally, to ensure the most vulnerable and marginalised
communities are not left behind, 300 free SMS’s were provided per customer for one month in the first
instance. To date, more than 1 billion free messages have been sent.



Our team has worked extremely hard to minimise the impact of the temporary disruption in the supply
chain on operational continuity. We have put in place necessary measures and resources to keep the
network running, continue network rollout and expansion of population coverage.



Towards the end of March, we started experiencing a change in traffic patterns with a drop in voice
traffic which was partially offset by an increase in data traffic on the network. Data traffic increased
as customers began to adopt digital channels for most of their activities and routines including
telecommuting, entertainment and social media engagements due to the lockdown. To accommodate
this, we have deployed additional resources to upgrade the capacity of the network. Enhancing
operating efficiency remains critical at this time, with an increased focus on optimising costs and cash
flow generation.



The impact of COVID-19 on our first quarter performance was not significant, except for delayed
orders. However, given that lockdown measures only started towards the end of the quarter, and given
the uncertainty associated with the likely duration and related economic impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and its effects on our customers, unstable oil prices as well as pressure on the rate and
availability of foreign exchange, it is currently too early to reliably quantify the direct or indirect
financial effects on our business going forward. We have activated our business continuity plan and
implemented extensive response measures aimed at mitigating the potential impact on the network
and overall business performance. The continuity plan covers, among others: supply chain,
management of credit and liquidity, currency risk, counterparty risk, and potential revenue impacts
from reduced consumer spend.



Operational review

Over the quarter, we continued to gain market share, with the addition of 4.2 million subscribers to
the network, representing a 6.5% increase in the quarter to 68.5 million. Active data subscribers also
increased by 6.6% to 26.8 million, representing an additional 1.7 million data users. The increase in
the subscriber base was supported by the deployment of additional SIM registration devices and
various customer value management (CVM) initiatives implemented during the quarter.



Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 7.4% (+3.2% QoQ) and accounted for 69.1% of service
revenue. Voice traffic increased by 7.2% YoY, supporting revenue growth.



Data revenue, making up 22.6% of service revenue, continued to accelerate with growth of 59.2%
(+12.3% QoQ). This was achieved through increased data subscribers and improved 4G penetration,
which supported traffic growth of 130.4% YoY (25.2% QoQ). 1.6 million new smartphones were added
to the network, bringing smartphone penetration to 42.6% of the base.



The digital business returned to growth, with revenue increasing 63.7% (+8.0% QoQ) supported by a
rich portfolio of digital products and services and improvement in customer journey experience. There
was an improvement in the uptake of digital offerings and efforts to expand the active user base for
the digital business continued to yield positive results. During the quarter, 1.6 million new users were
added, bringing the active base for digital subscriptions to 3.8 million users.



Fintech revenue growth was 36.1% (+10.8% QoQ) in Q1 2020 driven by an increase in the adoption of
MTN Xtratime, an airtime lending service. 70,000 MoMo agents were added in the quarter, bringing
the total number of registered agents to 178,000 nationwide. The total volume of transactions
processed by agents during the quarter was over 5.6 million, about 80% of which were airtime
vending. Transaction fees for all money transfers using the MoMo agent network were suspended for
an initial period of one month starting 23 March, 2020 as part of the Y’ello Hope Package.



The enterprise business segment continued to improve, with revenue growth of 12.7%. Enterprise
business includes revenue from mobile and fixed connectivity, cloud and ICT solutions, and devices. It
cuts across voice, data and digital services for SMEs, public sector and large enterprise customers.



On the cost side, operating expenses increased by 22.3% driven mainly by an increase in lease rental
costs following an aggressive 4G roll site rollout. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 15.3%, while EBITDA margin moderated by 0.6pp to 52.7% due to the
increase in costs. Capital expenditure, excluding right of use assets, was N24.7 billion. Overall,
reported growth of 8.9% in profit before tax was impacted by an increase in finance costs due to higher
borrowings, while profit after tax and earnings per share both rose by 5.6%.




Funding and Liquidity



We are currently diversifying funding strategies and sources to fast track capital expenditure related
to hardware investment and to optimise our funding costs. We have strong free cash flow and
approved loan facility headroom to meet financial obligations. In line with existing banking covenants,
there is headroom to leverage the balance sheet optimally for strategic investments. Major credit
exposures are from trade partners, but these are secured by bank guarantees. This enables the trade
partners to improve sales turnover even in this period of lockdown. We have kept foreign currency
exposures within manageable limits so that the balance sheet can withstand currency volatility. The
debt split is 92% in local currency and 8% in foreign currency.



Tower Providers’ Contract



In 2014, we made a strategic decision to sell passive infrastructure to enable the company to focus on
its core business. Although MTN Nigeria continues to own a small number of towers, it currently has
lease agreements with various tower providers and this constitutes a significant portion of service
costs.



In terms of the agreement between MTN Nigeria and the tower companies, all payments are made in
Naira, but in certain instances some are quantified in foreign currency and converted into Naira at the
official exchange rate published by the CBN. This rate was recently reset from 305 to 360 and will
apply to the relevant contracts with effect from 1 April 2020. This will put pressure on margins going
forward. However, we are in continued discussions with our tower providers to optimise these long-
term contracts.



Outlook



We started the year with an upbeat view of the prospects for the business in 2020, which was
substantiated by the strong performance in service revenue delivered in the first quarter. However,
recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, oil price volatility and foreign exchange rates
and availability call for a more measured outlook in the near-term. The remainder of the year will be
shaped by the impact of these developments, which remains highly uncertain at this time.



Voice revenue has experienced an immediate impact from the current macro disruptions, based on
early trends, especially in the mass market segment. There has been a decline in voice traffic post-
COVID lockdown largely due to a slowdown in economic activity and a reduction in people’s earning
capacity. Although we have witnessed growth in data revenue, it does not fully offset the decline in
voice revenue. This may persist with the extension of the lockdown, and continued macroeconomic
and other challenges. The company continues to monitor and analyse these developments, and their
potential impact on our business.



We will continue to invest in the network to provide adequate capacity and resilience. This is key as
data traffic on the network continues to increase, not least because of COVID-19-related relief efforts.
Although the situation remains fluid due to uncertainties around the potential impact of COVID-19 as
well as oil price, foreign exchange rate volatility and foreign currency availability on the business, we
are continually assessing the situation and implementing mitigating interventions. We believe that the
business is well-placed to weather the current macroeconomic and social turmoil.

MTN Group Limited Credit Rating affirmed by Moody’s.

Noteholders are hereby advised regarding the rating affirmation
of MTN Group, being the Issuer’s Guarantor. Despite its
sovereign rating downgrade of South Africa, Moody’s has left
MTN’s rating unchanged and affirmed its Ba1 rating. Moody's has
also revised MTN's national scale CFR higher to Aa2.za from
Aa3.za to reflect the updated mapping of Global Scale Ratings
to NSR due to the downgrade of the sovereign rating.

Moody’s has also left the negative outlook unchanged to reflect
the exposure to weakening sovereign credit quality in some of
MTN's key markets such as South Africa (Ba1 negative) and Nigeria
(B2 negative).

Moody’s decision to affirm MTN’s rating resulted from Moody’s
view that the Company’s healthy credit metrics and good
liquidity will help to absorb the deterioration in the domestic
macroeconomic environment.

MTN Group Limited-Credit Rating Review by S&P Global(“S&P”)

On 1 April 2020, S&P took rating actions on Nigeria-exposed
corporate issuers that are rated at or above sovereign.

S&P also considered the effects that lower GDP growth, potential
currency movements, and lower oil prices could pose to issuers'
earnings prospects and leverage, within the context of their
exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19)-related local and global
developments.

S&P’s rationale for the rating review was that the Nigeria-
exposed issuers would be facing the following conspicuous risks
that would have an impact on the issuers:

  •   lower demand for a wide variety of products and services
      due to a likely broad-based COVID-19-related economic
      recession, negative effects on Nigeria's government
      finances and
  •   oil-related industries following the recent slump in oil
      prices, and risks of Nigerian naira (NGN) depreciation
      versus other global currencies.

S&P, stated however, that they foresaw COVID-19 as having a
modest effect on MTN's financial metrics, given the heightened
importance of telecommunications during a period of restricted
movement.

MTN Group Ltd - S&P lowered the long-term issuer credit rating
to 'BB' from 'BB+' and maintained the negative outlook.

Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings Ltd - S&P lowered the issuer
credit and issue ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+' and maintained the
negative outlook.

MTN (Mauritius) Investments Ltd - S&P lowered the issue rating
to 'BB' from 'BB+'. The '3 (65%)' recovery rating is unchanged.

Furthermore, the South African national scale rating was also
lowered to 'zaAA' from 'zaAAA'.
Notwithstanding the above,   MTN   Group’s   stand-alone   credit
profile remains unchanged.

MTN South Africa (“MTN SA”) announces outcomes from engagements with the Competition
Commission (“CompCom”)


Further to the announcements on 4 December 2019 and 12 December 2019, MTN SA has today
announced the outcomes from its engagements with the CompCom and response to its Data Service
Market Inquiry (“inquiry”). MTN SA has developed a set of voluntary undertakings in the form of a social
compact to further address the affordability of data services for its customers and MTN remains in
discussion with the CompCom on the options to formalise these elective solutions and the
implementation thereof.

Included in these initiatives are three areas which focus on deepening MTN’s ongoing drive to reduce the
cost to communicate. These are: the affordability of monthly prepaid bundles, lifeline data and the zero-
rating of data for public benefit service websites.

With regard to monthly prepaid data bundles, MTN SA will, in April 2020, reduce the price of its monthly
bundles of 1GB and below by between 25-50% and specifically the 1GB monthly bundle will decrease by
33% to R99. This continues the work MTN SA has done to improve the affordability of data for its
customers, having already brought the effective rate of data on its network down by 76% between
February 2017 and February 2020.

In terms of lifeline data, MTN SA will provide each of its customers 20MB of free data daily – or the
equivalent of 600MB per customer every month – through its instant messaging platform, Ayoba. Ayoba
currently has 500 000 customers in South Africa and is expected to continue to scale through the lifeline
offering.

MTN currently offers zero-rated data access to a range of websites which includes schools, and
universities. These will form part of the broader public benefit website service. In April 2020, MTN will
extend the websites that form part of the public benefit service to also include health, public universities,
vocational colleges, educational resources as well as employment sites based on terms and conditions
and criteria defined by MTN and after application and approval from MTN.

From April 2020, MTN will launch the OpenTime service, which will be enable free access to public benefit
services through a link on this website. MTN SA will offer a monthly 500MB free data access to public
benefit services websites every month, amounting to 6GBs per year, for each of MTN SA’s 29 million
customers.

While there will be pressure on MTN SA’s short-term financial performance from these initiatives, MTN
believe that the reduction in pricing will be compensated over time by elasticity and customer growth,
and growth in prepaid data service revenue will return in a couple of quarters.

Radio spectrum is the digital highway upon which we depend to carry increasing mobile data at more
cost-effective prices. This is acutely felt in South Africa, which has among the lowest spectrum allocation
in all our MTN markets. The release of new spectrum in South Africa is urgently needed and will greatly
assist our ability to service increased customer demand in a more cost-effective manner.

MTN completes the sale of ATC joint ventures for R8,9 billion


Our asset realisation programme (“ARP”), introduced in March 2019, aims to reduce debt, simplify our
portfolio, reduce risk and improve returns.

Subsequent to MTN Group’s announcement on 11 March 2020 reporting its 2019 annual results and the
conclusion of the disposal of its stake in ATC Uganda for R2,2 billion, MTN confirms that regulatory
approvals have now been received for the disposal of its stake in ATC Ghana. MTN is due to receive further
transaction proceeds of approximately $384 million (R6,7 billion, based on an exchange rate of R17,4:$1)
in the next week. This takes the total proceeds received for the disposal of both ATC Uganda and ATC
Ghana to R8,9 billion, which will be applied to paying down US-dollar debt and general corporate
purposes.

On completion, the Group will have realised R15.0 billion within the first 12 months of its initial three-
year ARP. Consequently, MTN has enhanced its ARP guidance framework to a target of at least R25 billion
in further asset realisations over the medium-term (3-5 years), and a holding company leverage target
ratio of below 2,0 times.

MTN has strengthened its operational and financial position is well-placed to weather the prevailing
turbulent macroeconomic environment. The Group remains focused on its strategic execution and
committed to its clearly-defined and disciplined capital allocation framework.

MTN declared a final dividend of 355 cents per share on 11 March 2020, bringing the total dividend to
550 cents per share for the 2019 financial year.

Salient dates relating to the payment of the final dividend are as follows:

          constitutes pro forma financial information to the extent that it is not extracted from the segment disclosure
          included in the audited summary group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. This pro forma
          financial information has been presented to eliminate the impact of the pro forma adjustments from the
          consolidated financial results to achieve a comparable YoY analysis. The pro forma adjustments have been
          calculated in terms of the group accounting policies disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year
          ended 31 December 2019, except for the changes in accounting policies as a result of the adoption of the
          accounting standards effective 1 January 2019.
     2.   Constant currency information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in currency rates on the
          group's results. In determining the change in constant currency terms, the prior financial reporting period's results
          have been adjusted to the current period average exchange rates determined as the weighted average of the
          monthly exchange rates. The measurement has been performed for each of the group's currencies, materially
          being that of the US dollar and Nigerian naira. The constant currency growth percentage has been calculated based
          on the prior year constant currency results compared to the current year results. In addition, in respect of MTN
          Irancell, MTN Sudan, MTN South Sudan and MTN Syria, the constant currency information has been prepared
          excluding the impact of hyperinflation. The economies of Sudan, South Sudan and Syria were assessed to be
          hyperinflationary for the period under review and hyperinflation accounting was applied.

Group president and CEO, Rob Shuter comments:
""In 2019, the 25-year anniversary of MTN Group, we delivered solid operational execution and
commercial momentum across most of our operations as well as a number of innovations that support
greater digital and financial inclusion.

In challenging trading conditions, we maintained operating leverage with a 9,8%* increase in service
revenue and a 13,6%* increase in EBITDA. The group's EBITDA margin improved by 1,2 pp* to 35,5%*
on an IAS 17 basis, in line with our medium-term guidance. Our holding company leverage remained
stable at 2,2x and we reduced our capex intensity to 17,5%, from 19,3%, also on an IAS 17 basis.

The group's results were supported by double-digit growth in service revenue by both MTN Nigeria and
MTN Ghana, while economic pressure, new data usage rules and a reassessment of recognition criteria
for roaming revenue from Cell C impacted our performance in South Africa.

We advanced our work to build a digital operator, adding 18,2 million subscribers to reach a total base
of 251 million, and recording 95 million active data users and 35 million active MoMo users. This
growth is central to our belief that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life. In
support of this, we launched a $20 smartphone during the year, following on from our $20 smart
feature phone developed in 2018.

To ensure Africa doesn't miss out on the instant messaging revolution, we launched our own instant
messaging platform, Ayoba, in March 2019. Ayoba is now live in 12 markets and has registered two
million monthly active users. Broadening our fintech offering remains a priority, and MoMo is now live
in South Africa. In Nigeria, we received our super-agent licence and by December 2019 had 108 000
registered agents.

We delivered approximately R14 billion of asset realisations within the first 12 months of our three-
year R15 billion asset realisation programme. We moved towards more localisation of operations,
most notably with the listing of MTN Nigeria, and recorded progress on various regulatory issues,
including the AGF matter on taxes in Nigeria. Relationships with stakeholders across our markets
improved, and we reported our highest employee engagement score yet.

Inspired to harness the pioneering spirit that has built MTN over the last 25 years we remain committed
to delivering on our strategy in a more agile way in close collaboration with our many partners, with
whom we are #GoodTogether.

Given the progress and momentum we are seeing in our commercial, financial and strategic initiatives,
we have enhanced our medium-term guidance framework. While we maintain our medium-term
service revenue, EBITDA, capex and ROE objectives, we are increasing our medium-term (3-5 years)
targets for our asset realisation programme to at least a further R25 billion and are reducing our
holding company leverage target ratio to below 2,0x.""

EPS
Basic earnings per share increased to 499 cents from 485 cents. These were negatively impacted by
77 cents or 13,4% because of the adoption of IFRS 16.

Dividends
The board has declared a gross final dividend of 355 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for
the year to 550 cents per share, up 10% from prior year.

Declaration of final ordinary cash dividend
Notice is hereby given that a gross final dividend of 355 cents per share for the period to 31 December
2019 has been declared and will be paid out of reserves. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the
date of this declaration is 1 884 269 758 (including 9 426 634 treasury shares held by MTN Holdings
and 76 835 378 shares held by MTN Zakhele Futhi).

The dividend will be subject to a maximum local dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net
dividend of 284 cents per share to those shareholders who bear the maximum rate of dividend
withholding tax of 71 cents per share. The net dividend per share for the respective categories of
shareholders for the different dividend tax rates is as follows:
    * 0%                 355,00 cents per share
    * 5%                 337,25 cents per share
    * 7,5%               328,38 cents per share
    * 10%                319,50 cents per share
    * 12,5%              310,63 cents per share
    * 15%                301,75 cents per share
These different dividend tax rates are a result of the application of tax rates in various double-taxation
agreements as well as exemptions from dividend tax.

Prospects and guidance

Well positioned to deliver growth
Our markets are growth markets. Our infrastructure and investments, our established leading position
as well as the characteristics of our markets - including significant population growth, low levels of
smartphone penetration and data and digital adoption as well as large unbanked populations - ensure
that we are well positioned for growth.

Guided by our well-defined BRIGHT strategy, we are optimising efficiencies, capex and cashflow as
well as creating sustainable economic value, enhancing sustainable societies and ensuring eco-
responsibility as we build a digital operator.

Following data price reductions in South Africa and Nigeria in 2019, we expect price elasticity to
improve data revenue growth in 2020. In Nigeria, expansion of our 4G network and migration of
incidental to active data users remain key priorities to drive data revenue growth.

We continue to work towards obtaining a payment service banking licence in Nigeria. We will further
scale the basic mobile financial services products, deepen advanced services as well as increase our
merchant base, as part of our plans to build a fintech ecosystem. Having met our initial milestone in
Nigeria, we will sustain this momentum to grow our network of agents to 300 000 in 2020.

We will further strengthen and grow our digital offerings. We plan to continue to roll out Ayoba into
our markets. We will also integrate payments into the Ayoba service as part of our broadening of the
fintech business, as well as integrating Ayoba into MTN segmented offers. After launching our time-
based music streaming service MusicTime! in six of our markets, we will expand market coverage and
improve the offerings as well as build our digital marketing business.

In 2020 we will continue to invest in our networks to ensure we are ready for the digital revolution
and plan to increase our capex spend by 13% to R28,5 billion.


Medium-term guidance
Given the pleasing progress and momentum we are seeing in our commercial, financial and strategic
initiatives, we have reviewed and enhanced our medium-term (3 - 5 years) guidance framework.

We will maintain our target of double-digit growth in group service revenue in constant currency
terms, MTN Nigeria's service revenue to grow above inflation with double-digit growth, and mid-
single-digit growth in service revenue from MTN South Africa.

Over this period, we expect to continue to improve our group EBITDA margin through our ongoing
efficiency programmes and delivering on our ROE target.

By leveraging historical investments, improved procurement processes and an increasing revenue
contribution from our digital businesses, we expect the group capex intensity to improve steadily over
the medium term on an IFRS reported basis.

Our asset realisation programme (ARP) has performed better than anticipated. We have therefore
revised our medium-term target to secure at least a further R25 billion in asset realisations over the
medium-term. This is within the context of our localisation ambitions, MTN's portfolio of assets that
have been identified as not long-term strategic and market conditions being conducive. We have
further revised our holdco leverage ratio to  below 2,0x' and remain focused on delivering on our
capital allocation priorities as previously communicated.

The board remains committed to targeting growth of 10% to 20% in the dividend.

We note the developments around the Coronavirus outbreak, which has been an unexpected shock
for China's economy, as well as the global economy. While we acknowledge its potential impact on
our supply chain, we continue to monitor developments and are developing contingency plans to
mitigate the impact. Having assessed the impact on our supply chain, and assuming current conditions
do not worsen, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our near-term network rollout
plans.

Management succession
The MTN group president and CEO Rob Shuter will step down from his role at the end of his fixed four-
year contract in March 2021. Under his leadership significant progress has been made, including
establishing and effectively communicating a clear vision and strategy, driving the resolution of a
number of complex matters and delivering significant improvements in transformation, operational
performance and staff morale.

The MTN board thanks Rob for the contribution he has made, and continues to make, to MTN. The
board, led by the chairman, will manage the succession process and expects to conclude this during
the year, thus enabling a seamless handover.

In other changes, the group chief technology and IT officer Charles Molapisi has been appointed to
the group executive committee, reporting to the group president and CEO and the fixed contract of
the group chief operations officer, Jens Schulte-Bockum, has been extended until 31 March 2022.

Unless otherwise stated, financial and non-financial information is year-on-year (YoY, full-year 2019 versus 2018). In

MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria) is one of Africa's largest providers of communications
services with a clear vision to lead the delivery of a bold, new digital world. We announce our audited
results for the full year ended 31 December 2019.

MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman comments:

""I am pleased with our performance in 2019, which demonstrates the progress we have made in the
implementation of our BRIGHT strategy. Despite a challenging operating environment, we continued
to deliver double-digit growth in service revenue in line with our medium-term guidance. Voice revenue
growth remained healthy, and data revenue continued to accelerate, supporting a 12.6% increase in
service revenue with an acceleration in growth to 14.0% YoY in Q4 2019.

Following the completion of the SIM re-registration exercise in Q3 2019, we recorded 2.7 million net
additions in Q4. In total, we added 6.1 million new subscribers to our network in 2019. Although the
last quarter is usually seasonally strong, service revenue growth (14.0%) in Q4 outpaced the seasonal
effect.

In the third quarter, we focused on several initiatives to enhance coverage and drive data usage
penetration. These initiatives include optimising frequencies, expanding our 4G network coverage with
over 6,000 additional sites leveraging 800MHz spectrum and repositioning our commercial data
offerings.

It is pleasing to note that the promising results we reported at the end of Q3 2019 accelerated in the
fourth quarter. Corresponding with the increase in our active data subscriber net additions by
2.9 million in Q4 2019, our 4G population coverage rose by 8.4 pp to 43.8%, giving people in 68
additional cities access to 4G. We closed the year with 132 cities covered by 4G and became the first
mobile network operator in West Africa to demonstrate the capability of 5G technology. We are excited
about its potential for our customers and Nigeria's overall national development plans.

At 20.9% on an IAS 17 basis (45.2% on reported IFRS basis), our earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose at a rate in excess of revenue growth and we recorded
an EBITDA margin of 44.8% (53.9% on reported IFRS basis). Our reported profit before tax rose by
31.1%, while profit after tax and earnings per share both rose by 38.8%. In line with our dividend policy,
the board has proposed a final dividend of N4.97 kobo per share to be paid out of distributable net
income. This brings the total dividend for the year to N7.92 kobo per share.

We are delighted with the progress made in resolving our dispute with the Attorney General of the
Federation (AGF) on the adequacy of taxes and duties paid. We have discontinued the legal action
against the AGF following the transfer of the matter to the relevant authorities and look forward to a
final resolution. We have always fulfilled our tax obligations and remain committed to maintaining
good relationships with all regulatory authorities.

Finally, we achieved a major milestone in the history of MTN Nigeria with the conversion from a private
company to a public limited company and the subsequent listing on the premium board of the Nigerian
Stock Exchange, which has led to a broader base of Nigerian shareholders for the company.""

Operational review

During the year, we focused on building our subscriber base, resulting in growth of 10.5% in net
additions to a total of 64.3 million subscribers. Our active data subscribers rose by 34.9% to
25.2 million on the back of several initiatives. As a result, the ratio of active data users to total mobile
subscribers increased by 7.1 pp to 39.2% in 2019 with strong potential for future growth.

Voice revenue growth remained healthy at 8.4% and accounted for 72.7% of service revenue. Voice
traffic increased by 7.6%, supporting revenue growth.

In addition, we have seen rapid acceleration in data revenue growth enabled by greater population
coverage, a revamp of our data portfolio and initiatives to drive 4G device penetration. We added 5.3
million new smartphones to our network, bringing smartphone penetration to 41.8% of our base,
while data traffic rose by 85.8%. Our interventions in the year helped to drive a 42.4% increase in data
revenue for the year (63.1% YoY in Q4 2019). Data contributed 18.8% to service revenue, up 3.9 pp
from 14.9% in 2018.

Digital revenue gained momentum as we started to see quarterly growth from Q3 2019. We further
focused on building a sustainable active user base for our digital business, while improving the
customer journey and experience on value-added services (VAS). In Q4 2019, we launched MusicTime,
one of our flagship digital offerings. The active base for our digital subscriptions surpassed 2.1 million
users during the year, as we continue to build critical mass for our portfolio of digital products and
services. On a sequential QoQ (quarter-on-quarter, Q4 19 vs Q3 19) basis, digital revenue increased
by 23.0% and we target sustained growth into 2020.

                                                                                                          
Fintech revenue growth was 23.3%, supported by increased adoption of MTN Xtratime, our airtime
lending service. We launched a super-agent service in August and are pleased with the initial rollout
and uptake of the service. We closed the year with a network of 108,000 agents registered nation-
wide. The agent network served almost one million customers in the first four months of operation,
and we are maintaining our focus on further expansion. To cater to a broader market and encourage
further adoption, we are also widening the service offering - from basic transfer service and
airtime/data sales to a more extensive bouquet, including cash deposit and withdrawal services, bill
payments and facilitating e-commerce.

Our enterprise business segment continued to deliver solid results, with revenue growth of 20.3%.

On the cost side, the increase in operating expenses on an IAS 17 basis was 4.4%, which was below
the rate of inflation. This reflects progress with our cost management initiatives and reduction of non-
recurring expenses. We maintained our leadership position in network net promoter score (NPS) as
we continued to invest to improve service quality and drive 4G expansion. This resulted in a 13.1%
increase in capital expenditure and capex intensity of 17.8% on an IAS 17 basis. Our overall cash flow
performance was pleasing, with a 26.6% growth in free cash flow to N316.1 billion (IFRS 16: 51.4% to
N378.0 billion).

Overall, our bottom-line remained strong with growth of 31.1% and 38.8% respectively in profit before
and after tax. Earnings per share increased by 38.8% to N9.9k.

Outlook

We are optimistic about the prospects for our business in 2020 and pleased with the continued
momentum from H2 of 2019, and particularly Q4. Expanding 4G network coverage to deliver high-
speed internet to more people nation-wide and data revenue growth remain in focus. We expect
growth in voice revenue to remain healthy. We continue to make good progress with the expansion
of our super-agent network and are confident that the expanded service offerings will position us to
effectively drive broader financial inclusion as well as roll out the payment service bank seamlessly,
once we receive a licence.

We acknowledge the outbreak of Corona Virus worldwide and its potential impact on our supply chain.
While we monitor unfolding developments, we are exploring multiple scenarios in a bid to mitigate
the impact.

Over the next three years, we plan to invest about N600 billion in our network. This investment will
enable us to accelerate our 4G network expansion, deepen population coverage and support the
Federal Government's broadband initiative. We are excited about the possibilities that the transition
to digital presents for our business, and the growth and development of Nigeria.

Commentary

MTN Ghana (Scancom PLC or MTNGH or the Company) delivered a strong performance for the year in a
competitive industry, maintaining market leadership with 55.21%** market share. Service revenue
increased by 22.8% year-on-year (YoY), underpinned by growth in revenue from voice, data and Mobile
Money (MoMo).

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 19.4% YoY) was driven by an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+11.2%), the benefits of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives and pro-
consumer activity, as well as continued improvements to our network. As new lines of revenue continued
to grow much faster than the traditional business, voice revenue's contribution to service revenue
decreased from 46.3% to 45.0%.

Solid data revenue growth (up 32.5% YoY) was attributable to growth in active data users# (+26.6%),
growth in the number of smartphones (+18.5%) on the network and an increase in data usage (up 85.9%
to 256,301 Terabyte). Data revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 26.3% to 28.4%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to grow strongly (up 28.0%) in a year in which we marked the 10th
anniversary of MoMo in Ghana. MoMo growth was attributable to an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+8.9%), commissions on cash-in-cash-out transactions, increased transactional activity of
person-to-person (P2P) transactions as well as good growth in more advanced services - such as retail
merchant payments. MoMo revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 17.9% to 18.6%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 65.7% with a YoY EBITDA
margin expansion of 13.2 pp to 50.8%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management fee, the like-for-
like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 pp to 43.5% (2018 EBITDA margin: 37.6%). The margin improvement
was supported by lower operating expenses, prudent revenue initiatives as well as distribution
efficiencies.

We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 280 2G, 557 3G, 900 4G and 100 rural telephony
sites.

On the regulatory front, during the year the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed into law.
This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required of existing players, we have
applied for the new licence.

MTN Ghana continues to engage with regulatory stakeholders and maintains a firm focus on achieving
continued improvements in customer experience.

Following the expiry of certain technology licences in 2019, the NCA has renewed our 2G licence for 15
years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our International Gateway and Fixed Access
licences, which are pending NCA approval.

We continued to invest in our communities, with the MTN Ghana Foundation support reaching a total of
149 projects since inception in 2007. In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education,
three in health and one in economic empowerment.

The board of MTN Ghana declared an interim dividend of 2 pesewas per share after reviewing the mid-
year performance of the Company. After reviewing the full year performance of the Company, the board
of MTN Ghana shall be recommending a final dividend of 4 pesewas per share, bringing the total dividend
for the 2019 year to 6 pesewas per share. This represents 73.1% of profit after tax and a 20.0% increase
in dividend per share.

2019 marked the  year of the customer' for MTN Ghana and in 2020 we are building on that foundation
as we transition from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an emerging digital operator.
In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the  year of the customer: the digital
experience' with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value
for our shareholders.

Commentary

MTN Ghana (Scancom PLC or MTNGH or the Company) delivered a strong performance for the year in a
competitive industry, maintaining market leadership with 55.21%** market share. Service revenue
increased by 22.8% year-on-year (YoY), underpinned by growth in revenue from voice, data and Mobile
Money (MoMo).

Double-digit growth in voice revenue (up 19.4% YoY) was driven by an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+11.2%), the benefits of various customer value management (CVM) initiatives and pro-
consumer activity, as well as continued improvements to our network. As new lines of revenue continued
to grow much faster than the traditional business, voice revenue's contribution to service revenue
decreased from 46.3% to 45.0%.

Solid data revenue growth (up 32.5% YoY) was attributable to growth in active data users# (+26.6%),
growth in the number of smartphones (+18.5%) on the network and an increase in data usage (up 85.9%
to 256,301 Terabyte). Data revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 26.3% to 28.4%.

Mobile Money revenue continued to grow strongly (up 28.0%) in a year in which we marked the 10th
anniversary of MoMo in Ghana. MoMo growth was attributable to an increase in the number of active
subscribers* (+8.9%), commissions on cash-in-cash-out transactions, increased transactional activity of
person-to-person (P2P) transactions as well as good growth in more advanced services - such as retail
merchant payments. MoMo revenue's contribution to service revenue expanded from 17.9% to 18.6%.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 65.7% with a YoY EBITDA
margin expansion of 13.2 pp to 50.8%. Under IAS 17 and adjusting for the management fee, the like-for-
like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 pp to 43.5% (2018 EBITDA margin: 37.6%). The margin improvement
was supported by lower operating expenses, prudent revenue initiatives as well as distribution
efficiencies.

We continued to invest in our network and rolled out 280 2G, 557 3G, 900 4G and 100 rural telephony
sites.

On the regulatory front, during the year the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed into law.
This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required of existing players, we have
applied for the new licence.

MTN Ghana continues to engage with regulatory stakeholders and maintains a firm focus on achieving
continued improvements in customer experience.

Following the expiry of certain technology licences in 2019, the NCA has renewed our 2G licence for 15
years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our International Gateway and Fixed Access
licences, which are pending NCA approval.

We continued to invest in our communities, with the MTN Ghana Foundation support reaching a total of
149 projects since inception in 2007. In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education,
three in health and one in economic empowerment.

The board of MTN Ghana declared an interim dividend of 2 pesewas per share after reviewing the mid-
year performance of the Company. After reviewing the full year performance of the Company, the board
of MTN Ghana shall be recommending a final dividend of 4 pesewas per share, bringing the total dividend
for the 2019 year to 6 pesewas per share. This represents 73.1% of profit after tax and a 20.0% increase
in dividend per share.

2019 marked the  year of the customer' for MTN Ghana and in 2020 we are building on that foundation
as we transition from a traditional mobile telecommunications operator to an emerging digital operator.
In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the  year of the customer: the digital
experience' with a focus on digitalisation as a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value
for our shareholders.

Trading statement for the year ended 31 December 2019


MTN is currently in the process of finalising its results for the year ended 31 December 2019, which
will be announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (""SENS"") on or about
Wednesday, 11 March 2020.


MTN has adopted the new accounting standard on leases, IFRS 16, with effect from 1 January 2019
and, as permitted by the standard, comparative numbers have not been restated and remain on the
previous accounting treatment of operating leases in accordance with IAS 17. The adoption of IFRS 16
has resulted in an approximately 13% reduction in the reported earnings numbers, arising primarily
from the net effects of (a) lower operating lease costs, (b) higher finance costs, and (c) higher
depreciation charges.

Shareholders are advised that MTN expects to report growth in headline earnings per share (""HEPS""),
on an IFRS reported basis (2018 on IAS 17 and 2019 on IFRS 16) of between 30% and 50%, i.e. HEPS of
between 438 cents and 506 cents for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared with HEPS of 337
cents for the prior financial year. The change in earnings per share (""EPS"") is expected to be between
0% and 10% i.e. a figure of between 485 cents and 534 cents compared with EPS of 485 cents for the
prior financial year.

Attorney General of Nigeria Withdraws USD2 billion Tax Demand Against MTN Nigeria and Refers
Matter to Tax Authorities


On 4 September 2018, MTN announced that MTN Nigeria Communications PLC (""MTN Nigeria"") was
disputing a claim for back taxes of approximately USD2 billion by the Attorney General of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria and Minister of Justice (the ""AGF""). Subsequent to this, MTN Nigeria commenced
legal action in Nigeria against the AGF, which court action was most recently postponed to 30 and
31 January 2020.


MTN Nigeria has been informed by means of a letter received by its legal counsel and dated
8 January 2020, that following careful review and due consultation with relevant statutory agencies,
the AGF has decided to refer the matter to the relevant authorities, being the Federal Inland Revenue
Service (""FIRS"") and Nigeria Customs (""NC""), with a view to them resolving the issues. Accordingly,
the AGF has withdrawn its letter of demand for the aforementioned USD2 billion that was issued in
August 2018.


MTN Nigeria will consequently follow due court process to withdraw its legal action against the AGF
and engage with FIRS and NC on this issue. MTN remains committed to building and maintaining
cordial relationships with all regulatory authorities in Nigeria.

Significant Progress in MTN's Asset Realisation Programme

MTN announced its Asset Realisation Programme (""ARP"") in March 2019 which aims to reduce debt,
simplify its portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise capital of at least R15 billion over three years
(excluding the IHS investment). MTN is pleased to announce the conclusion of two important transactions
reflecting the ongoing progress of this programme.

Firstly, and further to MTN's quarterly update for the period ended 30 September 2019 announcement
released on 31 October 2019, MTN has concluded an agreement to dispose of its 49% equity holdings in
Ghana Tower Interco B.V. (""Ghana Interco"") and Uganda Tower Interco B.V. (""Uganda Interco"") to AT Sher
Netherlands Cooperatief U.A. (""ATC"") for $523 million, approximately R7.3 billion, in cash.

The sale is conditional on customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in Q1 2020. On closing
MTN will record a profit on disposal of approximately R6 billion.

Secondly, as part of the ARP, the redemption of MTN Nigeria preference shares was envisaged as a
necessary part of the simplification of its capital structure.

MTN hereby confirms that the necessary processes have been finalised for the redemption of MTN
Nigeria preference shares for a consideration to MTN of US$315 million (approximately R4,4 billion),
which was received on 31 December 2019.

Following the completion of these transactions, MTN will have realised approximately R14 billion within
the first 12 months of its guided three-year ARP. MTN intends to use the proceeds to pay down US$ debt
and for general corporate purposes. We remain focused on continuing to execute on the important
strategic priorities of reducing debt, simplifying the portfolio and reducing risk.

About Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco

Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco were formed when MTN sold its towers in Ghana and Uganda to
its joint ventures with ATC in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

MTN holds 49% in Ghana Interco and Uganda Interco, and each of these companies hold 100% in ATC
Ghana Limited and ATC Uganda Limited respectively, which in turn own and lease tower assets in their
respective countries.

MTN Statement on Complaint for Violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act

On 27 December 2019 a complaint for violation of the anti-terrorism act was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia (""The Complaint""). The Complaint was filed on behalf of
American service members and civilians, and their families, who were killed or wounded in
Afghanistan between 2009 and 2017.

The Complaint alleges that several Western businesses supported the Taliban by, inter alia, making
payments to ensure the protection of their infrastructure. The defendants named in the complaint are
six different groups one of which is MTN and certain of its subsidiary companies including MTN
Afghanistan.

MTN is reviewing the details of the report and is consulting its advisers but remains of the view that
it conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories and so intends to
defend its position where necessary.

MTN Group shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 3 May 2019.

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, MTN Group
shareholders are advised of the following changes to the MTN Group board of directors (""Board"").

    1. The Chairman of MTN Group, Phuthuma Nhleko, has stepped down from the Board on 15
       December 2019 after overseeing an orderly transition of the Board including the establishment
       of the International Advisory Board.

    2. Further, Alan Harper, Jeff Van Rooyen and Koosum Kaylan have stepped down from the Board
       on 15 December 2019 after an orderly transition and handover to incoming directors.

    3. Mcebisi Jonas assumed the position of Chairman of MTN Group with effect from 15 December

MTN Group from a plucky start-up into one of Africa's largest multinational businesses.

Phuthuma expressed his gratitude to the retiring directors and the Board for persisting passionately on
a roadmap (with twists, turns and diversions) that they collectively forged at strategy sessions. He
wished the entire MTN Group family the very best in continuing to etch a Pan African vision, and
mentioned that there is still a lot to be achieved and celebrated in the future, and he has no doubt the
MTN Group ""can do spirit"" will prevail in realizing the full potential of this vision.

to MTN Group and across all the markets that MTN Group operates in.

Release of Competition Commission of South Africa's summary report on data services market
enquiry

MTN Group has noted the release of the Competition Commission of South Africa's summary report
on the final findings of the data services market enquiry, released on Monday, 2 December 2019.

The detailed report from the Competition Commission is yet to be released. We are currently studying
the summary report and will not be able to comment in more detail until we have seen the full
document. We are also reviewing the ICASA discussion document released last Friday.

We reiterate comments made earlier in the year that MTN South Africa has substantially reduced the
effective price of data in South Africa, having also invested heavily in the network to
accommodate growing data demand with limited spectrum availability. MTN Group has invested over
R50 billion in the South African network in the last five years and has pledged a further R50 billion of
investment over the next five years as part of delivering a world-class network for all South Africans.

We remain committed to providing high quality, affordable data and connectivity to our customers in
all our markets. We will continue with our pricing transformation initiatives across all our markets to
make our services more affordable for customers.

Radio spectrum is the digital highway upon which we depend to carry increasing mobile data at more
cost-effective prices. This is acutely felt in South Africa that has amongst the lowest spectrum
allocation in all our MTN markets. The release of new spectrum in this market will greatly assist our
ability to service more customers with more data traffic.

We respectfully disagree with the analysis and recommendations contained in the summary report
and, as we study the full report, will continue to engage constructively and vigorously defend against
overbroad and intrusive recommendations.

Mandatory audit firm rotation,29 Nov 2019,"MTN : Mandatory audit firm rotation:

Mandatory audit firm rotation


The group is required to rotate its auditors by 2024 in accordance with mandatory audit firm rotation
regulations issued by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA). Both the current joint
group auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers and SNG Grant Thornton, are required to rotate off the
group audit. In addition, MTN Nigeria is required to rotate auditors following the introduction of the
Nigerian Code of Corporate Governance (NCCG) which became effective on 15 January 2019.

As a result of these regulations to strengthen the independence of the external audit function, and in
recognition of this emerging best practice governance trend, the group audit committee concluded a
comprehensive tender process and the board will be recommending Ernst & Young (EY) as the new
joint group audit firm for approval by shareholders at the AGM in May 2020.

The group audit committee also evaluated the best approach to reduce audit risk during the transition
of audit firms and concluded on a phased transition approach for the current joint audit arrangement.
The group will maintain its joint audit approach during the transition period and, following shareholder
approval, EY will replace SNG Grant Thornton for the 2021 financial period as the joint group audit
firm. PricewaterhouseCoopers will rotate off the MTN Group audit following the transition period. The
group will evaluate the continuation of a joint audit approach following this transition period.


The development of the audit profession remains a focus for the group and in this regard the group
will be monitoring certain internal transformation targets as committed by EY as well as initiatives
agreed on to build local audit knowledge, experience and capabilities in the telecommunications
sector.
