This Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group) and
Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group’s regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-     The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-     Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not
      superseded by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.



1. Key prudential metrics and RWA


In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage positions of the Group and the Bank in this document are reflected on a
regulatory basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded). However, the capital and leverage positions of the Group are also managed
on a statutory basis (which includes unappropriated profits). The summary table below provides key capital adequacy and liquidity information on both
a regulatory and statutory basis as at 30 September 2020. As at 30 September 2020 all profits in the Group and Bank were appropriated, with the
result that regulatory and statutory basis were identical.

Capital
-     The Group’s CET1 capital position was well above minimum regulatory requirements as at 30 September 2020 and within the Board target range
      of 11 - 12%.
-     Group RWAs decreased by R14.6bn from R935.7bn to R921.1bn from June 2020 to September 2020 mainly within the Absa Regional Operations.
      This was driven by rand strength combined with the impact of the Group deploying more of its surplus liquidity into low risk securities rather than
      deposits with banks.
-     Group CET1 capital increased by R1.3bn due to higher capital supply supported by improved profitability. At a total capital level, this was offset
      by a decrease in Tier 2 capital of R1.5bn post the call of subordinated debt during September 2020.
-     The Bank leverage ratio has decreased marginally from June 2020. This is due to an increase in leverage exposure as a result of balance sheet
      growth mainly in investment securities and loans to customers which was partially offset by improvements in capital supply. The Group leverage
      ratio remained flat due to additional capital supply generated by Group entities.




                                                                                                                                       
Liquidity
-     The liquidity risk position of the Group is in line with risk appetite, and well above the minimum regulatory requirements.
-     The Group liquidity coverage ratio increased to 139% (June 2020: 127%) as the liquidity resources of the Group strengthened over the third
      quarter of the year and included Absa Bank investing in alternative forms of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as the Bank reduces reliance on
      the committed liquidity facility (CLF), in line with the phase out requirements set out by the Prudential Authority.
-     The Group net stable funding ratio strengthened to 119% (June 2020: 117%) with strong core deposit growth from retail and corporate clients.




1.2 KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)
In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an
incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory
capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5 issued by the Prudential Authority. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of
the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on a transitional basis.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2020



Shareholders are advised that due to the significant uncertainty created by the covid-19 pandemic and
economic downturn, Absa Group will host a market update today. It will include the following update on the
Group’s financial performance for the first nine months of 2020 and guidance on its 2020 earnings.



Trading update

The Group experienced the following financial trends for the first nine months of 2020, on a normalised
basis:

Revenue growth was similar to the 3% increase in the first half.

The Rand was 11% weaker year-on-year (YoY) than our Absa Regional Operations (ARO) currencies for
the period, in line with the first half’s 12%.

In line with our guidance, the growth in gross Group loans slowed slightly to 5% YoY. In South Africa, Retail
and Business Banking (RBB) and Corporate and Investment Bank’s (CIB) gross loans grew 3% and 5%
respectively YoY, while ARO increased 11%.

Overall deposit growth was in line with the first half at 15% YoY, with particularly strong third quarter growth
from Relationship Banking and CIB in South Africa, while Retail in South Africa grew 11% YoY. The Group
liquidity coverage ratio averaged 139% in the third quarter.

Net interest income growth for the first nine months was similar to the first half’s 6% YoY. Given strong
growth in average interest bearing assets in the third quarter, our net interest margin for the nine months
declined to 4.13% from 4.23% in the first half. Lower rates were a drag, although the structural hedge
released over R700m in the third quarter. Balance sheet construct was the main cause of the third quarter
margin compression, as substantial surplus liquidity was placed into low-margin government bonds and
loans to banks. Moreover, low-margin deposit growth was strong, while higher margin loans declined and
mortgages increased.



                                                                                                    
Our non-interest income trajectory for the first nine months improved slightly from the 2% decline in the
first half. Although fee and commission income recovered strongly from the weak second quarter, it
remained down YoY in the third quarter and below first quarter levels, particularly in RBB South Africa.
While net insurance premium income grew by high single digits YoY for the first nine months, claims
increased in the third quarter due to higher mortality and credit life claims. Trading revenue in Global
Markets grew substantially for the period, and was strong in the third quarter, particularly in South Africa
off a low base.

Operating expenses remain very well managed, decreasing by a similar amount for the nine months to the
first half’s 2% decline. Headcount fell by 1200 year-to-date, while performance costs dropped substantially
YoY during the nine months. South African costs declined YoY, while ARO’s increased due to incremental
run costs after separating from Barclays PLC.

Lower operating expenses supported positive JAWS for the nine months similar to the 5% recorded in the
first half, despite the modest YoY revenue growth. As a result, our cost-to-income ratio improved noticeably
YoY, and YoY pre-provision profit growth for the nine months was the same as the first half’s 9%.

Credit impairments for the nine months trebled YoY given the substantial first half charge. However, third
quarter credit impairments were better than expected, with a credit loss ratio slightly above the 100 basis
point top end of our through-the-cycle target range. As a result, the credit loss ratio for the nine months
improved to 219 basis points from the first half’s 277 basis points. No material adjustments were made to
the substantial macroeconomic variable coverage built in the first half.

RBB South Africa’s third quarter credit loss ratio increased substantially YoY, although it improved
noticeably from the first half, particularly in mortgages. Of the R154bn in payment relief granted to RBB
South Africa customers, 24% by value extended payment relief when it expired. Of the R116bn in RBB
South Africa relief book that expired, 91% are paying and 9% have missed one or more payments. Missed
payments on the expired payment relief book are lowest in Relationship Banking and home loans at 4%
and 8% respectively, and higher in unsecured. As part of the government loan guarantee scheme R1.8bn
in business loans have been approved, from R0.5bn at 30 June 2020.

CIB South Africa’s third quarter credit loss ratio was below CIB’s through-the-cycle target range of 20 to 30
basis points. Its lending subject to payment relief increased to R38bn from R37bn at 30 June 2020.

While ARO’s credit charge improved in the third quarter, it doubled YoY. CIB ARO’s payment relief loans
increased to R15bn from R11bn at 30 June 2020. In Retail outside of South Africa, 13% of the payment
relief granted was extended, while 5% of the portfolio that expired has missed a payment.



                                                                                                  
The Group delinquency profile and non-performing loans deteriorated slightly in the third quarter. Stage 2
loans increased to 11.6% from 10.0% at 30 June 2020, while stage 3 increased to 5.89% from 5.65%,
despite CIB South Africa and ARO improving. RBB South Africa’s stage 3 loans rose, largely due to
personal loans. The group’s balance sheet credit provisions as a proportion of loans was 4.62% at 30
September 2020, from 4.46% at 30 June 2020.

As a result of these factors, the group’s return on equity for the first nine months was more than double
the first half’s 2.6%, as the third quarter return on equity improved to low double digits.

The Group common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio increased to 11.3% at 30 September 2020, within the board
target range of 11% to 12%, and its net asset value per share grew 6% YoY.

Focusing on our third quarter, YoY revenue and cost growth were similar to the first half, producing positive
JAWS. Credit impairments improved noticeably from the first half, but were still substantially higher YoY,
although the credit loss ratio was only slightly above the group’s through-the-cycle range. The group’s
return on equity improved considerably to low double digits. Division-wise, RBB South Africa’s revenue
declined, albeit far less than its costs, and its credit impairments increased substantially, although its credit
loss ratio improved noticeably from the first half. CIB South Africa’s substantial YoY revenue growth off a
low base, together with lower costs and credit impairments produced a strong third quarter. Meanwhile,
incremental run costs after separating from Barclays and substantially higher credit impairments YoY
dampened ARO’s third quarter performance.

Most of these third quarter trends continued into October.




Outlook and trading statement

Our latest forecast is for South Africa’s real GDP to fall 8.7% this year and grow 2.6% next year. We expect
another 25 basis point cut in South Africa’s prime rate today, although this remains finely balanced.
Thereafter, it is likely to remain flat until a 25 basis point increase in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a whole,
our ARO markets’ real GDP is expected to be largely flat this year, well below our pre-Covid-19 forecast of
5.7% growth and slightly lower than our estimate of 0.9% in August. We see limited scope for further large
rate cuts across the ARO portfolio.

Excluding any further major unforeseen political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, our 2020
guidance is as follows:

The Group’s net interest margin is expected to decline noticeably this year, with the second half lower,
largely due to a change in balance sheet construct. Annual revenue sensitivity to further rate cuts in South

                                                                                                      
Africa is a R250m reduction per 50 basis points. Despite the expected reduction in margin, YoY net interest
income growth in the second half is expected to be similar to the first half growth.

Loan growth should slow in the second half, while deposits are expected to grow far faster than loans.

Operating expenses are expected to decline YoY, producing positive JAWS, although pre-provision profit
growth is likely to slow slightly from the first half.

The credit loss ratio for the full year is expected to exceed global financial crisis levels. The second half
credit loss ratio is likely to improve noticeably compared to the first half, but remain above the through-the-
cycle range of 75 to 100 basis points.

The group’s return on equity is expected to remain well below cost of equity this year, although it is likely
to improve considerably in the second half.

With improved second half capital generation, the Group CET1 ratio is expected to remain resilient. Due
to our focus on preserving capital, we do not envisage declaring an ordinary dividend for 2020.

Shareholders are advised that Absa Group’s IFRS headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the year ending 31 December 2020 are expected to decline by more than 40% from the
2019 comparatives of 1750.1 cents and 1717.6 cents respectively. Normalised HEPS for the year is also
expected to decline by more than 40% from the 1926.0 cents for 2019. We will provide a more specific
guidance range once reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline has been obtained.



Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Absa Group’s auditors.

Editor’s Note:

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods
where the financial impact of separation is considered material.

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC Separation
A normalised view of the 2020 half-year results is provided which adjusts for the consequences of the separation from Barclays
PLC. This view better reflects the Group’s underlying performance. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
compliant financial results will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act and the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings
Requirements and include a reconciliation between the normalised and IFRS views. Normalised results will be presented for
future periods to the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is considered material.
The normalised results have not been prepared using the accounting policies of the Group and do not comply with IFRS. These
results are considered to be pro forma financial information, are presented for illustrative purposes only and have been presented
in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the SAICA Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information and any relevant
guidance issued by the IRBA. The normalised results have not been reviewed or reported on by the external auditors of the
Group and are the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors. Given its nature, the pro forma financial information may not
fairly present the Group’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows.

Declaration of dividends

In the current economic climate, capital conservation is regarded as paramount to the Group’s sustainability over the short to
medium term. The Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank (PA) has encouraged the boards of directors of banks
to ensure that capital conservation takes priority over any distributions of dividends on ordinary shares. As a result of this
guidance from the PA and the Board’s view as to the need for capital conservation and the appropriate management of capital at
this time, no interim dividend for the period ended 30 June 2020 has been declared by the Group.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa
Registration number: 1986/003934/06
ISIN: ZAE000255915
JSE share code: ABG
(“Absa Group” or “the Group”)


TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Listings Requirements, and updating Absa Group’s trading
statement published on 26 May 2020, shareholders are advised that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty regarding our financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (1H20).
The Group’s normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 1H20 is expected to be between 80%
and 85% lower than the 977.5 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (the “comparative period”).
On an IFRS basis, 1H20 HEPS and earnings per share are expected to decline by between 92% and
97% from the comparative period’s 920.0 and 918.9 cents, respectively.
In line with our recent trading statement, the Covid-19 pandemic, national lockdowns and weak economy
during the first half had a material impact on customer loan and transaction volumes, while significantly
lower policy rates reduced our net interest margin, despite protection from our structural hedge.
Consequently, 1H20 revenue growth slowed to low single digit year-on-year. Operating expenses
reduced from the comparative period, producing positive JAWS and high single digit pre-provision profit
growth, with an improved cost-to-income ratio for the half. However, credit impairments were four times
higher, resulting in a credit loss ratio of 2.77% from 0.79% in the comparative period. Half of the increase
reflects judgmental macro-economic overlays, which strengthened stage 1 and 2 loan coverage
materially. Based on our current expectations, credit impairments should decrease significantly in the
second half of 2020. Absa Group’s balance sheet remains resilient, with an 11.0% common equity tier 1
ratio at 30 June 2020, together with strong levels of liquidity and an 85% loans-to-deposits and debt

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for periods where
the financial impact of separation is considered material.

support vulnerable communities across all the markets in which we operate.

Although Absa Group’s earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were somewhat impacted by covid-19 towards
the end of March, our return on equity was slightly lower than the comparative period in 2019, and we were
on track to achieve the guidance we had issued.

However, the national lockdown in South Africa had a substantial impact on our financial performance in
April 2020 and accordingly affecting the first four months of the year.

The Group experienced the following financial trends for the first four months of 2020:

We had some benefit from a weaker Rand versus currencies in our Absa Regional Operations (ARO). On
average, the Rand was 8% weaker than our ARO currencies during the period versus the comparable
period in 2019.

Despite slowing materially in April, the year-on-year growth in customer loans to 30 April 2020 was low
double digit, while customer deposit growth was in the high teens. Group customer loans declined slightly
month-on-month in April, across Retail and Business Banking (RBB) SA, Corporate and Investment Bank
(CIB) and ARO.


                                                                                                 Page 1 of 4
Absa Group’s net interest margin declined year-on-year, due to the rate cuts in South Africa and most of
our ARO markets. Net interest income growth was high single digits year-on-year, but is expected to slow.

Non-interest revenue growth was mid-single digit year-on-year, despite RBB SA declining due to
substantially reduced transaction volumes during the national lockdown. There was a material decline in
RBB SA’s fee income in April, with ATM volumes, bancassurance sales, card turnover and point of sale
volumes decreasing significantly month-on-month. However, there are signs of some recovery in
transactional volumes in May, as parts of the economy gradually re-open.

CIB’s non-interest income for the period increased, with strong Markets revenue growth off a low base.
Markets corporate client flows reduced noticeably in April while institutional flows remained intact.

Operating expenses were well contained, producing positive JAWS for the first four months and strong pre-
provision profit growth.

However, credit impairments for the period doubled year-on-year, with large increases in personal loans
and credit cards. The Group credit loss ratio was similar to 2009 financial year levels of 1.7%, well above
our through-the-cycle target range. The substantial increase in credit impairments occurred largely in April.

Consequently, Absa Group’s return on equity for the first four months fell materially year-on-year.



Trading statement

It is difficult to provide guidance for the rest of the year, given the significant uncertainty about the impact
of covid-19, national lockdowns and the macroeconomic outlook. These have a material impact on
customer loan and transaction volumes and credit impairments, in particular.

We currently expect South Africa’s real GDP to fall 10% and our ARO portfolio to decline slightly on
average. We expect lower average policy rates for 2020 across the board. Based on these assumptions,
and excluding further major unforeseen political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, our guidance
for 2020 is as follows:

We see limited customer loan growth year-on-year and customer deposits are likely to increase by more
than customer loans.

The 275 basis points (bp) lower interest rates in South Africa is expected to reduce the group’s net interest
income by approximately R1.6bn in 2020, after factoring in the meaningful benefit of its structural hedge.
We believe there could be another 50bp rate cut in South Africa this year. The annual sensitivity to further
rate cuts in South Africa is a R250m reduction per 50bp.

Revenue growth is expected to slow from the first four months, reflecting reduced customer loan production
and transactional activity on the back of the impact of the lockdowns and negative GDP.



                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4
Operating expenses for the year are expected to decline slightly year-on-year, reflecting a hiring freeze,
lower short-term incentives, significant project reprioritization and material reductions in marketing spend.

On credit impairments, IFRS 9 requires the use of forward looking assumptions when determining the level
of provisions required. These assumptions have a basis in historical information, but will require additional
levels of management judgement in this unprecedented stressed environment.

Coverage is expected to significantly increase as the macroeconomic base case has deteriorated, resulting
in lower realizable collateral values, higher likelihood of default and a greater proportion of defaults
impacting significant increases in credit risk. Judgement regarding the financial health of clients will need
to be based on a multitude of factors.

To assist customers experiencing challenges as a result of covid-19, RBB SA launched a comprehensive
payment relief plan on 30 March 2020. It provides three months of payment relief across all credit products
for wealth, business bank, private bank and retail customers. Take up has been substantial and to date we
have provided R8bn of payment relief over three months to 398 thousand customers on 584 thousand
accounts, covering R146bn of customer loans.

We expect a significant increase in credit impairments this year, to well above the Group’s through-the-
cycle target range of 75bp to 100bp. Given the substantial uncertainty, we will provide additional disclosure
on the judgements we have made and more guidance on the Group’s likely credit impairment for the year
when we report first half results on 24 August 2020.

Absa Group’s return on equity for 2020 is likely to decline materially from last year’s 15.8%.

We expect the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to remain resilient. It may decrease to below our board
target range of 11% to 12% as a consequence of the crisis; however, stress testing confirms that it should
remain well above regulatory requirements. Given our focus on preserving capital, we currently do not
envisage declaring an ordinary dividend for 2020.

Shareholders are advised that Absa Group’s IFRS headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% below the
comparatives for the first half of 2019 of 920.0 cents and 918.9 cents, respectively. Normalised HEPS for
the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 is expected to be more than 20% lower than the normalised
HEPS of 977.5 cents for first half of 2019. We will provide a more specific guidance range once there is
reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline.

We are reviewing the Group’s medium-term financial targets and will update the market when there is
greater certainty in the macroeconomic outlook.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Absa Group’s auditors.

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods
where the financial impact of separation is considered material.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED – BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 31 MARCH 2020

This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group)
and Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group’s regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-       The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-       Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not
        superseded by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.



1.      Key prudential metrics and RWA
In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage position of the Group and the Bank in this document are reflected on a
regulatory basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded), and in accordance with IFRS accounting rules (which requires the impact of the
contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation to be included). However, the capital and leverage position of the Group is
also managed on a statutory, normalised basis (which includes unappropriated profits, and excludes the impact of the contribution amounts received
from Barclays PLC). The summary table below provides key capital adequacy and liquidity information on both normalised and statutory, IFRS basis as
at 31 March 2020.

Capital
The capital adequacy ratios remain strong, above the minimum regulatory requirements and within Board target range. Absa Group’s statutory CET1
ratio (calculated on a normalised basis) declined by 70bps over Q1 2020, driven by payment of the final 2019 dividend of R5.2bn or 55bps of the
decrease. Higher capital deductions due to higher valuation reserves and a higher available for sale reserve, together with the IFRS 9 transitional
adjustment contributed to the remaining reduction.
-   Capital demand increased by R69.4bn, of which R40bn related to Rand weakness. The increased capital demand due to currency movements was
    offset by R6bn additional supply from Absa Regional Operations (ARO) entities due to the weaker exchange rate.
-   Constant currency RWA growth of R29bn was primarily in Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) due to asset growth, probability of default (PD)
    migration and FX volatility. Counterparty credit risk and market risk were also a drag on consumption, given the market dislocation in March. An
    offset of R9bn came from the sale of the Edcon storecard book which concluded in February 2020.
-   Capital deductions reduced the capital ratio, as the stressed market environment in March resulted in a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in
    valuation reserves and available for sale reserve which increased from R0.6bn to R2.5bn combined.
-   The IFRS 9 phasing adjustment reduced capital supply by R0.9bn and will be fully phased in by 2021.
-   The Group redeemed R2.5bn and issued R2.7bn of Tier 2 capital during February 2020. The capital markets for further issuances are currently
    uncertain, although the Group has minimal redemptions for the remainder of 2020.
The leverage ratio (calculated on a normalised basis) has reduced from 7.0% to 6.6%. This is due to an increase in leverage exposures as the balance
sheet grew due to customer and interbank lending in combination with the weaker currency, which was only partially offset by a growth in Tier 1 capital.
In response to the COVID-19 stress, the Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 of 2020, which temporarily reduces the current Pillar 2A minimum capital
from 50bps at a CET1 level, 75bps at a Tier 1 level and 100bps at a total capital level to zero. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% has also been
made available for banks to utilize during the COVID-19 stress. The Prudential Authority Directive 2 of 2020 is effective from 6 April 2020.


Liquidity
-   The liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio remain strong, above the minimum regulatory requirements and within risk appetite.
-   The QoQ decrease in the liquidity coverage ratio from 134.4% to 120.8% was mainly attributable to an increase in net cash outflows as a result of
    wholesale funding clients reducing the duration of their deposits, given the stressed financial market conditions in March 2020. The Prudential
    Authority released Directive 1 of 2020, reducing the LCR minimum from 100% to 80% due to the COVID-19 market stress. The Prudential Authority
    Directive 1 of 2020 is effective from 1 April 2020.
-   The net stable funding ratio decreased slightly QoQ, from 112.7% to 112.1%, due to the above-mentioned shortening in duration of wholesale
    funding.

1.2   KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)
In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an
incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory
capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of the Group on a fully loaded basis, as
well as on a transitional basis.
The Prudential Authority have issued Directive 2 of 2020 which temporarily reduces Pillar 2A minimum capital requirement to zero. This relief is effective
from 6 April 2020; therefore, the disclosures below do not include the Pillar 2A reduction.

Notes:

 (1)    The difference between the CET1 ratio on a transitional basis and the fully loaded ECL accounting model total capital ratio is less than 5bps, hence
        no difference is shown.
 (2)    The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (3)    The D-SIB add on is not required to be disclosed.
 (4)    The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank LCR and the LCR of ARO. For this purpose, a simple average of the relevant 3 month-
        end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Absa Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-day LCR
        observations.
 (5)    Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special-purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore holdings.
 (6)    The 2020 minimum regulatory capital requirement of 11.5% includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes the bank-specific individual capital
        requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestically systemically important bank (D-SIB) add-on. The Pillar 2A reduction of 100bps per the guidance
        in the SARB directives has not been taken into account in determining the minimum regulatory capital requirement above as this is only effective
        from 1 April 2020.
 (7)    SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (8)    Includes the operational risk floor.
 (9)    Excludes R3.57bn relating to IFRS9 RWA impact phase in.
 (10)   IRC: incremental risk charge
 (11)   Calculated at 11.5% of RWA
 (12)   Numbers reported are on a regulatory basis and include the contribution amounts from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
 (13)   The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank LCR and the LCR of Absa Regional Operations (ARO). For this purpose, a simple average
        of the relevant 3 month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-
        day LCR observations.
 (14)   The Bank LCR is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-day LCR observations.

Notes:
(1) The Group Chairman’s fees cover her chairmanship and membership of all Board committees and sub-committees (excluding the
Separation Oversight Committee), including the chairmanship of the boards of Absa Bank Limited and Absa Financial Services Limited.
(2) Executive directors of the Company do not receive fees as members of the Company Board and Board committees.
(3) The GACC, GRCMC, RemCo and SEC chairmen receive fees equal to two-and-a-half times (2.5x) the fee payable to the members of these
committees.
(4) The chairmen of Board committees and sub-committees other than the GACC, GRCMC, RemCo and SEC receive fees equal to twice the
fee payable to members of these committees.
(5) The fees indicated above are exclusive of VAT. Where applicable, VAT will be levied by the non-executive directors and such fees plus
VAT will be paid to the non-executive directors concerned (subject to the issue of a valid tax invoice reflecting fees plus VAT).
Motivation
The motivation for the amendment is that the Absa Group Board reconsidered the original
special resolution number 1 proposing an across-the-board 4.5% increase in non-executive
remuneration, in view of the prevailing situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and,
accordingly, resolved that no increase in non-executive remuneration is the appropriate and
responsible recommendation.

   DEALINGS BY ABSA GROUP DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

   In accordance with paragraph 3.63 of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are advised that the
   following ordinary shares have been awarded to executive directors, prescribed officers and the company
   secretary of Absa Group:

   1.     Absa Group Share Incentive Plan – Long-Term Performance Award

   The Share Incentive Plan – Long-Term Performance Award (Performance Share Award) is designed to
   incentivise long-term performance with vesting of awards subject to fulfilment of a combination of
   financial and non-financial Group performance targets measured over a three-year performance period.
   The awards were also considered in the context of moving a greater proportion of total remuneration into
   variable remuneration and, in this instance, longer term performance. For executive directors and the
   prescribed officers, this award will vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of
   the grant date subject to the achievement of the performance targets, and continued employment
   requirements as set out in the Plan Rules. Dividend equivalents may be added to the awards at the
   vesting of an award tranche in terms of the Scheme Rules and will be paid to the extent that the shares
   vest.

   The number of shares under the Performance Share Award was fixed with reference to the 20-day
   volume-weighted average price preceding the grant date (being 1 April 2020), which was the award date
   determined by the Absa Group Remuneration Committee. The quantum of the awards was determined
   having regard to 2019 Group performance and individual ability to support and influence the future
   execution of the Group strategy. The share awards were granted to the executive directors, prescribed
   officers and company secretary as set out in the table below. These awards have since been accepted
   on the date indicated below.

  2.    Absa Group Share Incentive Plan - Deferred Award
  In terms of our Remuneration Policy on incentive awards, executive directors and prescribed officers are
  obliged to defer 50% of the value of their total bonus into shares. In prior years, the deferral element
  comprised of a combination of deferred cash and shares. For 2019 awards onwards, all deferral is in the
  form of shares.

  The mechanism used for this is the Deferred Award, which is a conditional right to receive Absa Group
  shares. Dividend equivalents may be added to the Deferred Awards at the vesting of a Deferred Award
  tranche. The Deferred Award is subject to continued employment at date of vesting.

  The number of shares under the Deferred Awards (in respect of the 2019 financial year performance, and
  as already set out in our 2019 Remuneration Report) were fixed with reference to the 20-day volume-
  weighted average price preceding 1 April 2020 (the grant date). This table sets out the deferred
  incentives which were awarded under the Deferred Award and granted to the executive directors,
  prescribed officers and company secretary off market. Deferred Awards will vest in three equal tranches,
  on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date subject to the rules of the Share Incentive Plan
  (as amended from time to time). These awards have since been accepted on the date indicated below.

PAYMENT OF FINAL 2019 ORDINARY DIVIDEND


With reference to the Prudential Authority’s Guidance Note 4/2020, dated 6 April 2020,
shareholders are advised that Absa Group will pay a final ordinary dividend of 620 cents per
ordinary share for the period ended 31 December 2019.


We have consulted carefully with the Prudential Authority both before and after the issuance of
Guidance Note 4/2020 and have clarified with the Prudential Authority that we should continue
to pay our dividend declared on 11 March 2020. The Prudential Authority has confirmed that,
where governance processes have reached a point where there is a legal obligation to pay
dividends, banks should pay. We will, however, continue to carefully consider our capital and
funding position and the guidance note of the Prudential Authority for the 2020 year.


While the Board agrees with the need to conserve capital in the current environment, legal
advice confirms that a dividend must be paid after having been declared and communicated.
We also recognise that there are pensioners and other investors who have placed reliance on
our dividend declaration.


The final ordinary dividend for 2019 is payable to shareholders recorded in the register of
members of the Company at the close of business on 17 April 2020. It will be subject to local
dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%. Shares will commence trading ex-dividend on
15 April 2020 and the payment date is 20 April 2020.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED AND ABSA BANK LIMITED: MOODY’S DOWNGRADES CREDIT RATINGS
FOLLOWING DOWNGRADE ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN SOVEREIGN

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Moody’s
Investor Services (“Moody’s”) has on 31 March 2020 lowered the long-term local currency and foreign
currency deposit ratings of Absa Bank Limited to Ba1 from Baa3, and the long-term issuer ratings of Absa
Group Limited to Ba2 from Ba1.The outlook on both ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody’s decision to downgrade the South African government’s local and
foreign currency issuer rating to Ba1 from Baa3, with a negative outlook, on 27 March 2020. Moody’s
does not rate financial institutions above the credit profile of the government.

The above ratings actions do not reflect any fundamental change in the credit quality of the Absa Group
and Absa Bank Limited.

For additional details on the rationale of the ratings action please see the press release by Moody’s on 31
March 2020 titled “Rating Action: Moody’s downgrades the ratings of five South African banks following
downgrade on the South African sovereign. The outlook is negative”

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC separation

A normalised view of the 2019 results is provided which adjusts for the consequences of the separation from
Barclays PLC (Separation). This view better reflects Absa Group's underlying performance. International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) compliant financial statements will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act and the
JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements and include a reconciliation between the normalised and IFRS views. Normalised
results will be presented for future periods to the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is considered material.


Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial information as per JSE Listing
Requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of the Group's Board of directors and is presented
for illustrative purpose only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in
equity, and results in operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial information contained in this announcement has
been reviewed by Absa Group's external auditors and their unmodified limited assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE
3420 is available for inspection at the Company's registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED - BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2019

This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group)
and Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group's regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-      The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-      Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not superseded
       by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.


1. Key prudential metrics and risk weighted assets (RWA)

In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage position of Group and Bank in this document is reflected on a regulatory
basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded), and in accordance with IFRS accounting rules (which requires the impact of the contribution
amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation to be included). However, the capital and leverage position of the Group is also managed
on a statutory basis. For reference, the summary table below provides key capital and leverage information on a statutory, IFRS basis as at 30 September
2019.

Capital adequacy

The Group remains capitalised above the minimum regulatory capital requirements. Absa Group continues to optimise the level and composition of capital
resources. In line with this objective, the Group will continue to raise Basel III compliant capital instruments as and when appropriate, in the domestic
and/or international capital markets.
The Absa Group statutory CET 1 ratios (calculated on an IFRS basis) have reduced by 70bps over Q3 2019, driven by the impact of the interim dividend
of R4.2bn combined with RWA growth.

1.   Key prudential metrics and RWA



KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an incurred
loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory capital
impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on
a transitional basis.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption from 30 June 2019 to 30 September 2019 were as follows:

-        Credit risk: The increase of R38.2bn is attributable to increases in the IRB portfolios of R17.9bn and standardised portfolios of R20.3bn. The primary
         driver for the increase in the South African IRB portfolios is exposure growth in Retail and Business Banking (RBB). The R20.3bn increase in the
         standardised portfolios is as a result of balance sheet growth of R12.5bn and foreign exchange movements of R7.5bn.
-        CCR & CVA: The decreases in CCR of R1.2bn and in CVA of R1.5bn are mainly attributable to market volatility.
-        Market Risk: The increase of R1.7bn is primarily as a result of specific risk capital on local currency sovereign bonds held by ARO.

Notes:
 (1) These numbers have been restated. Refer to reporting changes overview on the inside front cover of the Group results booklet for the period ended
      30 June 2019.
 (2) The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (3) Bank-specific confidential requirement.
 (4) The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Bank LCR and the LCR of the Absa Regional Operations (ARO). For this purpose, a simple average
      of the relevant 3 month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-
      day LCR observations. The December 2018 and March 2019 Group LCR was restated post a change in certain assumptions.
 (5) The 2019 minimum regulatory capital requirement is calculated at 11.5% (2018: 11.13%), which includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes
      the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the D-SIB add-on.
 (6) SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (7) Includes the operational risk floor.
 (8) IRC: incremental risk charge.
 (9) Calculated at 11.5% of RWA.
 (10) Numbers reported are on a regulatory basis, and include the contribution amounts from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
 (11) The Absa Group LCR for 30 September 2019 reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank and Absa Regional Operations (ARO) LCR. The ARO LCR
      is calculated as a simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points. The surplus HQLA of ARO in excess of the minimum requirement of
      100% has been excluded from the calculation of the ARO LCR.
 (12) The Absa Bank Limited quarterly LCR is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-day observations.
