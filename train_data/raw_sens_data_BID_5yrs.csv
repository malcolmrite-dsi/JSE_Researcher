Management comments as follows:

Employees

Our employees continue to be our top priority in terms of securing their health,
well-being and where possible, maintaining their incomes in the face of the
fallout from the global COVID-19 pandemic (COVID). We have seen limited
cases of infections within our various businesses around the world, which are
managed within strict business best practices and local government
requirements. None of these infections have materially impacted on our ability
to operate.

We are conscious this is a stressful and difficult time for all our people and are
offering help where we are able. We continue to work with our customers and
suppliers in navigating the crisis and plotting the way forward.

Overall market conditions

Where lockdown restrictions have been eased, we have seen demand in the
discretionary spend sectors recover, however any businesses associated with
‘large crowds’, such as entertainment, sports events, business travel,
conventions and conferences, aviation and the cruise line industry remain
largely shuttered. The requirement of major institutions, many of whom are in
large inner capital cities, for employees to work from home has reduced activity
levels of our national customers. Some of this activity has shifted into suburban
areas and more rural locations as people continue to seek out eating-away-
from-home opportunities.

Most independent customers have reopened and have been able to adapt to
the varying economic conditions relatively well. The recovery of our larger
national customers has been much slower and activity levels remain subdued.
Our diversification into the home delivery new channel in a few businesses has
reduced as activity has returned in our traditional channels, however we have
continued to supply some products into independent retail related channels.
The overall contribution of these initiatives is small and remains generally non-
core.

Non-discretionary demand from our institutional customers, including serving
hospitals, aged care, prisons, the military, and government departments has
continued and is relatively stable.

Our governmental support programs in several countries to provide food and
care packages to the most vulnerable members of society via home delivery,
have ceased in most jurisdictions.

Current trading performance

The financial year started relatively well, with most geographies seemingly
coming out of the worst of the COVID crisis, with July showing a strong financial
performance, particularly in Europe and UK. Unfortunately, this started
deteriorating in August and has worsened with Europe and UK now firmly in the
grip of a harsh second wave that is showing little sign of easing. This is having
a significant impact on us once again. Fortunately, we are a diversified
business, with Australia, New Zealand and Asia doing well, and our other
Emerging Market constituents continuing to improve on a month-to-month
basis.

Group sales (in constant currency) for the financial year to date peaked in the
week ended August 2nd at 87% versus the corresponding week in F2020 but
had eased to 71% of the corresponding weekly sales for the week ended
November 8th.

All our businesses continue to fully operate in each geography however each
country is at a different stage of the COVID crisis. Sales progression by division
and for the group as a whole, between the period July 1st and November 8th as
shown in the table below, reflects the different stages of the COVID impact on
our markets.

   •   Australasia (AUS) - Sales have fluctuated between 84% and 96% of
       F2020 demand despite localised lockdowns in both Auckland (New
       Zealand) and Victoria (Australia) over the period.

   •   United Kingdom (UK) - Bidfood UK sales improved through the
       summer period assisted by the Shield Pack business in July, the “Eat
       out to Help Out” scheme in August and the return of the education sector
       in September. Fresh UK sales in September were 57% of last year, down
       from 61% in August. However as reported COVID cases increased,
       sales in our UK operations decreased in October and November as local
       and national restrictions began to bite.

   •   Europe (EUR) - Sales reached a low of 48% of the F2020 activity levels
       in the week of November 8th as the second wave of lockdowns limited
       activity across EUR from mid-October onwards, and this looks likely to
       continue through the winter.

   •   Emerging Markets (EM) - Other than in Greater China where the
       recovery was quick, the COVID pandemic has had a much longer and
       deeper impact in our EM region. However, through the quarter, sales in
       EM have continued to improve, particularly in South Africa and Turkey.
       Angliss Greater China has tracked at or better than the comparative
       Q1 F2020.

Currency volatility has positively impacted our rand-translated results and will
remain a significant factor for the remainder of F2021. Currency movements for
Q1 F2021 are shown below:

                          Q1 F2021             Q1 F2020
                                                                    % change
                       Average FX rate      Average FX rate
        AUD:ZAR              12,09               10,27                17,7
        EUR:ZAR              19,76               16,30                21,2
        GBP:ZAR              21,84               18,07                20,8

Our group gross profit percentage for the Q1 F2021 has been maintained at
similar levels to the comparative quarter in F2020, benefitting from the mix of
smaller independent customers, however under a little pressure in certain
businesses who are driving market share gains.

Throughout the crisis, our focus has been on making sure that our businesses
retain as much human capital capacity and internal IP as we are able, in order
to scale-up as activity levels return, as we have seen quickly happen across
many regions in which we operate. To enable us to ‘retain the muscle’ of the
businesses, we have continued to access various government wage assistance
schemes in jurisdictions where we are eligible to do so, in order to protect as
many of our staff as possible. Unfortunately, this hasn’t negated the need to
furlough some employees and permanently reduce headcount where
restructuring was required.

With lower levels of activity, operating costs as a percentage of net revenue
increased from 18,8% to 19,5%. In the quarter, constant currency operating
expenditure (opex) declined by 14,2% compared to a constant currency
revenue decline of 17,1%. We estimate that 35% to 40% of the cost base is
relatively fixed so we will not see a linear reduction in opex as revenues decline,
particularly where the onset of the resurgent spread of the virus as in the UK
and Europe results in rapid and sudden lockdowns imposed by governments.

For Q1 F2021, the group made a pleasing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest,
Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) equivalent to 5,2% of monthly net revenue
compared to 5,9% in Q1 F2020.

Non-IFRS 16 finance charges were 12,7% higher in Q1 F2021 driven up by the
forex translation impact and imputed interest on the DAC put option. Excluding
these impacts, real net finance charges were lower by 20% arising out of the
benefits of lower capex and better working capital management.

Working capital days are better by 8 days in Q1 F2021, a great result achieved
by our operations despite a few areas of anticipated absorption. Our inventories
are in good shape, customers are generally paying well, and our payable terms
are normalised.

We completed a sale & leaseback of a Hong Kong property for HK$325 million
and will conclude on two other properties in the next few months. These asset
sales are part of our property maximisation strategy in terms of end-of-useful-
life properties, where we are taking advantage of very low yields currently being
achieved in many markets on industrial property.

Free cash flow (excluding dividends but after operating cashflows, working
capital and capex) for Q1 F2021 amounted to an inflow of R1,2 billion, some
R2,6 billion better than the comparative Q1 F2020. This has been achieved by
improved cash generated from operations (after working capital), capex in line
with depreciation and proceeds received on the sale of the Hong Kong property
in August.
Cashflow evolution since March 2020

As at March 31st 2020 the group’s net debt was £338 million. Through April
and May during the initial strict government lockdown’s, cashflow was
aggressively managed which resulted in net debt levels being maintained. As
markets reopened from June onwards, group sales improved from week-to-
week which resulted in excellent cash generation through to August. Net debt
levels during October and November are stable at levels around £175 million
to £185 million, but approximately £200 million better when compared to the
prior year.

Liquidity

Our priority remains to ensure that our operations have sufficient liquidity for
their respective requirements. We believe that the group has sufficient liquidity
for the foreseeable future. The group and its subsidiaries have as at
September 30th, cash and cash equivalents of R7,2 billion (£336,1 million),
gross borrowings of R11,7 billion (£540,9 million) of which R6,7 billion is short
term. Total headroom available, including uncommitted facilities and cash and
cash equivalents, is R21,6 billion (£998,9 million).

Debt covenants
The group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest cover
ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the effects of
IFRS 16) of not less than 5x. As at September 30th 2020, the group was well
within these covenant ranges and does not believe there will be any breach
thereof for the year ending June 2021.

Update on under-performing businesses

Going into the COVID crisis we had problems in our Spain, Germany and Fresh
UK activities. We have taken remedial action with these businesses, and
although the financial numbers don’t yet show it, we are well on the track to
recovery with all of them. Spain remains the largest challenge, the senior
management team has been changed, we bought out the minorities, the
business has been significantly downscaled and now we just need sales to
return. Fresh UK has also been significantly streamlined and excess costs and
capacity taken out, without diminishing its position as a specialist supplier of
seafood, meat and produce. Germany is operating effectively and once sales
return, so too will profits.

Strategic future

Bidcorp’s current focus is to operate at the ‘new normal’ which is being dictated
by the unpredictability we are seeing in many markets arising out of the ‘second
waves’ prevalent in the northern hemisphere now. It is not possible at this time
to confidently predict activity levels until we see consistent levelling off and
decline in the spread of COVID. Our businesses in UK and Europe are well
prepared to ride out the next phase of the COVID pandemic, likely to persist
through the winter months. The Group has taken steps to ensure that
management are incentivised to guide our businesses through the short-term
effects of COVID whilst seeking longer-term growth opportunities to return the
group to pre-COVID activity levels.

We continue to believe that there will not be any long-term fundamental shift in
consumer behavior of eating-away-from-home and evidence suggests that not
much has changed in those markets where normality and confidence has
returned. If anything, we are seeing growth particularly in our “sweet spot” target
market, namely the smaller to mid-size independent customer.

Large supply disruptions haven’t materialised as predicted, however for our
products imported into China the supply chain has been strained for products
sourced in Europe, USA, and South America. In most of our businesses, the
majority of product is procured locally. There is an element of disruption
currently being experienced in global shipping and container availability, and
we continue to adapt our procurement as necessary.

No significant acquisitions in the foodservice space have become evident yet,
however we believe economic conditions will result in opportunities coming to
market. The ability to explore opportunities in new markets remains hindered
by the general prohibition on international travel into and from many parts of the
world. In existing markets, we are confident we are gaining market share
against competitors, many of whom do not have the financial strength of
Bidcorp. We have concluded a small in-country acquisition in the Middle East
and are looking at some potential targets in Chile, Brazil, Australia, New
Zealand, Malaysia, and Germany. We do however need to understand that
acquisitions made now are riskier than before due to the uncertainty and
disruption of the past nine months.

We have scaled back much discretionary spend in capex and other business
expenses. We are considering future investments in those jurisdictions where
activity levels have returned as the time delay between conceptualisation and
conclusion can be up to three years.

Our ecommerce platform remains a source of competitive advantage and
continues to evolve primarily to cater for our wholesale customers. Our digital
transformation journey has accelerated through this crisis, and we are seeing
some great benefits, particularly with regards to insights through data analytics,
of which we have the benefit of a multi-jurisdictional view. For retail customers,
who can either collect or elect home-delivery, this remains a fringe activity
catering to the current environment.

Comment

Bernard Berson, CE, commented as follows:

   “Although our financial results are down, our motivation and confidence
   are up, and we are very fortunate to have the team that we do around
   the world running our businesses. Our competitive position is good even
   though our industry has been particularly hard hit. We believe hospitality
   will bounce back strongly and we will be ready to take advantage of
   these opportunities. In the meantime, it’s about a focus on long-term
   sustainability, strength, and resilience. I believe we are doing better than
   most. This is helped by our (deliberate) geographic diversity, our
   (deliberate) de-emphasising of large volume, low-margin business in
   favour of smaller to mid-size independent customers, and our
   (deliberate) decentralised and entrepreneurial approach to how we
   manage our business across 35 geographies.”

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, Bidcorp is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the year ended June 30 2020, will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding year ended June 30 2019.

Shareholders are referred to the trading update provided to the market on June 15 2020 and are
further advised that: -

Bidcorp has been significantly impacted by the catastrophic economic and social consequences of the
COVID 19 pandemic (COVID) which took hold across every operating geography from late January
2020 onwards. As a consequence of the lockdowns and restrictions caused by COVID, sales declined
by 28% in the last quarter of the financial year against the last quarter in the comparative period, and
significant abnormal costs were incurred including additional receivables provisioning of R785 million,
inventory obsolescence of R248 million and restructuring costs of R470 million. Asset impairments of
R940 million have been taken, the most significant of which relates to goodwill on our Spanish
operation.

In respect of continuing operations, headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) is expected to be between
45% (794,0 cents per share) and 50% (721,8 cents per share) lower than the comparative year (F2019:
1443,6 cents per share) and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is expected to be between 66% (493,3
cents per share) and 70% (435,3 cents per share) lower than the comparative year (F2019: 1451,0
cents per share).

In addition to the aforementioned impacts of COVID, our discontinued operations, Best Food Logistics
and PCL distribution, were successfully exited in March. Accordingly, HEPS from total operations is
expected to be between 45% (737,3 cents per share) and 50% (670,3 cents per share) lower than the
comparative year (F2019: 1340,5 cents per share) and EPS from total operations is expected to be
between 68% (394,0 cents per share) and 72% (344,8 cents per share) lower than the comparative
year (F2019: 1231,4 cents per share).

It is expected that Bidcorp will release its full year results for the year ended June 30 2020 on or about
August 26 2020. The information above has not been reviewed and reported on by the group’s
external auditors.

CAPITAL MARKETS TRADING UPDATE Q4 F2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are advised Bidcorp today, Monday June 15th 2020, wishes to
update the market on the trading environment across its operations, with
particular emphasis on the impacts of the COVID-19 (COVID) crisis. This is in
terms of Bidcorp’s requirement of continuous disclosure in terms of the JSE
Listings Requirements and needs to be read in conjunction with the update
provided on April 14th 2020.

Management comments as follows on:
Our employees have been our top priority, good progress has been made in
terms of securing their health, well-being and where possible, maintaining their
incomes. To date, most of our employees have managed to avoid any health
impact from the COVID pandemic with a limited number of cases having been
reported in South Africa and Chile.

Sadly, one employee has succumbed to the disease in South Africa. We have
extended our sincere condolences to the family and his colleagues within the
Group. Our heart goes out to all those affected by the pandemic and we remain
committed to play our role through various support initiatives across our
operations.

We continue to work with our customers and suppliers in navigating the fallout
from this crisis and plotting the way forward.

Current trading performance
As noted in the April update, the full impact of the economic crisis became
evident from April onwards. Group sales for the week ended April 5th reached
a low of 37% versus the corresponding week in F2019 but had recovered to
65% of the corresponding sales for the week ended May 31st. For the past week
ended June 14th, sales have improved to 67% compared to the same week in
the prior year.
All our businesses have continued operating in each geography; however each
country is at a different stage of the COVID crisis. Sales progression by division
and for the Group as a whole, as shown in the table over the page between the
period March 1st and June 14th reflects the different stages of the COVID impact
on our markets. Please note that weekly comparatives to last year should be
viewed as a trend; as the timing of public holidays, school holidays and other
events can have an impact on any one week in isolation.

   •   Australasia (AUS) – Despite hitting a low of 35% of its F2019 demand
       in the week of April 19th, sales have recovered to 83% of the F2019 level
       in the week ended June 14th.
   •   United Kingdom (UK) – UK achieved a low of 30% of its F2019 sales
       in the week of April 5th however sales have recovered to 56% of the
       F2019 level in the week of June 14th. Most of this activity has arisen away
       from our traditional markets.
   •   Europe (EUR) - Sales reached a low of 27% of the F2019 activity levels
       in the week of April 19th however has recovered to 62% of the F2019
       level in the week of June 14th. Eastern Europe appears to be further
       along the economic recovery path than what we are experiencing in
       western Europe. Activity levels in Italy (weekly sales low of 17% to a
       current 43%), Spain (weekly sales low of 7% to a current 31%) and the
       Netherlands (weekly sales low of 12% to a current 55%) are
       experiencing a slower recovery.
   •   Emerging Markets (EM) – Sales in mainland China have recovered and
       are now exceeding those of the comparative week in F2019. Weekly
       sales in Hong Kong and Macau are tracking at about 20% behind the
       comparative week in F2019, additionally subdued by the resurgence of
       the political unrest. Activity levels in the other emerging market countries
       in which the Group operates (South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey and the
       Middle East) remain subdued as the path out of the COVID crisis still
       lags that of Australasia and Europe.

Our Group gross profit percentage over the months of April and May have been
maintained at their pre-COVID levels despite the severity and suddenness of
the worldwide lockdowns.

Even though all our businesses have, and continue to experience reduced
levels of activity, the Group has been cognisant of the need to retain as much
human capital capacity as we are able, in order to scale-up as activity levels
return, as we are seeing in a number of businesses. We have accessed various
government wage assistance schemes in a number of businesses where we
are eligible to do so, in order to protect as many of our staff as possible,
unfortunately this hasn’t negated the need to temporarily stand down and
furlough some employees.

The board and executive management have taken a 30% reduction in fees and
salary respectively in Q4 F2020 and we are evaluating whether this should be
extended post June 2020. All businesses where salary reduction initiatives
were implemented will continue to align themselves with the impacts in their
respective workforces.

With lower levels of activity, variable costs have been taken out the businesses
as much as possible bearing in mind that all businesses have traded through
the past 3 months, each to varying degrees.

For the month of April, the Group made a positive EBITDAC (Earnings Before
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation, and COVID adjustments)
equivalent to 2,2% of monthly revenue. For the month of May the Group made
a positive EBITDAC (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and
Amortisation and COVID adjustments) equivalent to 4,4% of monthly revenue.
The COVID adjustments relate to abnormal receivables provisioning and
restructuring costs arising out of the current crisis which amounted to
R317 million for April and R177 million for May.


Overall market conditions
Demand in the discretionary spend sectors, particularly across hotels,
restaurants, pubs, leisure and travel related segments remains weak but are
improving off a near zero base. Many customers are reopening and emerging
from their ‘hibernation’ at a pace quicker than we had anticipated, however
those businesses associated with ‘large crowds’, such as entertainment, sports
clubs and travel, remain shuttered. Our businesses have diversified into new
channels, such as home delivery and supply to other retail related channels,
however the overall contribution of these initiatives is small and remains non-
core.
Non-discretionary demand from our institutional customers , including serving
customers such as hospitals, aged care, prisons, the military and government
departments has stabilised.
Our governmental support programs in several countries to provide food and
care packages to the most vulnerable members of society via home delivery,
have continued. We are grateful to our staff who are involved with these for
their valued and selfless contribution.
Ongoing actions being undertaken by the businesses in the current
environment:


Workplaces
As activity levels have increased and more staff return to the work, so has the
need to increase compliance throughout our work environments. Our priority
remains ensuring a safe workplace for our staff through maintaining exceptional
hygiene standards in line with each environment and jurisdiction
recommendations and legislations.
Social distancing in the workplace remains an effective methodology to contain
the risk of infections with operations operating under strict sanitization protocols
to prevent any potential risk of cross-contamination.
Working remotely for those employees who can do so has been encouraged.
Discretionary travel and commuting have been discontinued.


Liquidity
Our priority has been to ensure that our operations have sufficient liquidity for
their respective requirements. Further headroom has been created and we
believe that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. The
Group and its subsidiaries have available to it, as at June 10th 2020, headroom
facilities of R17,4 billion (£823 million) which is in addition to our existing net
debt. Our net debt at May 31st 2020 was R7,6 billion (£353 million, at the month
end exchange rate of R21,67:£1).
Free cash flow (excluding the interim dividend paid in March 2020 but after
operating cashflows, working capital and capex) for the period from
January 1st 2020 to May 31st 2020 amounted to an outflow of R470 million
(£24 million) highlighting a concerted effort by operational management to
aggressively manage their cashflows in these trying circumstances.


Debt covenants
The Group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest cover
ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the effects of
IFRS16) of not less than 5x. As at May 31st 2020, the Group was well within
these covenant ranges and does not believe there will be any breach thereof
for the year ended June 2020.


Dividends
As noted in the interim financial results commentary, the Group is conscious of
the need to balance gearing and shareholder returns (in light of the Group’s
stated dividend policy). Management anticipate that as the economic recovery
gains strength, gearing is likely to increase as our working capital investment
increases in the return of the businesses to growth. Accordingly, it is too early
to determine the status of the final dividend for the year ending June 2020 and
any changes to the Group’s dividend policy beyond that.

Working capital
The working capital cycle has been well-managed by our operations across the
Group in the context of having experienced a significant shutdown of a large
part of the customer base. Collections from customers through April and May
have exceeded our expectations under the circumstances and where required,
payment plans have been agreed to. We expect further stress in some of the
customer base and our businesses continue to work alongside those affected
customers to proactively manage this. All businesses have and continue to
evaluate their credit loss exposure which will result in additional provisioning,
the exact quantum of which is unquantifiable at this stage. We insure a
proportion of our current credit book however the ability of many customers to
obtain insurance is becoming increasingly difficult.

Our businesses through April and May have actively managed their inventory
exposure, particularly their short-dated stock. All inventory obsolescence has
been expensed as incurred and we do not believe our current broad range of
ambient and frozen products, all of which have longer shelf-lives, presents a
significant further exposure. All stock continues to be carefully monitored and
remains fit for our customer base.

Through March and April, payables were aggressively managed in conjunction
with our suppliers however supplier payment cycles were largely regularised by
the end of May.

Our expectation is that we will see the working capital cycle normalise in the
months ahead even though some working capital pressures may manifest as
markets open and we experience a return to a more normalised customers
credit cycle, however some counter to this is we will be selling our inventory
that has largely been paid for.


Strategic future
Bidcorp’s current focus is to predict the likely ‘new normal’ that will exist post
the short-term effects of the COVID crisis. Our initial assessment was that
activity levels would return to levels of 75% – 85% of pre-COVID levels in the
next 12 to 18 months but we now believe this number will be higher and
hopefully sooner. Our businesses are preparing to ride out the next phase of
the economic recovery with these activity levels in mind. We believe that there
will not be any fundamental shift in consumer behavior of eating-away-from-
home and early anecdotal evidence suggests that human muscle memory in
respect of socialisation remains an important component of the consumers
existence.

Unfortunately, not all of our operations entered this crisis in as strong a market
position as we would have liked and in order to ensure their long-term survival,
will require restructuring to achieve simplification and focus on their core
competencies and markets. In this respect, management are evaluating our
Spanish operations to focus on their independent customer base in their core
markets. Depending on the extent of the restructuring required, this may
necessitate some impairment of the goodwill associated with this operation.
Our recovery in China has been hampered by supply chain disruptions of
products sourced in Europe, USA and South America. Whilst this has assisted
with ensuring that we trade our current inventory judiciously, we are unable to
establish whether this is a short-term aberration only in relation to our Greater
China operation or is likely to become a long-term supply chain issue. In most
of our businesses, the majority of product is procured locally so this is unlikely
to have any material impact across the Group.

No significant acquisition opportunities in the foodservice space have become
evident and we believe is premature to be exploring these in the current
environment. There is the possibility of market share gains should competitors,
without the financial strength of Bidcorp, exit the industry. We are finalising the
acquisition of a distressed business in northern Italy and expect more of these
in-country type of opportunities to present themselves in the months ahead.
We continue to scale back any discretionary spend in capex and other business
expenses. We are also not committing to any large investments for future years
until we have greater clarity on the outlook.

Our ecommerce platform remains a source of competitive advantage and has
been adapted to cater for retail customers, who can either collect or elect home-
delivery. There has been good take-up of home deliveries in many countries,
but this remains a fringe activity catering to the current environment.


Trading statement

Bidcorp believes that the worst of the COVID crisis is behind the Group however
significant uncertainty persists as to the speed and depth of the economic
recovery in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

Bidcorp’s financial results in April, May and as anticipated in June as well, have
been adversely affected by crisis and accordingly shareholders are advised, in
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, that both headline earnings per share
and basic earnings per share for the year to June 2020 is expected to be more
than 20% lower than the comparative year to June 2019.

The Company will issue a further trading statement with more specific guidance
ranges once there is reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline
relative to the comparable period.

COVID-19: IMPACT ON BIDCORP

Shareholders are advised Bidcorp today, Tuesday, April 14 2020, wishes to
update the market on the trading environment across its operations, with
particular emphasis on the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. This is in terms of
the requirement of issuers to assess the impact, if any, that the outbreak may
have on business operations and an issuers disclosure obligation in terms of
the JSE Listings Requirements.

Bidcorp’s UK logistics activities (Bestfood Contract Distribution and PCL),
which were classified as Discontinued Operations, were exited fully at the
beginning of March 2020 as expected and within the terms and conditions as
previously outlined.

Management comments as follows on Bidcorp’s operations around the world:
   •   The safety of our employees is top of mind, securing their health, well-
       being and where possible, maintaining their incomes in order that they
       can emerge from this crisis employed and motivated.
   •   Furthermore, maintaining our relationships with our customers and
       suppliers is a priority as all parties navigate the significant and rapidly
       changing fallout from this crisis.

Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   •   Trading for the 9 months to March 31 2020 (on a like-for-like basis,
       excluding the impact of IFRS 16) has held up reasonably well and
       broadly in line with expectations (measured in home currencies),
       however the full effects of the COVID-19 crisis across many of our
       operations only appeared in the second half of March and the full impact
       will become evident from April onwards.
   •   Being part of the food distribution industry, all our businesses have been
       designated as essential services and have continued operating in all
       geographies. Demand for food products has substantially diminished in
       many discretionary spend sectors, particularly across hotels,
       restaurants, pubs, leisure and travel related segments. Our businesses
       are actively seeking solutions for each market and attempting to replace
       a small portion of this lost revenue in new channels, such as home
       delivery and supply to other retail related channels.
   •   Non-discretionary activities to institutional customers continues,
       including serving customers such as hospitals, aged care, prisons, the
       military and government departments in many of our businesses. We are
       experiencing an uptick in demand generally from these segments but
       expect this to normalise once the consumer panic and stockpiling eases.
       We are sharing the experiences of operations in geographies that are
       ahead of others in the crisis, to pre-empt some of the sales opportunities
       and cost saving measures where possible.
   •   We are very proud to be part of governmental programs in several
       countries to provide food and care packages to the most vulnerable
       members of society via home delivery, during the very difficult and strict
       lockdown period. Our staff who are involved with this are to be
       commended and thanked for their valued and selfless contribution.
   •   It is very difficult to quantify the exact amount of decline we are
       experiencing as different countries are at different stages of the crisis
       and have implemented various strategies to fight the virus, which have
       a differing impact on our end-customer base, and vary from week to
       week. In China, we are seeing a very encouraging and quick bounce
       back in demand, and our volumes are quickly approaching the levels of
       a year ago. In our other major geographies, we are currently
       experiencing a short-term decline of volumes of between 45% to 70%
       relative to weekly volumes achieved during the comparative period in
       2019.

Actions being undertaken by the businesses in the current environment

Workplaces:
   •   Cleanliness and food safety have always been a top priority in our
       businesses, however we have increased compliance throughout our
       work environments, as well as additional hygiene standards and
       requirements such as masks and sanitizers, as each environment and
       jurisdiction recommend and legislates.
   •   Social distancing is implemented in operations with teams working
       separate shifts and between shifts sanitizing and clean down to prevent
       any potential risk of cross contamination.
   •   Working remotely has been encouraged wherever possible.
   •   Discretionary travel and commuting have been discontinued.

Costs:
   •   All our businesses are experiencing reduced levels of activity and we
       must be innovative on how we protect our staff yet manage the cost
       base. In some areas we have reduced working hours to 60% - 80% of
       the normal shift and have requested staff to take annual / unpaid leave
       where possible to assist in managing these costs down and to protect
       jobs wherever possible. We have also unfortunately had to temporarily
       stand down and furlough some employees. There is quite a bit of fluidity
       regarding various government wage assistance schemes in respect of
       eligibility, timing and coverage. We are doing our best to access these in
       all countries where we qualify. The Group is cognisant of the need to
       retain as much human capital capacity as we are able to in order to
       scale-up as quickly as circumstances allow once normality returns in our
       various territories.
   •   The Board and executive management are taking a 30% reduction in
       fees / salary for the fourth quarter of F2020 (and beyond if need be) to
       help support the business. All businesses have also implemented salary
       reduction initiatives to align themselves with the impacts in the general
       workforces.
   •   Wherever possible other variable costs are being downscaled, and the
       lower level of activity assists in this, in areas such as fuel, electricity and
       waste. We own a substantial portion of our properties and fleet, and
       where we don’t, we are actively negotiating property rental reductions as
       well as fleet dehires.

Liquidity:
   •   Our priority is to make sure that in our decentralised environment, our
       operations have sufficient liquidity for their requirements. We believe the
       Group has sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future in terms of
       headroom and we are working with our banking partners to further
       increase liquidity. The Group has available to it, as at March 31 2020,
       headroom and facilities of R9,6 billion (£425 million) which is in addition
       to our existing net debt. For reference, our total net debt at
       December 31 2019 was R4,9 billion.

Debt covenants:
   •   The Group’s debt covenants sit at 2,5x net debt to EBITDA and interest
       cover ratio of EBITDA to net consolidated finance costs (excluding the
       effects of IFRS16) of not less than 5x. As at December 2019, the Group
       was well within its covenants with its net debt to EBITDA ratio at 0,6x
       and the interest cover ratio at 27x.

Working capital:
   •   To date the working capital cycle has been well-managed by our
       operations across the Group. However, we do expect there to be stress
       in our customer base and detailed work is being undertaken to
       understand the impact of this. In many businesses, we insure a
       proportion of the credit book. We do understand that there will be an
       element of our customer base that may struggle to pay us in agreed
       terms, and we are proactively managing this on a customer by customer
       basis. It must be emphasised that a number of our customers are still
       open and trading, although some at much-reduced rates than before.
   •   Furthermore, work is being undertaken to understand the impact of
       obsolescence on our inventory. Our businesses have already
       undertaken initiatives to reduce exposure to short dated stock. We
       generally carry a broad range of ambient and frozen products all of which
       have longer shelf lives, but all stock is being carefully monitored. There
       is not a major financial loss anticipated at this stage, as inventory usage
       was very actively monitored and actioned on short life product.
   •   We do expect working capital pressures to become more evident once
       the market reopens in particular with regard to customers credit cycle.

Strategic initiatives

   •   Bidcorp’s current strategy is to ensure the sustainability of the
       businesses in the current environment. As jurisdictions around the world
       are being subject to quarantine and lockdown regulations from
       governments, new sales opportunities are being sought such as the
       supply of food into retail environments, direct to retail customer sales via
       ecommerce platforms, growth in restaurant and hotel kitchens where
       they are being used to prepare pre-cooked meals for collection, home
       delivery and many different government feeding initiatives (quarantine
       centers, temporary hospitals and frontline healthcare worker
       accommodation).
   •   Acquisition opportunities in the foodservice space will become evident
       but it is premature to be exploring these in the current environment.
       There is the possibility of market share gains should competitors, without
       the financial strength of Bidcorp, exit the industry.
   •   We have cut back on any discretionary spend in capex and other
       business expenses. We are also scaling back any large capex plans for
       future years until we have greater clarity on the outlook.
   •   Our ecommerce platform has been adapted to cater for retail customers,
       who can either collect or want home delivery. There has been good take-
       up of home deliveries in many countries, but this remains a fringe activity.
       Our ecommerce platform has seen good growth during this period, and
       our development team have implemented some great features and
       enhancements to our offering, which will greatly benefit our digital
       platforms in the future.

Prospects

Management’s expectations for F2020 remain unquantifiable under the current
uncertain and unpredictable environment.
Commenting on today's announcement Bernard Berson, Chief Executive
Officer of Bidcorp, said:
   •   ""Bidcorp’s strength lies in its strong and decentralised management
       teams who are best placed to navigate the crisis at the coalface in each
       of its operating jurisdictions. Bidcorp is financially strong and enters this
       period of uncertainty with relatively low levels of gearing and a robust
       business model. Our businesses are designated essential services
       which means we are playing a critical role in servicing those most
       affected by the crisis.”
   •   ""I am very proud of the dedication and courage of our people around the
       world during these challenging times as we contemplate the new normal
       future. Tough conditions don’t last forever but tough teams do.”
   •   “We strongly believe in our business model and that our customers and
       demand will bounce back over time. There will be opportunities for us to
       explore in our operating geographies and beyond in the months to come,
       and we have an amazing team of people around the world who are up
       to the challenge and will ensure our market leading position and great
       operational excellence continue as the world recovers from this dark
       chapter.”

Shareholders will be kept informed on an ongoing basis as further information
comes to light.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, Bidcorp is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the 6 months ended December 31 2019, will differ by at least 20% from
those of the previous corresponding 6 months ended December 31 2018.

Shareholders are advised that:

As a result of the capital write-offs incurred in the discontinued operations in the comparative
period, basic earnings per share (""EPS"") from total operations is expected to be between 20% (674,5
cents per share) and 22% ( 685,8 cents per share) higher than the comparative period (2019: 562,1
cents per share) and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") from total operations is expected to be
between 4% (707,7 cents per share) and 6% (721,3 cents per share) higher than the comparative
period (2019: 680,5 cents per share).

In respect of continuing operations, HEPS is expected to be between 3% (721,2 cents per share) and
5% (735,2 cents per share) higher than the comparative period (2019: 700,2 cents per share) and
EPS is expected to be between 3% (719,7 cents per share) and 5% ( 733,6 cents per share) higher
than the comparative period (2019: 698,7 cents per share), reflecting the challenging trading
environment in many of our operational geographies.

It is expected that Bidcorp will release its half-year results for the six months ended December 31
2019 on or about February 19 2020. The information above has not been reviewed and reported on
by the Group's auditors.

Capital Markets Trading Update – November 18th 2019

Shareholders are advised that the Bidcorp executive management are meeting
with members of the financial community (including shareholders, financial
analysts and the press) today, Monday November 18th 2019, to update the
market on the trading environment across its international operations.

The impact of the new IFRS 16 accounting standard is in line with guidance as
provided to stakeholders in August 2019. Bidcorp’s UK logistics activities
remain classified as discontinued operations. The following update deals with
the continuing and discontinued operations separately.

Continuing operations:

Management comments as follows:

Current trading performance and overall market conditions

•   Trading for the 4 months to October in F2020 (on a like-for-like basis,
    excluding the impact of IFRS 16) continues to be positive (measured in
    home currencies). Performance achieved by the Group remains on trend,
    broadly in line with that achieved in constant currencies for F2019.
•   Underlying sales have continued to show real growth in the independent
    segment with some further rebalancing of the customer mix evident in New
    Zealand and the United Kingdom. Gross margin percentage has increased.
    Operating costs (on a like-for-like basis excluding the impact of IFRS 16)
    have been reasonably well managed despite being impacted by increasing
    wage costs (due to full employment levels in numerous economies) and
    higher fuel and energy expenses. Overall trading margins (on a like-for-like
    basis, excluding the impact of IFRS 16) have improved slightly. Food
    inflation remains relatively benign across most markets.
•   Generally, all our businesses have shown growth, albeit some at an
    anticipated slower rate. The problem businesses, namely Guzman in Spain,
    Pier7 in Germany & Bidfresh UK are making slow but steady progress.
•   Political and social unrest in several geographies is having an impact on
    some of our businesses. In Hong Kong, ongoing protests have significantly
    decreased hotel occupancies, tourist arrivals and eating out-of-home
    activities. In Chile, major outbreaks of civil unrest have recently arisen. In
    Barcelona, the separatist movement and anti-independence groups have
    clashed resulting in civil unrest. In the UK, the Brexit debacle drags on and
        economic growth is stuttering; although the imminent general election has
        signaled some potential positive news. Despite all the negatives, our
        management teams remain positive and motivated by opportunities.
•       Currency volatility has negatively impacted Bidcorp’s rand translated results
        to October in F2020. The rand translated results are approximately 1,0%
        lower than the constant currency results.


    Strategic initiatives

    •    Bidcorp’s strategy remains focused on growth – organically in current
         markets through real sales growth in the correct customer segment; via
         in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand geographic reach and product
         ranges; and via opportunistic strategic acquisitions as the Group enters
         new markets.
    •    Foodservice fundamentals across all our operating geographies remain
         positive.
    •    Acquisition opportunities in the foodservice space remain limited, either
         due to unrealistic vendor expectations or vendor uncertainty at this stage
         of the economic cycle, a consequence of which is only one bolt-on
         acquisition has been concluded so far this year. Our focus has been on
         creating a sustainable platform from which to build on in Iberia and
         Germany, while extracting the benefits from the more recent acquisition in
         Australia.
    •    We continue to invest in organic growth through ongoing capex spend,
         with the focus on having smaller, modern and environmentally efficient
         depots closer to the customer base.
    •    Our ecommerce, CRM and data analytics platform deployment continues
         to provide competitive advantage to Group businesses. Our global
         procurement initiatives are expanding both in Asia and Europe, the
         benefits of which reflect in each individual business.


    Prospects

    •    Management’s expectations for F2020 remain cautious but largely
         unchanged; however, political uncertainty, slowing global growth and
         recent socio-economic unrest heightens risk.


Australasia

    •    Australia’s trading performance remains solid, despite weak consumer
         confidence and low inflation. Overall revenue growth has been dampened
         by the prior year exit of a low-margin contract which still reflects in the
         comparative base (exited September 2018); however, free trade growth
         is good. Competitive pressures are being felt in the national account
         segment which is impacting pricing. The core foodservice businesses are
         doing well, with the focus on growing the penetration of the meat and
         liquor product lines through the network. Supply Solutions (Imports)
     continues to perform well off the back of further upstream integration. The
     Fresh business was exited in September 2019. Further capex has been
     invested in finalising the infrastructure upgrade programme. Bolt-on
     acquisition and greenfield opportunities remain.

 •   New Zealand continues its solid operational performance. Excellent
     progress has been achieved in replacing a large low-margin contract
     which exited with effect from July 2019. Overall revenue gains were
     limited; however, gross margin improvements are evident from the better
     customer mix. Higher costs are being driven by labour pressures (full
     employment and no migration) as well as increased capacity demands
     with the opening of our new, second depot in Auckland in October 2019.
     All segments of the business continue to develop profitably with ongoing
     innovation and value-add product development.


United Kingdom (‘UK’)

 •   Bidfood UK continues to perform well with the rate of growth in line with
     expectation. Brexit-fatigue is having a demonstrable impact on consumer
     confidence and consequently economic growth. Sales volumes continue
     to grow in the independent sector as our focus on customer mix and high-
     service levels continues. National account volumes and margins are
     under competitive pressure as customer volumes decline. New volumes
     are being carefully managed in favour of sustainable margins. Additional
     distribution capacity came on-stream with the new Liverpool depot going
     live late in Q1. Ongoing investment in infrastructure remains an imperative
     to cater for anticipated growth. Strategic initiatives in own brand
     development, value-add opportunities and ecommerce implementation
     continue to gain traction. An acquisition of a small niche independent
     wholesaler, Elite Fine Foods, was concluded in the first quarter.

 •   Trading in Bidfresh has been disappointing in Q1 driven principally by the
     performance in the Produce business. Seafood continues to perform well,
     and Meat continues to build scale against the backdrop of a weak casual
     dining sector and general low consumer confidence. In Produce, the
     infrastructure expansion into the new additional depot and upgrade of the
     ERP system have hampered operational progress and profitability.
     Management’s focus is on correcting these operational challenges and
     rebuilding profitability.


Europe

 •   Overall results from our European businesses remains solid, despite
     challenges in both Spain and Germany. Improved like-for-like trading
     profit growth in constant FX has been achieved by the Netherlands,
     Belgium, Czech & Slovakia, Poland, Baltics and Italy. Cost pressures
     remain, particularly labour and fuel; however, they do appear to be
     moderating. Business improvement initiatives in Guzman (Spain) and
    Pier7 (Germany) are starting to deliver improved operational benefits in
    both operations, although profitability has been negatively impacted.

•   Netherlands has continued to make good progress despite a tight labour
    market. The horeca segment is showing good growth, while the decline in
    healthcare has stopped. The business simplification journey continues as
    management focus on developing the high-service customer offering.
    Product range rationalisation and IT infrastructure realignment projects
    are ongoing. Depot reconfiguration and investment into new distribution
    infrastructure is underway to accommodate future growth.

•   Belgium’s performance is positive, delivering incrementally higher
    profitability. A number of catering customers have renewed their
    contracts. Volume growth in the freetrade and institutional sectors is
    ongoing. Depot consolidation to achieve operational efficiencies continue.
    The implementation of the ‘myBidfood’ ecommerce platform is
    progressing well.

•   Czech & Slovakia continues to deliver good trading results although the
    rate of growth has moderated as overall economic growth slows. Sales
    have continued to grow, gross margins have been maintained and overall
    overhead costs are being well managed. However, cost pressures remain
    in labour, energy and fuel. Recent infrastructure investment in production
    facilities is yet to deliver anticipated returns. Opportunities in neighbouring
    territories offer expansion potential.

•   Further strong organic growth in Poland has continued, delivering an
    excellent trading performance. Focus remains on the freetrade sector.
    Gross margin improvements have delivered an improved trading margin.
    Anticipated future organic growth will require additional infrastructural
    investment.

•   Italy has delivered an improved trading performance despite the weakest
    summer season experienced in Italy for several years. Good penetration
    of the independent sector continues. Integration of recent bolt-on
    acquisitions, being D&D and Quartiglia, into DAC Italy is ongoing. Despite
    the political turmoil in Italy, business and consumer confidence are holding
    up. Regional expansion opportunities continue to be explored.

•   Iberia comprises our businesses in Spain and Portugal. Overall
    performance in Spain is well below expectation, attributed mostly to the
    Guzman activities. Political unrest in Barcelona had a significant impact
    on Guzman’s performance in October; however, internal focus remains on
    margin improvement and overhead cost reduction. The new ERP system
    has settled down and operational improvements are evident; however,
    financial performance remains poor. Igartza (acquired July 2018), a multi-
    category distributor in northern Spain, is performing well. Our business in
    Portugal continues to perform well. Investment into infrastructure will be
    required to alleviate capacity constraints in Portugal. Management remain
    positive about the medium-term growth prospects in the Iberian market.
 •   Germany continues to underperform with progress slow. Completion of
     the new depot in Munich is imminent. Further management changes have
     been made and additional Group resource has been deployed to guide
     improvements. Germany still represents a very large foodservice
     opportunity; however, further acquisitive expansion remains on hold until
     the current base has been stabilised.

 •   The Baltics, being Bidfood in Lithuania and Latvia, is now sustainably
     profitable. Focus is on leveraging the benefits of the new depot in Kaunas
     to achieve higher returns.

 •   Further expansion, both in terms of in-country bolt-on acquisitions and
     strategic entry into new geographies in Europe, remains possible, as we
     are not represented or underrepresented in many countries.


Emerging markets

 •   South Africa overall is showing solid results despite a persistently weak
     economic environment. Bidfood has continued its growth trajectory and
     the Crown Food business has recovered post the Listeriosis crisis and is
     achieving growth in many areas of the business. Results from the Chipkins
     Puratos JV are flat as end-user customer preferences have shifted away
     from yeast products in plant bakeries to cheaper maize alternatives.
     Focus remains on shifting the product mix to further value-add products.

 •   Greater China’s year-to-date financial performance is flat against F2019
     with the anticipated improvements gained in mainland China offsetting the
     unexpected declines in Hong Kong, directly attributable to the fallout from
     the social crisis that has unfolded. In mainland China, trading continues
     to improve following the dairy crisis of the past. Dairy remains an important
     category; however, continuing product range diversification continues.
     Operations commenced at the new meat (value-add processing) factory
     in Q4 F2019; however, the production ramp-up has been slowed by
     outstanding regulatory approvals. Our geographic distribution network is
     now reasonably complete. Hong Kong continues to be significantly
     impacted by the fallout from the unrest of the past few months.
     Management and staff have embarked upon flexible working hours, have
     all agreed to unpaid leave and are working with suppliers and landlords to
     minimize operating costs. Safety measures to protect staff and assets
     have been introduced. Further supplier dislocation in dairy arose in July
     2019; however, alternative suppliers have been sourced. The greater
     China working capital cycle remains under close scrutiny.

 •   Singapore has seen a positive uptick in activity levels and continues to
     deliver steady growth. Good traction is being achieved in the core
     foodservice market. Malaysia has performed well, and further nationwide
     growth opportunities are being explored. Our small joint venture in
     Vietnam is progressing, albeit slower than originally planned.
•   In South America, our focus remains on building a strong platform in a
    region with significant growth potential. In Brazil, the economy continues
    to be challenged; in spite of this our business has maintained its
    performance. Refinement of the business model continues to enable sales
    volume growth and expansion of the broadline product range. Bolt-on
    opportunities continue to be pursued; however, vendor expectations
    remain unrealistic. Chile was performing very well to October; however,
    violent and unexpected political unrest has negatively impacted this
    trajectory. Local management have reacted quickly to the crisis but how
    long this unrest will continue for remains unknown. Integration and
    benefits of the acquisition made in October 2018 continue to be achieved.
    Our investment in the foodservice business Blancaluna, Argentina is
    performing in line with expectation.

•   In the Middle East, our businesses have performed very well, particularly
    in Saudi Arabia. The UAE is showing some improvement; but tourism and
    hotel occupancies are still struggling. Our Saudi operation has again
    performed very well, buoyed by structural social and economic reforms
    which are translating into higher economic activity. All other businesses,
    albeit they are small, are profitable. New opportunities in adjacent
    geographies are being explored.

•   Turkey continues to improve as the mix is shifted to local products
    supplying local customers. A new greenfield branch was opened in
    Antalya in October 2019.


Acquisitive activity

•   Bidcorp remains alert to all acquisition opportunities that present
    themselves both in current markets and in new territories.
•   In the 4 months to October 2019, the following bolt-on acquisition was
    made:
    o Bidfood UK acquired Elite Fine Foods, a niche independent
        wholesaler.

Discontinued operations – UK logistics activities:

CD business

•   As announced on October 2nd 2019, a contract was entered into for the
    disposal of Best Food Logistics to the Booker Group, a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Tesco Plc. Several conditions precedent have been met and
    good progress has been made on the remaining few. We anticipate
    closure between late January and early March 2020.

•   Trading performance in Best Food Logistics continues to improve off the
    back of better service levels and a more sustainable revenue platform.
 PCL

 •   Post the sale and exit of the distribution activities earlier this year,
     management are working on an exit plan for the residual warehousing
     activities, which are small and now marginally profitable. No further
     material exit costs are expected.

Management comments as follows:

Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   •   Trading to the end of April F2019 continues to be positive (measured in
       home currencies). The Easter holidays fell in mid-April versus late March
       in F2018. Performance achieved by the Group remains on trend. Our
       large UK, European and Australasian businesses continue to perform
       well. Angliss China and South Africa remain challenging geographies
       however monthly performance is starting to improve against last year.
   •   Sales have continued to show real growth, with the gross margin
       percentage increasing. This has offset higher operating costs impacted
       by rising wage costs (due to full employment levels in numerous
       economies) and higher fuel and energy expenses. Overall trading
       margins are being maintained.
   •   Economic growth in the UK, Europe and Australasia remains supportive
       of the foodservice industry. Food inflation remains relatively benign
       across most markets.
   •   Currency volatility has positively impacted Bidcorp's rand translated
       results. The rand translated results are approximately 4,5% higher than
       the constant currency results to the end of April 2019.
   •   Acquisition opportunities are being limited by unrealistic vendor
       valuation expectations at this stage of the cycle, a consequence of which
       is that fewer bolt-on acquisitions have been concluded. Focus remains
       on extracting the benefits from some of the more recent acquisitions,
       most notably in Australia, Iberia and Germany.
•   We continue to invest in organic growth through ongoing capex spend,
    with the focus on having more but smaller depots closer to the customer
    base.
•   Further evolution (not revolution) of our ecommerce and CRM platforms
    continue to provide competitive advantage across all businesses in the
    Group. Our global procurement initiatives are expanding both in Asia and
    Europe, the benefits of which reflect in each individual business.
•   Bidcorp's strategy remains focused on growth – organically in current
    markets through real sales growth focussed on the correct customer
    base; via in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand geographic reach and
    product ranges; and via strategic acquisitions as the group enters new
    markets.
•   Management's expectations for F2019 remain unchanged.


Australasia

    •   Australia's trading performance remains at anticipated levels.
        Revenue growth has been dampened by the exiting of a residual low
        margin contract in the latter part of calendar 2018. The core
        foodservice businesses are doing well, and the meat business is
        slowly improving. Supply Solutions (Imports) continues to perform
        well off the back of further upstream integration, such as cheese
        processing. Our focus on liquor continues to prove challenging but
        will be a key driver of growth in years to come. Further capex is being
        spent on organic expansion in foodservice. Bolt-on acquisition
        opportunities remain, however the current focus remains on
        performance improvement at Festival Liquor.
    •   New Zealand continues its solid performance. Revenue gains and
        margin improvements are being offset by higher costs, particularly
        labour (full employment and no migration) and the costs of recent
        increased capacity. All segments of the business continue to develop
        profitably with ongoing innovation and product development,
        particularly value add and processing. Further capacity expansion is
        being planned to accommodate organic growth.

United Kingdom (""UK"")

    •   Bidfood UK continues to perform well. Consumer confidence is
        being dented due to ‘Brexit' fatigue. Sales volumes continue to grow
        in the independent sector as our focus on service levels continues.
        National account volume growth is being carefully managed in favour
        of improved margins. Business improvement initiatives continue to
        deliver margin improvements. Ecommerce implementation continues
        to gather traction. Further investment into increased distribution
        capacity remains a key focus to cater for anticipated growth. Growth
        in ‘own' brands continues and importing of an exclusive range of
        brands is gaining traction. The acquisition of Punjab Kitchen (niche
        ready-meals business) in February will add to Bidfood's
        manufacturing / value add products capability. An acquisition of an
      independent foodservice businesses is likely to conclude in Q1
      F2020.
  •   Trading in Bidfresh improved in Q3 however market conditions
      remain challenging. Our customer base has experienced the decline
      in the ‘casual dining' segment as well as several suppliers going
      bankrupt. Seafood has performed well, Produce is getting better but
      the Meat division is taking longer than anticipated to reach scale.
      Management's focus is on building the customer base in the Meat
      pillar.

Europe

  •   Overall results from our European businesses remains solid. Good
      like-for-like trading profit growth in constant FX has been achieved
      by the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech & Slovakia, Poland and Italy.
      Large cost increases, particularly labour and fuel, remain however do
      appear to be moderating. Our businesses are compensating for
      these by driving higher revenues and improved gross margins.
      Performance at Iberia and Germany remains below expectation
      although business improvement initiatives are starting to deliver
      improvements in both operations.
  •   Netherlands has maintained its good momentum despite a
      tightening labour market. Its business simplification journey with
      product range rationalisation and IT infrastructure reconfiguration is
      starting to benefit the overall cost base, improving net margins.
  •   Belgium's performance is positive, delivering higher profitability.
      Volume growth in its freetrade and institutional sectors is ongoing.
      Depot consolidation between Bestfoods and Langens to achieve
      operational efficiencies in its infrastructure continue. Private label
      development in the freetrade segment is being pursued. The roll out
      of the ‘myBidfood' ecommerce platform is ongoing.
  •   Czech & Slovakia continues to deliver a strong performance across
      all segments of the business. Economic growth is slowing however
      sales and gross margins have continued to grow. These have
      mitigated higher labour costs. Timely depot investments in F2018
      have positioned the business well in terms of market share gains.
      Further infrastructure investment in depots is planned. Production
      facilities are operating at high capacities ahead of anticipated
      summer demand.
  •   Solid organic growth in Poland has continued, driven by focus on the
      freetrade sector. Development of the product range into both Asian
      cuisine and liquor is driving sales growth. Increased investment into
      customer focused IT initiatives are expected to grow market share.
      Further net margin improvement continues to be achieved.
  •   DAC Italy continues to grow with good penetration of the
      independent sector. Business and consumer confidence is holding
      up. D&D's integration into DAC is ongoing. Procurement benefits in
      Italian product (sourced/ co-sourced from/ with DAC) continues to
      grow.
  •   Iberia comprises our businesses in Spain and Portugal. Overall
      performance in Spain is well below expectations. Improvements to
      the business platform through efficiencies in the infrastructure, a new
      ERP system and skilled people, are starting to show improvements
      however financial performance remains poor. Our business in
      Portugal goes from strength to strength. The bolt-on acquisition
      Igartza (July 2018), a multi-category distributor in northern Spain, is
      performing in line with expectations. Management remain positive
      about the growth opportunity in the Iberian market.
  •   Germany has underperformed however trading losses are
      narrowing. Work continues in building its business foundation
      including sales structures, IT platforms, human capital and
      infrastructure. Additional management, deployed to assist the local
      operators, is starting to make a difference. Germany still represents
      a very large foodservice opportunity.
  •   The Baltics, with a focus on Lithuania, is profitable. The new depot
      in Kaunas became operational in Q3.
  •   Further expansion, both in terms of in-country bolt-on acquisitions
      and strategic entry into new geographies in Europe, remains
      possible, as we are not represented or underrepresented in many
      countries.


Emerging markets

  •   South Africa overall is showing improvement despite weak
      economic conditions. Bidfood and the Chipkins Puratos (CP) JV have
      achieved pleasing growth through good cost containment and
      improved margins. The aftermath of the listeriosis crisis in processed
      meats continues to impact the Crown Food Group (CFG) business
      however, from April, is largely in the comparative base. The food
      inflation trajectory is up which will start to assist Bidfood. The CP JV
      is investing in new product offerings with the benefit of the Puratos
      influence. The small ingredients distributor acquired by CFG in H1
      F2019 is meeting expectations. Overall results in the month of April
      were much improved on the comparative month in F2018.
  •   Greater China's year to date financial performance remains
      significantly below F2018 however month on month is starting to
      recover as expected. In mainland China, our geographic distribution
      network is reasonably complete. Dairy remains an important
      category however diversification of the product range continues.
      Operations are expected to commence at the new meat (value add
      processing) factory in Q4. Mainland China has reacted well in
      recovering from the effects of dairy market supply dislocation,
      accordant margin pressures and rising operating and logistics costs.
      Hong Kong's cost inefficiencies remain due to duplicate
      warehousing, but these will rectify themselves from the beginning of
      Q4. Some further supplier dislocation in dairy is anticipated in Hong
      Kong in Q4 however management are well prepared to deal with the
          challenge. The working capital cycle remains under scrutiny. The
          focus on bolstering the overall management structures continues.
      •   Singapore continues to deliver steady growth as we develop our
          foodservice model. Good traction is being achieved in the core
          foodservice market with other areas such as exports, marine and
          commodities being scaled back significantly. Our investment into
          Malaysia is rolling out nationwide. Our small joint venture in Vietnam
          is progressing, albeit a little later than planned.
      •   Further expansion in Asia depends on finding the correct
          opportunities.
      •   In South America, our focus remains on building a strong platform
          in a region with significant growth potential. Brazil has delivered an
          improved organic performance. Recent political change has not yet
          manifested itself in higher economic growth, yet business confidence
          is up. Refinement of the business model continues to enable sales
          growth and expansion of their broadline product range. Further capex
          is being spent to cater for growth. Bolt-on opportunities are being
          pursued however vendor expectations remain unrealistic. Chile is
          performing well and has a true national presence off the back of the
          significant customer base and two additional depots which were
          acquired in October. Integration continues.
      •   In the Middle East, our businesses have rebounded strongly
          benefitting from improved geopolitical stability and the flow through
          effects of higher oil prices. The UAE is starting to show some
          improvement as tourism and hotel occupancies improve. A
          significant agency was won in Q3 which should assist going forward.
          Our Saudi operation has performed very well, buoyed by structural
          reforms which are translating in higher economic activity. All
          businesses are profitable other than the small Jordan operation.
      •   Turkey continues to improve as the local operations grow. Further
          bolt-on opportunities are being sought.


Acquisitive activity

      •   Bidcorp remains alert to all acquisition opportunities that present
          themselves both in current markets and in new territories.
      •   In the 3 months to March 2019, we made the following bolt-on
          acquisition costing (inclusive of acquisition costs) R291 million:
             o Bidfood UK acquired Punjab Kitchen, a niche ready meals
                 business.


Discontinued operations – UK Logistics activities:

          •   CD business

              o We are in advanced negotiations for the disposal of the CD
                business (Bestfood Logistics), to a reputable international
                buyer. At this stage we cannot provide any further details and
              will update the market in due course. We are reasonably
              confident at this stage of the sale progressing, but it is still
              subject to clearing several hurdles which are considered
              normal and usual for a transaction of this nature. We anticipate
              closure in Q1 F2020.
            o Trading performance in Bestfood Logistics continues to
              improve off the back of better service levels and a more
              sustainable revenue platform. The rest of the re-awarded KFC
              contract is being onboarded and will be complete by June.
      •   PCL
            o The exit of the highly unprofitable transport contracts were
              completed at the end of April. The residual fleet is in the
              process of being disposed of, which should be complete by
              June. The remaining warehousing activities are small and
              management are working on an exit plan for these. All costs
              of closure will be expensed by year-end.

per share (H1F2018: 641,0 cents), with basic earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 8,2% to 698,7 cents per share 
(H1F2018: 645,5 cents). Currency volatility across major currencies positively impacted our rand-translated results 
for the period. On a constant currency basis, HEPS grew by 7,1%.

Trading across developed market geographies remained positive, despite cost pressures, persistent low food inflation
and moderate economic growth. Good top-line growth combined with gross-margin gains alleviated cost inflation.

Europe again delivered a standout performance, particularly eastern Europe. UK Foodservice continued to perform very
well and Bidfresh continued on its recovery trajectory. Australia benefited from its previous infrastructure investments
while continuing to rationalise its exposure to lower-margin customers. New Zealand achieved both top-line and margin
growth, offsetting cost pressures. South Africa performed admirably, despite tough economic conditions. Greater China
struggled, hampered by the after-effects of the loss of a major dairy products agency and dairy market crisis, which
constrained gross margins and added costs as rapid range diversification proceeded. 

Discontinued operations
Consequent to our previously announced strategy of exiting the UK Contract Distribution activities, Bidcorp has
classified all of its UK Logistics' activities as discontinued, the details of which are reported below.

UK Contract Distribution (CD)
Performance significantly improved on the second half of F2018, though the business still recorded a small loss.
Service levels have improved and customer pricing has been substantially increased to more fully reflect the risk 
and reward of these activities.

Bidcorp continues to run a broad sales process designed to achieve a controlled exit of this business.

PCL distribution business (PCL)
Trading in PCL (dairy distribution business for Arla) was poor and losses were incurred. Despite improved service
levels, profitability was significantly impacted by low revenue increases, higher distribution costs and a dispute on
transport rates. As noted previously, the business relationship with Arla has largely broken down and negotiations for 
the sale of the major portion of these activities is underway. Accordingly, the intangible associated with this contract 
has been fully impaired and further costs associated with the exit will be incurred in the second half particularly vehicle
fleet disposal costs.

Distribution
Bidcorp has declared an interim cash dividend of 310,0 cents per share, a 10,7% increase on the 2018 interim dividend.

Financial overview
Net revenue of R66,4 billion (H1F2018: R60,9 billion) grew by 9,1% (constant currency growth of 6,8%), reflecting real
growth in activity levels in all geographies. Despite significant cost pressures in fuel, wages and energy, food
inflation in our core foodservice markets remains low. 

Gross profit percentage increased to 23,4% (H1F2018: 22,9%), reflecting further freetrade growth in the mix as well as
trading through the higher cost base.

Operating expenses increased due to ongoing wage pressure in many economies and higher fuel and energy costs. The Group's 
overall cost of doing business increased to 18,4% (H1F2018: 17,9%) on higher sales and distribution activity and the
cost of invested operational capacity.

Group trading profit rose 8,3% to R3,3 billion (H1F2018: R3,0 billion). Trading margin was maintained at 4,9%.

Share-based payment costs increased to R58,3 million (H1F2018: R53,5 million) on the back of further long-term
incentivisation of staff across the Group. Lower acquisition costs reflect slightly lower acquisitive activity as 
management bedded down acquisitions made in previous periods.

Net finance charges were 5,8% higher at R143,2 million (H1F2018: R135,4 million), in line with overall trading profit
growth. Bidcorp remains well capitalised, with trading profit interest cover at 22,9 times (H1F2018: 22,3 times). We
retain adequate headroom for further organic and acquisitive growth; however, we remain conscious of the need to balance
gearing and shareholder returns.

The Group's financial position remains strong, a positive attribute in volatile global markets. Investments in fixed
assets reflect both replacement and expansionary capital expenditure to accommodate increased capacity and facility
modernisation. Net debt is R5,1 billion (H1F2018: R3,2 billion), impacted by normal first-half working capital absorption 
and ongoing investment.

Cash generated by operations before working capital absorption was R3,9 billion, an increase of 14,8% over H1F2018.
Lower utilisation of working capital of R1,5 billion (H1F2018: R1,8 billion) is pleasing in the face of higher activity
levels, tighter supplier terms and impacts from recent acquisitions not fully in the base. Monthly average net working
capital days remained consistent at 11 days (H1F2018: 10 days). Free cash flow (excluding dividends paid) was better than
H1F2018 by R0,9 billion, largely due to higher cash flow from operations and lower working capital absorption.

Acquisitions
Several small bolt-on acquisitions were made, the most significant of which entailed the acquisition of the remaining
minority of the D&D bolt-on acquisition in Italy and 100% of Igartza in Spain. Investments totalled R337,5 million.
Focus remains on bolstering systems and infrastructure while extracting synergies and efficiencies from recent acquisitions
in Germany and Iberia.
 
Prospects
Bidcorp remains focused on growth opportunities in the wholesaling of food and allied products to the eat-out-of-home
market; organically through achieving the appropriate customer mix, by selling more products and gaining new customers;
via in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand our geographic reach or to expand our product ranges; and via strategic
acquisitions to enter new markets, as and when these arise.

Our mantra of ""it's all about the food, the service and the technology"" articulates our aim of delivering customer
satisfaction backed by high service levels, efficient infrastructure and fit-for-purpose cost-effective products.

Fresh produce, meat, value-add processing and supply chain procurement initiatives all remain areas of further potential 
across all businesses in the Group. Our bespoke global ecommerce and CRM platform continues to evolve and embrace our
best worldwide intellectual property, all leveraged for the greater benefit of the Group. Our service capability
continues to improve as we further invest in our decentralised infrastructure programme to fulfil the strategic objective 
of getting as close as possible to the customer base. Shared innovations across the Group greatly enhance our speed of
business development.

We retain significant financial headroom to enable us to decisively capitalise on the right opportunities, either
organic or acquisitive, while always remaining disciplined in our overriding approach.

Financially, the Group is strong and we expect cash generation to remain robust. Our objective is to generate
above-average returns in each of our businesses in their home markets, notwithstanding macro-considerations and 
short-term volatility in various markets.

Bidcorp's strength lies in the experience of its entrepreneurial management teams who thrive within our decentralised
Group culture. Despite some short-term challenges in our emerging markets, the fundamental demographic and industry
drivers of our global foodservice markets remain positive, positioning the Group to continue to deliver real earnings 
growth for the full year.

Divisional performance
Australasia
The region performed strongly. Revenue was up 1,2% to R16,0 billion (H1F2018: R15,9 billion). Trading profit rose 4,7%
to R980,9 million (H1F2018: R937,1 million), demonstrating the benefit of the continuing strategic move away from the
lower margin customer portfolio.

Australia had a reasonable first half, with sales slightly up on last year, a great result considering the exit of
further low-margin business in the period.

Continuing focus was given to freetrade customer space, which now represents 77% of total sales, up from 73%. In terms
of the metropolitan branch splits effected in F2018, all three regions are tracking well ahead of previous performance.
Supply Solutions continues to perform well while developing further exclusive brand lines and other light manufacturing
opportunities.

The key challenge is to drive continuing growth in a large, mature business - the strategic factor behind our move
into liquor following the Festival acquisition. Initial Festival results were disappointing, but opportunities abound in
the medium term, given improved operational performance.

New Zealand put in a credible first-half performance as consumers became increasingly cautious and many customers
reported tough trading conditions. Sales showed pleasing growth, margins firmed and expenses were well controlled as
branches focused on productivity improvements. Labour availability continues to be a challenge, as well as pressure on 
wage rates.

Construction started at three more sites to ensure we can maintain our growth trajectory. All the 2018 new builds are
now delivering a positive return. Returns slipped slightly on the back of continued investment in property and related
assets.

United Kingdom
Notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding Brexit, revenue rose 10,0% to R17,2 billion (H1F2018: R15,6 billion) while
trading profit increased by 17,9% to R856,7 million (H1F2018: R726,5 million). Foodservice continues to deliver excellent
results, with Bidfresh refreshed and ready to deliver good growth.

Bidfood UK performed strongly, with sales and trading profit ahead of projections. Intense margin management delivered
the anticipated gains, a pleasing performance in view of persistent cost pressures in wages, fuel and energy prices.

The independent and multiple freetrade categories showed continued growth, both in margins and volumes. National
account volumes fell, but margins improved. The focus remains on exiting non-profitable business while improving 
margins across our existing customer base.

New brand Unity Wines strengthened its market position despite the brand transition undertaken. Own brand product
growth was buoyant.

Bidfresh performance overall was flat. Seafood did well and margins improved. However, further losses were recorded at
Meat. Steps are being taken to drive renewed Meat growth. The Produce business has been restructured following its new
depot and geographical expansion. National accounts showed good growth. Independents face challenges in a slowing
economy. Cost efficiency is key going forward.
 
Europe
Europe continues to be the stand-out performer in the Group, with most businesses delivering good sales growth and
solid trading results. Eastern Europe jurisdictions continue to show record revenue growth, in spite of significant wage
pressures throughout the region. Revenue rose 14,8% to R22,5 billion (H1F2018: R19,6 billion) while trading profit rose
19,9% to R979,9 million (H1F2018: R817,0 million).

Netherlands maintained strong momentum, supported by a solid second-quarter performance. Sales and trading profit
exceeded expectation. Strong gains in the horeca channel more than offset a slowdown in other areas of the business, 
notably in the healthcare market. Freetrade growth was unabated and beat expectations. Margins were supported by import
activities and some small price rises. Operational expenses rose. Labour availability remains a challenge.

Belgium performed strongly in both the horeca and institutional segments. Sales were above budget and margins well
managed. All customer segments showed growth, except the Catering channel. Development of the ecommerce customer 
offering is ongoing.

Italy again performed strongly. Sales and trading profit growth was pleasing in view of the national economy slowdown.
Cash generated by operations rose significantly. Sales to Bidcorp sister companies continued to grow. Continued success
in the freetrade sector underscores recent gains. This will remain a point of focus in the second half, along with
continued integration of the D&D acquisition.

Czech Republic and Slovakia again recorded excellent first-half growth. Higher sales and better margins offset significant 
wage pressures due to labour shortages. Sales of our Nowaco products were pleasing, thanks in part to a highly effective 
TV campaign. Production numbers were positive overall. The Czech economy is slowing, but we are confident we can maintain 
momentum. Further depot openings are planned to ensure we can effectively service our increasing customer base. 

Poland had an outstanding first half, once again registering record sales. The business drew strategic benefit from
sustained investment in previous years. Growing sales to the independent street trade provided much of the impetus.
Contract reviews in the national accounts segment assisted margin management. Smart Food, the subsidiary that serves 
Asian restaurants, is expanding its geographic reach. Our Food & Wine subsidiary continues to grow its wine sales and is
expanding into spirits.

Iberia (Spain and Portugal) performance is below expectations. However, steady progress is being made internally on
improving the business platforms and systems. The Barcelona region is still performing poorly, offset by good growth in
Madrid and Lisbon. Focus remains on growing the independent customer-base. Restructuring of the legacy Food4 business
impacted profitability. Frustock (Portugal) and newly acquired Igartza performed well. 

Baltics achieved pleasing sales growth, driven by strong foodservice performance. Operations in both Latvia and
Lithuania recorded a profit. Construction of the new depot in Kaunas is progressing well.

Germany continued to underperform. Horeca sales rose and national accounts ticked higher, though expenses remained too
high. Additional management support has been deployed to assist our local operators. This remains a medium-term market
opportunity for us. We need to structure the base before attempting expansion.

Emerging Markets
This segment continues to navigate the challenging economic and political headwinds in these developing jurisdictions.
Even so, overall revenue was up 9,1% to R10,7 billion (H1F2018: R9,8 billion), with trading profit down 13,6% at 
R502,0 million (H1F2018: R581,3 million), largely due to the impact of the mainland China results.

Africa was impacted by a challenged performance at Crown Food Group (CFG) as recovery by the processed meats sector
after last year's listeriosis crisis proved slow. Bidfood and Chipkins Puratos (CP), our 50% equity-accounted JV,
delivered excellent results, despite consumer pressure and cost rises well above food inflation. All businesses grew 
volumes in targeted channels, but margins are under pressure. Bidfood secured further street trade gains. National accounts
declined slightly, but industrial catering sales rose. Sales through the MyBidfood ecommerce platform continue to expand. 
Our private and exclusive labels remain a differentiator in the market. At CFG, the Six Bar acquisition has been integrated
into the business. CP grew across most channels, bolstered by good sales of own-manufactured products. Its
state-of-the-art wet plant opens soon.

Greater China faced pressures as the economy slowed. Some sales gains were registered. Margins slipped and profit fell
as expenses moved significantly higher as we expanded our product offering following the loss of our cornerstone dairy
products agency. This loss was unpreventable, the principal (a large New Zealand dairy company) made the strategic
decision to insource the selling function and outsource only the distribution component, which is not the type of activity 
we choose to be involved in. The Guangzhou and Shanghai operations were under particular pressure in adjusting to the loss
of the dairy agency. Miumi, the Japanese food business, put in a strong showing. The second quarter 'festival effect'
boosted Hong Kong and Macau.

Work continued on the further diversification of the product mix. Hong Kong and Macau plan to continue the introduction 
of new brands while stepping up investment in production centres. The hotel and restaurant channel and Chinese cuisine
are focus areas for mainland operations. The business is now poised to resume its growth strategy, with the aim of
repeating the performance levels seen in the previous 10 years.

Singapore achieved modest sales gains, but operating profit was slightly lower as a result of our Vietnam startup
costs. The Vietnam JV became operational late in the period. Our Singapore business is now performing better after being
transformed into a more traditional foodservice operation. Malaysia performed well, growing sales and margins.

Chile exceeded expectations. Volumes benefited from the October acquisition of Foodchoice. Organic growth remained the
biggest driver, supported by contributions from the Viña del Mar branch. Sales from two more branches (Foodchoice
Temuco and Antofagata) added to momentum. 

Brazil achieved strong sales growth. Both the Irmaos Avelino and Mariusso components of the business reported solid
gains as the foodservice sector benefited from a more positive consumer mood following national elections. Gains were
underpinned by productivity improvements and the introduction of enhanced technology and reporting tools. We began the
launch of own brand products in numerous categories, drawing on the experience of Group businesses around the world.

Middle East sales and profit exceeded expectations while margins improved. Operating expenditure was well managed.
Dubai was under pressure. However, Abu Dhabi did well. Al Diyafa, the Saudi Arabian JV, recorded pleasing results, 
driven by new account gains and a better product sales mix. 

Turkey recorded big sales gains. Trading profit lagged budget but was up on the comparative period. Izmir-based EFE
put in an exceptional performance. Expenses were well controlled, but the weak Turkish lira drove some distribution costs
higher.

Basis of presentation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements 
The condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for interim reports, and the requirement of the Companies Act of South Africa applicable for condensed
interim consolidated financial statements. The Listings Requirements require interim reports to be prepared in accordance
with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
Reporting Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council, and include disclosure as required by IAS 34:
Interim Financial Reporting and the Companies Act of South Africa. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
the condensed interim consolidated financial statements from which the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
were derived are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
previous consolidated annual financial statements.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Acquisitions
The Group made a number of small acquisitions during the period, namely:
- Igartza, S.L. (Spain)
- D&D S.p.A. (Italy) - acquired remaining 30%
- Foodchoice (Chile)
- Six Bar Trading 409 CC (South Africa)
- KBC Foods (Australia)

These acquisitions form part of the Group's strategic expansion plans in the international foodservice industry. The
acquisitions have enabled the Group to expand its range of complementary products and services and, as a consequence, 
has broadened the Group's base in the market place. Total investment in acquisitions was R337,5 million, and their
contribution to revenue and trading profit for the half-year ended December 31  2018 was R195,2 million and R11,0 million
respectively. There were no significant contingent liabilities identified in the businesses acquired. 

Financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques categorised as follows:
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
           directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including 
their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does not include fair
value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a
reasonable approximation of fair value.

Discontinued operations 
In December 2017, management committed to a plan to discontinue the UK Contract Distribution (CD) business 
segment which operates in the United Kingdom. By June 30  2018, Bidcorp was close to finalising its proposed 
exit from this non-core segment. Costs associated with this anticipated exit were substantially provided for 
and any further costs are unlikely to be significant. The CD business segment is a component of the Group's 
United Kingdom business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest 
of the Group. Post June 30  2018, the prospective purchaser of the CD business notified Bidcorp that for 
its own internal reasons, it has decided not to proceed with the transaction. The CD business remains a 
non-core activity in respect of Bidcorp's global foodservice operations. Accordingly, Bidcorp pursued 
alternative exit proposals, and has engaged in a formal sale process, managed by independent advisers. 
The sale process is ongoing at December 31  2018.

PCL's (dairy distribution business for Arla) performance for the half year was disappointing. Towards the end 
of 2018, following a dispute with Arla,management committed to exit the PCL business by either selling the PCL 
transport operations to Arla or to close down the PCL business. Heads of Terms are being negotiated with Arla, 
and the sales process is ongoing at December 31  2018. An outcome is expected to be finalised before June 2019. 
Further costs associated with the exit will be incurred in the second half of the financial year, including
trading losses and vehicle fleet disposal costs.

Preparation and results
These half-year ended December 31 results have not been audited or reviewed by the Group's auditors. The 
condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CAM Bishop (CA)SA, under the 
supervision of DE Cleasby CA(SA), and were approved by the board of directors on February 19  2019.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of cash flows, segmental analysis and 
related notes have been re-presented as a result of classifying the remaining UK logistics activities, PCL, 
as a discontinued operation in the 2019 interim period, together with the related notes.

As a result of this disclosure change, the June 30  2018 consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated 
statement of cash flows, segmental analysis and related notes have been described as ""unaudited"" in the 2019 
interim financial statements contained herein.

The adoption of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments and IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts from Customers, which became 
effective from July 1  2018, has not had a material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. 
No transition adjustments have been processed to retained earnings.

IFRS 16: Leases will be adopted by the Group with effect from July 1  2019. Management's initial assessment of 
IFRS 16 is that it will have an impact on the following areas (but not limited to):
- an overall increase in the Group's total assets, net debt and debt/equity ratio due to the inclusion of the
  lease liability on statement of financial position;
- higher trading profit due to an element of the operating lease charge being disclosed as a finance charge; 
  and
- higher finance charges and lower trading interest cover levels due to the finance element of the current 
  lease charge being moved to the finance charges line on the statement of profit or loss.

Notification Of Change In External Auditor

The Bidcorp Board of Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee, wish to inform shareholders
that after a formal tender process to appoint a new firm of external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. (""PwC"") are appointed as the company's external auditors, with
Mr Eben Gerryts appointed as the designated audit partner for the financial year ending
June 30th 2019.

KPMG Inc. (""KPMG"") have submitted their formal resignation as Bidcorp's appointed external
auditors, dated January 14th 2019. PwC is appointed as external auditor with immediate effect.

The KPMG audit reports for the Bidcorp consolidated financial statements and subsidiaries for the
years up to the year ended June 30th 2018 did not contain any adverse opinions or disclaimers of
opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During Bidcorp's financial year ended June 30th 2018 and through the subsequent interim period on
or prior to this announcement, there were no disagreements between Bidcorp and KPMG on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction, would have caused them to
make reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement, or
reportable events. The Board and the Audit and Risk Committee are satisfied that KPMG delivered
an audit of satisfactory quality for the financial year ended June 30th 2018.

Notwithstanding the above, KPMG has faced significant reputational risks. Having due consideration
of these risks, the Board, through the Audit and Risk Committee, announced in the 2018 Notice of
AGM, Bidcorp's intention to appoint a new firm of external auditors with global audit capability for
the financial year ending June 30th 2019.

Capital Markets Trading Update – November 28th 2018

Shareholders are advised that the Bidcorp executive management are meeting
with members of the financial community (including shareholders, financial
analysts and the press) today, November 28th 2018, to update the market on
the trading environment across its international operations.

Bidcorp’s UK CD business is still being classified as a discontinued operation.
The following update deals with the continuing and discontinued operations
separately.

Update on trading conditions

Continuing operations:

Management comments as follows:

Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   •   Trading for Q1 F2019 continues to be positive (measured in home
       currencies). Performance achieved by our large UK, European and
       Australasian foodservice businesses remains on expectation however
       Angliss China and South Africa in particular, are challenging.
   •   Organic sales have continued to grow, with the gross margin percentage
       increasing marginally. This has offset operating cost increases impacted
       by rising wage costs (due to full employment levels in numerous
       economies) and higher fuel and energy expenses. Overall trading
       margins are being maintained.
   •   Economic growth in the UK, Europe and Australasia remains supportive
       of the foodservice industry. Food inflation remains relatively benign
       across most markets.
   •   Currency volatility continues to impact Bidcorp’s rand translated results.
       The constant currency results are approximately 3,1% lower than the
       rand translated results to the end of October 2018.
   •   Fundamental conditions within our global foodservice markets continue
       to support organic growth and bolt-on opportunities remain in all our
       geographical segments.
   •   Bidcorp’s strategy remains focused on growth – organically in current
       markets, via in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand geographic reach
    and product ranges; and via strategic acquisitions as the group enters
    new markets.

Australasia

•   Australia’s trading performance has returned to anticipated levels as our
    major metro expansion gathers momentum. The Melbourne, Sydney and
    Brisbane / Gold Coast branches are now generating much improved
    returns. Revenue growth has been dampened by the exiting of a residual
    low margin contract. Our focus on liquor has proved challenging but will
    be a key driver of growth in years to come as the range is extended into
    the foodservice network. The core foodservice businesses are doing
    well, and the fresh and meat businesses are slowly improving. Supply
    Solutions (Imports) continues to perform well off the back of the success
    of its cheese processing plant. Bolt-on acquisition opportunities remain,
    however the current focus is on the integration of recent investments.
•   New Zealand continues its solid performance however top line gains and
    margin improvements are being offset by higher costs, particularly labour
    (full employment and no migration) and the costs of recent increased
    capacity. All segments of the business continue to develop profitably with
    ongoing innovation and product development, particularly value add and
    processing. Further capacity expansion is being planned to
    accommodate organic growth.

United Kingdom (""UK"")

•   Bidfood UK continues to perform very well. Good summer weather
    assisted activity levels despite increasing stress in the casual dining
    space and lower consumer confidence, partly due to the Brexit
    uncertainty. Sales volumes continue to grow in the independent sector
    as our focus on service levels continues. National account volumes are
    being well controlled but margins have improved. Business improvement
    initiatives continue to deliver margin improvements. Ecommerce
    implementation continues to gather traction. Further investment into
    increased distribution capacity remains a key focus to cater for
    anticipated growth. Implementation of importing exclusive brands is
    underway. An acquisition of a niche independent foodservice businesses
    is in progress.
•   Trading in Bidfresh has been reasonable with the overhang from good
    trading in July and August being experienced in September. Market
    conditions have been challenging, with the customer base experiencing
    many ‘casual dining’ failures as well as several suppliers going bankrupt.
    Seafood has performed well, Produce is getting better, and the evolution
    of the Meat model still lagging. The Bidfresh business has a good
    national footprint across each of its Meat, Produce and Seafood
    segments. The focus is on strengthened management capability in each
    of the Produce and Meat pillars.
•   Trading in PCL (dairy distribution business for Arla) has been poor. Low
    revenue increases, higher distribution costs and a dispute on transport
    rates have impacted profitability. The future viability of the business is
    under serious consideration and our relationship with Arla is severely
    strained.

Europe

•   Overall results from our European businesses are pleasing. Solid like-
    for-like trading profit growth in constant FX, excluding recent
    acquisitions, has been achieved. The performances of the Netherlands,
    Belgium, Czech & Slovakia, Poland and Italy are good. Cost increases,
    particularly labour and fuel, are having an impact in many economies
    experiencing full employment.
•   Netherlands has delivered an improved performance. Economic activity
    is buoyant however the labour market has tightened. The business is
    making progress on its simplification journey with product range
    rationalisation and IT infrastructure costs reconfiguration starting to
    benefit the overall cost base.
•   The Belgium performance is pleasing, delivering incrementally higher
    profitability. Focus remains on volume growth in its freetrade and
    institutional sectors. Depot consolidation between Bestfoods and
    Langens to achieve operational efficiencies in its infrastructure have
    commenced. Our private label development in the freetrade segment is
    being pursued. The ‘myBidfood’ ecommerce platform is live and being
    progressively rolled out across the business.
•   Czech & Slovakia have continued to deliver strong performance across
    all segments of their business. Economic growth has moderated
    however staff availability is driving up wage costs. Our sales have
    continued to grow with margins being maintained. A new depot was
    opened in Chlumec late in the quarter and further infrastructure
    investment in depots is planned. Production facilities are operating at
    high capacities to meet demand but are benefitting from new technology
    around products and packaging.
•   Good organic growth in Poland has continued, driven by focus on the
    freetrade sector. New depots investments, positive economic conditions
    and a good summer have contributed to their positive performance.
    Development of the product range into both Asian cuisine and liquor has
    benefitted the business. Further margin enhancement continues to be
    achieved.
•   DAC Italy has continued to grow off the back of higher business and
    consumer confidence. D&D, a horeca specialist, acquired in January
    2018, has performed well. Global procurement benefits in Italian product
    (sourced/co-sourced from/with DAC) continues to grow.
•   Bidfood Iberia comprises our businesses in Spain and Portugal. Overall
    performance in Spain is below expectations. Internal focus in Guzman is
    on improving the business platform around infrastructure, ERP systems
    and people. The integration of our produce business in Portugal and
    meat business in Spain continues. A bolt-on acquisition of a multi
    category distributor in northern Spain was concluded. Management
    remain positive about the potential opportunity in the Iberian market.
•   Our German and Austrian acquisition, made in July 2017, has
    underperformed. Work on its business foundation including sales
    structures, IT platforms, human capital and infrastructure continues.
    Additional management support has been deployed to assist the local
    operators. Germany still represents a very large and developed
    foodservice opportunity.
•   The Baltics, with a focus on Lithuania, is now profitable. The new depot,
    under construction in Kaunas, is expected to be operational in Q3 F2019.
•   Further expansion, both in terms of in-country bolt-on acquisitions and
    strategic entry into new geographies in Europe, remains possible, as we
    are not represented or underrepresented in many countries.

Emerging markets

•   South Africa overall has underperformed in extremely trying economic
    conditions, characterised by stagnant GDP growth and ongoing weak
    consumer sentiment. Despite these conditions, Bidfood and the Chipkins
    Puratos (CP) JV have achieved satisfactory growth through good cost
    containment and improved profitability. However, the aftermath of the
    listeriosis crisis in chilled processed meats continues to impact the
    Crown Food Group (CFG) business. Food inflation trajectory is up
    following recent deflation which will assist Bidfood going forward. The
    CP JV is developing new product offerings with the benefit of the Puratos
    influence. A small ingredients distributor was acquired by CFG,
    broadening exposure to this segment of the market.
•   Greater China’s financial performance has been disappointing, but the
    business has reacted well in recovering from the effects of dairy market
    supply dislocation and accordant margin pressures and rising operating
    and logistics costs. There has been a slowdown arising out of the trade
    war with the US, mostly due to the effects of the currency devaluation.
    Hong Kong’s cost inefficiencies remain due to duplicate warehousing,
    but these will rectify themselves in the 2nd half of F2019 as surplus
    capacity is eliminated. In mainland China, our geographic expansion
    continues with the distribution network reasonably complete. Despite
    dairy remaining an important category, the diversification of the product
    range continues. Operations are expected to commence in the new meat
    (value add processing) factory in Q3 of F2019. The working capital cycle
    remains under scrutiny. As the geographic spread in mainland China
    grows, management structures are being bolstered.
•   Singapore has achieved steady growth as we develop our foodservice
    model. Good progress in being made in the core foodservice market with
    other areas such as exports, marine and commodities being scaled back
       significantly. Bidfood Malaysia, albeit small, is developing well. Our small
       joint venture in Vietnam has commenced activities.
   •   Further expansion into Asia always remains an opportunity.
   •   In South America, our focus remains on building a strong platform in a
       region with significant growth potential. Our Brazilian business has
       delivered an improved performance in a tough and competitive
       foodservice market. Refinement of the business model continues to
       enable sales growth and expansion of their broadline product range.
       Bolt-on opportunities continue to be explored however vendor
       expectations remain unrealistic. Chile is performing well and to
       expectation, a significant customer base and two additional depots were
       acquired in October, bolstering its geographic footprint.
   •   In the Middle East, our businesses have improved significantly,
       benefitting from less geopolitical challenges and the flow through effects
       of higher oil prices. The UAE has remains challenged by lower tourism
       and hotel occupancies however an improvement is foreseen. Our Saudi
       operation has performed very well, buoyed by structural reforms and less
       impacted by regional geopolitical issues. All businesses are profitable
       other than the recently commenced Jordan operation.
   •   Despite severe economic volatility in Turkey, our operations are
       performing well.

Acquisitive activity

   •   Bidcorp remains alert to all acquisition opportunities that present
       themselves both in current markets and in new territories.
   •   In the 4 months to October, activity has been relatively quiet as
       management focusses on integration of acquisitions made in prior
       periods.
   •   We have however made the following bolt-on acquisitions costing
       (exclusive of acquisition costs) in aggregate R162 million:
          o Guzman acquired 100% of a broadline distributor in Spain.
          o CFG in SA acquired 100% of an ingredients distributor to bolster
            access to this market.
          o Chile acquired a customer base and two depots significantly
            broadening its geographic footprint.


Discontinued operation – UK CD business:

   •   Post the unsuccessful sale transaction, management remains of the
       view that the logistics business remains non-core to the foodservice
       activities of the group. Bidcorp is running a broader sales process
       designed to achieve a controlled exit of this business.
   •   Trading performance in the CD business is much improved compared to
       the same period in F2018, however is still slightly loss making. Bidcorp
       is continuing to implement initiatives, including better rate contributions
       and returning customers to improve the business, as well deliver
       superior service.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT – UPDATE ON DISPOSAL OF UK CONTRACT DISTRIBUTION (CD)
BUSINESS

Shareholders are referred to commentary in the Group’s year-end results on August 22 2018, wherein
Bidcorp noted that it was in the process of finalising an agreement with a prospective purchaser to
acquire the CD business.

The prospective purchaser has notified Bidcorp that for its own internal reasons, it has decided not to
proceed with the transaction.

The CD business remains a non-core activity in respect of Bidcorp’s global foodservice operations.
Accordingly, Bidcorp is currently considering alternative proposals which were suspended due to the
advanced sale process.

Bidcorp is continuing to implement numerous initiatives to improve the CD business, and these are
yielding positive results. The trading performance for the two months to end-August 2018 has delivered
a near breakeven position, which is a significant improvement compared to the same period in the
previous financial year.

Shareholders will be kept informed of developments in regard to the CD business as and when
appropriate.

Our strategic vision 

Management is focused on growth opportunities; organically in our current markets through attaining the 
appropriate business mix by selling more products to our existing customers and gaining new customers; via 
in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand our geographic reach and expanding our product ranges; and via 
larger acquisitions to enter new markets. Despite our appetite for acquisitions, we remain disciplined in 
our approach to accessing the ""right"" opportunities.
 
Bidcorp's entrepreneurial and decentralised business model, the depth and experience of our management 
teams and the strength of the Group's culture has set up the Group for sustained growth in the future.

Comment
Bidcorp has over a period of a few years been exiting low-margin logistics activities globally where they do not fit 
into its model for its foodservice businesses and are thus non-core. As previously announced, pursuant to receiving 
a credible and realistic commercial offer for the UK Contract Distribution (CD) business, Bidcorp took a decision 
in December 2017 to treat CD as a discontinued operation. Accordingly the performance of the continuing operations 
and the discontinued operation are reported separately.

Continuing operations
Bidcorp performed in line with our expectations, delivering solid results for the year ended June 30  2018. 
Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 9,1% to 1 286,3 cents per share (F2017: 1 179,2 cents),
with basic earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 1,1% to 1 223,9 cents per share (F2017: 1 210,5 cents).

Trading across all the geographies in which the Group's foodservice businesses operate remained positive. 
Most businesses in the portfolio improved their performance in home currencies against a backdrop of low food 
inflation and moderate economic growth.

Europe delivered a standout performance. UK Foodservice did well, delivering its best result ever; however, Fresh
disappointed somewhat. New capacity investments in Australia initially created some short-term underperformance but 
their full-year performance achieved a commendable record result. New Zealand once again delivered a great performance. 
In Asia, supplier dislocation and volatile currencies led to rampant price increases in dairy, impacting gross margins 
and efficiencies. South Africa performed well in tough economic conditions.

Our strategic focus of growing our exposure to the independent customer base in our respective markets has driven real
organic growth. A few small acquisitions were concluded in the year to broaden our product range and geographic
extension, the benefits of which have not yet been realised.

The outbreaks of listeria in numerous parts of the world heightened food safety risks. Food testing protocols, systems
and recall procedures were all re-examined and strengthened to maintain the highest level of standards.

Discontinued operation
UK Contract Distribution (CD)
Performance was extremely poor and the business recorded significant losses, particularly in the second half of
the year. The exit of KFC in February and the accompanying redundancies and restructuring, the downscaling of properties
and vehicles, the subsequent onboarding of a part of the KFC contract, poor weather and reduced consumer confidence in
the chain segment of the market all contributed, as did additional costs in relation to the exit of the business.
We are in the process of finalising an agreement with the proposed purchaser of the business, a global business, and 
they are in the final stages of clearing their internal approval formalities. We are hopeful of being able to announce 
the details of this transaction in the next two weeks. Any transaction is still subject to regulatory competition 
authority approval, which is anticipated to take up to four months to complete.

During the year, the management irregularities identified during 2015 and 2016 were settled against the former
business director and numerous other defendants. Significant legal costs were incurred in pursuing this matter, which 
has been resolved to our satisfaction. Certain recoveries have been made but further recoveries are still expected, 
including the finalisation of the insurance matter.

Distribution
Bidcorp has declared a final cash dividend of 280,0 cents per share, bringing the total distribution to shareholders 
in F2018 to 560,0 cents.

Financial overview
Net revenue of R119,4 billion (F2017: R110,5 billion) grew by 8,0% (constant currency growth of 8,5%) reflecting real
growth in activity levels despite relatively benign inflation in the core foodservice markets in all geographies. 

Gross profit percentage was maintained at 24,0% despite our focus on freetrade growth which allowed some businesses to
sacrifice margins to grow volumes and absorb some price increases in the face of rapid inflation in the dairy category.

Operating expenses remained well controlled despite ongoing wage pressure in many economies and generally higher fuel
costs. The overall cost of doing business across the Group remained at 19,0% despite higher sales and distribution 
activity and additional invested capacity.

Group trading profit increased by 8,7% to R6,0 billion (F2017: R5,5 billion) and the trading margin was maintained 
at 5,0%.

Share-based payment costs increased to R99,2 million (F2017: R94,1 million) on the back of further long-term
incentivisation of staff across the Group. Acquisition costs of R35,5 million (F2017: R46,1 million) were incurred 
reflecting slightly lower acquisitive activity compared to the previous year.

Net finance charges were 7,1% higher at R231,1 million (F2017: R215,7 million). Bidcorp remains well capitalised, with
trading profit interest cover at 25,8 times (F2017: 25,4 times). We retain adequate headroom for further organic and
acquisitive growth; however, remain conscious of the need to balance debt capacity and shareholder returns.

The Group's financial position remains strong, a positive attribute in volatile global markets. Total fixed assets
have grown reflecting both replacement and expansionary capital expenditure. Net debt is R3,6 billion impacted by 
ongoing investment and bolt-on acquisitions.

Cash generated by operations before working capital absorption was R6,9 billion, an increase of 10,6% over F2017.
There has been greater utilisation of working capital in the year, reflecting higher activity levels, tighter supplier
terms, some excess stocking due to the listeria crisis in South Africa and impacts from recent acquisitions. However, 
monthly average net working capital days remained flattish at 11 days (F2017: 10 days). Free cash flow (excluding 
dividends paid) was positive at R1,0 billion after investment activities absorbed R3,1 billion.

Acquisitions
Bolt-on acquisitions were made in Australia, Netherlands, Spain, New Zealand, South Africa, Greater China and Turkey.
Total investments were R965,6 million. New geography expansion included Pier 7, a small foodservice business based in
Germany and a niche horeca business in Portugal which has been integrated under Bidfood Iberia. The benefits of these
investments will be evident in the medium-term as we bolster systems and infrastructure and extract synergies and
efficiencies. 

Prospects
The Group comprises businesses concentrated on the wholesaling and distribution of food and aligned products to the 
eat-out-of-home market. 

Our focus on customer satisfaction backed by high service levels, efficient infrastructure and fit-for-purpose product
ranges should continue to deliver real volume growth. Our ""last mile"" delivery capability continues to improve as we
roll-out our decentralised infrastructure programme. Our mantra of ""it's all about the food"" guides our desire to achieve 
the correct customer mix.

Fresh produce, meat, value-add processing and supply chain initiatives all remain areas of unexploited potential,
which assists in bolstering our value-add proposition. Our culture of sharing innovations across the Group ensures 
that the speed of business development is greatly enhanced.

Our bespoke global ecommerce and CRM platform, continues to evolve and embrace our best worldwide IP, all leveraged
for the greater benefit of the Group.

Bidcorp remains focused on growth opportunities; organically in our current markets through attaining the appropriate
business and customer mix by selling more products and gaining new customers; via in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to
expand our geographic reach and expanding our product ranges; and via strategic acquisitions to enter new markets.

We retain significant financial headroom giving the Group the ability to act decisively to capitalise on the right
opportunities, either organic or acquisitive, whilst always remaining disciplined in our approach.

Financially, the Group is strong and we expect cash generation to remain robust. Despite currency volatility in our
global marketplace, our objective remains to generate above average returns in each of our businesses in their home
markets.

Despite some short-term challenges, we remain optimistic that the fundamental drivers of our global foodservice
markets remain positive. Bidcorp's strength lies in the depth and experience of its entrepreneurial management teams 
who thrive in the decentralised business model, a recipe that positions the Group well for continued real growth 
in the year ahead.

Divisional performance
Australasia
The region performed strongly. Despite growth tracking below trend, both Australia and New Zealand set new
records. Revenue moved 2,0% higher to R30,0 billion (2017: R29,4 billion). Trading profit rose marginally by 
0,8% to R2,0 billion (2017: R2,0 billion). Results reflect continued focus on the successful freetrade strategy 
and the management mission to remain ""all about the food"". The future here continues to look bright.

Australia put in a strong performance. Trading profit lagged the prior year at the half-year mark, but by year-end 
was up 2,5%. This was an outstanding result in a year of transformation and some internal disruption.

Revenue rose 4,7%, though this included the sales contribution from recent small acquisitions. The sales effort was
exceptional as three of the biggest branches went through major changes during the year.

Margins were maintained, despite pressures in Foodservice. As expected, expenses increased as new branches bedded in.
Payroll costs were well contained.

Strong bases have now been established in Australia's most densely populated cities - Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane 
- creating platforms for long-term gains, and this is already showing benefits.

Foodservice performed reasonably well. The number of Foodservice branches rose to 40, all of which were profitable.
Melbourne's branches made outstanding gains in the throes of their restructure. The alcohol category was rolled out 
to Foodservice branches. Freetrade sales again grew.

Supply Solutions made big progress. New product development was the key feature of the year with over 100 new product
lines introduced.

Fresh sales fell, but margins were well managed. Meat continues to gain traction as we refine our route-to-market
model. Overall both the Fresh and Meat divisions were profitable, but still not at desired levels. The new Festival
acquisition performed below expectation and will improve in the future once fully integrated.

New Zealand did well to grow revenue and trading profit in a sluggish market. Spending on new distribution centres to
handle continued growth added to the cost base and the business's biggest branch - Auckland Foodservice - had a tough
year.

Foodservice performed solidly and Imports put in another stellar performance. Hamilton moved to a new distribution
centre, as did Nelson, Timaru and Invercargill.

Fresh had a challenging year as extreme weather conditions disrupted supply and impacted pricing. Processing results
were mixed. Newly acquired Prepared Foods failed to meet initial expectations and additional investment was required.

United Kingdom
The UK businesses did well, with the Foodservice business achieving excellent results. Revenue grew 6,4% to 
R31,4 billion (2017: R29,5 billion). Trading profit increased by 8,6% to R1,4 billion (2017: R1,3 billion). 
The core Foodservice and Fresh businesses are in good condition and well positioned for future growth.

Bidfood UK achieved growth in revenue and trading profit despite low consumer demand and restaurant closures. 
National Account margins strengthened and freetrade sales showed continued growth. Own brands and specialist pillar 
range sales gained further momentum - all indicators that strategic goals are being achieved.

Sales pressures sharpened in the third quarter as business and consumer sentiment hit a low ebb. Customer confidence
returned in the fourth quarter and sales picked up. Margins overall were well managed. Overheads were higher than
expected as labour costs rose and the national driver shortage persisted. Overtime became a significant item at 
some depots, driven by higher freetrade activity levels.

New trading depots bedded down in Royton and Penrith. Specialist operations performed well, except the Channel Islands
business which is taking a little longer to restructure than anticipated.

Customer migration to the latest version of the online ""Bidfood Direct"" platform was completed.

Fresh performed below expectations. However, a platform for renewed growth has been laid.

Challenges related to the move of the Hensons meat business from the ageing site in King's Cross, London, to a
purpose-built facility in Woolwich. Some customers were lost and staff left. A new team and new processes are 
revitalising the business in the new facility.

At Seafood, timely succession planning resulted in the deployment of a new management team at Daily Fish. Average
sales to independents rose and customer numbers increased.

Oliver Kay, the fresh fruit and vegetables business, opened a new depot in Birmingham designed to improve customer
service and reduce cost inefficiencies. Scotland operations derived knock-on benefits and Campbells Produce staged 
an impressive turnaround.

In PCL, management has dedicated significant effort to improve service levels. However, profitability has been
impacted. Discussions are underway with the client in order to match activity and service level expectations with 
profitable returns.

Europe
Europe was the standout performer this year, as the economies generally delivered continued growth. Revenue rose 
21,8% to R39,2 billion (2017: R32,2 billion) while trading profit rose 37,7% to R1,6 billion (2017: R1,2 billion). 
Investment made in prior years established a strong foundation on which we capitalised in improved market 
conditions.

Netherlands optimised a strong finish to the year. Rising revenue and trading profits were assisted by the first
contribution of the small bolt-on acquisition, Van de Mheen. The deal was finalised in March.

The National Accounts business grew and regional horeca sales rose strongly. As anticipated, Catering volumes were
under pressure. Institutional sales fell on the prior year. However, within the hospitality sector, pleasing growth 
in independent volumes was secured. The ongoing simplification processes in the business continue to deliver the 
desired benefits.

Belgium delivered its best ever results. Revenue and trading profit exceeded expectations while margins were well
protected and cash generation was strong.

The horeca and institutional channels did especially well. Contributions from Catering and Logistics were marginally
below expectations.

The online ""My BidOne"" platform, implemented at Makady and Langens, had a positive impact on the wholesale horeca
business. Initial work has begun on the planned merger of the Limburg-based businesses, Makady and Langens. 
Improvements continue at Bestfood (acquired in 2016).

DAC Italy achieved strong growth in revenue and trading profit, with a positive contribution from new acquisition,
D&D. Pleasing momentum was evident in the core DAC business. Quartiglia Food Service, acquired in the previous year, 
met expectations. Trading profits still topped projections, even without the D&D contribution.

Work to integrate D&D into the DAC systems will begin early in the new period.

Sales into the street or independent channel now account for more than 80% of volumes. Product sales to DAC's
international trading markets (including other Bidfood companies) gained momentum, with own-brands accounting for 
a significant part of the total mix.

Iberia developed momentum as the Guzman business created a platform for strategic growth. Revenue and trading profits
were bolstered by contributions from new acquisitions, Frustock (our operation in Portugal) and Saenz Horeca (a meat 
and hospitality specialist). Continued political uncertainty in and around Barcelona affected sales in this important
region. Costs increased as systems, sales force and infrastructure were strengthened. Though overall results were below
expectations, the base is now set for future growth.

Growth of independent business was an important feature of the year. The Barcelona warehouse was expanded and the
sales force beefed up. Frustock performed in line with expectations.

Czech Republic and Slovakia performed excellently, securing good profit and volume growth on the back of a buoyant
consumer market.

Horeca Gastro benefited from positive consumer sentiment and the middle-class trend to increased out-of-home eating.
Quality service underpinned continued growth. Good spring and summer weather drove strong ice cream sales, 
contributing to the excellent results.

Retail was buoyed by rising consumer incomes and growing focus on quality and reputable brands. Growth was achieved 
in many value-add products as market demand rose and shopping at upmarket malls became part of the lifestyle. Sales 
of fresh fish and meat exceeded expectations.

Output at the factories was consistently high. Highest production was achieved in Sous-Vide lines, ready meals, red
meat and ice cream.

Germany recorded a small loss. Sales at the recently acquired business failed to meet expectations. Margins were
impacted by high levels of operational expenses at the branches and the poor quality of some National Account 
businesses.

Hamburg depot moved into a new warehouse in April and Munich will move to a new warehouse in the new period. 
Vienna maintained solid margin management and performed well. We are setting up a solid foundation in Germany 
to facilitate further expansion in due course.

Poland delivered substantial revenue growth. Market share improved and profit forecasts were exceeded.

Freetrade growth continued at a high rate, now accounting for more than 70% of all volumes. We have become one 
of the major players in this market. Margins were well managed as terms were revised on some National Accounts.

Expansion of the Gdansk and Poznan operations were completed.

Innovation continues. Asian cuisine is a growth area and Farutex has begun to serve this sector. Early results 
are encouraging. Online capability has the potential to drive further sales gains while investment in warehousing 
creates the capacity to pursue ongoing growth.

Pressure on the wage bill persists as a result of low unemployment levels.

Baltics showed continued improvement. Revenue at the now-profitable Lithuanian operations continues to rise. 
Latvia did well off the back of sales growth and improved expense control. Performance improvements across the 
Baltic markets are driven by growing foodservice volumes. Work to implement ecommerce solutions has begun.

Emerging Markets
Emerging Markets delivered a mixed bag of results in uncertain economic environments. On a like-for-like basis 
(50% of South Africa's bakery business was sold in April 2017) these businesses continue to deliver commendable 
results. Revenue dropped 3,1% to R18,7 billion (2017: R19,3 billion) and trading profit fell 6,7% to R1,0 billion 
(2017: R1,1 billion).

Bidcorp Food Africa (BFA) delivered good results in tough economic conditions. Margin and expense management was
excellent, with overall expenses growth well below inflation. Trading profit rose despite deflation in Bidfood (BF) 
and some parts of Chipkins Puratos (CP).

South Africa's listeriosis crisis had material effects on Crown Food Group (CFG). BF was impacted to a lesser extent.

BF delivered excellent results. First contribution of newly acquired fruit and veg distributor, Famous Fresh, was
recorded from February. Sales into the independent channel continued to grow. National Accounts business declined 
marginally while business with industrial caterers ticked higher. Online orders via the ""myBidfood"" platform account 
for more than 60% of revenue.

CFG's results were impacted by the listeriosis outbreak, with ingredients for processed meat products hard hit. The lost
sales impact was material while stock on hand rose, impacting working capital. CFG entered the wholesale channel to
support its brands and own manufactured products. The ""Crown 247"" ecommerce platform was implemented.

CP made excellent progress. Introductions of its unique brands began in January. Changes to manufacturing processes
are under way. Upskilling continues and the Puratos influence is starting to manifest itself in terms of quality and
innovation.

Greater China saw profits dip, impacted by a tough second half. Sales were up on prior year, but lagged expectations.

Hong Kong failed to meet budget, hit by a slowdown in the foodservice market and the global dairy crisis. Fierce
competition at the upper end of the market created added pressure.

Him Kee dry goods did relatively well. A good performance at Miumi, the Japanese foods specialist, was underpinned 
by increasing sales of frozen fish products.

Our new seafood business, Linson Global Seafood Trading, did well. Macau was impacted by price cutting by market
entrants. Hong Kong plans a series of new brand introductions in the new period.

Mainland China recorded a fall in sales and experienced strong margin pressure. Competition in the dairy category 
was intense. Work continued on the development of the product mix and brand portfolio. To reduce dependence on dairy, 
major subsidiaries in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou redoubled efforts to build sales across a broader product range.

Renewed growth will be sought through strong focus on hotels and restaurants, meat imports and the provision of
chilled and processed meats to the foodservice channel. A strong sales push is planned in second-tier cities such 
as Shandong, Qingdao, Nanjing, Yunnan, Xiamen, Nanning and Jilin.

Singapore secured continued improvements in revenue and trading profit. Foodservice again grew sales and margins were
well managed. Sales at the Miumi division grew strongly. The marine, international trading and consumer operations were
under pressure, though a consumer turnaround was evident following new brand introductions. Gourmet Partner sales rose
and Food Pride surpassed expectation. Bidfood Malaysia (formerly Aeroshield) performed in line with budget.

Brazil secured revenue growth on the prior year, but volumes fell short of plan. Margins were under pressure in
challenging socio-political conditions. However, profits were maintained. Fourth quarter results were impacted by 
World Cup soccer (which kept patrons out of restaurants) and a nationwide truck strike.

Work has begun to standardise systems used by the core Irmaos Avelino business and Mariusso, the distribution business
acquired in the previous period.

Chile performed strongly. Revenue growth was highly satisfactory. Launch of the Viña del Mar branch boosted volumes.
The processed meat and particularly the seafood category showed good growth, though at lower margins. Internal controls
and debtor collections improved. Late in the year, the ""myBidfood"" ecommerce platform was launched. Continued sales
growth is projected.

Middle East achieved second-half gains following the implementation of a recovery plan, with sales approaching the
levels of the prior year. Margin improved and steps to contain expenses proved successful. Horeca UAE faced sales
challenges as several poor performing brands were discontinued. Al Diyafa, Saudi Arabia, delivered good revenue and 
trading profit growth. Horeca, Oman, recorded consistent growth and Bahrain's results were outstanding. Early progress 
by Horeca Jordan was encouraging.

Aktaes Turkey registered further sales gains and the level of loss was contained. Distribution costs rose on the back
of the weak Turkish lira. The purchase of the Efe distribution firm in Izmir and its nine-month contribution helped
Aktaes maintain momentum. Despite economic and political uncertainty, management remain optimistic about local market
prospects.

Corporate
Bidfood Procurement Community (BPC) sales rose and ever closer collaboration with Group operations led to new buying
opportunities. Seafood category development continued.

Change in directorate
Mr S Koseff, an independent non-executive director, assumed the role of chairman of the board on March 31  2018. 
Mr B Joffe remains on the board as a non-executive director. The board expresses its sincere appreciation to Mr Joffe 
for his services as chairman, particularly in leading the formation of Bidcorp, as well as its JSE listing on 
May 30  2016, which were critical development phases for the Group.

The board welcomes Mr Koseff to the role of chairman and looks forward to the benefits of his extensive business
experience and acknowledged leadership record.

Basis of presentation of summary consolidated financial statements
The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements 
for preliminary reports, and the requirement of the Companies Act of South Africa applicable to summary financial 
statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework 
concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting 
Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council, and to also, as a minimum, contain the 
information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements from which the summary financial statements were derived are in terms 
of IFRS. The Group adopted the amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IAS 12 Income Taxes during the 
year. The adoption of these amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies and had no 
effect on the results of the Group. Other than the adopted amendments above, the accounting policies are 
consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual 
financial statements. There was no significant impact from the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
from Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as at July 1  2018. Therefore, no transition adjustments 
have been processed to retained earnings.            

Audit report
These summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30  2018 have been audited by KPMG Inc, 
who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor expressed an unmodified opinion on the annual consolidated 
financial statements from which these summary consolidated financial statements were derived. 

A copy of the auditor's report on the summary consolidated financial statements and of the auditor's report on the
annual consolidated financial statements are available for inspection at the company's registered office, together 
with the financial statements identified in the respective auditor's reports.

The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this announcement.
Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's 
engagement they should obtain a copy of the auditor's report together with the accompanying financial information 
from the issuer's registered office.

Preparer of the financial statements
These summary consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CAM Bishop CA(SA), under the supervision 
of DE Cleasby CA(SA) and were approved by the board of directors on August 21  2018.

The directors are responsible for the preparation of the preliminary report and the correct extraction of the
financial information from the financial statements.

Subsequent events
There have been no material events subsequent to June 30  2018.

Acquisition of businesses and subsidiaries
Acquisitions
The Group made a number of small acquisitions during the year, namely:
- Festival City Food & Wine (Australia)
- Goldline Distributors Proprietary Limited (Australia) 
- Pier 7 Holding GmbH (Germany) 
- Frustock Foodservice, S.A. (Portugal) 
- Carnicas Saez, S.L. (Spain) 
- Jilin Food Service Limited (Mainland China) 
- Linson Global Seafood Trading Limited (Hong Kong) 
- D&D S.p.A. (Italy) 
- Van de Mheen Foodservices B.V. (Netherlands) 
- Prepared Produce (New Zealand) 
- Aeroshield (Malaysia) 
- Famous Fresh Holdings Proprietary Limited (South Africa)
- Efe Dagitim ve Pazarlama A.S. (Turkey)

These acquisitions form part of the Group's strategic expansion plans in the international foodservice industry.
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions as the anticipated value of future cash flows that were taken into account in 
determining the purchase consideration exceeded the net assets or net liabilities acquired at fair value. The 
acquisitions have enabled the Group to expand its range of complementary products and services and, as a 
consequence, has broadened the Group's base in the market place.

There were no significant contingent liabilities identified in the businesses acquired.

The acquisitions increased the Group's revenue by R3,3 billion, and its trading profit by R22,5 million. 
If these acquisitions had been effective on July 1  2017, the total contribution to revenue would have 
been R4,6 billion and an increase in trading profit of R56,9 million.

The impact of these acquisitions on the Group's results can be summarised as follows:
                                                                                           2018              2017

In December 2017, management committed to a plan to discontinue the UK Contract Distribution (CD) business. As a
result, this operation has been classified as a discontinued operation. 

CD was not previously classified as held-for-sale or as a discontinued operation. The comparative consolidated
statement of profit or loss and OCI has been re-presented to show the discontinued operation separately from 
continuing operations.

The relevant requirements of IFRS 5 have been met for this classification.

The results of the discontinued operation included in the Group's results for the year ended June 30, are detailed
below:

Financial instruments
Fair value hierarchy
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques categorised as follows:
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
  directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does not include 
fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount 
is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
Valuation technique
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDA, the amount to be paid
under each scenario and the probability of each scenario. The valuation models consider the present value of expected
payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 

Significant unobservable inputs
- EBITDA growth rates:           5% - 15% (2017: 10% - 23%)
- EBITDA multiples:              5,5x - 8,5x (2017: 4,8x - 7x)
- Risk-adjusted discount rate:   0,5% - 9,0% (2017: 1,99% - 5,0%)

Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if:
- the EBITDA was higher (lower); or
- the risk-adjusted discount rate were lower (higher).

Capital Markets Day – May 16 2018

Management update on general trading conditions

Shareholders are advised that the Bidcorp executive management are meeting
with members of the financial community (including shareholders, financial
analysts and the press), today May 16th 2018, for an update on current market
conditions and the trading environment across its international operations.

As announced in February 2018, Bidcorp took the decision to treat the UK
Logistics CD (“CD”) business segment as a discontinued operation. The
following update deals with the continuing and discontinued operations
separately.

Continuing operations:

Management comments as follows:

1. Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   -   Trading for the third quarter of the 2018 financial year has been positive
       (measured in home currencies), largely maintaining the earnings
       trajectory achieved in the first 6 months of the 2018 financial year.
       Performance achieved by our European businesses remains excellent.
   -   Currency volatility continues to impact Bidcorp’s rand translated results,
       with a negative constant currency impact of approximately 0,4% (to the
       end of March 2018) against the basket of currencies in which the Group
       trades.
   -   Trading conditions have seen increasing inflation in certain categories of
       products, particularly dairy and some wage cost pressure is evident in a
       few economies as unemployment levels fall.
   -   Fundamentals within the global foodservice industry remain positive and
       continued organic growth and bolt-on opportunities remain in all our
       operating geographical segments.
   -   Bidcorp remains focused on growth – organically in current markets, via
       in-territory bolt-on acquisitions to expand geographic reach and product
       ranges; and via strategic acquisitions as the Group enters new markets.
Australasia

   -   Bidfood Australia’s performance is in line with expectation as our
       major metro expansion gathers pace. The splitting of the Melbourne,
       Sydney and Brisbane / Gold Coast branches has created some cost
       pain and disruption but the quarterly profitability run rate is now
       positive in two of the 3 regions. Our focus with our recently acquired
       liquor wholesaler has been to grow into the branches. Supply
       Solutions (Imports) launched its cheese processing plant with
       immediate success. The fresh and meat businesses are showing
       improvement. A bolt-on foodservice business in regional Western
       Australia was acquired with effect from March 2018.
   -   New Zealand continues to perform well despite experiencing volatile
       pricing and availability of fresh produce, a tightening labour market
       and the costs of increased capacity. All segments of the business
       continue to develop profitably. Further capacity expansion is being
       planned.
   -   Further acquisition opportunities remain under consideration in both
       countries.

United Kingdom (“UK”)

   -   Bidfood UK continues to perform well despite a challenging 3rd
       quarter with unseasonal weather conditions, increasing stress in the
       business community and lower consumer confidence. Sales volumes
       continue to improve particularly in the independent and undisciplined
       multiple sectors. National account volumes have also grown. Internal
       business improvements continue to be implemented, particularly in
       the ecommerce arena. Further investment into increased capacity
       remains a key focus to cater for anticipated growth. Opportunities in
       relation to importing exclusive brands are being explored. Further
       acquisitions of niche independent foodservice businesses are under
       consideration. The 4th Quarter sales have rebounded strongly.
   -   Trading in Bidfresh has been a little disappointing in the 3 rd quarter
       as a depot move, seafood price volatility and poor cost management
       dampened profitability. The Fresh business has achieved a good
       national footprint across each of the Meat, Produce and Seafood
       segments however further focus is directed to building management
       capability in each of the pillars.

Europe

   -   Overall results from our European businesses have been pleasing.
       Strong like-for-like trading profit growth in constant FX, excluding
       positive effects of acquisitions, has been achieved. In particular, the
       performances of the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech & Slovakia,
       Poland and Italy are good.
   -   Netherlands delivered an improved performance, albeit off a low
       base. The business is making progress as the infrastructure
       reconfiguration and distribution rationalization projects start to benefit
    the overall cost base. Further benefits of range consolidation and IT
    simplification are anticipated in the medium term. A small bolt-on
    acquisition to complement the geographic footprint was completed in
    the 3rd quarter.
-   The Belgium performance is pleasing, delivering solid volume growth
    in its freetrade and institutional sectors. Depot consolidation has
    commenced between Bestfoods and Langens to achieve operational
    efficiencies in the infrastructure footprint. Private label opportunities
    in the freetrade segment are being explored. The myBidfood
    ecommerce platform implementation is underway.
-   Czech & Slovakia have continued to perform strongly across all
    segments of their business. Robust economic growth is driving low
    unemployment and higher wage costs. Higher consumer spending is
    boosting demand in the horeca and retail segments. Production
    facilities are operating at high capacities to meet demand. Further
    infrastructure investment in depots and production facilities is
    underway to bolster capacity.
-   Good organic growth in Poland has continued driven by focus on the
    freetrade sector. New depots in Gda?sk, Lublin and Pozna? have
    come on stream, boosting productive capacity. The current product
    range is being expanded to incorporate both Asian cuisine and liquor.
    Further margin enhancement continues to be achieved.
-   DAC Italy has delivered a solid performance in Q3 F2018 off the back
    of high business and consumer confidence. D&D, a horeca specialist,
    was acquired with effect from January 2018, broadening the
    geographic footprint. Global procurement benefits in Italian product
    (sourced/co-sourced from/with DAC Italy) are being achieved across
    the Group.
-   Bidfood Iberia comprises businesses in Spain and Portugal. Political
    disturbances in Catalonia have had a dampening effect on Guzman,
    particularly in Barcelona however consumer confidence is returning
    quickly. The acquisitions of a produce business in Portugal and meat
    business in Spain have settled in well and overall performance is in
    line with expectations. Significant internal focus is being directed to
    integrating our recent acquisitions and the new ERP implementation.
    Management remain confident about the potential opportunity in the
    Spanish market.
-   Our German and Austrian acquisition, made in July 2017, is
    strengthening its business foundation including sales structures, IT
    platforms, human capital and infrastructure. Germany represents a
    very large and developed foodservice opportunity.
-   The Baltics, with a focus on Lithuania, is now profitable. A new depot
    is under construction in Kaunas.
-   Further expansion, both in terms of in-country bolt-on acquisitions
    and strategic entry into new geographies in Europe, remains
    possible, as we are not represented or underrepresented in many
    countries.
Emerging markets

  -   South Africa has performed credibly in extremely tough operating
      conditions. Recent positive political developments have yet to
      translate into meaningful economic growth and improved consumer
      sentiment. Food inflation had declined markedly since the double-
      digit rate in 2017 resulting in a challenging trading environment in the
      Bidfood business. The listeriosis outbreak in the 3rd quarter impacted
      consumer confidence in chilled processed meats, impacting sales
      growth in the Crown Ingredients business. The Chipkins Puratos JV
      is performing well and developing new product offerings with the
      benefit of the Puratos influence.
  -   Within Greater China overall, performance has held up well despite
      the impacts of dairy market supply dislocation, margin pressures, the
      effects of a strong euro and rising operating and logistics costs. Hong
      Kong profitability remains hobbled by cost inefficiencies due to
      duplicate warehousing costs but management have plans to reduce
      this impact. In mainland China, our geographic expansion continues.
      Operations faced challenges with dairy supply and pricing however
      reliance as a category on lower margin dairy is diminishing overall as
      the product range grows. Structural supply chain changes resulted in
      some working capital absorption. A small foodservice acquisition has
      been made to complement the footprint. As the overall business
      grows, management structures are being reviewed.
  -   Singapore continues to make steady progress as we develop our
      foodservice model. Growth has been positive. Bidfood Malaysia,
      albeit small, is developing well.
  -   Further expansion into Asia always remains an opportunity. A joint
      venture in Vietnam is being pursued.
  -   In South America, management continues to focus on building a
      strong growth platform in a region with significant potential. Our
      Brazilian business has delivered a solid performance in a tough
      foodservice market. Investment continues to enable the development
      of their broadline product range. Bolt-on opportunities continue to be
      explored. Chile is performing to expectation, with a focus on product
      range extension with further expansion of its geographic footprint
      planned.
  -   In the Middle East, our business in the UAE has underperformed
      affected by lower tourism impacted from the geopolitical challenges,
      lower oil prices and new consumer taxes in the region. Our Saudi
      operation has performed well, buoyed by structural reforms and less
      impacted by regional geopolitical issues. Our investment in Jordan
      has commenced.

2. Acquisitive activity

      -   In Q3 F2018, we have made the following bolt-on acquisitions costing
          (exclusive of acquisition costs) in aggregate R318 million:
              o We acquired 70% of D&D, a broadline distributor operating in
                 Italy.
              o Bidfood SA acquired 70% of a fresh produce distributor.
              o Angliss Greater China acquired 60% of a foodservice
                 distributor.
              o In Australia, we acquired 100% of a broadline distributor in
                 regional Western Australia.
      -   YTD F2018, we have spent in aggregate (exclusive of acquisition
          costs) R906 million on new territory and bolt-on acquisitions.
      -   Management remains highly motivated and alert to all acquisition
          opportunities that present themselves both in current markets and in
          new territories.

Discontinued operation:

Trading performance in CD has been poor as corrective action to downscale
our exposure is being undertaken. Significant restructuring was implemented
following the exit of the KFC contract on February 14th 2018. However, a portion
of the contract was awarded back to CD effective end March. Negotiations for
the sale of the business are progressing positively.

Our strategic vision 
Management is focused on growth opportunities; organically in our current markets through attaining the appropriate
business mix by selling more products to our existing customers and gaining new customers; via in-territory bolt-on
acquisitions to expand our geographic reach and expanding our product ranges; and via larger acquisitions to enter 
new markets. Despite our appetite for acquisitions, we remain disciplined in our approach to accessing the ""right” 
opportunities.
 
Bidcorp's entrepreneurial and decentralised business model, the depth and experience of our management teams and 
the strength of the Group's culture has set up the Group for sustained growth in the future.

Comment
Bidcorp’s foodservice operations performed in line with expectations delivering pleasing results for the half-year ended 
December 31  2017. Headline earnings per share from the foodservice businesses (HEPS) increased by 8,6% to 640,0 cents per 
share (H1F2017: 589,3 cents) with basic earnings per share from the foodservice businesses (EPS) increasing by 9,4% to 644,5 
cents per share (H1F2017: 589,3 cents).

Trading conditions across all the geographies in which the Group operates remained positive. Most businesses in the 
portfolio improved their performance in home currencies against a backdrop of low inflation and mediocre economic growth. 
However, in certain categories of products, particularly dairy, rampant price increases marginally impacted gross margins. 
Planned investments in new capacity, particularly in Australia, has created some short-term underperformance but strategic 
medium-term prospects remain exciting.

Our strategic focus of growing our independent customer base in our respective markets has driven organic growth and a few 
bolt-on acquisitions have been concluded in the period to broaden our product range and geographic extension.

As previously outlined, our low margin logistics activities globally have been identified as not fitting into Bidcorp’s strategic 
plan in the medium term and thus non-core. We have received a credible and realistic commercial offer for the UK Contract 
Distribution (CD) business which we are actively pursuing. In December 2017, Bidcorp took a decision to treat the CD segment 
of UK Logistics as a discontinued operation.

Distribution
Bidcorp has declared an interim cash dividend of 280,0 cents per share, a 12,0% increase on the F2017 interim dividend.

Financial overview
The financial comment is based on the continuing operations of the Group.

Net revenue of R61,5 billion (H1F2017: R57,1 billion) grew by 7,7% (constant currency growth of 8,3%) reflecting our focus 
in the core foodservice markets in all geographies. Despite significant inflation in certain categories of products, largely 
dairy, overall food inflation across the basket remained relatively benign demonstrating real growth in market share across 
all operations. The exit of some low margin business in various geographies is still reflected in the comparative base.
 
Gross profit percentage was maintained at 23,6% (H1F2017: 23,8%). Certain businesses sacrificed margin to grow their free 
trade volumes and some inflation in the dairy category was absorbed. Operating expenses remained well controlled, increasing 
3,6% like-for-like in absolute terms despite ongoing wage pressure in a number of economies. The overall cost of doing business 
declined to 18,7% (H1F2017: 18,9%) despite higher sales and distribution activity reflecting ongoing efficiency gains.

Group trading profit increased by 8,9% to R3,0 billion (H1F2017: R2,8 billion) and the trading margin was constant at 4,9%.

Share-based payment costs increased to R53,5 million (H1F2017: R45,0 million) reflecting the anticipated costs of long-term 
employee incentivisation across the Group. Acquisition costs of R14,6 million (H1F2017: R14,0 million) were incurred in bringing 
the various bolt-on acquisitions to fruition. The contribution of the various acquisitions in the period to the overall Group 
profitability has been minimal, however these businesses assist in building our scale.

Net finance charges are 16,6% higher at R136,5 million (H1F2017: R117,0 million). Cash generation from operations remains 
robust but has been impacted by greater utilisation of working capital typical of the first half of the financial year. Working 
capital has been generally well managed but reflects higher activity levels, structural investment and tighter supplier terms in 
Greater China, some strategic stocking, and impacts from recent acquisitions. Bidcorp remains well capitalised, with trading 
profit interest cover at 22,1 times (H1F2017: 23,8 times). We retain adequate headroom for further organic and acquisitive growth, 
however remain conscious of the need to balance debt capacity and shareholder returns.

The Group’s financial position remains strong, a positive attribute in volatile global markets. Total fixed assets have grown in 
home currencies reflecting both replacement and significant expansionary capital expenditure. Net debt is R3,4 billion which 
reflects the impacts of ongoing investment and acquisitions.

Cash generated by operations before working capital absorption was R3,5 billion and monthly average net working capital days 
increased to nine days (H1F2017: five days). Free cash flow (excluding dividends paid) was negative at R0,9 billion after 
investment activities absorbed R1,6 billion. 

Acquisitions
In July 2017, 70% of Pier 7 Foods, a small foodservice business based in Munich, Germany, was acquired incorporating five 
locations within Germany and one in Austria. In addition, a niche Portuguese horeca business was also acquired and integrated 
into Bidfood Iberia.

The Group also concluded smaller bolt-on acquisitions in Australia, Spain, New Zealand and Turkey. Total investment in 
acquisitions was R588,2 million, the benefits of which will be evident in the medium term as we extract synergies and 
efficiencies. 

Prospects
We are confident that our strategy of developing our capability to become an on-demand high service business focused on 
customer satisfaction continues to deliver strong growth. Our ability to handle the ‘last mile’ delivery over a complicated 
product range improves continually as we roll out our infrastructure programme. Our focus is ‘all about the food’ as we 
move towards achieving the correct customer mix. Our value-add proposition is driven by our people’s desire to deliver 
excellent customer service.

Fresh produce, meat, value-add processing and procurement initiatives remain areas of future potential, all of which will 
assist in growing the basket. The regular sharing of the best Bidcorp practices and innovations across the Group ensures 
that speed of business development is greatly enhanced, often avoiding costly mistakes.

Our investment in digital interaction with our customers is being leveraged off our ability to intelligently interpret our 
significant data sets. The development of BidOne, our bespoke global ecommerce and CRM platform, continues ensuring our 
best worldwide innovations are leveraged for the greater benefit of the Group. 

Bidcorp strategically remains focused on growth opportunities; organically in our current markets through attaining the 
appropriate business and customer mix by selling more products and gaining new customers; via in-territory bolt-on acquisitions 
to expand our geographic reach and expanding our product ranges; and via strategic acquisitions to enter new markets. We remain 
disciplined in our approach to accessing the “right” opportunities, despite our appetite and capacity for acquisitions. 
The timing of investments either into capacity creation or acquisition opportunities is often difficult to predict. However, we 
retain significant financial headroom and the ability to act quickly to accommodate any feasible possibilities, either organic 
or acquisitive.

Our financial position is strong and cash generation is expected to remain robust. Currency volatility in the global environment 
is a given, however, our objective remains to generate above average returns in each of our businesses in their home markets.
Bidcorp’s strength lies in the depth and experience of our management teams who thrive in an entrepreneurial and decentralised 
business model, a recipe we believe positions the Group well for continued growth in future. 

In the short term, we believe the challenges of infrastructural investment in Australia and dairy pricing volatility particularly 
in Asia will favourably resolve themselves. In the medium term, the fundamental drivers of the global foodservice industry will
remain positive in our markets. Bidcorp anticipates continued real growth in the period ahead.

Divisional performance

Australasia
The region continues to make a substantial contribution and remains the biggest profit generator. Revenue moved 3,6% higher to 
R15,9 billion (H1F2017: R15,3 billion). Trading profit rose marginally by 0,1% to R944,9 million (H1F2017: R943,6 million).

Australia’s first-half focus was on investing in the future and its strategy of creating more warehouses across smaller, manageable 
operations in its major metropolitan areas that provide exceptional service to foodservice customers. In AUD, revenue rose 4,6%. 
However, due to the expected lag between additional expenses and additional revenue, operating expenses went up 9,3%. Overall 
progress was highly satisfactory for a business that recently opened three additional metro sites in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. 

Foodservice division had been trading at peak, an effort that could only be sustained with renewed investment. Change implementation 
at scale without losing customers was testament to the strength of the business and the excellent work of all involved.

Supply Chain Solutions division continues to perform well and remains an important part of future growth plans. Fresh and Meat 
continue to make progress, albeit behind expectations. 

New Zealand put in a strong second-quarter performance, offsetting a slow start to the half-year. Performance was driven by 
steady revenue growth, supplemented by ongoing focus on imports and margin management.

Trading conditions remained challenging in the core foodservice business. Revenue growth in NZD was pleasing at 7,9%, but price 
resistance kept margins in check. A tight labour market saw the cost of doing business rise slightly. However, a focus on supply 
chain efficiencies underpinned a solid trading result. Five new or upgraded distribution centres came on stream.

Fresh performance was impacted by an extremely wet winter followed by a summer drought, restricting opportunities to trade and 
manage margins. Processing put in a pleasing second-quarter performance, despite significant internal reorganisation to 
facilitate future growth requirements. 

United Kingdom (UK)
Revenue rose 5,3% to R16,2 billion (H1F2017: R15,4 billion) while trading profit increased by 3,4% to R723,9 million 
(H1F2017: R699,8 million).

Bidfood UK traded well thanks to continued focus on free trade growth, national margin enhancement and cost reductions. 
Trading profit exceeded expectation despite once-off costs and a bad debt write-off. Free trade volume growth of nearly 8% was 
achieved, accompanied by a little gross margin dilution. National accounts volumes were up 3% on ongoing tender wins and renewals. 
Overall costs were well managed and our business simplification programme gained traction.

In PCL, service levels improved but further operating efficiencies are required.

Fresh trading profit declined by 5%, though Seafood made pleasing gains. Improved Seafood revenues were underpinned by tight cost 
control and rigorous margin management. Produce was impacted by duplicate handling and trunking costs, lower revenue and margins. 
The opening of the Birmingham depot will alleviate some inefficiencies caused by the rapid expansion of Oliver Kay. Meat division 
performed poorly, largely due to Hensons, which was impacted by staff losses ahead of the impending move to the new depot in 
Woolwich. The focus on independent growth continues throughout the division.

Europe
Most businesses performed strongly, particularly the eastern European jurisdictions which continued to report good growth. 
Revenue rose 20,0% to R19,6 million (H1F2017: R16,3 million) while trading profit rose 38,7% to R817,0 million 
(H1F2017: R589,0 million).

Netherlands put in a highly satisfactory trading performance. Sales volumes were ahead of expectation, driven by strong growth 
in the national accounts segment. Free trade horeca business showed good volume growth of 5%, despite strong competition. 
As expected, institutional and catering volumes were down, but ahead of budget. The healthcare category retained customers, 
but overall faces strong pressure. Promising growth was seen into the free trade hospitality channel. Further internal 
reorganisation occurred as we continue to simplify the business to improve profitability.

Belgium’s revenue growth continued to beat expectations and trading profit growth was pleasing. Expenses were in line 
with activity levels while gross margin held up well. The catering segment maintained volumes in the face of pressure, 
while the horeca and institutional channels exceeded budget. The 'My BidOne' ecommerce platform was successfully introduced.

Iberia (Guzman Spain and Portugal) delivered lower than expected trading profit - in part affected by Catalonia's political
uncertainty and consequent economic slowdown. Significant internal reorganisation, including IT upgrades, is under way to better 
align processes to the customer focus. Some small branches faced challenges. Gross margins improved and cost control was effective. 
Implementation of the Bidfood Iberia strategy continued. Recent bolt-on acquisitions (Frustock and Carnicas Saez) confirmed the 
potential for broader geographical growth. We remain enthusiastic about the Iberian market.

DAC Italy put in a pleasing performance, reflecting positive contributions from DAC and Quartiglia. Revenue and trading profit 
were ahead of the comparative period. Growth continued in the independent segment, in line with long-term strategy. Sales to 
other Bidcorp companies rose by 41%, spotlighting the appeal of the ‘Made-in-Italy’ product proposition. A further bolt-on 
opportunity was concluded early in January, adding to the geographical footprint across Italy.

Czech Republic and Slovakia put in an excellent first-half trading performance. Volumes exceeded budget across both the Czech 
and Slovakian operations, though rising personnel and production costs created challenges. The business optimised the trend to 
added-value products in the restaurant channel. Continued penetration of butcheries and baker’s shops was evident. Production 
volumes grew.

Poland performed strongly. Good volume growth was driven by continued penetration of the free trade channel. As a result, gross 
margin showed improvement. Cost controls were stepped up. Lublin branch moved to a new depot. The Gdansk depot expansion programme 
is complete and expansion work at the Poznan site is nearing completion.

Baltics moved into profit, buoyed by revenue growth and reduced losses in Latvia and Estonia. Lithuanian operations performed 
strongly. A new, modern depot is under construction in Lithuania in order to alleviate capacity constraints.

Germany/Austria (Pier 7 Foods) performed reasonably in its first six months within the Bidcorp stable, and is profitable. This 
small acquisition is the first building block of a larger play in the German market, which is dominated by a few very large 
players, but also has a highly fragmented base of smaller to medium size foodservice wholesalers with a profile similar to ours. 

Emerging Markets
These businesses felt the impact of the many varied economic and political challenges facing these developing regions. In 
April 2017, 50% of our Baking Supplies business was sold to Puratos NV, renamed Chipkins Puratos and equity accounted thereafter. 
Although revenue dropped 2,3% to R9,8 billion (H1F2017: R10,0 billion), with trading profit down 0,4% at R581,3 million 
(H1F2017: R583,8 million) on a like-for-like basis, revenue and trading profit were up 7,1% and 9,3% respectively.

Bidcorp Food Africa delivered revenue and trading profit growth in tough trading conditions. Focused expense management 
underpinned gains. Bidfood performed strongly, securing continued independent channel growth and revenue increases in excess 
of inflation. Growth of Bidfood’s private and exclusive label range continues. To date, 58% of revenue is transacted via Bidfood’s 
ecommerce platform. Crown Food Group built momentum on manufacturing performance improvements. Competition remains significant 
in very tough market conditions. The Griffiths Crown JV had a short-term impact on Crown Ingredient Solutions as QSR customers 
were transferred to the new unit. The new Chipkins Puratos JV made excellent progress. Puratos’ knowledge and best practice 
are being implemented across the business. IT tools and collaborative systems continue to add value across the whole division.

Greater China grew overall revenue and trading profits, but was impacted by dairy market dislocation, pricing pressures, the 
effects of a strong euro and rising operating and logistics costs. The Hong Kong business was challenged by pricing pressures 
in the dairy category while poultry imports from Europe fell away due to avian flu. High warehousing costs negatively 
impacted profitability. Angliss Macau achieved pleasing growth in other categories, but failed to offset the decline in its 
dairy business. Operations in mainland China faced similar challenges as the previous undersupply of dairy products 
(and higher prices) was followed by oversupply. Reliance as a category on lower margin dairy is diminishing overall as the 
higher margin product range grows. Structural supply chain changes resulted in some working capital absorption. 

Singapore grew revenues and trading profit moved slightly higher. Margin pressure was offset by good cost control. 
Foodservice, now the largest division in the refocused business, continues to grow in the restaurant, hotel, pub, club and 
café segments. Bidfood Malaysia made its first contribution following the acquisition of Aeroshield’s Malaysia business.

Chile delivered good revenue growth despite recessionary conditions. Trading profits were flat due to the initial costs of 
the introduction of seafood categories, excess product storage and the opening of the new Viña del Mar branch. Stepped-up 
credit controls drove working capital improvements. 

Brazil witnessed satisfactory revenue and trading profit growth as the economy showed tentative signs of recovery. Competition 
sharpened in the foodservice market. Unemployment remains high and some consumers are downtrading. Significant internal 
development of the business has been undertaken. Freezer construction began in the recently acquired Mariusso business 
to enable expansion of the range.

Middle East operations benefited from second-quarter revenue improvements, but the uptick could not offset an overall 
decline in trading profits to levels well below expectation. Geopolitical challenges contributed to a significant fall 
in UAE demand. Lower volumes necessitated changes to the brand basket. Saudi Arabia, less impacted by regional 
instability, showed good second-quarter growth as the economy diversifies away from oil revenues. Oman and Bahrain, 
both in early stages of development, made significant revenue gains.

Aktaes Turkey achieved pleasing revenue growth and the business moved back into profit. Margins were well managed, 
though distribution costs rose and the Turkish lire’s depreciation affected imported product costs. Hotels still face 
low occupancy rates, but the horeca market remained resilient. Acquisition of the EFE business, a local horeca-focused 
business, delivered the expected gains.

Discontinued operation

Logistics UK
As previously outlined, low margin logistics business’ globally have been identified as activities that fall outside 
Bidcorp’s strategic plan in the medium term. We have received a credible and realistic offer for the UK Logistics’ 
CD business, the consequence of which we are carefully evaluating in the best interests of all our stakeholders. 
In December 2017, Bidcorp took the decision to treat the CD business as a discontinued operation. 

Performance, as anticipated, was disappointing at CD which recorded losses. The Shared-User unit experienced falling 
volumes on the loss of a significant account in May 2017. A further contract (KFC) representing 30% of the overall 
volume exited on February 14  2018. Operations will be significantly downscaled thereafter, the costs of which in 
relation to people, property and vehicles will be expensed in the second half of the financial year.

Directorate
Mr Brian Joffe will retire from the Bidcorp chairmanship on March 31  2018, but remains on as a non-executive director. 
Mr Stephen Koseff, currently an independent non-executive director, has agreed to accept the board’s invitation to 
assume the role of independent non-executive chairman, effective March 31  2018.

The board expresses its sincere appreciation to Mr Joffe for his services as chairman, particularly in leading the 
formation of Bidcorp, as well as its JSE listing on May 30  2016, which were critical development phases for the Group.

Basis of presentation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the JSE Limited 
Listings Requirements for interim reports, and the requirement of the Companies Act of South Africa applicable 
for condensed interim consolidated financial statements. The Listings Requirements require interim reports to 
be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the 
Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards 
Council, and include disclosure as required by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting and the Companies Act of 
South Africa. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial 
statements from which the condensed interim consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS 
and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual 
financial statements.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Acquisitions
Bidcorp acquired 70% of Pier 7 Foods, a small foodservice business based in Germany and Austria, a niche Portuguese
horeca business was integrated into Bidfood Iberia and bolt-on acquisitions were completed in Australia, Spain, 
New Zealand and Turkey. Total investment in acquisitions was R588,2 million, and their contribution to revenue 
and trading profit for the half-year ended December 31  2017 was R1,2 billion and R33,5 million respectively.

Financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques categorised as follows.
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
           directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does not 
include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the 
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Valuation technique
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDAs, the amount to 
be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario. The valuation models consider the present value 
of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 

Significant unobservable inputs
- EBITDA growth rates            10% - 23% (2016: 10% - 23%)
- EBITDA multiples               4,8x - 7x (2016: 4,8x - 7x)
- Risk-adjusted discount rate    1,99% - 5,00% (2016: 1,99% - 5,00%)

Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if:
- the EBITDA were higher (lower); or
- the risk-adjusted discount rate were lower (higher).

Discontinued operation
In December 2017, management committed to a plan to discontinue the Logistics CD business segment which operates 
in the United Kingdom. Efforts to dispose of this operation have started and a sale is expected by December 2018. 
As a result, this operation has been classified as a discontinued operation. 

The Logistics CD segment was not previously classified as held-for-sale or as a discontinued operation. The
comparative consolidated statement of profit or loss, statement of cash flows and segmental analysis have been 
restated to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.

The relevant requirements of IFRS 5 have been met for this classification. 

The results of the discontinued operation included in the Group's results for the period ending 
December 31  2017, are detailed below:

* Refer to 'Preparation and results' note

Preparation and results
These half-year ended December 31 results have not been audited or reviewed by the Group's auditors. The condensed
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CAM Bishop (CA)SA, under the supervision of DE Cleasby
CA(SA), and were approved by the board of directors on February 20 2018.

The audit and risk committee engaged KPMG Inc., to review the previously audited June 30  2017 consolidated statement
of profit or loss, consolidated statement of cash flows and segmental analysis which have been re-presented as a result
of classifying CD business as a discontinued operation in the 2018 interim period, together with the related notes.
Re-presented special purpose financial statements (""special purpose financial statements”) containing the re-presented
consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of cash flows, segmental analysis, and related notes, 
were reviewed by KPMG for this purpose. KPMG Inc. expressed an unmodified conclusion on these special purpose financial
statements. A copy of the special purpose financial statements, together with KPMG Inc.'s review report is available 
for inspection at the Company's registered office.

As a result of this review, the June 30  2017 consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement 
of cash flows and segmental analysis, and related notes have been described as  ""reviewed” in the interim 
financial statements contained herein. It should be noted that KPMG Inc.'s review report on this matter draws 
attention to the basis of preparation contained in the special purpose financial statements, which describes how
they were prepared. The review report also notes that the special purpose financial statements were prepared to 
provide information to the audit and risk committee. As a result, the special purpose financial statements may 
not be suitable for another purpose. The conclusion reached by KPMG Inc. is not modified in respect of this matter.

This review did not cover the entire set of interim financial statements, and for this reason the interim financial
statements should not be regarded as reviewed by KPMG Inc.

Capital Markets Day – November 13 2017

Management update on general trading conditions


Shareholders are advised that the executive management of the group are
meeting with members of the financial community, today November 13th 2017,
including shareholders, financial analysts and the press, for an update on
current market conditions and the trading environment across its international
operations.

Management comments as follows:

1. Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   -   Trading for the first quarter of the 2018 financial year has been
       reasonably positive (measured in home currencies) in the core
       foodservice businesses. Corrective management attention to down
       scale our exposure in the non-core Logistics business in the UK is
       underway, but trading performance in that business remains poor. These
       results are however not material in the context of the overall underlying
       core operations of the group. Currency volatility continues to impact
       Bidcorp’s rand translated results, with a negative constant currency
       impact of approximately 2,0% (to the end of October 2017) against the
       basket of currencies in which the group trades.
   -   Fundamentals within the global foodservice industry remain positive and
       continued organic growth and bolt on opportunities remain in all our
       operating geographical segments.
   -   Our performance has been achieved against a backdrop of increasing
       inflation in certain categories of products, particularly dairy. Wage cost
       pressure is evident in a number of economies as unemployment levels
       fall.
   -   Our strategic plan to rebalance customer portfolios by focusing on the
       correct segments of the markets, and on adding value to our customer
       offering through innovation and service delivery, is on track.

   Australasia

       -   In Australia, performance is in line with expectation in the broadline
           foodservice business as our major metro expansion project rolls out.
           The splitting of the Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane / Gold Coast
           branches has created some short-term cost pain but will be positive
      in the years ahead. The fresh and meat operations remain
      challenging. Our product range has been expanded with the
      acquisition of a liquor wholesaler. The exit of our low margin contracts
      is nearing completion, with a A$75m exit planned for March 2018.
  -   New Zealand is experiencing a tougher trading environment however
      has again delivered very solid results. The business is in good shape,
      with all segments of the business performing well. Significant
      investments are being made into capacity expansion.
  -   Further bolt-on acquisition opportunities remain under consideration
      in both countries.

United Kingdom (“UK”)

  -   Some 15 months post the referendum to leave the EU (Brexit) and
      the subsequent sterling devaluation, the overall the economy in the
      United Kingdom continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Overall
      inflation has ticked up to nearly 3%, the food component of which has
      been substantially passed onto our market. Unfortunately, there is a
      sense of pessimism and lack of confidence generally emerging in the
      economy.
  -   The foodservice business continues to perform well, growing sales
      strongly but selectively in both the independent sector as well as the
      national accounts segment. The internal transformation process
      undertaken over the past 3 years is driving the businesses success.
      Further investment into increased capacity is underway to capture
      anticipated growth opportunities ahead.
  -   The Fresh business strategy of building out a national presence
      across Meat, Produce and Seafood continues with the immediate
      focus having been on strengthening management in each of the
      pillars. Fresh products by nature are more volatile in terms of pricing
      and demand. Trading has been a little disappointing in the quarter
      (mainly in September and further in October) and dampened the
      growth trajectory in the short term.
  -   Although the Logistics business performance remains disappointing,
      our new management are getting to grips with the scale back plan.
      The operations have been segmented into three distinctive areas of
      which the shared user business remains of greatest concern.
      Management are making progress in improving underlying results,
      the key area being the control of costs. The strategic options for this
      non-core business remain under consideration. This will remain a
      work in progress for a few years due to the nature of the underlying
      contracts.

Europe

  -   Eastern Europe remains particularly buoyant in terms of economic
      growth. Western and central Europe are seeing growth, however at
      lower rates than eastern Europe. Results for the first quarter out of
      our Czech, Slovakian, Polish and Italian businesses are pleasing.
  -   Netherlands delivered an improved performance as the business
      continues to make steady but slow progress in transforming the
      shape of the business to a more entrepreneurial and horeca focus.
      Management attention is trying to match the infrastructure and cost
      base with the revenue opportunity, removing the complexity of
      operations. This remains a medium-term outcome.
  -   The Belgium performance is pleasing, delivering solid growth in its
      horeca market while maintaining an even keel in its institutional
      exposure. The recent Bestfoods bolt-on acquisition has turned the
      corner and is solidly headed into profitability. Preliminary
      investigations are being made into another acquisition.
  -   Czech and Slovakia have continued to perform strongly across all
      segments of their foodservice business. Good economic growth in
      the region is creating wage pressures and lack of staff availability.
      Further infrastructure investment is underway to bolster capacity.
  -   Good organic growth has continued in Poland as the benefits of their
      infrastructural investment manifest in productive capacity. Our
      business is well positioned to enhance margin capability.
  -   DAC Italy has delivered a solid performance in Q1 2018 driven by a
      bumper summer season, benefitting the independent sector of the
      market. Management remain confident growth will continue. Further
      bolt-on acquisitions are being investigated in the highly fragmented
      market. Growth in global procurement benefits in Italian product
      (sourced from DAC) are being achieved across the group.
  -   Guzman in Spain, acquired in April 2017, has settled in well and we
      are satisfied with overall performance. Significant internal change
      from integrating our existing business, a new ERP implementation to
      the acquisitions of a Produce business in Portugal and meat business
      in Spain have kept management busy. Management remain
      confident about the potential for Spain, notwithstanding the potential
      impacts of the political risks, which has been disruptive to trading
      recently
  -   In the Baltics, further good progress has been made and the business
      in now profitable.
  -   Our German and Austrian acquisition made in July has performed
      well, and presents us with a solid platform on which to grow in this
      very large and developed foodservice market.
  -   Further expansion into the European region, both in terms of in-
      country bolt on acquisitions and strategic entry into new geographies,
      remains possible, as we are not represented or underrepresented in
      many countries.


Emerging markets

  -   South Africa has delivered solid results in extremely tough operating
      conditions, low GDP growth and negative consumer sentiment. Sales
      growth particularly in Crown Ingredients businesses has been
      challenging. The Chipkins Puratos JV is performing well and starting
         to benefit from the Puratos technical influence. Innovation and
         energised management teams are contributing to moving the
         businesses forward. Trading into sub Saharan Africa, now being
         driven from within each business segment, is starting to receive more
         management attention.
     -   Within Greater China, our Hong Kong business is suffering from cost
         inefficiencies due to duplicate warehousing costs despite the move
         to a new facility in June. In mainland China, our business continues
         to show strong growth as our geographic expansion continues with a
         focus on selling branded products to western styled food outlets. The
         results are particularly good in Q1 due to the effects of the ‘dairy’
         crisis currently affecting many parts of the world. As the overall
         business grows, management structures are being bolstered.
     -   In Singapore, progress is steady but frustrating as we develop our
         foodservice model. The ‘dairy’ crisis and the challenges in the Marine
         business last financial year has negatively impacted Q1
         performance. A small acquisition has been concluded in Malaysia to
         bulk up our presence there.
     -   Further expansion into Asia always remains an opportunity as
         investment criteria become more investor friendly. Vietnam is being
         closely looked at.
     -   Despite ongoing political and economic challenges in South America,
         management continues to build a strong growth platform in a region
         with significant opportunities. In Brazil, our business has delivered a
         solid performance in a tough foodservice market. Bolt-on
         opportunities continue to be explored. Chile is delivering within
         expectation, reflecting the investments made into product range
         extension and its expanded national platform.
     -   In the Middle East, our business in the UAE has been negatively
         affected by lower tourism impacted from the geopolitical challenges,
         lower oil prices and new consumer taxes in the region. Focused
         management attention over cost control and asset management is
         underway. Our Saudi operations appear to have been less impacted
         by regional issues and has performed much better. Other regional
         expansion possibilities are being investigated, including Jordan.

2. General

     -   In Q1 2018, we have made the following new territory and bolt-on’s
         acquisitions costing (inclusive of acquisition costs) in aggregate
         R608 million:
            o We acquired 70% of Pier 7, a specialist broadline distributer
                operating in Germany and Austria.
            o We entered Portugal acquiring 70% of a Produce distributer.
            o We bolstered out exposure in Malaysia by acquiring a small
                bakery products wholesaler.
            o Guzman in Spain acquired 100% of a meat processor and
                wholesaler.
            o In Australia, we acquired 100% of a Liquor wholesaler in
                Adelaide, Melbourne & Darwin.
              o In New Zealand, we acquired a fresh produce value-add
                 business.
      -   Assuming they all perform as planned, the approximate annualised
          financial impact of these transactions (converting at current forex
          rates) would be EBITDA of R104 million (before one-off acquisition
          related costs).
      -   Management remains highly motivated and alert to all acquisition
          opportunities that present themselves both in current markets and in
          new territories.

Comment
Bidcorp has, in addition to its actual audited results, provided shareholders with pro forma financial 
information in relation to the comparative year-end due to the unbundling from The Bidvest Group Limited in 
May 2016, to enable a full appreciation of the true performance of the Group. The following comment is 
based on the comparison to that pro forma information.

Highlights
Bidcorp delivered very pleasing results for the year ended June 30  2017, albeit the true performance in 
home currencies was negatively impacted by rand strength across all major currencies. Headline earnings per share 
(HEPS) increased by 9,4% to 1 181,0 cents per share (PF2016: 1 080,0 cents) with basic earnings per share 
(EPS) increasing by 16,7% to 1 207,1 cents per share (PF2016: 1 034,0 cents). On a constant currency basis, 
excellent growth of 19,1% in HEPS was achieved, truly reflective of the strong performance of the businesses.

Our strategic focus of balancing the exposure between contract, national and independent customers in the 
respective markets has driven gross and trading margin improvements, despite generally very low inflation 
environments and stable but subdued economic growth. Every business in the portfolio improved its performance 
in home currencies with the exception of Aktaes Turkey and Logistics UK. 

Our global rebranding exercise trading as ""Bidfood"" has been embraced by the businesses, reinforcing our 
credentials as  ""value-add food people"" in our first full year as a separate entity.

Distribution
In accordance with its dividend policy, Bidcorp has declared a final cash dividend of 250,0 cents per share.

Financial overview
Net revenue of R130,9 billion (PF2016: R140,5 billion) declined by 6,8% in part due to the currency impacts 
as well as the deliberate and planned exit of some low margin business in various geographies, which still 
reflect in the comparative base. Constant currency net revenue growth of 4,6% was achieved, reflecting our 
focus in the core foodservice markets in all geographies.

Gross profit percentage increased to 21,7% (PF2016: 20,8%) reflecting the benefit of trading with the correct
mix of business. Operating expenses remained well controlled, decreasing 4,9% in absolute terms despite wage 
pressure in a number of growing economies and higher sales and distribution costs reflecting higher activity 
levels.

Group trading profit increased by 6,9% to R5,5 billion (PF2016: R5,1 billion) and the trading margin improved to 
4,2% (PF2016: 3,7%).

Share-based payment costs increased to R97,6 million (PF2016: R64,0 million), the annual costs of long-term employee
incentivisation across the Group. Acquisition costs of R46,1 million (PF2016: R8,9 million) were incurred in bringing 
the various acquisitions to fruition. Although their contribution to the overall Group profitability has been limited 
to date, these businesses will assist in building our global presence going forward.

Net finance charges are 25,6% lower at R219,2 million (PF2016: R294,6 million) assisted by some deleveraging and lower
interest rates. Cash generation has been solid despite greater utilisation of working capital, impacted by higher
activity levels, some strategic stocking, tighter supplier terms and impacts from a Logistics UK contract unwind. Bidcorp
remains well capitalised, with trading profit interest cover at 25,1 times (PF2016: 17,5 times). We remain conservative 
in our approach to gearing and retain adequate headroom for further organic and acquisitive growth.

The Group's financial position remains strong. Total fixed assets have grown in home currencies reflecting replacement
and expansionary capital expenditure. Net debt is R1,7 billion which is at the same level as June 30  2016 despite
significant ongoing investment and acquisitions.

Cash generated by operations before working capital absorption was robust at R6,2 billion, net working capital days
was seven days and investment activities consumed R2,2 billion. Free cash flow (excluding dividends paid) was positive 
at R1,7 billion.

Acquisitions and disposals
The acquisition of 90% of Guzmán Gastronomía and Cuttings (Guzmán), a leading national Spanish multi-temperature
foodservice company supplying hotels, restaurants, industrial caterers and other institutions, was completed with 
effect from April 2017 for an enterprise value of €75 million (R1,1 billion). 

The Group also concluded a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions in Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Italy and UK
totalling R590,4 million. Disposal of investments totalled R670,4 million. 

Bidcorp concluded an agreement with Puratos Group NV (Puratos) which enabled Puratos to acquire joint control of our
South African-based Bakery Supplies business. Strategically the transaction will enable the business to develop new
products using international innovation for the baking industry. The transaction completed in April 2017.

Post-year-end, an acquisition was completed of 70% of Pier 7 Foods, a small foodservice business based in Munich,
Germany, incorporating five locations within Germany and one in Austria. In addition, an acquisition of a niche 
Portuguese horeca business was also completed.

Prospects
Our businesses worldwide will continue to focus on balancing their exposure between contract, national and independent
customers in their respective markets. The sharing of best practice across the Group and inter-divisional cooperation
spanning marketing and procurement ensures that speed of business development is greatly enhanced, often avoiding costly
mistakes. Innovative digital interaction with our customers and global procurement opportunities continue to gain
traction as part of our value-add service to grow market share.

Management remain focused on growth opportunities; organically in our current markets through attaining the
appropriate business mix by selling more products to our existing customers and gaining new customers; via in territory 
bolt-on acquisitions to expand our geographic reach and expanding our product ranges; and via larger acquisitions to
enter new markets. Despite our appetite for acquisitions, we remain disciplined in our approach to accessing the 
""right"" opportunities. Fresh produce, meat categories, value-add processing and procurement initiatives are areas of 
unexploited potential in many regions.

Bidcorp's entrepreneurial and decentralised business model, the depth and experience of our management teams and the
strength of the Group's culture has set up the Group for sustained growth in the future. Our financial position is 
strong and cash generation is expected to remain robust. Investment into capacity creation in many markets is growing. 
The timing of acquisitions is difficult to predict however we retain significant financial headroom and the ability 
to act quickly to accommodate expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic.

Currency volatility in the global environment is likely to continue. However, fundamental to management is our ability
continue to generate above average returns in each of our businesses in their home markets. Returns on funds employed
remains the key measure of performance across all businesses.

Despite persistent low inflation, pedestrian economic growth and low interest rates, we expect fundamentals in the
global foodservice industry to remain positive. Bidcorp anticipates being able to leverage off these conditions in 
its respective markets and anticipates continued real growth in the year ahead.

Divisional performance
Australasia
Revenue fell following strategic exit of low-margin contracts by 2,9% to R29,4 billion (PF2016: R30,3 billion).
Trading profit rose 9,8% to R2,0 billion (PF2016: R1,8 billion) - a 12,0% increase in constant currency terms. 
Results reflect successful strategic focus on freetrade and management determination to keep it ""all about the food"".

Australia reported a great finish to the year, taking trading profit higher. Net revenue fell following continued exit
of low-margin logistics business. Overall margins rose.

Freetrade sales rose a pleasing 5%, driven higher by hard-working sales teams and focused initiatives.

The exit of some logistics contracts led to the closure of two sites. Adelaide branch relocated to a new,
purpose-built facility. The Perth Fresh business was consolidated into the Perth Logistics site. New branches opened 
in Yatala (Queensland), Port Melbourne and Truganina (Victoria). Sydney Support office moved to a new facility in 
Botany that will also operate as a foodservice branch.

Small, bolt-on foodservice acquisitions were made in Launceston (Tasmania), Cairns (Queensland) and in Port
Macquarie (NSW). 

The Foodservice division put in another strong performance, despite increasingly intense competition as new players
enter this market. 

We now have 36 foodservice operations. Perth put in a particularly strong performance. Further foodservice growth is
projected, with the new branches positioned to contribute fully to continued momentum.

Imports division had a great year. The pace of new product development was maintained and the home-brand basket grew.

Fresh had a better year and returned a meaningful trading profit. Competition is intense, but a base on which to build
has now been established.

Classic Meats showed pleasing trading profit growth, though some was attributable to the reallocation of meat sales
from Brisbane Foodservice to Classic Meats Brisbane. Continued organic and acquisitive growth is planned.

Only one standalone logistics business remains (in Perth). Rebalancing of the customer portfolio is substantially
complete. 

Across the Australian business, significant progress was made with the strategy of creating a sustainable base that
will foster continued freetrade growth.

New Zealand delivered a strong fourth quarter. Most business units secured double-digit profit growth. Margins were
well protected, resulting in improved profitability in all divisions. 

Gains were underpinned by a strong Foodservice performance. This division recorded 10% sales growth and benefited 
from improved buying and margin management. Imports had an outstanding year. Freetrade remained the key Foodservice 
focus area, though contract retention contributed to overall performance. 

Fresh performed strongly, expenses were well controlled and margins were well protected.

The Logistics division was bolstered by a good result at Auckland and an excellent one at the Christchurch branch.

Processing put in a stellar performance. 

United Kingdom
Revenue fell 18,0% to R50,0 billion (PF2016: R61,0 billion). Excluding the effects of a strengthening rand, 
revenue grew 1,9%. Trading profit decreased by 9,6% to R1,3 billion (PF2016: R1,4 billion). Excluding the currency 
effects, profitability was up 12,4%.

Bidfood UK delivered pleasing trading performance underpinned by an excellent fourth quarter. Trading profit 
was up strongly and exceeded expectations, though overall sales growth was constrained by the strategic exit 
of a number of large, unprofitable contracts. Freetrade volume growth of 8% was achieved.

Margins were well managed and expenses contained. Cash flow remained robust and investment continued. 
Fleet vehicle renewal was a focus area. Rebranding to Bidfood was warmly received.

The freetrade sales mix showed continued improvement. National account margins were well managed while significant 
new contracts supported fourth quarter volumes.

Own-brand growth was strong.

IT infrastructure moved in-house and the transfer of data centre hosting to a new service provider was completed.
Migration of eCommerce solutions was finalised early in the new period. All IT activity proceeded to plan without 
business disruption. 

The specialist focus areas of wine and meat achieved pleasing volume and profit gains.

Across the wider business, ongoing growth is projected.

Fresh results saw good revenue growth with only a small growth in profit. Performance was assisted by the 
acquisition of R Noone & Son, a Manchester fresh produce supplier to the catering industry, and Wynne-Williams, 
a butchery business based in Flint, Wales. Both performed as expected post-acquisition.

Product cost inflation impacted margins while management consciously sacrificed some margin to maintain volumes.
Significant increases in wages, insurance and IT costs were experienced.

The seafood businesses experienced pressure on revenue and margin, but recovered well in the final quarter. 
Produce businesses had stable results while meat businesses experienced mixed results.

Logistics performance continued to disappoint, with trading profit well down. A marginal improvement in sales was
achieved. Margins remained under pressure as QSR deliveries fell below expectation and the business exited a 
major QSR account. In PCL247 Transport, sales and margins moved lower as the number of routes fell by 23%. 
As a consequence of lower activity, Trafford Park distribution centre will close. Associated costs have been 
accrued accordingly.

Significant effort and costs were expended in resolving previously reported management irregularities. These
irregularities remain the subject of ongoing legal processes. Management has impaired the goodwill associated 
with the PCL247 Transport business by £9 million (R155,1 million). 

Logistics remains a non-core activity and management remains committed to finding a viable solution for the 
future of the business.

Europe
Revenue rose 4,0% to R32,2 billion (PF2016: R31,0 billion) while trading profit rose 11,5% to R1,2 billion (PF2016:
R1,1 billion). In constant currency terms, trading profit rose 20,5%. Eastern European businesses continued to deliver
good growth, bolstered by buoyant economic conditions.

Netherlands' trading profit and revenue met expectation. Performance was driven by a strong hospitality sector
showing. In the national accounts, institutional and catering channels, sales and margins were under pressure.

Freetrade within the hotel, restaurant and catering channels has become a significant driver of the business.
Rebranding as Bidfood was successfully launched.

Belgium teams optimised sales opportunities. Trading profit was also above budget. Margin pressure persisted, but was
generally well managed. Cash generated from operations was up significantly due to good working capital management.

Revenue growth was driven by a strong horeca performance, assisted by the contribution of Bestfood, whose acquisition
was completed in September 2016.

The institutional wholesale business exceeded expectations, boosted from October by a new contract win. Logistics
sales were also above expectation. Numerous contract renewals were achieved.

The Bidfood identity was successfully implemented. 

Spain's newly acquired Guzmán (April 2017) witnessed pleasing gains in the independent sector in both Madrid and
Barcelona. Gross margins were impacted by product price increases caused by frosts during the early part of the 
calendar year. Bidfood Spain just failed to meet its objective of breaking even by year-end as mainland sales 
stalled in the last two months of the year. Integration of Bidfood Spain into Guzmán is a priority in the 
coming year.

DAC Italy's trading profit exceeded budget and sales growth occurred in all categories - ambient, frozen, 
chilled and non-food.

Strong growth was maintained in the independent/street channel, which now represents 81% of sales volumes. 
Own-brand growth continued, as did export sales.

Sales to Bidcorp group companies increased substantially. Cash from operations showed good improvement.

Newly acquired Quartiglia Food Service performed in line with expectations.

Czech Republic and Slovakia Bidfood teams put in another strong performance. Revenue and trading profit were 
well up. June was one of the best trading months on record, with pleasing growth in ice cream volumes and 
value-added products.

High productivity levels were achieved at our factories (ice cream, Sous-Vide meat, ready meals, red meat and
vegetables). Frozen fish processing capacity was increased.

Sales into the retail channel were pleasing, particularly in the fresh produce, red meat and frozen bakery product
segments. Export volumes - notably meat and game - also moved higher. Good demand was seen from both EU and non-EU
countries.

Return on funds employed achieved pleasing improvement.

Farutex Poland recorded excellent increases in sales volumes. Trading profit also exceeded expectations.

Particularly pleasing growth was achieved in the freetrade market. Sales of fresh produce and meat were 
particularly strong. Volumes in the national accounts channel also rose.

Margins remained stable, cash generation from operations was strong and return on funds employed moved higher. 
Staff numbers rose to cater for higher growth. Cash generation was robust.

Relocation and expansion of the Lublin depot is complete.

Baltics revenue rose, though the business overall recorded a small loss. Restructure of Estonian operations is
underway to stem losses. The Lithuanian business is profitable. 

Emerging markets
These businesses continue to deliver commendable results. Revenue rose 5,9% to R19,3 billion (PF2016: R18,2 billion),
with trading profit up 18,1% at R1,1 billion (PF2016: R0,9 billion). Excluding currency effects, profitability is 
up 20,8%.

Bidcorp Food Africa (BFA) recorded excellent results. Net revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong penetration of
the independent channel by Bidfood (BF) and Crown Food Group (CFG). 

With effect from April 1  2017, 50% of Bakery Solutions was sold to Puratos, a global manufacturer of bakery and
confectionery ingredients. The company, renamed Chipkins Puratos (CP), was equity accounted post the sale.

BFA's focus on its own manufactured products yielded positive results. Cash from operations improved substantially.
Investment continued into delivery vehicles, manufacturing facilities and new distribution centres. IT investment 
is ongoing.

BF recorded excellent results, achieving the target of double-digit independent channel growth. BF's online ordering
platform, BFS247, continues to grow. Channel growth was assisted by increased private label product sales. National
accounts growth was also achieved, but challenges persisted in the industrial caterers' channel.

CFG's sales dipped marginally, though trading margin improved. Procurement savings were secured and a change in the
customer mix proved beneficial. 

At year-end, a joint venture agreement was finalised between CFG and Griffith Foods, a US-based supplier of
ingredients solutions.

CP put in a strong performance, driven by innovation and successful initiatives with own-manufactured products.

Greater China delivered a strong finish to the year. Substantial mainland contributions underpinned a highly
satisfactory performance, with trading profit well up. Double-digit revenue growth was broadly in line with 
expectation. Expenses remained high in an increasingly competitive market. Working capital was impacted by 
tighter supplier terms on imported products, longer lead times and revenue growth. 

Hong Kong revenue was well up, but trading profits failed to meet expectation.

Results were impacted by rising costs and the need for further warehouse investment. The Him Kee dry 
goods business delivered solid growth. Sales at the PastryGlobal bakery and confectionary 
business were constrained by delayed shipments from European suppliers, but the strong profit-line was 
maintained.

Trading profit also exceeded budget at Gourmet Cuisine. Miumi, the Japanese foods business, witnessed continued 
growth of its Shabu Shabu line and frozen meat, frozen sashimi, meat and seafood. Natural and Organic Global 
gained further momentum.

Good sales of Ready-To-Eat processed products drove continued growth in Macau.

Mainland China achieved good volume growth in Shanghai driven by robust demand from hotels and restaurants,
particularly for dairy products. Beijing's pastry volumes showed good growth on strong demand for President 
products. Guangzhou put in another strong performance, bolstered by buoyant bakery and retail demand. Shenzhen 
enjoyed continued growth on the back of firm demand in the restaurant and foodservice channels. 

Singapore's trading profit and revenue growth continued as the company gained further traction following 
transition to a core foodservice focus. Foodservice achieved good growth in key customer categories such as 
restaurants, hotels, clubs, pubs and cafes. Pleasing growth was seen across beef, poultry and butchery lines.

Post-year-end, further investment was made into Malaysia through the acquisition of a majority stake in 
Aeroshield, a distributor of chocolate, pastry and bakery products.

Brazil achieved excellent revenue and trading profit growth, assisted by the acquisition of Mariusso, 
a foodservice distributor based in greater São Paulo.

The core business, Irmãos Avelino, achieved strong sales momentum.

Chilean business registered pleasing trading profit and revenue growth. Overall margins were well managed. 
Santiago foodservice branch sales were especially strong. Puerto Montt branch volumes rose, but were below 
expectation.

Concepción branch volumes doubled from a low base, following the launch of a local branch and acquisition 
of a small foodservice distributor.

Middle East division performed well, improving both revenue and trading profit significantly. Sales were up, 
gross margins improved and expense control was good.

Revenue ticked higher at Horeca UAE, but failed to reach anticipated levels. In Saudi Arabia, Al Difaya's revenue 
was below expectation, but up on prior year. Margins were well managed and trading profit improved. Horeca Oman 
recorded excellent sales. Performance was driven by a new brand introduction and growth of the customer base. 
Horeca Bahrain grew on the back of aggressive promotional activity. Beverage marketing benefited from 
collaboration with Al Difaya. 

Aktaes Turkey grew revenue, but trading losses persisted. Operating expenses rose, but were broadly in line 
with forecasts. A distribution agreement was signed with Campari. Acquisition of an Izmir-based foodservice 
distribution company is nearing completion.

Corporate
Bidfood Procurement Community (BPC) results were satisfactory. UK and European purchasing opportunities are now
pursued by a dedicated BPC staff member. The supplier and product ranges continue to broaden.

Basis of preparation of summary consolidated financial statements

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, and the requirement of the Companies Act of South Africa applicable to
summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with 
the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial 
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and to also, as a minimum, contain the 
information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements from which the summary financial statements were derived are in terms of IFRS 
and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous consolidated annual 
financial statements.

Audit report
These summary consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30  2017 have been audited by KPMG Inc, who
expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified opinion on the annual consolidated
financial statements from which these summary consolidated financial statements were derived. 

A copy of the auditor's report on the summary consolidated financial statements and of the auditor's report on the
annual consolidated financial statements are available for inspection at the Company's registered office, together 
with the financial statements identified in the respective auditor's reports.

The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this announcement.
Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's 
engagement they should obtain a copy of the auditor's report together with the accompanying financial announcement 
from the issuer's registered office.

Preparer of the financial statements
These summary consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CAM Bishop CA(SA), under the supervision of 
DE Cleasby CA(SA) and were approved by the board of directors on August 23  2017.

The directors are responsible for the preparation of the preliminary report and the correct extraction of the
financial information from the financial statements.

Subsequent events
Subsequent to year-end, management has been through a legal mediation process with the perpetrators of the 
Logistics UK irregularities. Bidcorp management remains optimistic that, pursuant to legal action and insurance 
claims, potential recoveries arising from the management irregularities will be forthcoming. 

Other than the legal matter disclosed above, no other material subsequent events have arisen since June 30  2017 
to the date of this announcement.

Acquisitions
Bidcorp acquired 90% of the issued share capital of Guzmán for an enterprise value of €75 million (R1,1 billion), 
the effective date of this acquisition was April 1  2017.

Other than the Guzmán acquisition, the Group made a number of small acquisitions during the year namely Bestfood NV
(Belgium), BFS Port Macquarie Proprietary Limited (Australia), Central Choices Foods Proprietary Limited (Australia),
Hanlon's Smokehouse Dublin Limited (Ireland), Mariusso Comércio De Alimentos E Representação Limitada (Brazil), Quartiglia
Food Service Spa (Italy), R Noone & Son Limited (England), Wyn Lee Holdings Limited (England) and Wynne-Williams (Flint)
Limited (England). 

These acquisitions form part of the Group's strategic expansion plans in the international foodservice industry.
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions as the anticipated value of future cash flows that were taken into account in 
determining the purchase consideration exceeded the net assets acquired at fair value. There were no significant 
contingent liabilities identified in the businesses acquired.

The acquisitions have enabled the Group to expand its range of complementary products and services and, as a
consequence, has broadened the Group's base in its marketplace.

For Guzmán and the other acquisitions the Group's revenue for the year was enhanced by R2,1 billion, and its trading
profit by R69,5 million. If these acquisitions had been effective on July 1  2016, the total contribution to 
revenue would have been R3,6 billion and an increase in trading profit by R139,6 million.

Disposals
Effective April 1  2017, Bidcorp Food Africa Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of Bid Corporation Limited, signed
agreements with Puratos Group NV (Puratos) whereby Puratos became an equal shareholder in Bidcorp Food's Bakery 
Solutions Division (subsequently named Chipkins Puratos (CP)). CP manufactures and supplies bakery ingredients to 
industrial bakers, the craft market and large retailers under the Chipkins and NCP brands in South Africa. 

The transaction provides CP with an opportunity to grow its existing business and to develop new products and
tailor-made solutions for the South African baking industry. Planned investment in new product categories and 
technology are very exciting and offer opportunities and development experiences to management and staff. 

The following table summarises the net assets acquired/disposed and liabilities assumed/disposed which have been
included in these results from the respective acquisitions and disposals.

The Group has commitments at June 30 of approved contracted capital expenditure of R675,2 million (2016: R568,7 million) and 
not contracted for capital expenditure of R873,5 million (2016: R939,4 million). It is anticipated that capital expenditure 
will be financed out of existing cash resources.


Financial instruments
Fair value hierarchy
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques categorised as follows:
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
           either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does not 
include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the 
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
Valuation technique
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDA, the amount to be 
paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario. The valuation models consider the present value of 
expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.

Significant unobservable inputs
- EBITDA growth rates             10% - 23% (2016: 10% - 23%)
- EBITDA multiples:               4,8x - 7x (2016: 4,8x - 7x)
- Risk-adjusted discount rate:    1,99% - 5,0% (2016: 1,99% - 5,0%)

Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if:
- the EBITDA were higher (lower); or
- the risk-adjusted discount rate were lower (higher).

Capital Markets Day – May 17 2017

Management update on general trading conditions

Shareholders are advised that the executive management of the group are meeting with
members of the financial community, today May 17 2017, including shareholders and
financial analysts, for an update on current market conditions and the trading
environment across its international operations.

Management comments as follows:

1. Current trading performance and overall market conditions

   -     Trading within Bidcorp for the first 9 months of the financial year 2017 has been
         positive and the momentum achieved in the 6 months to December 2016
         (measured in home currencies) has continued. Currency volatility continues to
         impact Bidcorp’s rand results, with the rand having appreciated against both the
         euro and sterling.
   -     Overall, fundamentals within the global foodservice industry remain positive and
         continued organic growth opportunities remain in all our operating geographies.
   -     Our performance has been achieved against a backdrop of very low food inflation
         in most operating geographies.
   -     Our focus on executing on the strategic plan to rebalance customer portfolios by
         focusing on the correct segments of the markets, and on adding value to their
         customer offering through innovation and service delivery, is yielding the desired
         results.

   1.1       United Kingdom (“UK”)

         -   Overall the economy in the UK is growing and the sterling devaluation
             following the referendum to leave the EU (Brexit) has increased activity levels
             in the foodservice market, benefitting from more tourists and local consumer
             spending. Inflation has started to tick up which should be positive for our UK
             businesses.
         -   The foodservice business continues to perform very well benefitting from
             targeting the correct customer base and its internal business transformation
             process. Additional investment into further capacity is being considered to
          capture anticipated growth opportunities ahead. To date the effects of Brexit
          haven’t had any negative impact on the business.
      -   The Fresh business has been impacted by price volatility, particularly in
          seafood products, which has dampened its growth trajectory in the short
          term. The strategy of building out a national presence across Meat, Produce
          and Seafood continues. A meat business was acquired in the 3rd quarter to
          continue to expand our presence.
      -   The Logistics business performance, a marginal profit contributor to the
          aggregated UK results, remains disappointing. Management are making
          progress in improving underlying results. The future strategic options for the
          business remain under consideration.

1.2       Europe

      -   Eastern Europe is experiencing good growth, significantly higher than
          western European growth, which is benefiting our Czech, Slovakian and Polish
          businesses.
      -   Our Netherlands business continues to make steady progress in transitioning
          its focus to the core horeca customer segment. Significant focus is being
          directed at matching the infrastructure and cost base with the revenue
          opportunity, however this remains a medium-term outcome.
      -   The Belgium business is performing well, delivering good growth in its horeca
          market while maintaining an even keel in its institutional exposure. Special
          management attention is being directed at bedding down the recent
          Bestfoods bolt-on acquisition.
      -   Czech and Slovakia have continued to performed exceptionally well driven by
          solid growth across all segments of their foodservice business. Further
          infrastructure investment is planned to bolster capacity. Good organic growth
          has continued in Poland as the benefits of their infrastructural investment
          manifest in productive capacity.
      -   DAC Italy has delivered a solid performance in the 9 months to date driven by
          strong growth in the independent sector of the market. The integration of
          Quartiglia, a bolt-on acquisition made in July 2017, continues. Growth in
          global procurement benefits in Italian product (sourced from DAC) are being
          achieved across the group.
      -   To date, the contribution from our Spanish business has been small. The
          recent acquisition of Guzman will bolster our opportunities in this attractive
          foodservice market.
      -   Further expansion into the European region, both in terms of in-country bolt-
          on acquisitions and strategic entry into new geographies, will be explored as
          we are not represented or underrepresented in many countries.

1.3       Australasia

       -   In Australia, both the broadline foodservice business and fresh and meat
          operations have maintained their growth momentum in the first three
          quarters of F2017. The exit of those targeted low margin contracts is
             substantially complete. Our major metro-expansion project continues to gain
             traction.
         -   New Zealand has again delivered very solid results, with all segments of the
             business performing well, despite capacity constrained economic activity
             levels.
         -   Further bolt-on acquisitions are being explored in both countries to sustain
             growth.

   1.4       Emerging markets

         -   South Africa has produced excellent results, contrary to the generally tough
             operating conditions, low GDP growth and negative political sentiment.
             Innovation, new contract gains and energised teams have all contributed to
             the improved result. Our focus on Africa is now being driven from within each
             business segment.
         -   Within Greater China, Hong Kong is slowly improving as tourism activity picks
             up. Our business is doing well despite inefficiencies due to duplicate
             warehousing costs. Our move to a new facility in June will alleviate these
             issues. In mainland China, our business continues to show strong growth as
             our geographic expansion continues. The focus on selling branded products
             to western styled food outlets continues. The region remains a good growth
             opportunity with a middle-class population driving ‘eating out of home’
             demand.
         -   In Singapore, steady improvement continues as we develop our foodservice
             model. New management have settled in well. A small acquisition is being
             concluded in Malaysia to bulk up our presence there.
         -   Further expansion into Asia remains an opportunity as investment conditions
             become more user friendly.
         -   In South America, despite challenging political and economic conditions,
             management continue to build a strong growth platform in a region with
             significant opportunities. In Brazil, our business has weathered the crisis and
             is performing much better. Bolt-on opportunities continue to be pursued,
             both in Sao Paulo and the Rio de Janeiro regions. Chile is delivering very solid
             growth, benefitting from its foodservice focus and expanded national
             platform.
         -   Middle East is showing pleasing results despite the geopolitical challenges,
             lower oil prices and higher taxes in the region. Focused management
             attention on its larger businesses in UAE and Saudi are delivering desired
             results.

2. General

   -     Bidcorp’s global rebranding exercise as ‘Bidfood’ should be substantially
         complete by June. It has brought a lot of energy and passion to the group and
         enabled us to promote our image as ‘value add foodie people’ It has also
         promoted more collaboration between our businesses in terms of marketing
         strategy.
   -   To December 2016, we had invested R496 million on bolt-on acquisitions, in Q3
       we have acquired the following bolt-on’s, costing in aggregate R134 million:
           o In Fresh UK, we acquired 100% of a meat distributor
           o In Australia, we acquired 100% of a distributor in Cairns.
   -   Assuming they both perform as planned, the approximate annualised financial
       impact of these transactions (converting at current forex rates) would be EBITDA
       of R23,4 million.
   -   50% of our Bakery business in South Africa was sold to Puratos NV with effect
       from April, the business will be equity accounted in Bidcorp going forward.
   -   90% of Guzman in Spain was acquired with effect from early April.
   -   Further geographies are also under consideration.
   -   Management remains highly motivated and alert to all acquisition opportunities
       that present themselves both in current markets and in new territories.

Voluntary Announcement: Acquisition of Guzmán Gastronomía and Cuttings


Bidcorp is pleased to announce the acquisition of 90% of Guzmán Gastronomía and Cuttings (“Guzmán”),
a leading national Spanish multi-temperature foodservice company supplying hotels, restaurants,
industrial caterers and other institutions throughout Spain (the “Acquisition”).

Guzmán is currently owned by Miura Private Equity and management. Management have agreed to retain
a 10% interest in Guzmán.

Founded more than 80 years ago, Guzmán specializes in the supply of fresh fruit and vegetables, and also
has an extensive range of gastronomic and value added products including salads, handcrafted bread and
sauces developed in conjunction with top local chefs. Serving more than 4,000 customers with approx.
2,200 deliveries per day, Guzmán has a national presence through its key operating platforms in
Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Bilbao, Alicante, Ibiza and Vitoria-Gasteiz. Guzmán employs over 540 people
and is managed by an experienced leadership team under the guidance of the CEO, Mr. Jordi Franch.
Guzmán’s revenues will be approx. EUR100m for the financial year ending December 31 2017.

The Acquisition is in line with Bidcorp’s strategy to expand its footprint into geographies, which offer solid
growth in the out of home foodservice market. Spain boasts a proud gastronomic heritage and the
Spanish foodservice market continues to demonstrate high growth potential buoyed by improved macro-
economic conditions, with a steady increase in foreign tourism numbers. The acquisition of Guzmán,
together with other opportunities in Spain and greater Iberia, will enable Bidcorp to position itself as one
of the leading foodservice companies in south-west Europe.

TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS OF BRIAN JOFFE FROM EXECUTIVE CHAIR TO NON-EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR OF THE BIDCORP GROUP

Since the unbundling of Bidcorp from The Bidvest Group Limited in May 2016, Brian Joffe (“Brian”)
has performed the transitional role of Executive Chairman of Bidcorp.

The Bidcorp Board and Brian have mutually agreed that as this task has now been achieved, Brian will,
effective June 30 2017, relinquish his position as Executive Chairman. Brian has agreed to continue, if
necessary, in a non-Executive Chairman role after this date, until the appropriate process for the
appointment of an Independent non-Executive Chairman has been completed. As soon as the
appointment of the new Chairman is finalised, Brian will then assume the role of a non-executive
director.

Bernard Berson will continue in his role as Group Chief Executive of Bidcorp.

The Board sincerely thanks Brian for his leadership and vision in the creation of Bidcorp in its new
identity and is delighted that Brian will continue his strong association with the Bidcorp Group in the
future.

Brian has informed the Board that he will be launching a new listed JSE investment vehicle which will
not focus on activities competitive with the current Bidcorp’s foodservice business.

The Board wishes him well in this new venture.

Note 2: Pro forma financial results of Bidcorp assume that all the assets (referred to in note 1) 
        transferred into Bidcorp by Bidvest as part of the internal restructuring prior to its 
        listing and unbundling had been part of Bidcorp for the full 2016 financial year.      

Comment
Bidcorp has, in addition to its actual results, provided shareholders with pro forma financial information 
in relation to the comparative half year end due to the unbundling from The Bidvest Group Limited in May 2016,
to enable a full appreciation of the true performance of the Group. The following comment is based on the 
comparison to that pro forma information.

Highlights
The Group delivered very pleasing results for the half year ended December 31 2016. Headline earnings 
per share (HEPS) increased by 20,3% to 600,3 cents per share (PF2015: 499,1 cents) with basic earnings 
per share (EPS) increasing by 20,7% to 600,3 cents per share (PF2015: 497,4 cents). 

Bidcorp's businesses continue to perform well across all geographies, driven by good organic growth in home 
currencies and benefiting from market share gains. Our strategic focus of balancing the exposure between 
contract, national and independent customers in the respective markets has driven margin improvement, despite 
generally very low inflation environments. Significant volatility across many major currencies, not only 
versus the rand, has not materially impacted our rand translated results in the period.

Bidcorp has commenced a global rebranding exercise trading as ""Bidfood"", which will reinforce our image 
as ""value-add food people” rather than logistics providers.

Distribution
In accordance with its dividend policy, Bidcorp has declared an interim cash dividend of 250,0 cents per share.

Financial overview
Overall net revenue of R67,8 billion (PF2015: R68,2 billion) was impacted by the ongoing deliberate and 
planned exit of some large contract business in various geographies, which still reflect to some extent in 
the comparative base. In the core foodservice businesses, solid revenue growth was achieved at improved 
margins in all geographies.

Gross profit percentage increased to 21,4% (PF2015: 20,2%) reflecting the benefit of focusing on the correct 
mix of business. Operating expenses remained well controlled, increasing 3,2% despite some wage pressure in 
a number of growing economies and higher sales and distribution costs reflecting higher activity levels.

Group trading profit increased by 15,7% to R2,8 billion (PF2015: R2,4 billion) and the trading margin improved 
to 4,2% (PF2015: 3,6%), a direct consequence of the operational focus to grow the independent trade and 
rebalance the customer portfolio.

Share-based payment costs of R46,5 million (PF2015: R51,8 million) reflect the costs of long-term incentivisation
across the Group, which remains a key performance driver.

Acquisition costs of R14,1 million (PF2015: R0,3 million) reflect some small bolt-on acquisition activity, the
benefits of which will manifest going forward.

Net finance charges are 24,4% lower at R118,5 million (PF2015: R156,8 million). Cash generation has been solid 
despite greater utilisation of working capital, typical of the normal absorption experienced in the first half 
of the financial year. Bidcorp remains well capitalised, with trading profit interest cover at 23,8 times 
(PF2015: 15,6 times). Where appropriate, funding has been renegotiated to avail ourselves of the current low 
interest rate environment. We remain conservative in our approach to gearing but ongoing work is being undertaken 
to create adequate capacity for organic and acquisitive growth.

The Group's financial position remains strong. Total assets have grown reflecting replacement and expansionary 
capital expenditure on fixed assets, and the higher trading activity in inventories and receivables. Net debt 
is R1,7 billion, the same level as June 30  2016 but significantly improved on the R4,3 billion at December 2015.

Cash generated by operations was robust, net working capital days increased to 3 days (June 2016: -1 day) 
and net investment activities consumed R608,8 million. Free cash flow was positive at R762,6 million.

Acquisitions 
There have been no material acquisitions in the period. However, a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions were
concluded in Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Italy and Fresh UK totalling R495,8 million.

Bidcorp has concluded an agreement which will enable Puratos Group NV to acquire joint control of our South
African-based Bakery Supplies business. The transaction will enable the business to develop new products 
using international innovation for the baking industry. The transaction is estimated to complete in April 2017.

Prospects
Our foodservice businesses worldwide are executing on the strategy of rebalancing the exposure between contract,
national and independent customers in their respective markets. We see our future as a ""foodservice"" provider, 
as opposed to a ""logistics"" operator. Innovative technology-based solutions for customers and global procurement 
opportunities continue to gain traction as part of our value-add service to grow market share. Fresh produce, 
Meat categories and Value Add Processing continue to be areas of unexploited potential in many regions.

Our financial position is strong, cash generation is expected to remain robust, and we retain significant 
headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic.

Management remains alert to opportunities; organically through a focus on the appropriate business mix and 
bolt-on acquisitions in territory to expand geographic reach and product range extension; and via larger 
acquisitions to enter new markets. Despite our appetite for acquisitions, we remain disciplined in our 
approach to accessing the ""right” opportunities.

Bidcorp's decentralised business model, the depth and experience of our entrepreneurial management team and the
strength of the Group's culture enables us to continue to drive above-average returns for our shareholders.

Management remain firmly of the view that over the medium term, overall returns on our internationally diversified 
businesses will far outstrip the negative effects of global volatility. Overall fundamentals in the global foodservice 
industry remain positive. Bidcorp will further leverage these conditions in its respective markets and anticipates 
continued real growth.

DIVISIONAL REVIEW
Australasia
The region continues to make a substantial contribution as the biggest profit generator. Revenue moved 
5,2% higher to R15,3 billion (PF2015: R14,6 billion). Trading profit rose 22,5% to R943,6 million 
(PF2015: R770,2 million). The successful strategy of bringing the ""food"" focus back into the businesses 
is reflected in these results.

Australia put in a strong first half. Total sales fell in line with the strategy of exiting logistics 
revenue while growing independent freetrade volumes through the Foodservice, Fresh and Meat divisions. 
Profit and margins rose, a commendable performance and an indication the long-term strategy is working.

Foodservice made an outstanding contribution. The number of branches rose to 33 following the acquisitions 
of Pye Providores (Port Macquarie) and Central Choice (Launceston). Branch network growth remains a focus area.

Imports division had a great six months, concentrating on new product development. Fresh is starting to 
fulfil its potential and delivered profit improvements. Meat made a small, opportunistic acquisition 
in Canberra.

New Zealand performance was buoyed by a positive macro-economic environment and the success of several 
initiatives, including the growth of the Processing and Imports divisions. Revenue and trading profit 
rose significantly.

Gains were driven by increased freetrade focus at branch level and supply chain efficiencies. Cash flow 
remained strong and returns rose substantially. Work continues on four new distribution facilities.

Foodservice performed strongly. The division's import capability became a source of competitive advantage. 
Fresh delivered excellent results, containing costs and protecting margins, and our Auckland business 
won a significant contract. Processing went from strength to strength.

Europe
The eastern European businesses delivered superior growth bolstering the results in this division. 
Revenue rose 12,5% to R16,3 billion (PF2015: R14,5 billion) while trading profit rose 27,0% to 
R589,0 million (PF2015: R463,6 million). 

The Netherlands business achieved revenue gains despite second quarter pressure. Trading profit growth 
was slightly below expectation as institutional sales volumes declined and catering volumes disappointed. 
A strong hospitality performance helped offset institutional and catering setbacks. National account business 
also grew. 

Belgium operations gained further traction. Revenue grew and trading profits rose. Catering remained 
under pressure, but Horeca, Institutional and Chain business exceeded expectation and the business remained 
strongly cash generative. The acquisition of Bestfood, a multi-temp Horeca wholesaler, was finalised. 
A significant institutional contract win was recorded late in the period.

DAC Italy registered strong trading profit and revenue growth that was substantially higher than prior year, 
notwithstanding the benefit of the acquisition of Quartiglia Food Service. Growth of the independent market 
continued and now represents about 75% of turnover. International revenue increased, boosted by sales to 
Bidcorp sister companies. Cash generation remains strong.

Czech and Slovakia secured pleasing growth despite the summer not being as favourable for ice cream sales 
as last year. Revenue and trading profit were well above last year and margins were well managed. In the Horeca 
space our main focus remains on growing our red meat, poultry and fish categories. Fresh vegetable distribution 
has begun. Retail activity centres on frozen products and ice cream. We launched pork, beef and game sales to 
butcheries. Slovakia made an improved contribution on strong retail and Horeca performance.

Poland continued the trend of strong revenue growth. Margins were maintained and overheads well controlled. 
Trading profit exceeded expectation. The freetrade share of the sales mix continues to expand. Working capital 
was well managed and investment in plant and vehicles continued, as we continue to see the benefits of this 
growing market.

Baltics revenue showed pleasing growth, underpinned by strong foodservice results. Strong ambient and chilled 
growth is evident. The business is at breakeven levels.

Spain made continued progress albeit a small loss was recorded, down on the loss recorded previously,and remains 
a very interesting market for us.

Aktaes Turkey was impacted by political uncertainty and terrorism, affecting tourism with major customer groups.
Depreciation of the Turkish lira had a severe effect on margins. Aktaes achieved sales gains, but recorded a 
loss. An Aegean acquisition is being explored.

United Kingdom (UK)
Trading profit decreased by 1,1% to R749,8 million (PF2015: R757,7 million); however, on a constant currency basis, 
trading profit grew 15,1%. Excluding the Logistics business, our UK Foodservice and Fresh business grew trading 
profit by 18,9% in sterling. 

Bidfood UK delivered an excellent result bolstered by a positive second quarter. Trading profit was comfortably 
above budget and the prior period, even though there is one less trading week in the current period. Overall 
revenue declined off the back of the intentional exiting of low margin contracts. Customer margins were well 
managed. In line with our long-term strategy, the freetrade volume mix showed good improvement. Like-for-like 
own brand volumes grew. National account business retention levels were pleasing.

Fresh profit rose, but was below expectation in view of the weaker sterling causing significant product cost inflation
within potatoes, salmon and butter product categories. Some margin has been sacrificed in order to maintain volumes.
Hardest hit was Seafood however margins have begun to stabilise. Oliver Kay (fresh produce) achieved encouraging 
sales gains. Recently acquired R Noone (fresh produce) performed well. Meat sales were strong in December, 
supported by solid contributions from Campbell's and Henson's.

Logistics results remain disappointing, weaker than the comparative period trading profit. Volumes rose though 
margin per case was under pressure. Distribution, storage and handling costs were poorly managed and increased 
beyond expectation.

Ongoing review of the commercial scope of contracts, service levels and costs is underway by the new management 
team. The management irregularities that were reported on during the previous financial year remain the subject 
of ongoing legal processes. Abnormal costs in respect of these matters have been provided for at the corporate level.
Any impact on non-current assets is continually being monitored by management however no adjustments have been made 
to the financial position to date. The future strategic options for this business are under consideration.

Emerging Markets
These businesses continue to deliver commendable results in light of the many economic challenges faced in these
regions. Revenue moved 14,8% higher to R10,0 billion (PF2015: R8,8 billion), with trading profit up 25,3% at 
R584,8 million (PF2015: R463,6 million).

Food Africa returned excellent results. Sales growth was underpinned by continued independent channel gains. 
Strong trading profit improvements were registered across all businesses. Cash flow remained strong while 
investment in vehicles and facilities was maintained. Developments to the IT and business collaboration 
systems continue to add value. Within Foodservice the online ordering platform and private label sales 
were enablers of growth. Crown Food Group grew its own manufactured lines and products. At Bakery Solutions 
the focus on innovation and product development yielded positive results. Within the export business, despite 
challenges in a number of geographies, excellent results were achieved by the Zambian operations. 

Greater China
Hong Kong topped budgetary expectations for trading profit and sales in a challenging market. Margins came under
renewed pressure impacted by sluggish tourism, notably Macau. Across the wider business, sales of dairy and 
dry products were especially strong. Natural and Organic Global grew beef and poultry volumes. In the mainland 
China business, second-tier cities were growth points. Hotel and restaurant customers supported Shanghai gains. 
Beijing saw good demand from supermarket and bakery customers. Guangzhou was buoyed by a strong second quarter. 
Shenzhen drove improvements in the restaurant and foodservice channels. Late in the period we bought out our 
40% partner in this business.

Singapore operations were challenged by declines across the food and beverage sector yet registered a 
significantly improved result. Foodservice secured continued growth with beef, poultry and butchery 
categories all strong contributors. Gourmet sales were strong but changes to the product mix affected 
margins.

Brazil secured pleasing growth in revenue and trading profit despite customer liquidity constraints. 
Economic and political conditions remained challenging. A new acquisition, Mariusso, based in the 
São Paulo area, is being integrated in order to extract synergies. Our disciplined approach to credit 
extension inhibits the potential growth of the customer-base; however, caution is deemed prudent at 
this stage.

Chile achieved pleasing gains in a stagnant economy. Sales volumes outperformed budget. The new Concepcion 
branch moved into profit following the acquisition of a small distribution company. Santiago Foodservice did 
well, freezer capacity expansion has begun and debtors' collections showed improvement.

Middle East businesses registered revenue growth while trading profit was in line with expectation, 
underpinned by good contributions from Saudi Arabia and the smaller regional markets. UAE put in 
another strong showing, and we are benefiting from our previous investment into our operational capacity.

Basis of presentation of condensed consolidated financial statements
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting 
Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards 
Council, and include disclosure as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Companies 
Act of South Africa. They do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS 
financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and 
transactions that are significant to an understanding to the changes in the Group's financial position 
and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year 
ended June 30  2016.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the 
key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated 
financial statements as at and for the year ended June 30  2016.

Certain segments were reclassified during the year. The comparative year's segmental information has 
been represented to reflect these insignificant changes.

Significant accounting policies 
The accounting policies applied in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are 
the same as those applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year 
ended June 30  2016.

Financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data 
as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy 
based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques categorised as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset 
           or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does 
not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value 
if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Valuation technique
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDAs, the amount 
to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario. The valuation models consider the present 
value of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. 

Significant unobservable inputs
- EBITDA growth rates:         10% - 23% (2015: 10% - 23%)
- EBITDA multiples:            4,8x - 7x (2015: 4,8x - 7x)
- Risk-adjusted discount rate: 1,99% - 5,00% (2015: 1,99% - 5,00%)

Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if:
- The EBITDA was higher (lower); or
- The risk-adjusted discount rate was lower (higher). 

Related parties
The identification of related parties and transactions with key management personnel as of and for the period 
ended December 31  2016 have been the same as those applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements 
as at and for the year ended June 30  2016.

Unaudited results
These results have not been audited or reviewed by the Group's auditors. The interim condensed consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared by CAM Bishop (CA)SA, under the supervision of DE Cleasby CA(SA), 
and were approved by the board of directors on February 22  2017.

Exchange rates

Supplementary pro forma information regarding the currency effects of the translation of foreign operations 
on the Group
The pro forma financial information has been compiled for illustrative purposes only and is the responsibility 
of the board. Due to the nature of this information, it may not fairly present the Group's financial position, 
changes in equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information has been compiled in terms 
of the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information by SAICA.

The Group underwent an internal restructuring with effect from April 1  2016 in anticipation of the listing 
and unbundling of Bidcorp on May 30  2016. The illustrative information, detailed in the statement of profit 
or loss, has been prepared on the basis that the internal restructuring had been effective July 1  2015 and 
includes pro forma adjustments on a basis consistent with those of the pre-listing statement of Bidcorp, dated
April 14  2016.

The average rand exchange rate weakened against most of the significant currencies in which the Group's 
foreign operations trade, namely the euro (15,01 in 2015 to 15,40 in 2016) and the Australian dollar 
(9,84 in 2015 to 10,57 in 2016), however, this was offset by an appreciation in the rand against sterling 
(20,86 in 2015 to 17,94 in 2016) following the UK referendum to leave the EU in June 2016 (Brexit). 
The illustrative information, detailed below, has been prepared on the basis of applying the 2015 
average rand exchange rates to the 2016 foreign subsidiary income statements and recalculating the 
reported income of the Group for the period.

BIDCORP FOOD AFRICA AND PURATOS ESTABLISH JOINT VENTURE

Bidcorp Food Africa (Bidcorp Food), a subsidiary of JSE-listed Bid
Corporation Limited (Bidcorp), has signed agreements with the Puratos Group
NV (Puratos) whereby Puratos will become an equal shareholder in Bidcorp
Food’s Bakery Solutions Division (BBS).

BBS manufactures and supplies bakery ingredients to industrial bakers, the
craft market and large retailers under the Chipkins and NCP brands in South
Africa

Puratos, a €1.6Bn turnover business, is headquartered in Brussels and
specializes in the development and production, as well as the international
distribution and marketing, of high quality ingredients for the global
bakery, patisserie and chocolate sectors. Puratos employs 7225 people, 840
R&D researchers and technical advisors, with a 2.2% of turnover investment
in R&D. Products are produced in 55 production units in 44 countries, has
subsidiaries operating in 68 countries, marketing and distributing their
products in 100 countries across the globe. Products are demonstrated and
developed at 77 innovation centers in the world.

Bidcorp CEO, Bernard Berson, commented, “The proposed transaction provides
BBS with an opportunity to grow its existing business and to develop new
products and tailor-made solutions for the South African baking industry”.

“This acquisition in South Africa will help us further develop the booming
African market. We want to expand further in Africa. Not only does it help
us strengthen our global presence, but it also gives us the opportunity to
bring the same Puratos quality ingredients to every baker on the continent.
With this investment we also aim to accompany our industrial and retail
customers who look at Africa, just as we do, as the next big frontier,”
says Daniel Malcorps, Chief Executive Officer of Puratos.

The Chief Executive of Bidcorp Food, Klaas Havenga commented, “Though BBS
has been a strong competitor in its market despite the presence of multi-
nationals, the JV will be in a much stronger position on the back of
Puratos’s technical strength and specialized ingredients. This augurs well
for strong future sales growth, especially in market segments of the baking
industry where BBS traditionally was underrepresented. Planned investment
in new product categories and technology are very exciting and will offer
new employment opportunities and learning and development experiences to

Divisional Day – November 24 2016 - Management update on general
trading conditions

Shareholders are advised that the executive management of the group met
with members of the financial community on November 24 2016, including
shareholders and financial analysts, for an update on current market
conditions and the trading environment across the international operations.

Management commented as follows:

1. Current market conditions and trading

   -   Overall conditions within the global foodservice industry remain positive
       and continued growth opportunities remain in all our trading
       geographies. Many of Bidcorp’s international foodservice peers have
       reported improved results benefitting from positive underlying market
       conditions.
   -   Overall trading within Bidcorp for the first 4 months of the financial year
       2017 has been good and the positive momentum achieved in the
       financial year 2016 has continued. Currency volatility continues to
       positively impact Bidcorp’s rand reported results with the depreciation
       of the rand against the euro and Australian dollar more than offsetting
       the appreciation of the rand against sterling following the UK
       referendum to leave the EU in June 2016 (Brexit).
   -   This performance has been achieved against a backdrop of zero food
       inflation in most operational geographies (bar South Africa and Brazil),
       in relatively benign economic conditions globally.
   -   Management remains focused on executing on the strategic plan to
       rebalance their customer portfolios by focusing on the correct
       segments and on adding value to their customer offering through
       innovation and service delivery.

   United Kingdom (“UK”)

   -   Following Brexit, one of the potential impacts of sterling’s
       devaluation will be inflation and the impact of inflation on our UK
       businesses is positive. Overall the economy in the United Kingdom
       is growing and the sterling devaluation should further propel activity
       levels forward, benefitting from more tourists and local consumer
       spending.
   -   The foodservice business continues to perform well and the
       business transformation process continues. We have retained our
       second largest customer for a further period of 5 years and the
       sales pipeline is looking encouraging. The highly fragmented
       foodservice market remains a growth opportunity.
   -   The fresh business has been impacted by inflation over the period,
       particularly in seafood and mainly in fresh salmon products. The
       strategy of building out a national presence across all product types
       continues.
   -   Logistics, a small contributor to the aggregated UK results, has
       been disappointing and remains a tough business. Current
       performance is under the microscope and the future strategic
       options for the business are under consideration.

Europe

   -   Western European growth remains low however Eastern Europe is
       experiencing significantly higher growth, which is benefiting our
       businesses.
   -   The Netherlands business is delivering positive growth as
       management transitions its focus to the ‘core’ street / independent
       customer segment, moving away from the previous institutionally
       focused customer model.
   -   The Belgium business is delivering good growth in its foodservice
       market while maintaining an even keel in its institutional exposure,
       despite low confidence following the terror attacks earlier in the
       calendar year.
   -   Czech and Slovakia have performed exceptionally well driven by
       solid growth in the core foodservice business. Good growth has
       continued in Poland as the benefits of recent infrastructural
       investment manifest in productive capacity.
   -   DAC Italy has performed well in the first quarter of F2017 buoyed
       by the bolt on Quartiglia acquisition. The core focus of the business
       on the independent market segment bodes well for further growth.
       Global procurement benefits in Italian product are being achieved
       across the group.
   -   Spain remains an attractive market and we are committed to
       accessing the right opportunity.
   -   Further expansion into the European region, both in terms of in
       country bolt on acquisitions and strategic entry into new
       geographies, will be explored as we are not represented or
       underrepresented in many countries.

Australasia

     -  In Australia, the exit of low margin contracts is substantially
        complete. Both the broadline foodservice business and fresh and
        meat operations have contributed to solid growth in the first quarter
        of F2017.
     -   New Zealand continues to produce solid results, with all segments
         of the business performing well, despite modest economic activity
         levels.
     -   A number of bolt on acquisitions are being explored in both
         countries which will sustain growth in the region.

  Emerging markets

     -   South Africa is producing excellent results, contrary to the generally
         tough operating conditions and low GDP growth. Energised
         management, rebalancing the product portfolio and innovation have
         all contributed to the improved result. Exposure to Africa is being
         hampered by a lack of credit and our resources are being refocused
         within each segment of the division.
     -   Within Greater China, Hong Kong continues to experience subdued
         trading off lower tourism activity. Our business remains stable
         however real growth is difficult to achieve. In mainland China, the
         business continues to power along however a number of trading
         challenges are being encountered. The region remains a huge
         growth opportunity with a growing middle class population and
         increasing demand for Western styled food products.
     -   In Singapore, the benefits of the transition to a foodservice model
         over the past few years is reflecting in an improved performance.
     -   Further expansion into Asia remains an opportunity as investment
         conditions become more user friendly.
     -   In South America, despite challenging political and economic
         conditions, management remain optimistic that significant
         opportunities exist in the region to consolidate markets to build a
         strong growth platform over time. In Brazil, our business is
         performing much better. Bolt on opportunities continue to be
         pursued however transaction conversion generally takes longer
         than anticipated. Chile is benefitting from its foodservice focus and
         national exposure provides a great platform for further organic
         expansion.
     -   Middle East has produced respectable results in spite of the
         geopolitical challenges in the region. Our small investment in
         Lebanon was exited in July. Focused management attention on its
         larger businesses in UAE and Saudi are delivering desired results.

2. General

     -   Management is highly motivated and enthused by the opportunity in
         each of the geographic regions within which the group operates.
     -   Bidcorp will be undertaking a global rebranding exercise within the
         next short while, which will be used to promote our image as ‘value
         add food people’ rather than box movers, as we transition to the
         new “Bidfood” brand.
     -   We have made 8 acquisitions (bolt-on’s) in the first 5 months of this
         financial year:
             o  In Fresh UK we acquired 80% of a produce supplier.
             o  In Belgium, we bought 100% of a regional Horeca distributor.
             o  Italy has acquired 60% of a central Italian distributor.
             o  In New Zealand, we acquired a sous vide meat producer to
                supply their foodservice needs with value add sous vide and
                cooked product
             o In Brazil, we have acquired another distributor in Sao Paolo.
             o In Australia, we have acquired 3 businesses, a meat
                processor / distributor in Canberra, and foodservice
                wholesalers in Launceston, Tasmania and Port Macquarie,
                NSW to fill in geographic gaps.
             o In aggregate (assuming they all perform as planned), the
                approximate annualised financial impact of these
                transactions (converting at current forex rates) would be
                Revenue of R1.9 billion, EBITDA of R100 million, and a
                purchase consideration of R530 million (including property
                acquired in Belgium of R115 million).
      -   Some new geographies are also under consideration.
      -   Management remain alert to all acquisition opportunities that
          present themselves both in current markets and in new territories.

TRADING UPDATE

“Overall conditions within the global foodservice industry remain positive and continued
growth opportunities remain in all our trading geographies. Many of Bidcorp’s international
foodservice peers have reported improved results benefitting from positive underlying market
conditions.

Overall trading within Bidcorp for the first 4 months of the financial year 2017 has been good
and the positive momentum achieved in the financial year 2016 has continued. Currency
volatility continues to positively impact Bidcorp’s rand reported results with the depreciation
of the rand against the euro and Australian dollar more than offsetting the appreciation of the
rand against sterling following Brexit.

Following Brexit, one of the potential impacts of sterling’s devaluation will be inflation and the
impact of inflation on our United Kingdom businesses is positive. Overall the economy in the
United Kingdom is growing and the sterling devaluation should further propel activity levels
forward, benefitting from more tourists and local consumer spending.”

Comment

Bidcorp has, in addition to its actual results, provided shareholders with pro forma financial information to enable a
full appreciation of the true performance of the Group. The following comment is based on the pro forma information.

Highlights
The Group delivered very pleasing results for the year ended June 30  2016. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) has
increased by 32,5% to 1 080,0 cents per share (F2015: 815,2 cents) with basic earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 
26,1% to 1 034,0 cents per share (F2015: 819,8 cents). On a constant currency basis, HEPS increased by 14,2%.

As a result of the listing, Bidcorp has declared a dividend of 241,0 cents per share based on the pro forma results 
which pertains to the second half of the financial year, in accordance with its dividend policy.

Bidcorp’s businesses continue to perform well across the world, with solid organic growth in home currencies in very
low inflation environments, benefiting from market share gains and margin improvement. Rand translated results were
enhanced by the positive effects of a weakened rand against most major currencies in the second half of the 
financial year. 

Financial overview
Revenue grew 20,8% to R140,5 billion (F2015: R116,3 billion). Major contributors to the increases were the UK and
European operations, reflecting organic growth and assistance from currency effects on translation. Revenue growth 
was dampened by the deliberate and planned exit of large contract business in various geographies.

Gross profit percentage increased to 20,8% (F2015: 20,3%) reflecting the benefit of the strategy of focusing on the
correct mix of business. Operating expenses remained well controlled, increasing by 6,2% on a constant currency basis. 
The benefits of lower fuel costs were negated by some wage pressure in a number of growing economies and higher sales 
and distribution costs reflecting activity levels.

Group trading profit increased by 26,1% to R5,2 billion (F2015: R4,1 billion) and the trading margin increased to 
3,7% (F2015: 3,5%), principally reflecting the operational focus to grow the independent trade and rebalance the 
customer portfolio in many geographies. 

Share-based payment costs declined from R89,9 million to R64,0 million impacted by the unbundling and the run off of
previous option schemes. Long-term incentivisation remains a cornerstone of management motivation and new allocations
have been made. 

Acquisition costs of R8,9 million (F2015: R43,6 million) reflect minimal acquisition activity as compared to the prior
year.

Net finance charges are 11,1% lower at R294,6 million (F2015: R331,3 million), reflecting good cash generation despite
greater utilisation of working capital during the year. Bidcorp remains well capitalised, with trading profit interest
cover at 17,5 times (F2015: 12,3 times). We remain conservative in our approach to gearing, however we are undertaking 
a review of current gearing levels across the Group in order to enhance returns.

Headline earnings increased by 32,7% to R3,6 billion (F2015: R2,7 billion). Net headline earnings adjustments in the
year totalled R152,7 million, the majority of which relates to the impairment of the investment in Icelandic Water.

The Group’s financial position remains strong. Growth in total assets reflects normal levels of replacement and
investment capital expenditure on fixed assets, and the higher trading activity in inventories and receivables. 
Net debt has declined to R1,7 billion as compared to R3,3 billion at June 30  2015. 

Cash generated by operations was extremely robust as was working capital management, despite organic growth and the
currency impacts on translation. Net working capital days remained in line with prior year (F2015: -1 day).

Acquisitions and disposals
There have been no material acquisitions in the year. Smaller acquisitions include MPD (Czech - R162,0 million) and
Caterfood and Cimandis (UK Foodservice - R464,0 million). Disposals include Patleys (Food Africa - R171,3 million) 
and our minority share in the associate VCN (Netherlands - R51,6 million).

Prospects
Growth in out-of-home eating where customers quest for quality products, differentiation of service and innovative
solutions, is expected to continue. Our philosophy remains on exploiting the “service” element by remaining close 
to our customers, evolving the product range and offering high levels of service.

Our foodservice distribution segments remain focused on balancing the exposure between contract, national and
independent customers in their respective markets. Traditionally more mature markets are being further segmented as 
a means of growing market share. Innovative technology-based solutions for customers continue to gain traction in 
many businesses as part of our value-add service. Fresh produce, Meat categories and Value Add Processing are areas 
of significant unexploited potential in most regions. 

Our financial position remains strong, cash generation is robust and we retain significant headroom to accommodate
expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic in a low interest rate environment. Currency volatility is 
likely to continue to impact Bidcorp’s translated results in the current global environment, however management 
remain focused on ensuring each business is managed in order to maximise returns in our businesses in their local 
currencies. Returns on funds employed remains the key driver of performance across all territories.

Management remains alert to opportunities and is confident of delivering further growth in the year ahead across all
segments of the market; organically through a focus on the independent trade and appropriate business mix, supplemented
by investment in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; through bolt-on acquisitions in territory to expand geographic reach 
and product range extension; and via larger acquisitions to enter new markets.

The Bidcorp entrepreneurial and decentralised business model, the depth and experience of our management team, and the
strength of the Group’s culture breeds accountability and confidence which allows us to deliver above-average returns
to our shareholders. 

The positive global fundamentals in the foodservice industry will enable Bidcorp to further exploit this opportunity
in its respective markets. All businesses are budgeting for real growth in their home currencies.

DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
Australasia
The region continues to make a substantial contribution and remains the biggest profit generator. Revenue moved 
7,6% higher to R30,3 billion (F2015: R28,2 billion). Trading profit rose 21,8% to R1,8 billion (F2015: R1,5 billion).

Australia
The business recorded solid trading profit growth of 8,8%, a pleasing result as sales fell 7,0%. Sales decline is in
line with the strategy of exiting low-margin logistics contracts while concentrating on higher margin independent
business.

The economy sent mixed signals, though GDP growth remained stable. The continuing mining sector downturn hurt Western
Australia and parts of Queensland, but tourism growth gave a boost to holiday destinations. 

Gross contribution was up, driven higher by the changing mix of business.

Margins were well managed. Expenses moved higher as higher margin segments like Fresh and Meat typically involve
higher costs and wages. Cash generation remained strong.

Foodservice profits were up 10,5%. The Foodservice result comes off flat overall sales but real sales growth of around
5,0% in the core target market (as low margin contract business was exited) and a zero food inflation environment.
Strong growth was achieved in the free trade segment.

Imports division continued to grow and maintained rigorous expense control. The potential for value add manufacture or
repack of own brand products is being explored, as are synergies with BPC and DAC Italy.

Fresh results were disappointing, this remains a segment with upside potential, and the national footprint was grown.

Meat division achieved profit growth, but results were somewhat below expectation, with meat prices being very high
and availability more scarce. Some larger city Meat branches have adopted the direct-to-customers business model. 
Closer collaboration with Foodservice will be a focus area going forward.

Logistics continued to scale back as the strategy of exiting low-margin business continued, and this division will
continue to be downsized even further.

In 2017, the Australia strategy of developing the higher margin market segments is expected to gain further momentum.
The vision is to become a focused “food” business whereby we add value to our customers, rather than a low-cost
carton-mover.

Further infrastructural development will continue, primarily in the large cities, and along with house brand
development, range extension, customer focus and select acquisition opportunities, continued growth is expected.

New Zealand
Food deflation set in following a drop in dairy prices, though strong growth in retail spending and tourism were
beneficial to the country. All divisions performed strongly. Revenue grew 12,8%, with impressive trading profit growth,
topping 21,0%.

Results were driven by the strategic focus of developing key centre of the plate and produce categories while timely
infrastructure investment created the capacity to maximise market potential.

Margins and working capital were well managed. The dollar value of inventories rose on the growth of higher value
categories such as meat.

We disposed of our retail operations and acquired two small businesses. Land purchases created capacity for expansion
in Hamilton, Timaru, Invercargill and Auckland. A new purpose-built distribution centre was built in Queenstown and
another is planned in Nelson.

Foodservice put in a highly pleasing performance with strong results at all branches. The use of ecommerce
technologies grew strongly further increasing the business’ competitive advantage.

Fresh also performed strongly. Despite market volatility, margins were generally steady. Expense management was
rigorous and exports achieved good sales growth.

The Logistics performance was driven by good ice cream sales, focus on the route trade and exceptional growth by a key
QSR customer.

The Processing division more than doubled its profit and Christchurch Butchery improved substantially.

In the year ahead, New Zealand will strive to maintain this strong momentum. The free-trade focus will intensify.
Steps will be taken to further improve the processing business. Development of our sous vide products and our repack 
product range are envisaged.

United Kingdom (UK)
Revenue rose 27,8% to R61,0 billion (F2015: R47,7 billion) while trading profit increased by 27,3% to 
R1,4 billion (F2015: R1,1 billion).

The Foodservice and Fresh businesses collectively grew trading profit by 44,9% off a 26,5% increase in revenue. 
The division was however negatively impacted by a 55,5% reduction in the trading profit of the Logistics business.

Foodservice
The business posted strong results in an economy that maintained modest but consistent growth. Sales and trading
profit were up while expenses were well controlled. 

National accounts showed growth as several major customers renewed contracts. The strategy of re-tendering very
low-margin accounts at more commercially acceptable rates resulted in a small number of customers moving to providers 
who are willing to take on very low-cost contracts. 

Free-trade volumes, excluding acquisitions, eased lower, but customer margin improved slightly. Focus for 2017 is to
grow the customer-base while maintaining margins. The Vivas wine joint venture achieved pleasing profit and sales growth.
Cimandis, an independent wholesaler in the Channel Islands was acquired in August 2015, and Caterfood, an independent
wholesaler in South West England, was acquired late in the financial year. Management are excited about the synergies the
association with Foodservice can bring.

The continued focus on food credentials was maintained with the re-launch of the entire own brand range, which also
won several food awards.

Working capital management improved and cash generation remained robust.

Investment in infrastructure continued, including a new site in Slough (west of London), which became operational in
June.

The upgrading, modernisation and simplification of IT infrastructure was completed and included the virtualisation 
of the server network, and the implementation of a new ecommerce platform for product management and online trading. 
In addition voice picking functionality was rolled out to 19 depots.

Among the specialist businesses, Southlincs Foodservice reported good trading profit growth. Catering Equipment
results exceeded expectations.

Fresh
Sales were ahead of budget, but profit was slightly below expectation. Independent channel growth continued. National
account business also grew, though margins came under pressure. We are making good progress in building a national
specialist Fresh distributor, with capability in Seafood, Meat, Produce, Cheese and Speciality products.

Underperformance at two Seafood depots contributed to the disappointing trading result. A sudden rise in salmon prices
put pressure on margins.

Oliver Kay Produce had a good year, growing its national sector exposure. The Campbell’s meat business moved from loss
to a small profit. 

Another meat specialist, Knights, was acquired in May. The acquisition of R Noone & Son (a Manchester fresh produce
distributor) was finalised in July 2016.

Logistics
Logistics overall benefited from higher revenue however, trading profit performance disappointed as margins were
squeezed. Labour shortages pushed expenses up significantly, as did higher vehicle accident costs as a result of more agency
labour requirements. In addition, costs of implementing new contracts, surplus depot capacity and abnormal expenses eroded
profitability. 

A review of the commercial scope of contracts and service levels is underway, combined with an aggressive review of
management structures and overhead costs.

Management irregularities were identified and investigated during the year, some of which relate to a recent
acquisition and others to operational activities, all of which significantly impacted the division. These irregularities 
are subject to ongoing legal processes. 

Any impact on non-current assets is continually being monitored by management. In respect of the net operating assets, management
have provided for the worst case scenario notwithstanding recoveries from legal action and insurance claims.

Europe
Most businesses performed strongly, particularly the eastern Europe jurisdictions. Revenue rose 24,9% to R31,0 billion
(F2015: R24,8 billion) while trading profit rose 22,4% to R1,1 billion (F2015: R0,9 billion).

Deli XL Netherlands
Revenue showed the first growth since 2013, buoyed by good hospitality performance that offset continued institutional
sector decline. Good progress has been made in redefining the business model to cater to the independent trade.
Institutional business decline appears to have bottomed but remained under pressure. Catering sales moved higher, 
driven by new contract gains and growing demand from existing customers.

National account volumes rose as a result of an uptick in out-of-home eating, with margins improving as marginal
customers were exited. The hospitality business made market share gains while maintaining margins.

Belgium
The economy slowed in the second half and tourism came under pressure following terror attacks. Horeca sales into
Brussels were hard hit as consumer confidence was shaken. However, teams put in a robust performance and revenue and 
trading profit were ahead of forecasts. Margins were largely maintained as teams focused on the development of high-value
categories.

Catering showed good growth, supported by the renewal of a significant contract with a large catering group. Horeca
volumes were slightly down, though trading profit growth was achieved. Good growth was seen in the institutional 
channel and within the logistics business.
 
Czech Republic and Slovakia
The Czech Republic’s economy returned to growth and the foodservice industry benefited from an influx of holiday
visitors. Operations maximised these opportunities and achieved excellent revenue and trading profit growth.

Sales were lifted by a fantastic ice cream season as the past summer has been one of the hottest in 10 years, this
being an uncontrollable driver of ice cream consumption.

The Czech division achieved a sales increase of 11,5%, with strong contributions from both Foodservice and Retail. 
The export department achieved a 30% sales gain. Overall costs were well managed, other than wages which are under 
pressure as improved economic activity increased demand for warehousing and distribution staff.

Meat production from the Kralupy (Prague) operation contributed to the strong overall result while trading profit from
Opava production (ice cream, frozen vegetable, ready meals and potato products) was maintained.

Newly acquired MPD (providing temperature controlled storage, as well as warehousing capacity in Pilzen) made a
positive start, and enabled us to open another distribution centre there, greatly adding to our available capacity, 
which was much needed to accommodate the growth achieved.

Slovakia’s sales were up by more than 21,0%. Foodservice and Retail both contributed to this.

DAC Italy
Pleasing results were achieved, with revenue and trading profit above budget and prior year. Expenses were impacted 
by the cost of opening the new Rome warehouse in July 2015, but overall were well managed.

Sales of ambient and frozen products continue to grow as a result of strong penetration of the “street market”. This
element of the mix now accounts for about 60% of sales. The growth drive in the “single customer” channel will be
maintained. In March we exited a large, low-margin caterer and this opened up much needed capacity in time for the 
summer season. 

Cash generated by operations remained healthy.

Going forward, to accelerate our growth, DAC will pursue acquisition opportunities, with strong focus on central Italy
and the south. In July 2016 we acquired a distributor on the Adriatic coast.

Poland
The business recorded strong sales growth, with a particularly impressive performance in the “street market” segment
due to good volume increases. No significant contracts were lost while some key national accounts were extended.

Trading profit was ahead of prior year. Overheads were well controlled. Cash flow remained robust despite
investment into working capital for growth.

Construction on the new central warehouse was completed. It went into full operation in October, and has added greatly
to our national infrastructure blueprint.

Baltics
Overall sales in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia achieved solid growth. Main driver was the foodservice segment. Retail
exposure declined. Although operating at a slight loss, the transition out of retail will yield a sustainable profitable
foodservice business in time.

Spain
Annual sales rose, but failed to meet budget and a small loss was recorded. Expense management remains a challenge.
Growth potential has been identified in fresh produce and the hotel channel. We believe the Spanish foodservice market to
be highly attractive and will continue to pursue suitable acquisitions.

Aktaes Turkey
Total sales moved higher, supported by strong growth in the foodservice segment. However, terror attacks and the
failed coup impacted tourism and out-of-home eating, particularly in Istanbul, where our operations are mainly centred, 
and creates a great deal of uncertainty for our future prospects.

Emerging Markets
These businesses achieved a commendable result in spite of many economic challenges. Revenue moved 16,7% higher to
R18,2 billion (F2015: R15,6 billion), with trading profit up 32,8% at R934,4 million (F2015: R703,6 million).

Food Africa (BFA)
BFA returned excellent results. Sales exceeded budget, as did trading profits. However, margin pressure intensified in
highly competitive trading conditions and cost pressures were evident due to high inflation and exchange rate
fluctuations. Debtors management remained stringent. Investment in distribution facilities and vehicles continued.

Net sales growth exceeded food inflation, driven by pleasing gains at Food Ingredients (BFI) across independent
channels and Foodservice (BFS) in the independent and national account channels.

Bakery Solutions (BBS) continued its penetration of the retail and franchise sector. Food Exports (BFE) achieved
substantial growth in Zambia.

BFS’ excellent growth was all organic. The independent and national account segments both achieved double-digit
growth. Growth was enhanced by a focus on developing our ecommerce platform and sales of private label products. A new
KwaZulu-Natal depot opened.

BFI drove growth by focusing on its own manufactured lines and product brands. Strong growth was realised in almost
all product categories through the trading operations.

BBS had an excellent year, with focus on innovation and product development across its own manufactured products.
Almost all trading branches performed well and the factory achieved efficiency improvements. All trading branches built
momentum in the last quarter.

BFE made market share gains in sub-Saharan Africa. Strong performance by the Zambian operation is expected to
continue.

Greater China
Sales were 4,2% higher, while expenses were well controlled. Trading profit rose an impressive 20,8%.

Hong Kong
Sales were slightly below expectation mirroring the general sluggishness of the Hong Kong economy, but pleasing annual
profit growth was achieved. In Macau, solid sales were seen across the meat, dairy and seafood categories despite a
large drop in casino-related activity and hotel occupancy.

In the coming year, sales growth is expected from newly launched operations (Wines and Master Butchery value-added
product range). Continued growth of the natural foods catalogue is planned.

China
Mainland operations put in another pleasing performance, with sales volumes and profits well ahead of projections.

Dairy and meat volumes to hotel and restaurant customers in Shanghai show continued growth. Strong supermarket demand
underpinned gains in Beijing while bakery, retail and foodservice lines did well in Guangzhou. Sales in the Shenzhen
foodservice and restaurant channels showed strong improvement.

Business growth continued in second-tier cities such as Changsha, Xian, Sanya and Wuhan. Continued growth is projected
for 2017.

Singapore
The business has begun its anticipated turnaround, with profit in line with expectation while expenses were rigorously
managed. Sales volumes fell in line with the ongoing transition to a fully-fledged foodservice operation.

Low-margin operations were either closed or scaled back. Rightsizing initiatives continued to deliver inventory
management gains and strong cash generation.

Foodservice continued to grow, supported by strong penetration of the restaurant industry. Gourmet lines performed
strongly, aided by the successful launch of several key European brands.

Brazil
Trading challenges mounted in a year of political and economic crisis. Foodservices were not hit as severely as some
sectors of the economy, but out-of-home eating declined by an estimated 30%. In this environment, the business did well
to maintain sales volumes while minimising the impact on trading profit. Cash generation remains very high, which is
important in this environment of high interest rates.

Implementation of new IT systems contributed to routing and distribution efficiencies. Further improvements were
evident following the opening of our new warehouse. We are optimistic and committed to this market and are actively 
seeking acquisition targets.

Chile
Despite marketplace pressures, year-on-year sales and trading profit growth were achieved.

Performance was underpinned by new-business gains, robust cross-selling and the introduction of meat to the product
mix. Contract terms were renegotiated in some instances and the Foodservice teams performed well.

We opened a new branch and acquired a small business in Concepción. We disposed of our Santiago fresh bakery operation
in May 2016, this business was not part of our strategic focus to be the leading Foodservice wholesaler in Chile.

The Santiago branch opened new sales channels and the Puerto Montt operation expanded its customer-base.

Middle East
Pleasing sales and trading profit growth was delivered, with strong contributions from UAE and Saudi Arabia. Cash
generation remained strong. Improved supply chain management drove substantial inventory management improvements. 

Horeca UAE reported solid year-on-year growth in sales and trading profit, and moved into a purpose built, state of
the art multi-temperature facility in Dubai in May 2016, which should greatly enhance our regional capabilities.

Al Diyafa (Saudi Arabia) enjoyed pleasing sales and trading profit growth. Retail achieved good momentum following
additions to the range and increased promotional activity. Meat was added to the category mix. 

Our activities in Lebanon were not profitable and we exited from this market in July 2016.

BPC 
Improved foreign exchange management and significant demand from other Bidcorp businesses helped BPC grow its
business, which is of benefit to all Bidcorp operations. The product mix was further widened and the number of supplier
countries grew. New procurement regions such as Latin America and southern Africa are being explored.

Dividend declaration
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 
241,0 cents (204,85 cents net of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share 
for the year ended June 30 2016 to those members registered on the record date, being Friday, September 16  2016.

The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend withholding tax of 15% will be applicable to all
shareholders who are not exempt.

Basis of presentation of condensed consolidated financial statements

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements for provisional reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings
Requirements require provisional reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and
recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards
Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting
policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are
consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended June 30  2015.

In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of
estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year
ended June 30  2015.

Certain segments were reclassified during the year. The comparative year’s segmental information has been represented
to reflect these insignificant changes.

Net acquisition of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments
There were no material acquisitions concluded during the year.

Commitments
The Group has commitments at June 30 of approved contracted capital expenditure of R568,7 million 
(2015: R407,2 million) and not contracted for capital expenditure of R939,4 million (2015: R989,6 million). 
It is anticipated that capital expenditure will be financed out of existing cash resources.

Financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
techniques categorised as follows:
- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
           directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value. It does not include fair
value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a
reasonable approximation of fair value.

Valuation technique
The expected payments (fair value) are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDA’s, the
amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario. The valuation models consider the present value
of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.

Significant unobservable inputs
- EBITDA growth rates:            10 - 23% (2015: 10 - 23%)
- EBITDA multiples:               4,8x - 7x (2015: 4,8x - 7x)
- Risk-adjusted discount rate:    1,99% (2015: 1,99%)

Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if:
- The EBITDA were higher (lower); or
- The risk-adjusted discount rate were lower (higher). 

Subsequent events
No material subsequent events have arisen since June 30 2016.

Supplementary pro forma information

The pro forma financial information has been compiled for illustrative purposes only and is the responsibility of the
board. Due to the nature of this information, it may not fairly present the Group’s financial position, changes in
equity and results of operations or cash flows. An unmodified reasonable assurance report has been issued by the Group’s
auditors, KPMG, in terms of ISAE 3420 Assurance Engagements to Report on the Compilation of Pro Forma Information in a
Prospectus, and is available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. The pro forma information has been compiled
in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information by SAICA and the accounting
policies of the Group as at June 30  2016.

The Group underwent an internal restructuring with effect from April 1  2016 in anticipation of the listing and
unbundling of Bidcorp on May 30 2016. The illustrative information, detailed in the income statement, has been prepared 
on the basis that the internal restructuring had been effective on each of July 1  2015 and July 1  2014 and includes

ABRIDGED PRE-LISTING STATEMENT OF BIDCORP – LISTING OF BIDCORP ON THE MAIN
BOARD OF THE JSE LIMITED (“JSE”)

1. INTRODUCTION

    This announcement should be read together with the announcement released by The Bidvest
    Group Limited (“Bidvest”) on the Stock Exchange News Service (“SENS”) of the JSE today in
    relation to the proposed listing (“the Listing”) and subsequent unbundling of its foodservices
    business on the main board of the JSE (“the Unbundling”).

    This abridged Pre-Listing Statement is not an invitation to subscribe for shares in BidCorp, but is
    issued in compliance with the listings requirements of the JSE for the purpose of providing
    information to the public with regard to the business and affairs of BidCorp as at the time of the
    Listing.

2. OVERVIEW OF BIDCORP

    BidCorp was incorporated and registered as a private company in South Africa under registration
    number 1995/008615/07 on August 17 1995. On February 9 2016, BidCorp was converted into a
    public company with registration number 1995/008615/06.  BidCorp is an international broadline
    foodservice group present in developed and developing economies in all continents other than
    North America. There is a mix of well-established leading market positions, where there is
    potential to optimise returns, and of rapidly growing market positions offering significant future
    upside. Achievement of a good performance track record is a result of strong organic and
    acquisitive growth, positive market fundamentals and the advantages of shared operational best
    practice, network density, deep local customer and supplier relationships, effective world-wide
    procurement, and a successful model of decentralised management. The profile of the customer
    base, strategically targeted to favour the independent trade and small to medium sized
    enterprises, yields a healthy margin.

3. RATIONALE FOR LISTING

   As part of its ongoing review and proposed restructure of its business operations, Bidvest has
   decided to procure the separate listing and unbundling of its foodservices operations on the main
   board of the JSE. The unbundling will provide Bidvest shareholders with the opportunity to
   participate directly in its foodservices operations. The separation of Bidvest and BidCorp will
   enable the component parts of Bidvest's businesses to operate in a more efficient and
   commercially effective manner, thereby enabling each of the businesses to achieve their
   respective strategic goals.

   Both BidCorp and Bidvest will remain South African domiciled companies with their primary
   listings of shares on the JSE.

4. STRATEGY

   BidCorp will focus on realising the potential that exists in its current foodservice operations as well
   as acquisitive growth opportunities. As a separately listed entity, the market will afford the assets
   of BidCorp a fair and objective valuation and provide BidCorp with the currency to selectively
   pursue synergistic acquisition opportunities globally. As an independent company, BidCorp will
   be able to ring-fence its cash flows for its own objectives. BidCorp can in the future use its free
   cash flows for the benefit of its shareholders, including through an appropriate dividend policy.

   BidCorp’s improved management focus will enable it to more readily identify acquisition
   opportunities both locally and abroad and mitigate and manage risks and challenges specific to its
   business. In summary, the proposed Unbundling will position BidCorp into a fit-for-purpose, more
   sustainable global foodservices operation, better positioned to maximise long-term value for all
   stakeholders.

5. LISTING ON JSE

   The JSE has granted BidCorp a listing by way of introduction of all its issued ordinary shares on
   the JSE main board under the abbreviated name “BidCorp”, share code “BID” and ISIN
   ZAE000216537 with effect from the commencement of trade on Monday, May 30 2016. BidCorp
   will be listed in the “Food Retailers and Wholesalers” sector.

6. SHARE CAPITAL

  As at the Listing date, the total authorised share capital of BidCorp will comprise 540,000,000
  ordinary no par value shares and all shares in issue shall rank pari passu with each other in all
  respects, including in respect of voting rights and dividends.
