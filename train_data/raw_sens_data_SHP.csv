OPERATIONAL UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2020


The Group's 2021 financial year has begun in earnest. Across the business 
adherence to strict COVID-19 protocols has become part of daily operations, 
whilst execution on growth across our store base, digital and customer first 
projects has continued.

In accordance with our 2020 year-end guidance expectations, the impact of 
COVID-19 lockdown regulations on RSA liquor trade was particularly marked 
over the quarter given it required our Supermarkets RSA LiquorShop business 
to remain closed for 60 of the 91 days in the period. The loss of trade 
notably impacted our Supermarkets RSA segment's sales growth and 
consequently Group growth and it is for this reason we have provided metrics 
including and excluding RSA LiquorShop's sales for both. Notwithstanding, 
the Group's continued focus on gross margin and expense management continued 
unabated and has delivered positive results for the quarter.

Sales growth from continuing operations for the three months to 
September 2020 over the corresponding three months ended 
September 2019:

                                                                    Change
                                                                         %

Other operating segments                                               9.9

Supermarkets RSA

The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, inclusive of our LiquorShop 
business, which due to South African COVID-19 lockdown regulations was 
closed for 60 of the 91 days in the quarter, increased sales by 3.3%. 

The Supermarkets RSA segment represented by Shoprite, Usave, Checkers and 
Checkers Hyper continued to report market share gains over the quarter. 
Sales excluding LiquorShop increased by 7.2%. Growth amongst the 
aforementioned brands that make up the segment remains led by our mid-to-
upper end Checkers and Checkers Hyper banner. Internal selling price 
inflation for the quarter measured 4.4%. 

The net store movement for the period for the segment measured 16 new 
stores. Across our three supermarket trading brands Shoprite, Usave, 
Checkers and Checkers Hyper we opened 25 new stores in the quarter: five 
Shoprite stores; two Checkers FreshX stores; one Checkers Hypermarket; eight 
Usave stores (including two Usave eKasi container stores) and nine 
LiquorShops.

Supermarkets Non-RSA

In line with the reporting of our 2020 year-end financials, as a result of 
the ongoing process pertaining to the sale of all or part of Retail 
Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, our Nigerian business remains classified as a 
discontinued operation and as such is not included in the reporting for this 
segment. Negotiations in this regard continue and the Group hopes to 
finalise this transaction during the second half of our current financial 
year. 

Supermarkets Non-RSA's onerous operating paradigm has been impacted further 
by COVID-19 lockdowns and their associated restrictions. Notwithstanding 
this, some countries for example Zambia have traded well, whilst others, 
namely Angola, remain under pressure. Across the board however, an admirable 
performance in local currency for the most part has been eroded by currency 
devaluation, which has negatively impacted translation into our reporting 
currency, the rand, in which sale of merchandise for the quarter declined by 
8.4%.

In terms of store movement over the quarter, three stores were opened (one 
in Zambia, one in Eswatini and one in Lesotho) and three stores were closed 
(two in Angola and one in Kenya). In line with the Group's prior statement 
pertaining to our Kenyan operations we expect to exit our two remaining 
stores by our financial year-end. 

Furniture

The Group's Furniture operating segment made up of OK Furniture and 
House & Home increased sales by 20.6%. The segment remains mostly cash 
sales based with credit sales participation measuring 11.7% of sales for 
the quarter. 

The Group's furniture business continues to consolidate its store base with 
a net closure of seven stores (nine closures and two openings).

Other operating segments

The Group's Other operating segments, made up of OK Franchise, Computicket, 
Transpharm and Medirite Pharmacies as well as Checkers Food Services, 
reported a 9.9% increase in sales. The OK Franchise division increased sales 
by 8.5% with 26 net new stores (36 openings and ten closures).

Outlook 

Pursuant to the finalisation of the terms of the 25 February 2020 SENS, in 
which the Group outlined the establishment of Retail Logistics Fund 
Proprietary Limited, Shoprite Holdings received the cash consideration of 
R1.2 billion during November 2020. This, together with the results of our 
continued focus on working capital, US dollar borrowing reduction and 
measured capital allocation bodes well for continued improvement in the 
Group's net cash position. 

From a digital transformation perspective we continue to execute well on our 
Group wide strategy. Noteworthy in this regard was the successful launch of 
the Group's Xtra Savings Rewards Programme in our Shoprite RSA supermarket 
business during October. This is a milestone event for the Group, timed to 
bring our Shoprite Xtra Savings Rewards Programme customers even more value 
at a time they need it most. To date, our Xtra Savings Rewards Programme has 
surpassed 12 million sign ups, half of which can be attributed to our 
Shoprite customer sign ups since the launch, five weeks ago. The Group's 
Xtra Savings Rewards Programme is an important foundational building block 
for the Group, allowing us to execute on our precision retailing objectives. 

Whilst firmly focussed on our customers, our efforts to future-fit our 
channels continues to gain momentum. Notably, our Checkers Sixty60 one hour 
delivery service has won three top tier innovation awards in the past month 
namely the People's Choice Award and the Best Enterprise Solution at the 
2020 MTN Business App of the Year Awards, as well as the 2020 BCX Digital 
Innovation Award in the Corporate category. Furthermore, the accolade of 
Best Convenience and Grocery Store of the Decade in the 22nd annual Sunday 
Times Top Brands survey awarded to Shoprite earlier this month was a great 
honour and an achievement of which we are very proud.

It is pleasing to report that from last week (12 November 2020) the South 
African nationwide lockdown regulations pertaining to the restriction of 
off-consumption liquor trade were lifted. The result of this is that our 
sizable retail LiquorShop business, previously restricted from trading over 
weekends and mid-week after 5pm, is now able to trade seven days a week. 
This is a meaningful change for the Group and comes at a significant time as 
we begin our important festive season period. 

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or 
reported on by the Group's external auditors.

Group results for the year ended 28 June 2020


Pieter Engelbrecht, Chief Executive Officer

In a challenging year we are proud to report the Group's 6.4% increase in 
sales to a record R156.9 billion. Despite significant COVID-19 lockdown 
restrictions impacting the Group to varying degrees, our core Supermarkets 
RSA operating segment increased sales by 8.7%, representing a R9.8 billion 
increase to R122.4 billion. Our Supermarkets Non-RSA continuing operations' 
sales declined by 1.4% in rand terms, however, it increased by 6.6% in 
constant currency terms.

As evidenced by our results, our core business, Supermarkets RSA, made up of 
Shoprite, Usave, Checkers and Checkers Hyper, remained focused on their 
respective customer segments and continued to execute on their value 
proposition. Pleasingly, our South African supermarket business reported 
2.3% volume growth, coupled with 16 months of consecutive market share gains 
up to and including June 2020. It was without doubt a milestone year 
strategically, with the successful launch of our industry first digital 
shopping application Checkers Sixty60 and our Checkers Xtra Savings Rewards 
Programme, which ended the year with 4.7 million customers registered. 

As previously articulated, the Group has embarked on a process to consider 
the sale of either a majority stake or the entire shareholding in our 
Nigeria subsidiary and, as required by IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations, it is now reported as a discontinued 
operation. Overall, it has been a difficult six months for Supermarkets Non-
RSA given lockdown regulations which impacted store openings, days and hours 
of trade, as well as severely restricting transport in some countries, 
impeding our employees and customers' ability to get to our stores.

Notwithstanding lockdown regulations resulting in the closure of our 
furniture and liquor stores, the Group reported a 20 basis point increase in 
trading margin to 5.3% after adjusting for the impact of hyperinflation. 
This is a considerable achievement and is a result of excellent sales 
growth, improved gross margin and commendable expense management, despite 
significant COVID-19 related costs. 

We approached COVID-19 lockdown conservatively given our view of the 
economic contraction and job losses that would follow in what can only be 
described as a devastating year for South Africa. In doing so we prioritised 
two things - the health and safety of our employees and customers and the 
preservation of jobs for our people. 

2020 was a team effort across the business, executing day-to-day operational 
excellence whilst delivering on a number of strategic initiatives. I am, as 
such, very proud of Shoprite, our people and these results.

Operational and voluntary trading update (52 weeks ended 28 June 2020) 


Trading environment

This operational update, inclusive of voluntary earnings per share (EPS) and 
headline earnings per share (HEPS) guidance, is more comprehensive than 
usual for the purpose of providing shareholders and investors with an 
understanding of how the Group has traded during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Despite difficult circumstances, in a year incorporating the COVID-19 
lockdown and accompanying regulations governing trade, transport and 
operations, the Group increased total sale of merchandise for the 52 weeks 
to 28 June 2020 (including the impact of hyperinflation in the prior year) 
by 6.4% to approximately R156.9 billion. Like-for-like growth for the year 
was 4.4%. 

The Shoprite Group remained committed to meeting the demands of our 
customers, whilst focusing on value and remaining solution oriented. 
This was evidenced, inter alia, by our digital voucher innovation, 
ongoing private label development and the conversion of our Checkers 
Food Services (CFS) business to include a consumer facing offering. In
addition, the rapid scaling of our innovative Checkers Sixty60 digital
shopping application, which after a test phase introduction in November
2019, was operational from 87 stores nationwide by June 2020. 

As a Group, our initiatives pertaining to inventory and capital management 
began early in our financial year and carried on unabated despite the 
nationwide lockdown. From a liquidity and net debt standpoint, the Group has 
managed to meaningfully improve its financial position since reporting in 
February 2020 on our first half results. The transaction involving the sale 
of our distribution centres to Equites Property Fund Limited is in its final 
phase of Competition Commission approval and we anticipate transfer will be 
affected during the first half of the 2021 financial year.

Supermarkets RSA's sales growth (inclusive of liquor) of 8.7% for the year 
was underpinned by a strong second half, in which sales grew 7.5%, 
notwithstanding a high second half base in the prior year during which 
fourth quarter sales grew by 9.4%. As a result of lockdown, customer visits 
for the year declined by 7.4%, however, average basket spend increased by 
18.4%. Superb execution across the business coupled with considerable 
efforts from our suppliers resulted in volume growth of 2.3% for the year. 
Market share figures insofar as they are available (up to the end of 
May 2020) reflect consecutive monthly market share gains for the past 
15 months. 

In equally, if not more difficult circumstances resulting from COVID-19 
lockdown regulations, Supermarkets Non-RSA's second half reported an 
increase in sales of 0.1%, resulting in an overall decline in sales of 1.4% 
for the year but in constant currency increased by 6.6%. 

Nigeria - discontinued operations 

Following approaches from various potential investors, and in line with 
our re-evaluation of the Group's operating model in Nigeria, the Board has
decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all,
or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary 
of Shoprite International Limited. As such, Retail Supermarkets Nigeria
Limited may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports
its results for the year. Any further updates will be provided to the market
at the appropriate time.

The following information provides context to the Group's sales growth for 
the year: 

Supermarkets RSA 

-  The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA (including liquor),
   contributing 78.0% to Group sales, achieved sales growth of 8.7% for
   the year. Like-for-like growth for the year measured 6.8%.

-  Shoprite and Usave reported full year sales growth of 6.7% (second
   half sales growth: 5.7%) and Checkers and Checkers Hyper reported
   full year growth of 13.5% (second half sales growth: 16.1%). 

-  Second half internal inflation of 3.4% increased marginally from the
   2.7% reported for the first six months to average 3.0% for the year. 

-  Our private label business, spanning our three supermarket chains and
   offering better value and range to our customers, managed to increase
   its Supermarkets RSA sales participation to 17.1%, up 60 basis points
   compared to the previous year. 

-  South African COVID-19 lockdown regulations implemented from
   27 March 2020 restricted trade in several categories within our
   supermarket business and as such, impacted the business differently at
   different times. However, across the board, our Checkers, Checkers
   Hyper, Shoprite and Usave brands performed admirably in what can only be
   described as incredibly difficult conditions for both our employees and
   customers. The two weeks preceding South Africa's initial 35 days of
   Level 5 lockdown resulted in elevated sales growth across all three of
   our supermarket brands but noteworthy was the significant growth
   reported by our repositioned mid-to-upper end Checkers (including
   Checkers Hyper) business which now represents 39.6% of Supermarkets
   RSA's sales. 

-  The sales growth momentum achieved in our liquor business during our
   first half continued up to February and accelerated, pre-lockdown,
   during March. COVID-19 lockdown regulations required the complete
   closure of our liquor business for 66 days and subsequently restricted
   trade to four days a week (Monday to Thursday) for the month of June.
   The combined result of a first half during which sales grew by 20.5%
   followed by a second half during which sales declined by 29.5%, 
   resulted in a year in which sales declined by 3.3%. Liquor represents
   5.8% of Supermarkets RSA's sales. 

Supermarkets Non-RSA

-  Given the aforementioned comment regarding the pending classification
   of Nigeria as a discontinued operation, Supermarkets Non-RSA (excluding
   Nigeria) contributing 11.6% to Group sales, recorded a decline in sales
   of 1.4% for the year. 

-  Second half constant currency sales growth of 6.3% was significantly
   impacted by lockdown regulations across the 14 African countries in
   which we trade. Lockdown restrictions pertaining to store closures;
   social distancing; transport restrictions; the movement of people;
   trading hours; workforce limitations and trade in alcohol impacted
   various regions to differing degrees at different times. 

Furniture

-  The Group's Furniture segment, representing 3.5% of Group sales,
   reported a decline in sales of 11.9% for the year. Like-for-like sales
   for the year declined by 10.3%.

-  Second half trade was significantly impacted by lockdown regulations
   which required our South African store base to close for 52 days and
   our Non-RSA regions to close, on average, for 31 days. Consequently,
   second half sales declined by 23.1%. 

-  Debtor book collections were hampered during the lockdown period and
   are expected to deteriorate in line with the anticipated economic
   downturn. The assessment of expected credit losses for the year is in
   the process of being finalised, however, our expectation in accordance
   with IFRS 9: Financial Instruments is that the provision against the
   debtor book will increase from 35.8% to approximately 50.5% compared 
   to the previous year. The movement in the provision equates to an income
   statement charge of approximately R325 million.

Other operating segments

The Group's Other operating segments, representing 6.9% of Group sales 
and comprising OK Franchise, Transpharm, MediRite Pharmacies, CFS and 
Computicket, achieved sales growth of 3.9% for the year. This was achieved 
despite lockdown limitations impacting CFS, given that its primary 
customers (the restaurant and hospitality industry) were closed during 
lockdown, as well as Computicket, with lockdown restrictions having a 
significant impact on events and travel related ticketing. Notwithstanding 
these restrictions, the businesses' ability to adapt and innovate resulted 
in second half sales increasing by 3.5%. 

COVID-19 costs

The Group believes it is appropriate to highlight the COVID-19 costs 
incurred pertaining to compliance with national lockdown regulations 
together with managing and protecting our employees, customers, stores, 
inventory and distribution infrastructure. In this regard, the Group has 
incurred a net total of R327.2 million spent across the areas of health and 
safety, security, mobile clinics, personal protective equipment, temperature 
scanners, store and distribution centre sanitation, employee meals, 
communication costs and remote network access for employees. The most 
significant spend pertained to R116.9 million paid to our employees,
inclusive of an appreciation bonus to assist them with the difficulties we
anticipated would accompany the nationwide lockdown. 

Impairment of non-financial assets 

Impairments for the year approximate R1.3 billion, mainly in the 
Supermarkets Non-RSA and Furniture segments as a result of the deterioration 
in the current and future economic outlook. Impairments, net of income tax, 
form part of items of a capital nature and as such impact EPS but not HEPS.

Voluntary trading update

The following information is supplied in order to assess the impact of the 
impairments raised and the aforementioned COVID-19 costs on the Group's 
results for the year.

Furthermore, due to the potential classification of our Nigerian business as 
a discontinued operation, we present continuing operations excluding Nigeria 
as an alternative. 

For ease of comparison of the like-for-like relative performance of the
operations, we have included an adjusted basic HEPS which excludes 
the after tax effect of exchange rate gains or losses and the impact of
hyperinflation. In addition, we have calculated this metric to exclude 
once-off COVID-19 costs.

Impact of the Group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate the 
Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment performance in terms of sales growth, 
excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this 
information, current year sales for entities reporting in currencies other 
than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR at the prior 
year's actual average exchange rates on a country-by-country basis. 

For the year ended 28 June 2020, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be 
hyperinflationary, whilst it was assessed to be hyperinflationary during the 
prior year ended 30 June 2019. As such, in respect of Angola, the constant 
currency information has been prepared excluding the impact of 
hyperinflation.

The table below sets out the percentage change in sales, based on the actual 
results for the financial year, in reported currency and constant currency 
for the following major currencies. The total impact on Supermarkets Non-RSA 
is also reflected after consolidating all currencies in this segment.

     each year.

     In respect of the undeveloped land at Centurion and Cilmor, the Lease Agreements will contain
     provisions relating to the future development of such undeveloped land, in terms of which Equites
     will be appointed as the developer and the JVCo will fund the development.

     The effective date of the Proposed Transaction will be the date on which the last of the conditions
     contained in the Heads of Agreement has been fulfilled, which is expected to be during May 2020.

SHOPRITE HOLDINGS: UNAUDITED GROUP RESULTS FOR THE 26 WEEKS TO 29 DECEMBER 2019


Pieter Engelbrecht, chief executive officer

We are very proud to report the Group's 7.0% increase in merchandise sales 

for the six months to 29 December 2019. The R81.2 billion in sales was 

achieved on the back of 4.4% growth in volume of products sold and 2.1% 

growth in the number of customers. EBITDA, a more comparable measure after 

the adoption of IFRS 16: Leases, increased by 5.3% to R6.8 billion. This was 

a satisfactory performance given the 1.1% market share gains to 31.6% in 

Supermarkets RSA which achieved sales growth of 9.8%.



Our Group strategy to capture a larger share of South Africa's premium food 

retail segment continues to be one of our drivers of growth as reflected 

particularly in the Checkers brand, together with Hypers, growing sales by 

11.2%. It's been an exciting six months for the Checkers brand with 

significant milestones reached in support of our long-term growth strategy. 

The Xtra Savings Rewards Programme was launched in October and has been very 

well received with 3.8 million customers having already signed up. In 

another first for South African Supermarkets, our pioneering one hour 

grocery delivery service, Sixty60, was launched in November in 8 stores. 

Although, still in the early stages, we believe this mobile e-commerce 

solution offering unrivalled convenience for shoppers holds much promise.



Our Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment, comprising operations in 14 

countries across the African continent, recorded positive sales growth of 

4.8% in constant currency terms. Sales declined by 3.1% in rand terms.



The Group's trading margin of 5.0% remained strong, underpinned by an 8.7% 

increase in gross margin and effective cost control. 



Outside of our retail operations, our focus is increasingly on our 

environment, governance, social responsibility and our continued goal to 

improve the lives of the people in key Shoprite communities. We remain

pleased to report that despite the current difficult economic climate,

Shoprite continued to create new jobs and participate in the YES

(Youth Employment Service) programme.

IMPLEMENTATION OF IFRS 16: LEASES


The purpose of this announcement is to communicate Shoprite Holdings' 

adoption of IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) effective for financial years 

beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group hereby publishes its 

restated 30 June 2019 financial results accordingly. 



IFRS 16 is a new financial reporting standard on leases replacing the 

previous IAS 17: Leases (IAS 17), requiring an accounting change. The main 

objective of IFRS 16 is to recognise and reflect a company's lease 

obligations in its financial statements by aligning the accounting and 

presentation of operating leased assets with those of owned and finance 

leased assets. 



The Group has adopted the new standard with effect from 1 July 2019 using 

the full retrospective approach. Accordingly, the Group's 30 June 2019 

comparative financial results have been restated from a transition date of 

2 July 2018. 



IFRS 16 has a significant impact on the presentation and classification of 

the statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, the 

statement of cash flows and certain key performance metrics. However, it has 

no impact on the Group's underlying economic model, revenue or net cash 

flow. 



The application of IFRS 16 requires the majority of the Group's leased 

property, vehicles, machinery and equipment and other small item leased 

assets to be brought onto the statement of financial position in accordance 

with the aforementioned approach. The Group has elected not to recognise 

right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets and 

short-term leases. The Group defines low-value assets, as assets with a cost 

price below R75 000. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment. Short-term 

leases comprise equipment and vehicle leases with a term of 12 months or 

less.



On the statement of financial position, IFRS 16 requires the recognition of 

a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset. At the 

commencement date of a qualifying lease, the lease liability and 

corresponding asset are raised by discounting future lease payments. 

Management uses the rate implicit in the lease for vehicle leases and the 

lessee's incremental borrowing rate for all other leases. Whilst the lease 

liability and right-of-use asset are initially recognised at the same value, 

except in the case of prepaid leases, they reduce differently over the lease 

term as explained herein. 



On the statement of comprehensive income, IFRS 16 replaces the previously 

recognised straight-line rental expense required under IAS 17 with a 

straight-line depreciation charge over the shorter of the underlying assets' 

useful life and the lease term. The right-of-use asset therefore reduces by 

the depreciation charge. The IFRS 16 lease liability results in an implied 

interest charge on the outstanding lease liability. The lease liability 

reduces over the term of the lease by the value of the lease payments, net 

of the implied interest charge, as payments are made. It is for this reason 

that IFRS 16 is dilutive to profit before tax and earnings per share at the 

initial stages of a lease and accretive at the end of the lease. However,

over the term of the lease, the finance charges and depreciation will equal

the rental payments. 



In accordance with IAS 36: Impairment of assets, on recognition and at each 

reporting date, the right-of-use asset is subject to impairment testing and 

any such impairments are classified under items of a capital nature in the 

statement of comprehensive income.



The impact of the IFRS 16 adoption on the Group's 30 June 2019 results is 

summarised as follows:



On the statement of financial position:

-  An IFRS 16 lease liability of R21.5 billion and right-of-use asset 

   of R15.7 billion has been raised; 

-  Retained earnings has been reduced by R4.0 billion inclusive of a 

   R3.3 billion adjustment to opening retained earnings on 2 July 2018; 

-  A deferred income tax asset of R1.0 billion has been raised. This is 

   due to temporary differences between the lease liability and right-of-use

   asset;

-  Trade and other receivables decreased by R0.8 billion due to a

   reclassification of prepaid leases to right-of-use assets; and

-  The fixed escalation operating lease accrual and onerous lease 

   provision of R1.5 billion has been derecognised. 



On the statement of comprehensive income:

-  Group sales and gross profit are unaffected;

-  Depreciation increased by R2.5 billion due to the creation of the 

   right-of-use asset;

-  Operating lease expense declined by R4.2 billion as a result of the

   derecognition of the IAS 17 straight-line rental expense;

-  There was an increase in the net monetary gain on the creation of the

   right-of-use asset. It is important to note that these restated results

   still apply hyperinflation accounting in accordance with IAS 29:

   Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies;

-  Group trading profit increased by R1.7 billion;

-  Exchange rate losses increased by R0.5 billion mainly due to the Group's

   US dollar leases. From the 2020 financial year, the Group will apply net

   investment hedge accounting to reduce this impact; 

-  Items of a capital nature increased by R0.4 billion as a result of the

   required annual impairment testing on the right-of-use asset created;

-  Finance costs increased by R1.8 billion. This is due to the implied

   interest charge raised on the aforementioned R21.5 billion IFRS 16 lease

   liability; 

-  Group profit before tax declined by R1.0 billion to R5.4 billion; and

-  Previously reported diluted headline earnings per share of 779.9c

   decreased by 81.4c to 698.5c. 



On the statement of cash flows:

-  Lease payments which were previously included in operating activities

   are now allocated between principle and finance costs. The principle

   lease payments are included in financing activities and the finance cost

   remains in operating activities;

-  The Group's net cash flow is not affected; and

-  Dividends paid are not affected. 



The application of IFRS 16 does not impact the Group's underlying business, 

operations, liquidity or cash flow. It also does not affect the Group's 

business strategy on leasing or otherwise. 



The complete restated comparative financial information for the 2019 

financial year included in Annexure A is the responsibility of the directors 

of Shoprite Holdings. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only 

and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors.



The Group is hosting an IFRS 16 briefing webcast call on 18 February 2020. 

It will be hosted by the Group chief financial officer, Anton de Bruyn,

and will follow the format of a short presentation followed by an

opportunity for questions and answers. Registration will be via

http://www.corpcam.com/shoprite18022020. The presentation will be available on

the company website www.shopriteholdings.co.za shortly before the webcast 

begins.

and product volumes by 4.4%.

On a segmental basis, approximate sales for the six months to December 2019 were as follows:

The following provides context to the overall sales growth for the six months:

    -   The Group's core business, Supermarkets RSA, achieved sales growth of 9.8% for the period.
            -  Internal selling price inflation moderated from 3.0% during the first quarter to 2.4%
               in the second quarter, resulting in internal selling price inflation of 2.7% for the six
               months.
            -  All three supermarket brands, Shoprite, Checkers and Usave, traded well in a tough
               market.
            -  Liquor sales remained strong, with sales growing 20.5%.
    -   Supermarkets Non-RSA recorded a decline in sales of 3.1% in rand terms.
            -  We have continued to experience ongoing currency devaluations and volatility in key
               markets in which we trade. The Angolan kwanza weakened by 40.6% against the US
               dollar since June 2019. During the reporting period, the Angolan kwanza, Zambian
               kwacha and Nigerian naira depreciated 40.4%, 20.8% and 18.2% respectively against
               the US dollar when compared to the previous year.
            -  Constant currency growth measured 4.8%.
    -   The Furniture Division's sales declined 2.7% for the six months to 29 December 2019,
        impacted by a reduction in the store base of 13 net stores over the period; load shedding in
        South Africa and currency devaluations in certain Non-RSA countries.
    -   Other operating segments which include OK Franchise, Computicket, MediRite Pharmacies,
        Transpharm and Checkers Food Services grew sales by 4.4%. The period included a 6-week
        strike in Transpharm, the Group's pharmaceutical wholesale business. OK Franchise's growth
        for the six months to 29 December 2019 measured 7.5%.

For the six months to 29 December 2019 the Group added a net 66 stores to its supermarket business
to end the period with 1 911 stores. Franchise added a net 10 stores to end December with 470 stores.

Shareholders are advised that this update does not constitute an earnings forecast. The figures and
information contained herein have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors.

The Group's interim results for the six months ended 29 December 2019 are scheduled for release on

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Impact of Angola hyperinflation adjustment in comparative period

For the comparative period ended 30 December 2018, the Angolan economy was assessed to be
hyperinflationary. As such, it required the application of hyperinflation accounting.

For the six months ended 29 December 2019, the Angolan economy was assessed not to be
hyperinflationary. As such, the current period's results do not require the application of hyperinflation
accounting.

In order to facilitate the comparison of the current period's results, the table below outlines the pro
forma financial information for the comparative prior period, excluding the impact of hyperinflation.

The financial impact of hyperinflation on the prior period's turnover was as follows:
