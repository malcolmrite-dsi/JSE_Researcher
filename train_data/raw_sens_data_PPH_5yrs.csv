REVIEWED ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


Pepkor achieves substantial market share gains during the COVID-19 pandemic

The Pepkor group achieved an exceptional performance during a challenging year as COVID-19
and the resultant lockdown protocols exacerbated an already weak consumer retail market.
Despite having lost approximately R5.0 billion in revenue through COVID-19 trading restrictions,
the group managed to achieve positive revenue growth for the year which is an outstanding result.

The group’s defensive discount and value positioning has been an advantage during the tough
economic conditions. Consumer focus on less discretionary and more affordable products and
services resulted in substantial market share gains. Pepkor’s strong corporate culture and
execution ability ensured a swift response to the COVID-19 crisis with stores and the supply chain
reacting very quickly to the challenging environment. The group’s expansive store footprint
appealed to customers who chose to shop in more convenient locations closer to home.

The group adopted IFRS 16 – Leases during the current year, using a modified retrospective
approach with no restatement of prior period reported results. This had a material impact on the
group’s statutory results for the current period. To form a meaningful assessment of group
performance, shareholders and noteholders are referred to Pepkor’s full results announcement,
available on the Pepkor website at www.pepkor.co.za.


Group highlights for the year

-    Revenue from continuing operations increased by 3.6% to R63.7 billion
-    Market share growth of 240 basis points in clothing, footwear and homeware products
     as reported by the Retailers’ Liaison Committee
-    Cash generated of R9.2 billion (excluding IFRS 16)
-    Net debt reduced by R6.9 billion (excluding IFRS 16)
-    230 new stores opened

Earnings were impacted by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of R4.8 billion (as
announced on 6 November 2020). The impairment is a result of the impact of COVID-19 and
constrained future growth expectations in PEP Africa, Speciality, Tekkie Town and the JD Group,
in addition to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.

As communicated during the group’s interim results published on 27 May 2020, no dividend is
declared for the year ended 30 September 2020 (20.9 cents in the prior year), based on
heightened levels of prudence applied by the board and the focus on liquidity preservation and
allocation of resources.


Performance and outlook

Pepkor’s sales performance since the relaxation of lockdown measures has been excellent and
has underscored the strength of its business model and market positioning. The group has gained
significant market share in the period since May 2020. The strong sales momentum continued
into the months of October and November 2020 with double-digit like-for-like sales growth
reported in PEP, Ackermans, Speciality and the JD Group. Providing the South African consumer
with affordable products has become even more important in the current environment and the
group is ideally positioned to execute on this.

While the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact in the near to medium
term remains uncertain, there is an expectation that the toughest times for the economy and
customers are still to come as unemployment increases and special grants and other benefits are
reduced. Our view on the future remains cautious and conservative.
Cash generation has been excellent and the balance sheet has been significantly strengthened
which provides security and the ability to capitalise on potential opportunities that may arise in the
market. Significant progress was made in restructuring and consolidating the group’s portfolio of
operations to enhance efficiency and profitability levels.

Pepkor is well positioned to continue gaining market share in a future constrained retail
environment. The group will continue to entrench its discount and value positioning through
providing affordable products to the consumer as it stands to benefit from consumers in search
of value.

The resolve, resilience and loyalty shown by the group’s employees and customers during one of
the most challenging periods in history is most encouraging. The strong and healthy corporate
cultures of the group and its retail brands have helped sustain the business during this trying time
and resulted in a commendable, market-leading performance for the year. The support and
understanding from our loyal, long-standing suppliers and business partners have been
invaluable, and similarly we value the support from our investors.

The group’s operations are prepared for changes in consumer behaviour with accelerated
progress in e-commerce and fintech capability, supplemented by its convenient and accessible
retail store footprint. The group continues to identify opportunities for store expansion driven
mainly by PEP and Ackermans, in addition to the development of new retail formats. In terms of
new markets, exciting opportunities exist in the adult wear market, while the group will also
consider other expansion opportunities.

CHAIRMAN OF PEPKOR

In accordance with paragraph 3.59(c) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, the board
of directors of the Company (“the Board”) wishes to advise shareholders that the current
Chairman of Pepkor, Mr. Jayendra Naidoo, who has been in office since August 2017, has
advised the Board that he will not make himself available for re-election as Chairman when
his term ends on 30 November 2020.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leon Lourens, said “Jayendra has led the Board
since the Company's listing in 2017 and has played a central role in enabling the Company
to navigate a challenging period, commencing with listing in 2017, managing the implications
for Pepkor arising from the Steinhoff crisis, and lately managing the prolonged impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has emerged in a much stronger position and the Board
thanks Jayendra for his service and wise leadership during his tenure as Chairman. We look
forward to his continued contribution as a non-executive director of the Board.”

Mr. Naidoo commented that “Given the positive progress and stability of Pepkor, and other
considerations, amongst others, the current state of litigation involving Pepkor’s major
shareholder and a company related to myself, I believe it is appropriate for the next term of
three years that the Company is led by an independent Chairman.”

A process is underway for the Board to appoint a new Chairman. Shareholders will be kept
advised of developments.

Voluntary Trading Update And Updated Trading Statement For The Year Ended 30 September 2020,6 Nov 2020,"Voluntary Trading Update And Updated Trading Statement For The Year Ended 30 September 2020

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE AND UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR
ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020



VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE

The aim of this voluntary trading update is to provide shareholders and noteholders with an
appreciation of the performance of the group and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
group and its operations. This trading update covers the financial year ended 30 September 2020
(“FY20”) and follows the previous trading update published on 24 July 2020 which covered the
nine months ended 30 June 2020 (“Nine-month Trading Update”).

Trading conditions since the relaxation of national lockdown measures have favoured Pepkor’s
defensive discount and value positioning. This resulted in the exceptional outcome of achieving
revenue growth in FY20 compared to the prior year.

The group’s focus on less discretionary and more affordable products and services has resulted
in substantial market share gains. Pepkor’s retail brands benefited from consumers seeking value
while its expansive store footprint appealed to customers choosing to shop in more convenient
locations closer to their homes.

Group revenue including discontinued operations increased by 1.9% to R70.9 billion compared
to R69.6 billion in the prior financial year ended 30 September 2019 (“FY19”). Revenue from
continuing operations increased by 3.6% to R63.7 billion (FY19: R61.5 billion).

The trade restrictions imposed in terms of the national lockdown prevented retail stores from
trading and revenue of approximately R5.0 billion was lost during the five-week level-5 lockdown
period. Further trading restrictions resulted in the group not being able to trade in its full
merchandise range until June 2020.

Discontinued operations

As per the 4 August 2020 SENS announcement, the group’s portfolio strategy to focus on its core
business resulted in the decision to dispose of The Building Company. Pepkor’s Building materials
reporting segment, in its entirety, will therefore be classified as discontinued operations in the
group’s FY20 financial results. The Building Company contributed c.10% to FY20 group revenue
(including revenue from discontinued operations).

Discontinued operations further include Pep Africa’s operations in Zimbabwe following the
decision in FY19 to exit the country. The exit from Zimbabwe was concluded on
30 September 2020.

Clothing and general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported an increase in revenue of 1.4% for the
year to R45.6 billion. This includes revenue growth of 12.1% during the fourth quarter, recovering
from a 15.9% decline reported during the third quarter.

Pep and Ackermans in aggregate, reported an increase in sales of 2.6% with a decrease in like-
for-like sales of 0.5% for FY20. Retail space expanded by 2.5% year-on-year as new store
openings slowed during the second half of the year. Pep and Ackermans opened 145 new stores
during the year.

Lower credit sales in Ackermans resulted in a reduction in the credit sales contribution to 17%
from 19% in FY19. Notwithstanding good collections, provision levels on the Tenacity credit book
were increased to 22% from 17% in FY19.

In Pep Africa’s continuing operations, constant currency sales declined by 7.0%, while like-for-
like sales decreased by 9.6%. Weakening currencies resulted in a decrease of 16.2% in sales at
actual rates.

The Speciality business reported a decrease in sales of 3.6% with like-for-like sales decreasing
by 4.6% for the year.

Furniture, appliances and electronics

The furniture, appliance and electronics segment reported revenue growth of 1.4% to R9.5 billion
for the year. Merchandise sales for the year decreased by 0.4% with a decrease in like-for-like
sales of 1.6%.

Curtailed credit granting and good post-lockdown collections resulted in a reduction in the gross
Connect credit book from R1.8 billion at 31 March 2020 to R1.6 billion at 30 September 2020.
Total credit sales contribution reduced from 19% in FY19 to 13%, most notably in the furniture
division where the credit sales mix reduced to 20% (FY19: 27%). Credit book provision levels
were increased to 42% compared to 33% in FY19.

* As reported in the Nine-month Trading Update

The FLASH business achieved strong growth during the fourth quarter. Virtual turnover in the
informal trader business increased by 25.7% for the year.

Collections on the Capfin credit book exceeded expectations and conservative credit granting
resulted in the gross Capfin credit book reducing to R1.9 billion at 30 September 2020 from
R2.6 billion at 31 March 2020. The credit book provision level was increased to 26% from 15% in
the prior year.

* As reported in the Nine-month Trading Update


Balance sheet and liquidity

The trading performance resulted in lower inventory levels and very strong cash generation. This,
in addition to the accelerated bookbuild completed in June 2020 which raised R1.9 billion, enabled
the group to reduce net debt from R14.1 billion at 31 March 2020 to c.R7.0 billion at
30 September 2020 (excluding the adoption of IFRS 16).

Substantial progress was therefore made to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the Pepkor
balance sheet.


UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, a listed company is required to publish a
trading statement once it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that its results
will differ by at least 20% compared to FY19.

Pepkor published an initial Trading Statement on SENS on 15 October 2020 advising
shareholders and noteholders that a reasonable degree of certainty existed that Pepkor’s FY20
earning per share (“EPS”) and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) results would decrease by
at least 20% compared to the previous corresponding period. Pepkor is now able to provide an
updated trading statement.

The following aspects will impact Pepkor’s FY20 results and have been communicated as part of
previous results announcements and/or trading updates:

    1. Adoption of IFRS 16: Leases

The group adopted IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) on 1 October 2019 using a modified retrospective
approach with no restatement of the FY19 reported results. The adoption of IFRS 16 will have a
negative impact on Pepkor’s results.

    2. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted performance of the group in many areas, most notably
through lost sales and increased credit book provision levels. The uncertainty surrounding the
longer term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the group’s forecasting ability.
Pepkor has therefore applied a conservative approach in areas such as capital allocation and
expenditure.

The conservative outlook further contributed to the impairment of carrying values of goodwill and
intangible assets. Following the completion of impairment assessments an impairment of
R4.8 billion will be recognised in FY20 and is allocated to the respective operations as indicated
in the table below.

The impairment is a result of constrained future growth expectations in Pep Africa, Speciality,

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2020 AND LIQUIDITY
UPDATE

Trading statement

In terms of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements (the “Requirements”), a listed company
is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes aware that a reasonable degree
of certainty exists that the financial results for the financial period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from the financial results for the previous corresponding period.

As reported in the Group’s interim results published on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service
(“SENS”) on 27 May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a negative impact on the
Group’s performance and results for the year ending 30 September 2020. The unprecedented
circumstances and volatile trading environment continue to impact the Group’s forecasting ability.

Pepkor hereby advises shareholders and noteholders that a reasonable degree of certainty exists
that its earnings per share (“EPS”) and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the year ending
30 September 2020 will decrease by at least 20%.

    -   EPS is expected to decrease by at least 12.5 cents per share (20%) when compared to
        the EPS of 62.6 cents reported for the year ended 30 September 2019 (the “Previous
        Period”); and

    -   HEPS is expected to decrease by at least 19.4 cents per share (20%) when compared to
        the HEPS of 96.8 cents reported for the Previous Period.

The decrease in EPS and HEPS can be attributed to the following factors:

    1. The Group implemented IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) on 1 October 2019 using a modified
       retrospective approach with no restatement of prior period reported results; and
                                                                                                        
    2. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the performance in many areas of
       the Group, most notably through lost sales and increased provision levels on credit books.
       This has contributed to the likely impairment of carrying values of goodwill and intangible
       assets.

Further guidance as to the range by which the EPS and HEPS are likely to decrease will be
provided once the required degree of certainty in terms of the Requirements has been
established.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Company's external auditors.


Liquidity update

As stated in the Trading Update published on SENS on 24 July 2020, the Group’s liquidity
benefited from strong trading since the relaxation of lockdown measures, pro-active expense
management, conservative credit granting, better-than-expected credit book collections and the
successful completion of an accelerated bookbuild which raised R1.9 billion.

This allowed early settlement of the R1.5 billion bridge term loan facility which was due for
repayment in August 2020 and early settlement of R4.0 billion of the total R6.0 billion preference
share funding due to mature in May 2022. The Group has made significant progress in its ambition
to degear the balance sheet and there is therefore no risk of debt covenants being breached at
30 September 2020.

The process to refinance R5.0 billion in debt due for repayment in May 2021 was successfully
concluded and implemented on 30 September 2020, and the debt is now repayable in September
2023. In addition, the R1.0 billion bridge revolving credit facility originally due to expire in
November 2021, has been extended to September 2023.

As part of the same process, debt covenants were amended to create sufficient headroom and
enhanced flexibility going forward.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUILDING COMPANY
PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“TBC”)

1. INTRODUCTION
    Pepkor shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has entered into a sale and purchase
    agreement with Cashbuild Limited (“Cashbuild”), for the disposal of the entire issued share capital of
    Pepkor’s wholly owned subsidiary, TBC, subject to the conditions precedent set out in paragraph 3.2
    below (“the Proposed Transaction”). Shareholders are referred to the earlier announcement made
    today by Cashbuild.

2. RATIONALE
    The Proposed Transaction will enable Pepkor to streamline its portfolio of businesses and focus on its
    core business of discount and value retail.
    Following a prolonged period of corporate activity that included various acquisitions, TBC has done well
    to restructure and consolidate the business. It has made significant progress in defining its value
    proposition, establishing a strong corporate culture, clarifying strategy and prioritising a central
    procurement strategy.
    With an attractive portfolio of established and well-known brands, the Proposed Transaction will ensure
    that, as part of Cashbuild, TBC will be strategically better placed for future growth.
    It is envisaged that Pepkor will use the net disposal proceeds to further reduce debt in line with the
    Group’s ambition to reduce its gearing levels to enhance the flexibility of its capital structure.

3. TERMS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    3.1 Purchase price
        The total consideration payable by Cashbuild on closing of the Proposed Transaction will be
        R1,074,700,000 (the “Purchase Consideration”) subject to:

        - an escalation rate of 5.5% per annum from 1 January 2021 until the Proposed Transaction
          closing date; and
        - the sum of the Purchase Consideration and the total escalation not exceeding
          R1,119,700,000.

    3.2 Conditions precedent
        The implementation of the Proposed Transaction is, subject to the fulfillment of, inter alia, the
        following principal conditions precedent:

        -   Regulatory approvals, including Competition Authorities, being obtained; and
        -   Cashbuild’s debt financing agreements being duly executed and becoming unconditional.

4. CATEGORISATION OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    The Proposed Transaction is uncategorised in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and this
    announcement has been voluntarily disclosed by the Company.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

The Pepkor group’s revenue for the nine months ended 30 June 2020 (“nine-month period”) decreased by
1.5% to R52.3 billion. This compares to revenue growth of 6.5% achieved for the six months ended
31 March 2020 and therefore highlights the negative impact of COVID-19 and the national lockdown during
the third quarter where group revenue reduced by 17.2%.

It is estimated that the national lockdown period during April 2020 resulted in lost revenue of approximately
R5.0 billion for the group. Very strong trade was achieved during May and June 2020 as lockdown
measures eased and can be attributed to pent-up demand, social grant payments as well as the value
propositions and market positioning of the group’s brands.

Continuing operations

Clothing and general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported a decrease in revenue of 1.7% for the nine-month
period, negatively impacted by a decrease in revenue of 15.9% during the third quarter.

Sales levels for Pep and Ackermans were very positive during May and June 2020 after stores reopened.
Trading proved resilient due to their defensive discount and value market positioning as consumers
prioritise apparel spending in areas such as babies’ and children’s clothing with focus on basic and
replenishment products. The national lockdown regulations impacted the reopening of schools which
resulted in weak back-to-school trading.

For the nine-month period the Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate, reported a decrease in sales of
0.4% with a decrease in like-for-like sales of 3.5%. Retail space expanded by 3.1% year-on-year with 22
new store openings during the third quarter.

The performance of Pep Africa, which contributes less than 3% to group revenue, was impacted by
lockdowns and adverse macroeconomic conditions across most countries of operation. For the nine-month
period constant currency sales declined by 11.5%, while like-for-like sales decreased by 14.0%. Sales at
actual rates decreased by 19.8%.
                                                                                                          
The Speciality business which focuses on discretionary products such as footwear and adult apparel,
performed well during May and June 2020 with positive like-for-like sales growth of 6.3% and 11.2%
respectively. For the nine-month period sales decreased by 7.4% with like-for-like sales reducing by 9.8%.

1) As reported in the trading update published on 23 June 2020 on the JSE Limited Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”), following the reopening of stores, like-for-like sales for the last four trading weeks of May
2020 increased by 40.3% in Pep and Ackermans in aggregate and by 27.5% in Speciality.
Note that Pep Africa is excluded from the table above.

Furniture, appliances and electronics

The JD Group reported a decline in revenue of 6.0% for the nine-month period which includes a decrease
of 21.8% during the third quarter. Sales for the nine-month period decreased by 7.6% with a decrease in
like-for-like sales of 9.5%.

The consumer electronics and appliances division (Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corp) resumed online
trading during May 2020 on a limited product range in line with lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations
were lifted from June 2020 and trading in this division has been very strong, benefiting from the group’s
investment in online retail capabilities and strong consumer demand which was fueled by technology
upgrades, work/school-from-home and online purchase trends.

The furniture division’s retail brands were only allowed to resume trading from June 2020 but have also
shown strong trading momentum since then.

Credit granting criteria were tightened and the respective credit sales contributions in the furniture- and
consumer electronics and appliances divisions reduced to 22% and 6% respectively compared to 28% and
7% contributions reported for the prior nine-month period.

The Building Company reported a decline in sales of 17.2% for the nine-month period. During the third
quarter sales reduced by 41.9% and like-for-like sales decreased by 41.6%. Lockdown regulations severely
constrained trading during April and May 2020 where the business was only permitted to trade on a very
limited product range. The business was permitted to trade on its full product range since June 2020 in line
with the reopening of the construction industry and has since seen a positive trajectory in trading
momentum.

The FLASH business with its penetration into the informal market operated throughout the lockdown period
and reported strong virtual turnover growth of 28.8% for the quarter.

Significantly curtailed credit granting characterised the quarter as the group reduced its exposure to
unsecured lending through the Capfin business. Collections have been above expectation to date while a
consolidation process is underway to reduce Capfin’s operating cost structure and support profitability going
forward.

Liquidity update

Strong trading, pro-active expense management, conservative credit granting and positive credit book
collections have benefited group liquidity and seasonal funding facilities secured as a contingency during
the lockdown period were not utilised. The group settled its R521 million bridge term loan facility earlier
than anticipated.

As announced on 24 June 2020, Pepkor successfully completed an accelerated bookbuild which raised
R1.9 billion. The book was oversubscribed by 5.3 times, indicating strong demand from more than 60 local
and international investors. The group issued 172.5 million new Pepkor shares at R11.00 per share which
reflected a discount of 6.2% to the 30-day volume weighted average price. The proceeds will be used to
reduce debt in line with the group’s ambition to reduce its gearing levels.
                                                                                                           
Processes to amend debt covenants and extend the group’s debt repayment profile are progressing well
as the group continues to improve liquidity and reduce debt levels to enhance the flexibility of its capital
structure.

Outlook

Strong trading momentum continued into July 2020. It is uncertain how long these levels of performance
are possible as the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and employment unfolds. The group is expecting
a constrained retail environment over the next 18 months.

The group will continue to focus on its aggressive growth in market share as consumers are forced to
reduce and reprioritise spending. It will capitalise on its defensive discount and value positioning as its retail
brands continue to execute compelling customer value propositions and focus on providing affordable value
to customers. Pepkor’s expansive retail footprint is also proving to be highly accessible to customers who
are choosing to shop closer to home.

Pepkor continues to make a positive difference in the lives of our customers and the communities in which
we operate by providing convenient access to everyday products and services at affordable prices.

Pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Pepkor group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate Pep Africa’s performance
in terms of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this information,

RESULTS OF ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING OF PEPKOR HOLDINGS LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES

RESULTS
Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News
Service of the JSE Limited (the “JSE”) on 23 June 2020, relating to the issue of 172,500,000
new ordinary no par value shares in the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company
(the “Placement Shares”) through an accelerated bookbuild (the “Bookbuild”) under and in
accordance with the Company’s existing general authority to issue shares for cash, granted
by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 11 March 2020 (the ""Placement"").
Pepkor is pleased to announce the successful completion of the Bookbuild. The Placement
Shares were issued at a price of R11.00 per share, a 6.2% discount to the pre-launch 30
business day volume weighted average price of R11.73 per share as at market close on
23 June 2020, in compliance with section 5.52(d) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE.

The Placement raised gross proceeds of R1.9 billion for the Company.
The Placement Shares being issued represent in aggregate 4.95% of the Company's issued
ordinary share capital prior to the Placement. The Placement Shares when issued will be fully
paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing ordinary shares in
issue, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid
after the date of issue of the Placement Shares.

An application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the Placement Shares. Subject to
approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placement Shares are expected to occur on the
JSE on Monday, 29 June 2020, and dealings in the Placement Shares are expected to
commence at the same time.
Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International Plc acted as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the Placement
(the “Bookrunners”).

USE OF PROCEEDS
The proceeds from the Placement will be used specifically to:
   •   reduce Pepkor’s current gearing level to move towards its stated target of 1 times net
       debt-to-EBITDA. As of March 2020, the Company’s gearing ratio is 1.7 times.;
   •   support securing of the business against the current and future uncertainties from both
       a macro and economic perspective; and
   •   provide investors with an opportunity to invest in the future growth and success of
       Pepkor.

The Placement is a precautionary measure to strengthen Pepkor’s financial flexibility and
liquidity position in the light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting macro-
economic pressure. In addition to other cash-saving initiatives already undertaken by the
Group, the Placement will help Pepkor to further enhance the liquidity profile and increase
resilience of its balance sheet, should a more negative macro-economic scenario realise.

LAUNCH OF AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING OF PEPKOR HOLDINGS LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES AND UPDATE ON TRADING AND LIQUIDITY

INTRODUCTION
Pepkor announces its intention to conduct a non pre-emptive placing of up to 172.5 million
ordinary shares in the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company
(the ""Placement Shares"") to certain institutional investors (the ""Placement""), which
represents up to 4.95% of the Company's existing issued ordinary shares. The Placement
Shares will be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its existing general
authority to issue shares for cash, granted by shareholders at the annual general meeting of
the Company held on 11 March 2020.
The Placement is being conducted via an accelerated bookbuild process (the ""Bookbuild""),
which will be launched immediately following this announcement.
Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International Plc are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the Placement
(the “Bookrunners”).

RATIONALE AND USE OF PROCEEDS
While Pepkor's trading following the relaxation of lockdown measures in South Africa on
1 May 2020 has exceeded expectations, the duration and evolution of COVID-19, and the
related impact on the economy and the Group’s trading in the near to medium term remains
uncertain.
Pepkor is continuously assessing various scenarios to ensure that it takes the appropriate
financial and operational actions to reduce costs, conserve cash, access liquidity and improve
flexibility in its capital structure during these unprecedented times.
Key short-term interventions implemented by management to protect the business have
included:
-   reduced operating expenditure;
-   reduced capital expenditure;
-   significantly curtailed credit granting with a focus on collections; and
-   suspension of the dividend payment for the current year.

The proceeds from the Placement will be used specifically to:
-   reduce Pepkor’s current gearing level to move towards its stated target of 1 times net debt-
    to-EBITDA. As of March 2020, the Company’s gearing ratio is 1.7 times;
-   support securing of the business against the current and future uncertainties from both a
    macro and economic perspective; and
-   provide investors with an opportunity to invest in the future growth and success of Pepkor.

The Placement is a precautionary measure to strengthen Pepkor’s financial flexibility and
liquidity position in the light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
macro-economic pressure. In addition to other cash-saving initiatives already undertaken by
the Group, the Placement will help Pepkor to further enhance the liquidity profile and increase
resilience of its balance sheet, should a more negative macro-economic scenario realise.

UPDATE ON TRADING ENVIRONMENT SINCE MAY 2020
The trading performance reported below comprise like-for-like sales growth for the last four
trading weeks of May 2020, following the relaxation of lockdown measures on 1 May 2020,
and the first three trading weeks of June 2020, unless otherwise stated.

The sales momentum reported for the three trading weeks in May during Pepkor’s interim
results presentation on 27 May 2020 continued into the fourth week and the month of June
2020. The Group’s more defensive market positioning which is aligned to basic consumer
needs continues to drive good performance. Satisfactory inventory levels have been achieved
as a result of the strong winter trade.

Strong trading in PEP and Ackermans continued, reporting combined like-for-like sales growth
of 40% in May and achieving the highest ever monthly turnovers for both retail brands. Trading
momentum continued during the first three weeks of June with like-for-like growth of 21%.

Sales in PEP Africa, which contribute c.3% to Group revenue, declined by double digits in
constant currencies during April, May and June, impacted by a weakness in local economies
and currencies due to COVID-19. Lockdowns in the respective countries varied in timing and
duration.

The Speciality business, which focuses on more discretionary adult wear and footwear product
categories, traded well and achieved like-for-like sales growth of 28% in May and 21% in June.

The consumer electronics and appliances division (Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi
Corporation) in the JD Group performed extremely well since re-opening with like-for-like sales
growth of 39% in May despite the fact that only a limited product range could be sold. Trading
momentum continued into June with like-for-like growth of 58%. The furniture division was
unable to trade during May but achieved like-for-like growth of 26% since re-opening in June.

Trading in The Building Company has been negative due to the fact that building contractors
and the construction industry only re-opened on the first of June. Since the re-opening of the
industry, trading has shown a positive trajectory with June showing a cumulative negative
growth of only 1%.

The FLASH business continued to trade during lockdown and reported 28% growth in virtual
turnover for the quarter to date.
Capfin continued to curtail the granting of credit and the size of the book reduced to R2 billion.
Since the commencement of the lockdown period, focus has been mainly on collection of the
book which has exceeded expectations thus far.

UPDATE ON LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW
Liquidity has improved compared to pre-COVID-19 levels due to the positive trading
performance and credit book collections. This enabled the Group to early settle its
R521 million bridge term loan facility.

The credit curtailment and consequent reduction in sizes of the credit books supported cash
flow since the start of April 2020. Collections to date have been better than expected although
the impact of COVID-19 on future collections remains uncertain.

Constructive discussions are continuing to waive and amend debt covenants going forward.
The Group continues to assess opportunities to reduce costs, conserve cash, access liquidity
and improve flexibility in its capital structure during these unprecedented circumstances.

OUTLOOK
The Group continues to assess its portfolio strategy with preference to businesses that provide
the best returns.

Despite the current positive trading levels the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the
South African economy and consumer remains to be seen. Pepkor continues to implement
measures to protect the Group and improve flexibility in its capital structure during these
unprecedented circumstances.

Pepkor is confident that its defensive discount and value positioning will support market share
gains in the current and medium term environment as the market consolidates and consumers
focus on basic and affordable products.

The Group continues to make a positive difference in the lives of our customers and the
communities in which we operate by providing convenient access to everyday products and
services at affordable prices.

released on 27 May 2020, available at https://www.pepkor.co.za/investor-relations/latest-
results/.

THE PLACEMENT
The Placement is offered to qualifying institutional investors only and will not be offered to the
public in any jurisdiction. The Placement is not an “offer to the public” as contemplated under
the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended
(the ""South African Companies Act""). Accordingly, this announcement does not, nor does it
intend to, constitute a ""registered prospectus"" or an ""advertisement"", as contemplated by the
South African Companies Act; and no prospectus has been filed with the South African
Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (the ""CIPC"") in respect of the Placement.

As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance and form requirements
for a prospectus set out in the South African Companies Act and the South African Companies
Regulations of 2011, and has not been approved by, and/or registered with, the CIPC, or any
other South African authority.

The Placement Shares will be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its
existing general authority to issue shares for cash, granted by shareholders at the annual
general meeting of the Company held on 11 March 2020, being up to 172.5 million shares
which represents up to 4.95% of the total issued ordinary shares of Pepkor. The book for the

Placement is open with immediate effect and is expected to close as soon as possible.
The price per ordinary share at which the Placement Shares will be placed
(the ""Placement Price"") will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing
of the Bookbuild, the Placement Price and allocations are at the discretion of the Company
and the Bookrunners. The Placement Price will be announced as soon as practicable on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (the ""JSE"") after the close of the Bookbuild.

The Placement Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects
with the existing ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company, including the right to
receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue of
the Placement Shares.

Subject to the approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placement Shares on the JSE is
expected to commence at 09h00 on Monday, 29 June 2020 (or such time and/or date as may
be agreed between the Company and the Bookrunners).

Pursuant to the terms of the placing agreement entered into between the Company and the
Bookrunners, the Company has, subject to certain exceptions agreed to between the
Company and the Bookrunners, agreed to customary lock-up arrangements for a period of
180 days from the closing date of the Placement.

UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020


Pepkor’s defensive discount and value positioning underpinned resilient performance.


1.   STATUTORY HIGHLIGHTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS – INCLUDING THE
     ADOPTION OF IFRS 16

     •   Revenue increased by 6.5% to R37.6 billion.

     •   Operating profit before capital items increased by 17.2% to R4.0 billion.

     •   Headline earnings per share decreased by 13.6% to 44.3 cents per share.

     •   The Group adopted IFRS 16: Leases during the current reporting period, using a
         modified retrospective approach with no restatement of prior period reported results.
         This had a material impact on the Group’s statutory results for the current period. To
         form a meaningful assessment of Group performance, shareholders are referred to
         Pepkor’s full results announcement, available on the Pepkor website at

     OF IFRS 16

     •   Revenue increased by 6.5% to R37.6 billion.

     •   Operating profit before capital items increased by 0.3% to R3.4 billion.

     •   145 new stores opened, increasing stores to 5 498 stores.

3.   OVERVIEW

     The Pepkor Group achieved commendable results for the six months ended
     31 March 2020 as its proven defensive discount and value market positioning,
     disciplined focus on customer needs and leading low cost of doing business
     underpinned performance.

     The retail environment was constrained with low consumer spending, high levels of
     unemployment, load shedding and low economic growth. This was exacerbated during
     March with the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) across South Africa and the
     globe – resulting in the declaration of a national state of disaster and the implementation
     of a national lockdown effective from 27 March 2020 until 30 April 2020.

4.   OUTLOOK

     The duration and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on the
     Group’s trading in the near to medium term remains uncertain. It is expected that
     COVID-19 and the lockdown measures will severely impact the South African economy,
     the retail sector as a whole, and the Pepkor Group as consumers face increased
     unemployment and hardship.

     Pepkor is confident that it is well positioned to gain market share in the post-COVID-19
     ‘new economy’ with its defensive discount and value positioning being more resilient
     through its focus on babies’ and children’s clothing and large contribution of basic and
     replenishment products.

     A live webcast of the results presentation will be broadcast at 11:00 am (SAST) on
     27 May 2020. A registration link for the webcast is available on the Company’s website:
     www.pepkor.co.za. The presentation will be made available on the Company’s website
     prior to the commencement of the webcast.

5.   DIVIDEND DECLARATION

     No interim dividend is declared as in prior interim periods. Based on heightened levels
     of prudence applied by the board and the focus on liquidity preservation and allocation
     of resources, it is not expected that a full year dividend will be declared for FY20.

6.   SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT

     This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors of the Company. It
     contains only a summary of the information in the full announcement and does not
     contain full or complete details. The full announcement can be found at:

COMMENTARY ON RECENT TRADING AND THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS

The following update was provided at the Pepkor annual general meeting today by Mr. Leon
Lourens, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company:

Consumers have remained under financial pressure in the current economic environment and
trading remains volatile.

Trading during January was stronger in both Pep and Ackermans which achieved double-digit
growth in sales on the back of the shift in ""back to school"". This was followed by weaker trading
in February and brings year-to-date performance largely in line with that what was reported
during the first quarter.

Trading in both JD Group and The Building Company was weaker during January and
February in context of the continued challenging trading environment for durable and building
material products. High unit prices and the challenges in the construction industry continue to
impact on the businesses in these divisions.

The impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has not been significant on group sales year-to-
date but will undoubtedly have an impact on the second half of the current financial year due
to the lag effect in the supply chain. Most of Pepkor's retail brands source products from China
and interruptions in production will in all likelihood lead to temporary shortages on certain stock
items. Certainty on the exact impact will only become clear once most factories resume
normalised production levels.

Pepkor's defensive business model will count in its favour to reduce the risk and impact on
the group. The bulk of Pepkor's product range is defensively skewed towards basic, everyday
products which are sourced well in advance of it being required in-store. This results in fairly
long supply chain lead times, allowing our buying teams, in collaboration with our long-term
loyal suppliers, the opportunity to tactically respond and put measures in place to mitigate any
negative impact. Management therefore expects interruptions to its product availability but
remains optimistic that customer service levels in the respective retail brands will be largely
maintained.

RESULTS OF THE SCRIP DIVIDEND AND ALTERNATIVE CASH DIVIDEND

Shareholders are referred to the Company's announcements released on SENS on 25
November 2019, 7 January 2020, 14 January 2020 and 23 January 2020 regarding the scrip
dividend (""Scrip Dividend"") declared in respect of the year ended 30 September 2019 with a
cash alternative of 20.9 cents (""Alternative Cash Dividend"") (""Announcements"").

As detailed in the Announcements, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders that
were recorded in the securities register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record
Date""), to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the Alternative Cash
Dividend, were entitled to be issued that number of Pepkor ordinary no par value shares
determined in the ratio of 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the
Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders who did not elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend, will automatically receive the Scrip Dividend.

In terms of the Scrip Dividend, 37 850 881 new ordinary shares were issued today at 1 707.15
cents per share to shareholders who did not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend in
respect of all or part of their shareholding, resulting in a capitalisation of distributable retained
profits of the Company of R646 171 315.

Shareholders recorded in the register of the Company at the close of business on the Record
Date holding 358 261 962 ordinary shares elected to receive the gross Alternative Cash
Dividend of 20.9 cents per ordinary share, resulting in a total gross cash dividend of
R74 876 750, which was paid out of distributable retained profits of the Company.

The Company's issued share capital, following the Scrip Dividend, is as follows:

Authorised share capital
20 000 000 000 ordinary shares of no par value
Issued share capital
3 487 850 881 ordinary shares of no par value

The Company's issued share capital does not include any treasury shares held.

In addition to the cash dividend payment today, share certificates will be dispatched to
certificated shareholders and CSDP/broker accounts of dematerialised shareholders will be
credited.

resilience of its business profile stemming from its leading position as South Africa's largest
non-grocery retailer.""

Pepkor is considering opportunities in the capital bond market with the objectives of
diversifying its sources of funding and reducing financing cost. This supports the Group's
target to reduce its leverage in the medium term to 1x net debt-to-EBITDA.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

The Pepkor group increased revenue from continuing operations by 7.6% to R20.9 billion for the
three months ended 31 December 2019.

The clothing, footwear and homeware (CFH) retail brands successfully defended and
expanded their market shares, according to the latest RLC data.

Continuing operations

Clothing & general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported total revenue growth of 5.0% for the
quarter.

The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported sales growth of 6.4% and like-for-like
sales growth of 3.2%. Sales performance was negatively impacted by a shift in ""back-to-
school"" trade from December 2019 to January 2020 as a result of the later start to the school
year. This is confirmed by double digit sales growth during the first three trading weeks of
January 2020.

Retail selling price inflation in core CFH product categories increased to 9.1%, driven by
fluctuations in exchange rates. This compares to 1.6% in the comparative quarter and sales
units reduced as a consequence.

Notwithstanding the inflation, both Pep and Ackermans protected their positions as price
leaders in the discount and value markets.

Retail space of Pep and Ackermans expanded by 4.8% compared to the comparative
quarter. New stores are performing in line with expectations and continue to meet feasibility
thresholds.

Pep Africa, which contributes c.3% to group revenue, continued to consolidate amidst
adverse macro-economic conditions across most countries of operation. High levels of
product inflation due to depreciating currencies in Angola, Nigeria and Zambia impacted
consumer affordability. Constant currency sales declined by 2.8% and like-for-like sales
reduced by 6.4%, translating to a decline in sales of 12.7% in rand terms.

The Speciality division reported sales growth of 1.6% with like-for-like sales reducing by 0.6%.
The clothing product categories performed well during the quarter. In the current economic
environment consumers tend first to reduce spending on higher priced products such as
footwear, resulting in a very challenging trading environment for the footwear brands. Tekkie
Town continues to focus on improving stock-holding and other inefficiencies in the business
which continues to impact performance.

Furniture, appliances & electronics

The JD Group reported revenue growth of 3.6% for the quarter.

Retail sales increased by 2.2% while like-for-like sales declined by 0.7%. Credit sales declined to
an overall credit mix of 17.5% compared to the prior year's corresponding 18.1%. Black Friday
promotions were very successful reflecting the price sensitivity of over-stretched consumers.

Building materials

The Building Company reported a decline in sales and like-for-like sales of 4.1% and 2.9%
respectively. Sales performance in the retail division improved during the quarter while
performance in the wholesale and specialist divisions were negatively impacted by the
challenging market conditions in the construction and building materials market.

Fintech

The Fintech segment reported revenue growth of 44.4%. This includes the contribution from
Capfin following the internalisation of its credit book funding which is not included in the
comparative quarter.

The FLASH business increased revenue by 30.9% and continued to invest in new products,
businesses, channels and geographies to complement its informal trader business, which
consists of 170 000 traders.

Capfin reported good results for the quarter. The loan book is healthy with credit performance
meeting expectations.

Outlook

Trading in January 2020 has been relatively stronger in most brands, supported by the shift in
""back-to-school"". On a relative basis, Pepkor continues to perform well in context of the

CASH FRACTION APPLICABLE TO THE SCRIP DIVIDEND


Shareholders are referred to the Company's annual results for the year ended 30 September
2019 and the scrip dividend declaration announced on SENS on 25 November 2019, wherein
the board of directors of Pepkor advised that it resolved to declare a scrip dividend
(""Scrip Dividend"") in respect of the year ended 30 September 2019 with a cash alternative of
20.9 cents (""Alternative Cash Dividend"").

A circular (including a form of election for certificated shareholders) detailing the terms of the
Scrip Dividend and the Alternative Cash Dividend was distributed to shareholders on Tuesday,
7 January 2020 (""Circular"").

As detailed in the Circular and the Company's announcement released on SENS on
7 January 2020, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued
fully-paid Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding as at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary
shareholding and to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend. Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend of 20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor on the Record Date, instead of the Scrip Dividend. For the avoidance
of doubt, shareholders who do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will
automatically receive the Scrip Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

As announced on SENS on Tuesday, 14 January 2020 (""Finalisation SENS""), the ratio of
Pepkor ordinary shares to which each shareholder recorded in the securities register of Pepkor
on the Record Date will become entitled pursuant to the Scrip Dividend (to the extent that such
Shareholder has not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend) is 1.22426 shares for
every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record Date.

As further mentioned in the Finalisation SENS, where a Shareholder's entitlement to new
Pepkor ordinary shares under the abovementioned ratio applicable to the Scrip Dividend gives
rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to the
nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction (""Rounding Provision""). In terms of the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited (""JSE""), the applicable cash payment in respect of fractional
entitlements has been determined with reference to the volume weighted average price
(""VWAP"") of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive
the Scrip Dividend or the Alternative Cash Dividend), less 10%.

The VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020
was 1 699 cents per share. This amount, discounted by 10%, is 1 529 cents per share, which
amount will be used to determine the cash payment for the fractional entitlements.

Example of fractional entitlement:

This example assumes that a shareholder holds 100 Pepkor ordinary shares at the close of
business on the Record Date and does not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend for
all or part of such Pepkor ordinary shares held.

The ratio of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled pursuant to
the Scrip Dividend is 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record
Date.

By applying the Rounding Provision, the shareholder with 100 Pepkor ordinary shares will
receive 1 new Pepkor ordinary share for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held and a cash
payment for the fraction of 0.22426 x 1 529 = 342.89354 cents.

Shareholders are informed that, as far as the tax implications of the cash payment of the
fractional entitlements are concerned, the receipt of the cash payment will not be subject to
dividend withholding tax.

The above is a general guide and is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of the
taxation consequences of the cash payment of fractional entitlements in terms of South African
taxation law. It is not intended to be, nor should it be considered as legal or taxation advice
and shareholders are advised to seek their own tax advice from an independent tax adviser.
The Company and its advisers cannot be held responsible for the taxation consequences that
the Scrip Dividend may have on individual shareholders and therefore shareholders are
advised to consult their own tax advisers if they are in any doubt about their tax position.

As detailed in the Circular and the Company's announcement released on SENS on
7 January 2020, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued
fully-paid Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding as at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary

Alternative Cash Dividend. Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend of 20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary

of doubt, shareholders who do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will
automatically receive the Scrip Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

The number of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled in terms of
the Scrip Dividend will be determined with reference to such shareholder's ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor (at the close of business on the Record Date) in relation to the ratio
that 20.9 cents bears to the volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") at which Pepkor
ordinary shares traded on the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") during the
10 trading day period ended on Monday, 13 January 2020, being 1 797 cents, discounted by
5%. However, where the application of this ratio gives rise to a fraction of a Pepkor ordinary
share, the rounding principles described below will be applied. For clarity, the 10-day VWAP
as noted in the Circular, was only for illustrative purposes and does not include trading

The ratio of Pepkor ordinary shares to which each shareholder recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on the Record Date will become entitled pursuant to the Scrip Dividend (to
the extent that such Shareholder has not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend) is
therefore 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record Date,
subject to the rounding principles described below.

Where a Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend to new Pepkor ordinary shares
gives rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to
the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction. In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, the
applicable cash payment in respect of fractional entitlements will be determined with reference
to the VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive

 in terms of the Scrip Dividend

In terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities register of
Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued fully-paid
Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary shareholding as
at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary shareholding and
to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend.

Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend of
20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary shareholding in Pepkor on
the Record Date, instead of the Scrip Dividend. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders who
do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will automatically receive the Scrip
Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

The number of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled in terms of
the Scrip Dividend will be determined with reference to such shareholder's ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor (at the close of business on the Record Date) in relation to the ratio
that 20.9 cents bears to the volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") at which Pepkor
ordinary shares traded on the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") during the
10 trading day period ending on Monday, 13 January 2020, discounted by 5%. The finalisation
information including the ratio applicable to the Scrip Dividend is expected to be released on
SENS on Tuesday, 14 January 2020, by 11:00 am.

Where a Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend to new Pepkor ordinary shares
gives rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to
the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction. In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, the
applicable cash payment in respect of fractional entitlements will be determined with reference
to the VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive
the Scrip Dividend or the Alternative Cash Dividend), less 10%. The value to be used for
calculating cash payments for fractional entitlements will be announced on SENS on
Thursday, 23 January 2020, by 11:00 am.

The distribution of the Circular, and the rights and entitlements to receive Pepkor ordinary
shares pursuant to the Scrip Dividend in jurisdictions other than the Republic of South Africa,
may be restricted by law and any failure to comply with such restrictions may constitute a
violation of the securities laws of such jurisdictions. Accordingly, shareholders will not be
entitled to receive any Scrip Dividend shares, directly or indirectly, in those jurisdictions and
shall be deemed to have elected the Alternative Cash Dividend. Such non-resident
Shareholders should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements
in such jurisdictions. Shareholders who have any doubts as to their position, including, without
limitation, their tax status, should consult an appropriate adviser in the relevant jurisdictions
without delay.

The Circular will be available on the Company's website at https://www.pepkor.co.za/investor-
relations/shareholder-diary-meetings-and-notices. In addition, copies of the Circular will be
available for inspection, in English only, during normal business hours until Friday, 24 January

ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2019 AND DIVIDEND
DECLARATION


1.   STATUTORY HIGHLIGHTS

     *   Revenue from continuing operations increased by 9.0% to R69.6 billion.

     *   Operating profit from continuing operations and before capital items increased
         by 15.6% to R6.8 billion.

     *   Total headline earnings per share increased by 14.5% to 96.8 cents per share.

     *   Impacted by an impairment charge pertaining to The Building Company business, total
         earnings per share decreased by 25.0% to 62.6 cents per share.

     *   A scrip dividend was declared, with a cash alternative of 20.9 cents per share (27.8
         cents in the prior year). This is consistent with the previously announced dividend
         policy of a dividend being covered three times by earnings.

     *   Pepkor's statutory results include the impact of BVI-related costs in the current and
         prior years, in addition to the implementation of IFRS 9 in the current year.
         Shareholders are referred to Pepkor's annual results presentation, available on the
         Pepkor website at www.pepkor.co.za, for further information on comparable results.

2.   OVERVIEW

     Pepkor achieved a commendable set of operating results for the 2019 financial year
     (FY19), despite a very difficult retail environment where consumer spending remained
     constrained, fuelled by high levels of unemployment and low economic growth. The
     Group's defensive discount and value market positioning, disciplined focus on customer
     needs and low cost of doing business proved to be resilient in this challenging
     environment.

     Pepkor's strategy of providing the right product, at the best possible price, in accessible
     locations continues to underpin Pepkor's performance, resulting in continued market
     share gains in most of the retail brands. Creating value for our customers and improving
     their lives in the process remains the primary focus for each of the retail brands in the
     Group.

     Pepkor continued its expansion and opened 338 new stores, expanding the Group's
     footprint to 5 415 stores. The Group's flexible store formats enable it to open stores closer
     to its customers' homes, saving them transport costs and creating opportunities for more
     frequent customer spend.
     With 56 100 employees, the Group remains one of the largest employers in the South
     African retail sector and will continue to focus on capitalising on its core competencies
     and assets to capitalise on the opportunities that the current market conditions present.

3.   OUTLOOK

     Trading subsequent to year-end remains volatile and management is of the opinion that
     the difficult trading environment will persist as consumer spending continues to be
     constrained. Notwithstanding, the Group is cautiously optimistic about growth for the
     coming year and its merchandise-buying plans reflect this.

     The current environment provides opportunities for market share expansion and the
     strong customer value propositions of Pepkor's retail brands is expected to remain a
     competitive advantage.

     Organic expansion opportunities remain top of mind, including store footprint expansion,
     the development of new retail formats and the creation of new channels through which to
     serve our customers. The Group will continue to focus on market share expansion and
     improving operating cost efficiencies.

     A live webcast of the results presentation will be broadcast at 13:00pm (SAST) on
     25 November 2019. A registration link for the webcast is available on the Company's
     website: www.pepkor.co.za.

4.   DIVIDEND DECLARATION

     Based on the stated ambition to reduce Pepkor's gearing to one times net debt-to-
     EBITDA, the board has elected to declare a scrip dividend to shareholders in respect of
     the year ended 30 September 2019 with a cash alternative of 20.9 cents (27.8 cents in
     the prior year).

     The dividend will be payable to the holders of ordinary shares in the share capital of the
     Company and recorded in the securities register of the Company on 24 January 2020.
     Shareholders will, be entitled to elect to receive a gross cash dividend of 20.9 cents per
     share held in respect of all or part of their ordinary shareholding, instead of the scrip
     dividend ( cash dividend'), payable out of the company's distributable retained profits.

     The finalisation of information, including the ratio applicable to the scrip dividend is
     expected to be released on SENS on or about Tuesday, 14 January 2020. A circular
     setting out the terms and salient dates of the scrip dividend and cash dividend alternative
     will be published separately in due course.

     The last date to trade in order to be eligible to receive the dividend will be 21 January
     2020 and the ex-dividend date will be 22 January 2020. The dividend will be paid and
     broker accounts updated, as the case may be, on 27 January 2020.

     Pepkor's two largest shareholders, representing 79.8% of the Group's issued share
     capital, have committed to receive the scrip dividend.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement once it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that its financial
results, compared to the previous corresponding period, will differ by at least 20%.

In a difficult trading environment the Group's major business segments have performed well,
with Pepkor's defensive discount and value market positioning, disciplined focus on customer
needs and low cost of doing business proving to be resilient.

However, the performance of The Building Company continued to be adversely impacted by
the contraction in the building materials market during the 2019 financial year. The Building
Company represented 13% of Pepkor's revenue and 3% of operating profit before capital
items in the 2018 financial year.

Following the completion of impairment assessments by Pepkor and its auditors, an
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets associated with The Building Company business,
amounting to R1.2 billion, will be recognised in the 2019 financial year (""Impairment"").

Accordingly, shareholders are hereby advised that for the year ended 30 September 2019,
Pepkor expects:

   *   Earnings per share to be between 57.6 cents and 65.1 cents, which is between 22.1%
       and 32.1% lower than the 83.6 cents reported for the previous corresponding period;
       and

   *   Headline earnings per share, which excludes the Impairment charge and other non-
       headline adjustments, will be between 91.0 cents and 99.4 cents, which is between
       7.7% and 17.7% higher than the 84.5 cents reported for the previous corresponding
       period.

Pepkor's results for the year ended 30 September 2019 are expected to be published on
SENS on Monday, 25 November 2019. A live webcast of the results presentation will be
broadcast at 13:00pm (SAST) on 25 November 2019.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

Pepkor increased revenue by 8.5% to R53.1 billion for the nine months ended 30 June 2019.
Performance was supported by a stronger third quarter which saw revenue grow by 11.7%,
largely benefitting from the shift of Easter to April. Trading however, remains volatile in an
environment of continued pressure on consumer spending.

Clothing & general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported revenue growth of 6.4% for the nine-
month period, supported by 9.2% growth during the third quarter.

For the nine-month period, the Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported sales
growth of 6.7% and like-for-like sales growth of 2.9%. Retail space expanded by 4.8% year-on-
year. Core clothing, footwear and homeware (CFH) product categories achieved 7.1% sales
growth and 3.5% like-for-like growth. This remains encouraging in the current operating
environment. Pep and Ackermans in aggregate reported inflation of 4.2% in CFH retail selling
prices.

Pep Africa reported a decline in sales of 0.7% in rand terms for the nine-period. This includes
strong constant currency performance with sales growth of 14.9% and like-for-like growth of
11.4%. Good results were achieved in most countries while macro-economic challenges in
Zimbabwe continue to impact performance.

The Speciality division reported sales growth of 9.5% with like-for-like growth of 4.2%, in
aggregate, for the nine-month period. Satisfactory performance was achieved in the clothing
product categories with continued softer performance in footwear.

Furniture, appliances & electronics

Performance in the furniture, appliances and electronics segment was supported by income
from the new internally-funded credit book. The segment reported revenue growth of 8.3% for
the nine-month period, including 10.9% growth during the third quarter.

During the nine-month period merchandise sales increased by 1.9% and like-for-like sales
declined by 1.3% as financially constrained consumers continue to prioritise spending on
essentials over durable product categories. Profitability of this segment will be impacted in the
current financial year by the implementation of IFRS 9 on the new internally-funded credit
book.

Building materials

Sales growth of 0.6% was achieved in the building materials segment with like-for-like growth
of 1.8% during the nine-month period. Sales contracted by 1.1% during the third quarter as high
levels of competition remain within the contracting and building materials market. This
continues to place significant pressure on margins.
Fintech

The segment reported 40.7% revenue growth for the nine-month period, including growth in
excess of 50% during the third quarter. The FLASH business continues to achieve significant
growth, while Capfin's performance is further supported by income earned on the new
internally-funded credit book. The implementation of IFRS 9 will also impact this segment's
profitability.

Outlook

Pepkor's defensive market position and strategy of providing customers with value at
affordable prices continues to resonate with customers, as demonstrated through continued
market share growth. This will continue to support performance in challenging operating
conditions where sales volatility is expected to continue as customers have to contend with
high levels of unemployment and increased cost of living in what remains to be an extremely
challenging retail environment.

OVERVIEW

The Pepkor group reported satisfactory results during the six months ended 31 March 2019 (H1FY19) in a challenging retail market. 

Consumer spending remains under pressure, having to contend with increased living costs and high levels of unemployment. Uncertainty 
prior to the 2019 elections, the implementation of stage four load-shedding and the shift of Easter to April further contributed 
to a very challenging retail environment.

Respectable earnings growth on a comparable basis was achieved, notwithstanding lower than expected sales growth. Pepkor's defensive 
market positioning of offering value to customers by providing everyday products at affordable prices and at customers' convenience, 
underpins the group's performance. 

Pepkor grew its market share in the period under review, and the group's retail store footprint expanded to 5 332 stores, including 
164 new store openings during the six-month period.


FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The group achieved revenue growth of 7.0% to R35.3 billion and reported operating profit growth of 25.2%, before capital items, 
to R3.4 billion during H1FY19. 

Pepkor's statutory results include one-off items that impact its comparison to the previous period. On a comparable basis, operating 
profit increased by 6.9% to R3.4 billion and headline earnings per share increased by 3.4% to 52.4 cents. Further information 
on how the comparable results were calculated is included in the ‘Comparability of results' section of this results announcement. 

Net finance costs increased by 33.5% to R738 million (29.8% to R718 million excluding one-off costs) as a result of the capital 
investment made to fund the two new credit books and as a consequence of lower cash generation.

Pepkor's effective tax rate for the period is 34.0%. South African income tax is calculated at 28% while tax in other jurisdictions 
is calculated at the prevailing rates. Items impacting Pepkor's effective tax rate relate mainly to irrecoverable foreign withholding 
taxes and non-deductible finance costs.  
 
The internal funding of the new credit books commenced during the reporting period. The new JD Group credit book, Connect Financial 
Solutions, amounted to R1.0 billion (gross) and the new Capfin credit book amounted to R0.3 billion (gross) at 31 March 2019. The new 
credit books are funded by R2.5 billion bridging finance secured during the period. Opportunities to diversify funding sources 
are being explored.

Cash generation was negatively impacted by the funding of the new credit books and higher net working capital levels due to lower sales 
growth. Higher inventory levels reported at the end of FY18 due to lower sales activity were successfully managed through disciplined 
markdowns to manage stock freshness. Higher inventory levels at 31 March 2019 - compared to the prior year - were influenced by lower 
than expected sales and the shift of Easter to April, as well as an expanded store base.

Net debt increased to R15.7 billion from R12.6 billion at 30 September 2018. The contractual net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of the group 
is 2.04 times with interest cover at 5.65 times.

The acquisition of FGI Holdings from Wands Investments, a subsidiary of Fulcrum, was approved by the Competition Commission 
and remains subject to conditions precedent, including Prudential Authority approval and a due diligence investigation. 
FGI provides insurance products via its subsidiaries under the Abacus brand to JD Group customers and other group companies.

Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (Steinhoff) published its 2017 results in May 2019. These financial statements included 
a restatement for the reversal of the Steinhoff Share Right Scheme charges. The reversal of all costs pertaining to open share 
grants for Pepkor employees was adjusted to retained earnings in the current reporting period.

The group has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, resulting in additional provisions raised on credit books in terms of the new 
impairment model. This resulted in a net impact on opening retained earnings of R68 million in addition to a R50 million provision 
raised on the new JD Credit book.

As in the prior reporting period, the board resolved not to declare an interim dividend.


OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Clothing and general merchandise 

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported revenue growth of 5.2% to R23.1 billion, contributing 66% of group revenue 
for the period under review. Operating profit increased by 6.6% to R3.1 billion. 

The challenging conditions within the discount and retail sectors weighed on sales growth. By Pepkor standards, the sales growth 
achieved by many of its retail brands was lower than expected. However, the group increased its market share according to the Retail 
Liaison Committee (RLC).

Momentum in retail store footprint expansion continued. Retail brands within the segment opened 136 new stores during the period, 
resulting in a total of 4 310 stores and equating to retail space growth of 4.8% year-on-year. The progressive return of selling price 
inflation supported healthy sales growth within the core Clothing, Footwear and Home (CFH) product departments.

PEP and Ackermans
In aggregate, PEP and Ackermans reported merchandise sales growth of 5.4% and like-for-like growth of 1.6%, underscoring the challenging 
consumer environment. Within CFH, selling price inflation of 2.5% was recorded, along with volume growth of 3.5%. Selling price 
inflation is expected to continue during the remainder of FY19.

PEP
PEP maintained market share and its position as price leader despite the particularly challenging trading conditions within the discount 
market sector. Performance was supported by good growth in Babies and Home departments, with strong growth achieved in Fast Moving Consumer 
Goods (FMCG) and Financial Services. 

A total of 5.3 million cellular handsets was sold during the period, which was below expectation following selling price increases 
in handsets. Corrective action in the form of a selling price reduction supported a recovery towards the end of the reporting period. 
Financial Services reported exceptional growth in profitability as PEP's strategy to expand its value-added services offering continues 
to resonate with customers. 

PEP's retail store footprint expanded to 2 265 stores, including 47 new stores opened during the period across its traditional PEP, 
PEP Home and PEP Cell retail formats, equating to retail space growth of 3.8% year-on-year.

The PAXI parcel delivery service, which successfully leverages and monetises the PEP retail footprint, celebrated its first full year 
of operation. Good growth momentum continues, with 45 000 parcels currently being sent on a monthly basis.

The new Dealz discount variety retail concept rolled out four additional stores and continues to perform well with strong like-for-like 
and basket size growth. Plans are in place to open a further six stores during the remainder of FY19.

Ackermans
Ackermans' strong customer value proposition of providing value to ‘women with kids in their lives' continued to drive growth 
and outperformed the market once again. A total of 31 new stores were opened during the period, expanding the store base to 759 stores 
and adding 6.3% retail space year-on-year. 

The credit sales mix, facilitated by Pepkor's Tenacity Financial Services business, was maintained at 17%, with lay-bys contributing 
a stable 18% to total sales. Challenges in the new Hammarsdale distribution centre, commissioned towards the end of 2018, negatively 
affected product availability in-store for a few months.

Growth in CFH was supported by double-digit growth in the Essentials, Babies and Women's Wear product categories. The Ackermans Woman 
retail format continues to perform well, and an additional three stores were opened during the period, bringing the total store base 
to six.

PEP Africa
PEP Africa contributed 3.4% to group revenue during the period and reported like-for-like sales growth of 10.8% in constant currency 
terms(1). The devaluation of Angolan and Zambian currencies resulted in a sales decline of 3.4% in reporting currency terms. The business 
continues to focus on enhancing processes, systems and efficiencies as it consolidates its base. Operations in Nigeria performed very well 
as the dynamics of the local market are better understood. Zimbabwe remains a concern and operations have been intentionally slowed down 
while viability is assessed and risk is managed.

(1) For further information on constant currency disclosure, refer to page 5 of this results announcement.

Speciality
The Speciality division reported strong results with exceptional performances by some of the retail brands, reporting sales growth 
of 9.4% and like-for-like growth of 4.1%.

The total store footprint across five retail brands was expanded to 939 stores, with 47 store openings.

Footwear businesses Tekkie Town and Shoe City currently face challenging market conditions. Tekkie Town management has been successful 
in continuing to grow and expand the business while key projects are underway to enhance its supply chain and stock management ability. 
Dunns has maintained its positive performance trajectory, while John Craig and Refinery continue to report double-digit sales 
and like-for-like growth.

Furniture, appliances and electronics 

JD Group increased revenue by 7.2% to R5.0 billion, supported by the new JD credit book under Connect Financial Solutions. 

Performance in this segment was characterised by difficult trading conditions where customer spending was more focused on essentials 
than durables and resulted in merchandise sales growth of 1.4% and a decline in like-for-like sales of 1.6%. 

Credit sales, now funded internally, are managed conservatively and contributed 18% to sales. This includes a credit sales mix 
of 27% for furniture brands and 7% for consumer electronics and appliances brands. 

Despite the challenging trading environment, an operating profit of R60 million was reported, reflecting the positive outcome 
of management's focus on efficiency gains and containing the segment's cost of doing business. This includes an additional provision 
of R50 million raised in terms of IFRS 9 on the new loan book.

Progress has been made in the operations and profitability of all brands. Management continues to optimise the retail store footprint 
of 900 stores, both in terms of locations and improved trading densities.

Building materials 

Segmental revenue increased by 1.5% to R4.0 billion, while operating profit decreased by 66.9% to R42 million.

The Building Company reported sales growth of 1.5% and like-for-like growth of 2.3% during the period with the building materials market 
currently experiencing its worst contraction in more than a decade. As a result, the business faced the dual challenge of defending 
its market share while margins and profitability were under pressure.

Positive sales growth was driven mainly by the wholesale division, with the general building and specialist retail divisions both reporting 
low sales growth. 

Significant pressure on margins resulted in reduced profitability for the period and strategic development continues across the business, 
including initiatives to improve margins. Good cost control further continues to support profitability.

FinTech

The FinTech segment increased revenue by 32.3% to R3.2 billion, while operating profit increased by 36.7% to R201 million.

The FLASH business continues to report strong growth, with virtual turnover growth exceeding 20%. The number of FLASH traders increased 
to 156 000 from 131 000 in the comparative period. 

The Capfin business performed well during the period and Pepkor commenced internal funding for the new Capfin loan book. 
Capfin saw healthy growth in new loan applications of 36% and credit granting continues to be managed on a conservative basis in terms 
of credit scorecards and affordability assessments. The introduction of new digital channels and a new marketing campaign further 
supported performance.


OUTLOOK

Pepkor is a group of 49 000 employees whose purpose is to provide value that enriches customers' lives - making their lives better 
and easier. This focus will continue to support the group's performance during the remainder of the 2019 financial year. Management 
remains cautiously optimistic about the retail environment and expects improved consumer confidence following the completion 
of South Africa's elections. The group continues to identify opportunities for growth and expansion and expects to further expand 
its store footprint, achieving between 3% and 4% space growth in FY19 on a net basis. 


APPRECIATION

Management and the board would like to thank shareholders, customers, employees and suppliers for their continued support and loyalty 
to Pepkor and its retail brands.

NOTES TO THE SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2019

Statement of compliance
The summarised consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings 
Requirements for summarised financial statements and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summarised financial statements. 
The Listings Requirements require summarised financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts 
and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting 
Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council 
and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the 
preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements from which the summarised consolidated interim financial statements were 
derived are in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the 
preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018, except where the group has adopted 
new standards and interpretations effective in the current financial year, as detailed in note 8.

Basis of preparation
The summarised consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in millions of South African rand (Rm) on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain assets and liabilities, which are carried at amortised cost, and derivative financial instruments, which 
are stated at their fair values (the classification of these assets and liabilities did not change classification subsequent 
to the adoption of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments). The preparation of the summarised consolidated interim financial statements 
for the six months ended 31 March 2019 was supervised by RG Hanekom CA(SA), the group's chief financial officer.

   Basis of segmental presentation
   During the preparation of the 2018 annual consolidated financial statements Pepkor revised its internal management reporting structure 
   and consequently revised its segmental reporting to better reflect the group's internal management review structure to the chief 
   operating decision-maker (CODM). Accordingly, the 31 March 2018 financial period segmental analysis has been restated to reflect 
   this change.

   The segmental information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS 8: Operating Segments (IFRS 8), which defines requirements 
   for the disclosure of financial information of an entity's operating segments. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified 
   on the basis of internal reporting of group components that are regularly reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources to segments 
   and to assess their performance. The board of directors has been identified as the CODM.

   Identification of segments
   The identification of segments is consistent with those identified in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year 
   ended 30 September 2018.

   Segmental analysis
   Geographical analysis
   The revenue, operating profit before capital items and assets are all classified as one geographical region.
 
   Major customers
   No single customer contributes 10% or more of the group's revenue.

5. FINANCING AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES   
       
   The group entered into bridge facilities to the value of R2.5 billion on 20 March 2019 for a maximum period of 18 months. 
   The facilities can be used for general corporate and banking purposes, including but not limited to working capital financing 
   for the build-up of consumer finance credit books in Pepkor.  The bridge facility is to be settled by the launch of a bond 
   facility in an effort to reduce the group's overall funding costs and diversify its sources of funding as originally anticipated 
   upon listing of the group in September 2017. The terms and conditions of the facilities are aligned with that of the current term loans 
   and revolving credit facilities as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018. 
   There were no further changes to the contingent liabilities as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year

   a restatement for the reversal of the Steinhoff Share Right Scheme IFRS 2 charges. The restatement did not result in any material 
   adjustment to the Pepkor financial statements. The group has transferred the cumulative amount related to these grants from 
   the share-based payment reserve to retained earnings in the current period.
       
7. RELATED PARTIES   
   During the period, the group entered into related party transactions in the ordinary course of business, the substance of which 
   are similar to those disclosed in the group's annual financial statements.

   On 1 October 2018 the group adopted the following accounting standards, effective for financial years ending on or after 1 January 2018, 
   which had an effect on the prior period disclosures.
        
   8.1  IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
        IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacing IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) addresses the classification, 
        measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment 
        model for financial assets. The key impact of IFRS 9 for the group is due to the new impairment model for financial assets 
        as set out below.
        
        Impairment of financial assets under the new impairment model
        The new impairment model applies to financial assets classified at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through 
        other comprehensive income (FVOCI), contract assets under IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, lease receivables, 
        loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision 
        in the case of commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (ECL) resulting from default events that 
        are possible within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance 
        (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument 
        (lifetime ECL). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be ‘stage 1'; financial assets that 
        are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in ‘stage 2'; and financial assets for which there 
        is objective evidence of impairment are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired are in ‘stage 3'. The assessment 
        of credit risk and the estimation of ECL is unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporates all available information that 
        is relevant to the assessment, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts 
        of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL takes into account the time value of money. 
        As a result, the recognition and measurement of impairment is intended to be more forward-looking than under IAS 39 
        and the resulting impairment charge will tend to be more volatile. It will also tend to result in an increase in the total level 
        of impairment allowances, since all financial assets will be assessed for at least 12-month ECL and the population of financial 
        assets to which lifetime ECL applies is likely to be larger than the population for which there is objective evidence of impairment 
        in accordance with IAS 39.

        For financial assets where objective evidence of impairment exists (stage 3), the standard requires interest income to be calculated 
        on the carrying value of the debtors, after allowance for expected credit losses based on the original effective interest rate. 
        
        For trade and other receivables without a significant financing component, the group has adopted the simplified approach 
        that recognises lifetime ECL regardless of the stage classification. The group applied a provision matrix based on historical 
        credit loss experience, which was adjusted for forward-looking factors applicable to the trade and other receivables balances 
        and economic factors.
        
        The group has elected to apply the impact of IFRS 9 retrospectively with an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
        on 1 October 2018, therefore comparative information for the prior periods has not been restated.
 
                                                                                                        R
        Closing retained earnings 30 September 2018 as previously reported                          2 750 
        Increase in impairment allowance for trade and other receivables                              (94)
        Increase in deferred tax relating to impairment allowances                                     20 
        Increase in taxation payable relating to impairment allowances                                  6
        Opening retained earnings on 1 October 2018                                                 2 682 
        
        The application of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the reported earnings or financial position for the interim results 
        under review.

  8.2  IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
       IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (replacing IAS 18 Revenue) is based on the principle that revenue is recognised 
       as the group satisfies performance obligations and when control of a good or service transfers to a customer, rather than the use 
       of the risks and rewards criteria under IAS 18.
        
       The group has elected to apply the impact of IFRS 15 retrospectively, therefore comparative information for the prior periods 
       has been restated. The key impact of IFRS 15 for the group is set out below.
        
       Agent vs principal assessment
       The group assessed its different revenue streams based on the new guidance under the agent and principle requirements. In certain 
       instances, revenue previously recognised on a gross basis and included in revenue and cost of sales, is now required to be recognised 
       on a net basis in other income.
        
       Rebates from suppliers
       The group assessed its different rebates received from suppliers. In certain instances, rebates relating to the purchase 
       of inventory were recognised either as revenue, operating income or net of operating expenses. According to IFRS 15, rebates relating 
       to the purchase of inventory should be accounted for net of the cost of inventory and unwinded to cost of sales as the goods are sold.

  8.6  Segmental analysis      

       During the preparation of the 2018 annual consolidated financial statements Pepkor revised its internal management reporting 
       structure and consequently revised its segmental reporting to better reflect the group's internal management review structure 
       to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The prior period segmental analysis was thus revised to reflect this and is consistent 
       with the segmental analysis as reported per the annual consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2018.


COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS

As reported in Pepkor's interim results for the six months ended 31 March 2018 (H1FY18) on 29 May 2018, and in trading statements published 
on 17 April 2019 and 10 May 2019, H1FY18 results were impacted by one-off costs pertaining to the BVI matter, which entails a provision 
for exposure in terms of a corporate financial guarantee of R440 million and associated loans of R60 million. One-off costs in H1FY18 
therefore amounted to R500 million, impacting H1FY18 earnings per share metrics by approximately 14.5 cents. This is calculated by applying 
the total impact net of tax of R500 million to a weighted average number of shares of 3 450 million.

During H1FY19, accumulated finance costs of R20 million (reflected in finance costs) were incurred in terms of the corporate financial 
guarantee, and R40 million (reflected in operating expenses) was raised in terms of credit exposure pertaining to the associated loans. 
One-off costs in H1FY19 therefore amount to R60 million, impacting H1FY19 earnings per share metrics by approximately 1.7 cents. 
This is calculated by applying the total impact net of tax of R60 million to a weighted average number of shares of 3 450 million. 

Resolution of the BVI matter continues to be evaluated in the context of a claim made by BVI for damages against Steinhoff International 
Holdings N.V.

The comparable results as set out in this results announcement have been prepared for illustrative purposes only, in order to provide 
shareholders with comparable results. The impact of these one-off costs is deemed to be non-recurring in nature, pending the resolution 
of the matter. Because of its nature, the historic financial information may not fairly present Pepkor's financial position, changes 
in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The comparable results are presented in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements 
and the Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information issued by SAICA.

The comparable results are the responsibility of the board and were not reviewed or reported on by Pepkor's auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, a listed company is required to
publish a trading statement once it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from the
financial results for the previous corresponding period.

Pepkor's unaudited interim results for the six months ended 31 March 2018 (""H1FY18""), as
reported on 28 May 2018, included one-off costs incurred pertaining to a provision for
exposure in terms of a corporate financial guarantee and associated loans which amounted
to R500 million (""one-off costs"").

While the Company does not have the required degree of certainty to provide details of the
anticipated range expected for headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") and earnings per share
(""EPS"") for the six-month period ended 31 March 2019 (""H1FY19""), the required degree of
certainty does exist that the non-recurring nature of the one-off costs incurred in H1FY18, in
isolation, will positively impact H1FY19 HEPS and EPS by at least 20%, or 7.2 cents per share,
when compared to the H1FY18 HEPS and EPS of 36.2 cents per share.

A further trading statement will be issued as soon as there is a reasonable degree of certainty
as to the likely range within which the Company's HEPS and EPS are expected to increase.

The results for the six-months ended 31 March 2019 is expected to be published on SENS on
or about 29 May 2019.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Company´s external auditors.

OVERVIEW OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATION AT STEINHOFF INTERNATIONAL

Pepkor shareholders are referred to the findings released by Steinhoff International Holdings
N.V. (""Steinhoff"") on Friday 15 March 2019 titled Overview of Forensic Investigation (the
""Overview""), which reported on the investigation into Steinhoff's affairs conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (""the PWC investigation"").

Pepkor highlights clause 3.2.4. of the Overview which confirms that ""Pepkor Holdings, nor any
of the other South African operating entities, were identified as having received such (fictitious
or irregular) contributions"" (from Steinhoff or any related party).

Pepkor CEO Leon Lourens commented: ""The findings confirm what we have always known.
Pepkor's financial results for the 2017 and 2018 financial years therefore remain unaffected.
This again illustrates that the appropriate financial and corporate governance structures are
in place within Pepkor. It also confirms the values and principles which we stand for and on
which our business was built. Pepkor will continue to operate in this way and remains focused
on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders.""

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

In a challenging trading environment the Pepkor group increased revenue by 6.1% to
R19.5 billion for the three months ended 31 December 2018.

Clothing & general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported sales growth of 6.1% and like-for-like
growth of 3.4%. Retail space increased by 4.0% compared to the comparative quarter.

The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported sales growth of 6.8% and like-for-like
sales growth of 2.7%. Core clothing, footwear and homeware (CFH) product categories
achieved 8.6% sales growth and 4.6% like-for-like growth which is very encouraging in the
current operating environment. Pep and Ackermans in aggregate reported inflation of 1.6% in
CFH retail selling prices.

Notwithstanding a decline in sales of 4.8% in rand terms as a result of currency devaluation
and poor performance in Zimbabwe, Pep Africa reported a markedly improved performance
in constant currency with sales growth of 18.7% and like-for-like growth of 13.3%. This was
supported by improved performance in Angola, Zambia and Nigeria.

The Speciality division reported sales growth of 7.3% with like-for-like growth of 3.0% in
aggregate. Satisfactory performance was achieved in the clothing product categories with
continued softer performance in footwear.

Furniture, appliances & electronics

The furniture, appliances and electronics brands reported sales growth of 0.6% and a decline
in like-for-like sales of 2.7% as the spending patterns of financially constrained consumers favour
essentials as opposed to durable product categories.

Building materials

Sales growth of 2.3% was achieved in the building materials segment with like-for-like growth
of 3.5% while retail space reduced by 1.3%. Performance was supported from a wholesale
perspective however, discounting in this highly competitive and contracting market continues
to put margins under pressure.

Fintech

The FLASH business continues to achieve significant growth, while a satisfactory performance
was reported by the Capfin call centre and debt collection operations. The segment reported
31.3% revenue growth for the quarter.
Outlook

Overall, Pepkor's defensive market position and strategy of providing customers with value at
affordable prices, continue to resonate with a financially constrained consumer. It is expected
that these Pepkor fundamentals will continue to support future performance in a very
challenging retail environment.

Impact of Pepkor group's pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Pepkor group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate Pep Africa's
performance in terms of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To
present this information, current period turnover for Pep Africa reported in currencies other
than ZAR are converted from local currency actuals into ZAR at the prior year's actual average
exchange rates. The table below sets out the percentage change in sales, based on the
actual results for the period, in reported currency and constant currency for the basket of

*Before capital items


The Pepkor group has completed its first financial year as a listed company and this is the first results publication under 
the Pepkor name. The 2018 financial year (FY18) will be remembered as a year that included numerous significant corporate matters, 
following the events that occurred at Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (Steinhoff) in December 2017. 

Major milestones include the refinancing of the Steinhoff shareholder funding and release from related financial guarantees, the name 
change to Pepkor and good overall financial performance under trying circumstances. The Pepkor corporate management team has made 
good progress in dealing with corporate matters, mitigating impact on the group and its operations. Pepkor’s decentralised management 
and operational structure made it possible to effectively insulate operations from the corporate noise, allowing the operating companies 
to focus on trading and providing value to customers. It was, however, very important to ensure that leadership in the operations 
remained focused and be retained. 

Pepkor today is financially independent and its strategy of providing everyday products at affordable prices at customers’ convenience 
continues to underpin performance in a challenging retail environment. The group’s culture revolves around the customer and providing 
everyday products at the best prices. Pepkor’s unparalleled low cost of doing business and extensive supply chain make this possible.

Consumers continue to face significant pressure on spending power as a result of a strained economy, and the group’s defensive market 
positioning has effectively supported performance. The resilience of the underlying operating businesses was proven. Despite all the 
corporate noise and significant deflation affecting the clothing and general merchandise segment, good results were produced, which 
in many respects stand out in the market. The group has some of the most trusted retail brands in South Africa, which continue to be 
supported by millions of loyal customers. 

During the year the group opened 428 stores, increasing retail space by 3.6%, resulting in a total store base of 5 236 stores. 
The slowdown of expansion in Africa and consolidation of stores in the JD Group and the Dunns brand impacted store expansion.


FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE


Pepkor achieved revenue growth of 10.9% to R64.2 billion during the year ended 30 September 2018. Pepkor’s clothing and general merchandise 
segment, which contributes 66.2% to group revenue, follows a retail trading calendar. FY18 included 52 trading weeks compared to 53 trading 
weeks in FY17. The additional week in FY17 therefore results in a higher base when compared to FY18, and impacts growth rates. Operating 
profit before capital items and one-off costs increased by 10.7% to R6.4 billion from the prior year (FY17). As reported to shareholders 
during Pepkor’s interim results in May 2018, the group’s exposure to the corporate financial guarantee and associated loans resulted 
in one-off costs of R511 million. Including the effect of this, operating profit before capital items increased by 1.9% to R5.9 billion. 
Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 4.2% to R7.1 billion (FY17: R6.8 billion).

As described in the pre-listing statement, significant shareholder funding was introduced in the group’s capital structure upon listing. 
This resulted in an increase in net finance costs from R620 million in FY17 to R1.2 billion in the current year.

The effective tax rate increased to 38.4% (FY17: 30.9%), mainly due to unrecognised tax losses and the non-tax deductibility 
of the R511 million provision relating to the group’s exposure to the corporate financial guarantee and associated loans.

Net debt increased to R12.2 billion (FY17: R12.0 billion) and the contractual net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of the group was 1.64 times. 
Interest cover reduced to 6.51 times due to the timing of the introduction of debt before listing in FY17. Pepkor successfully refinanced 
and settled the Steinhoff shareholder funding on 23 May 2018 after raising R18 billion from financial institutions. The Pepkor group was 
in turn released from all Steinhoff-related guarantees.

Pepkor generated cash from operations of R5.3 billion during the year. Cash generation was impacted due to additional investment 
in inventory, resulting from an increased store footprint ahead of the peak December trading period, stockholding of direct imported 
cellphones, earlier stock inflows and some carry-over of inventory from the previous season due to reduced sales.

As announced on 23 November 2018, Pepkor renegotiated its commercial agreements with Century Capital (CenCap). Pepkor considered 
its options and the decision was made not to acquire consumer loans credit books from CenCap, but rather that Pepkor will build 
its own internal customer credit books. It was agreed that Pepkor will continue to collect the existing CenCap-owned loan books 
at a market-related fee. 

These renegotiated agreements will ultimately result in Pepkor maintaining its income streams and profitability insofar as it pertains 
to financial services operations. The funding required to fund these new Pepkor debtors’ books will amount to approcimately R2.2 billion 
in FY19. 

Pepkor further agreed to purchase 100% of the issued shares in FGI Holdings from Wands Investments, a subsidiary of Fulcrum. 
FGI provides insurance products via its subsidiaries under the Abacus brand. 

Independent fairness opinions were obtained, confirming that the negotiated terms are fair to all Pepkor shareholders.

PEP Africa’s operations in Angola were reported in accordance with IAS 29: Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies, 
following the country’s classification during the year as a hyperinflationary economy. With Angolan operations contributing less 
than 1.0% to group revenue, this did not significantly affect Pepkor’s results.

Enhancement of disclosure

The group revised its financial reporting segments in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to better reflect 
the manner in which it is structured and managed internally. 

The group has further completed an extensive review process of disclosures made in its annual financial statements in order to enhance 
disclosure where deemed necessary and appropriate. In addition, Pepkor announced earlier on 26 November 2018 the conclusion of a JSE 
investigation pertaining to the disclosures made in Pepkor’s pre-listing statement, issued in September 2017, and the 2017 annual 
financial statements.

Comparability

FY17 results
As announced on SENS on 20 November 2018, the comparability of Pepkor’s statutory earnings per share metrics is impacted by the issue 
of 882 million shares during FY17. 

This included 132 million shares for the acquisition of Tekkie Town on 1 February 2017 and 750 million shares issued on 20 September 2017, 
shortly before the FY17 year-end on 30 September 2017, upon Pepkor’s listing on the JSE. This resulted in 3 450 million Pepkor shares 
in issue compared to a weighted average number of shares of 2 678 million applied in the FY17 statutory earnings per share metrics. 
Should a weighted average number of shares of 3 450 million be applied to the FY17 reported earnings of R3 550 million and reported 
headline earnings of R3 576 million, FY17 statutory earnings per share is reduced by approximately 30 cents.

FY18 results
As reported in Pepkor’s interim results on 29 May 2018, FY18 results are impacted by one-off costs pertaining to a provision 
for exposure in terms of a corporate financial guarantee of R440 million and associated loans of R60 million. At year-end, the guarantee, 
including accumulated finance costs of R11 million, amounts to R451 million, with the provision for associated loans remaining unchanged 
at R60 million. One-off costs in FY18 therefore amount to R511 million, negatively impacting FY18 earnings per share metrics 
by approximately 15 cents. This is calculated by applying the total impact net of tax of R511 million to a weighted average number 
of shares of 3 450 million.

In addition, comparability is affected by the acquisition of Tekkie Town, effective 1 February 2017, and the acquisition 
of Building Supply Group (BSG), effective 1 October 2017. 

Dividend

Pepkor has a relatively geared balance sheet compared to other listed retail peers. 

As a result of future capital commitments, strategic investments and the group’s ambition to reduce its gearing to one times 
net debt-to-EBITDA in the medium term, the board has approved a revised dividend policy of three times earnings cover. 

The board has therefore declared a final dividend of 27.8 cents per ordinary share, being Pepkor’s maiden dividend, payable 
to shareholders on Monday, 21 January 2019. The dividend has been declared out of income reserves.

The local dividend tax rate is 20%. The net local dividend amount is 22.24 cents per share for shareholders liable to pay dividends 
tax and 27.8 cents per share for shareholders exempt from paying dividends tax. The issued ordinary share capital of Pepkor Holdings Limited 
as at the date of this declaration is 3 450 million ordinary shares. Pepkor Holdings Limited’s tax reference number is IT9542320180.


COMMENTARY


Operational performance

Clothing and general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported good performance despite a financially constrained South African consumer 
and significant selling price deflation resulting from a strengthening rand during 2017, translating into a reduction in retail 
selling prices. 

Segmental revenue increased by 7.2% to R42.5 billion, while operating profit increased by 8.1% to R6.1 billion. Clothing, Footwear 
and Home (CFH) product departments, in particular Footwear, experienced significant deflation. Optimisation and development of the product 
mix and driving of sales volumes successfully countered the deflationary environment. This resulted in a 7.0% increase in sales units sold 
during the year, while the number of sales transactions increased by 6.3%. All brands included in this reporting segment continue to provide 
value to customers and from these results it can be assumed that market share was gained. 

The segment opened 335 new stores during the year, expanding the retail footprint to 4 220 stores. Retail space increased by 4.5% 
to 1.6 million square metres. Brands included in this segment follow a retail trading calendar. FY18 included 52 trading weeks compared 
to 53 trading weeks in FY17. The additional week in FY17 therefore results in a higher base when compared to FY18, and impacts growth rates. 
Growth rates reported below are on a comparable 52 trading week basis. 

PEP and Ackermans 
In aggregate, PEP and Ackermans achieved merchandise sales growth of 8.0% and like-for-like growth of 3.3%. Within CFH product departments 
in particular, deflation amounted to 4.5%, and pricing benefits were passed on to customers as part of the brands’ long-established DNA 
of providing best prices and value. Growth of 6.1% in transactions and 9.0% in sales units supported performance. 

PEP
PEP remained true to its DNA of Best Price Leadership (BPL), notwithstanding deflation and competitive pressure. PEP opened 137 new stores. 
On a net basis, the total store footprint increased by 118 stores to 2 231 stores, representing growth of 4.1% in retail space. The Adult 
and Home product categories reported strong growth, while in Cellular, demand for smartphones and data continue to underpin strong 
performance. PEP remains a significant provider of cellphones in South Africa.

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) reported double-digit growth driven by ongoing product innovation, private label promotional activities 
and a wider product offering, while strong growth in PEP Money was driven by the FIFA World Cup, resulting in strong DSTV decoder sales. 
Initiatives like the PAXI parcel delivery service and the new Dealz discount variety retail concept, with four stores, continues to perform 
in line with expectation. 

PEP continued to achieve operating leverage, celebrating its 19th consecutive year of double-digit operating profit growth. 

Ackermans
Ackermans continues to outperform competitors in the South African apparel industry as the strong customer value proposition aimed 
at ‘women with kids in their lives’ continues to drive performance. Ackermans opened 80 new stores during FY18.

On a net basis the total store footprint expanded with 75 stores to 730 stores, representing 6.7% space growth. This includes three 
Ackermans Woman stores, the new retail format focused on ladies’ wear.

The credit sales contribution was maintained at 17.5% of total sales, with a 9.8% increase in revolving credit accounts to 1.1 million. 
Growth in CFH was supported by double-digit growth in the Essentials, Boys and Ladies product categories. Ladies continues to grow 
aggressively. A state-of-the-art 90 000 square metre distribution centre in Hammarsdale, KwaZulu-Natal was opened in October 2018, which 
will support future growth and operational efficiencies.

Ackermans continued to achieve operating leverage, celebrating its ninth consecutive year of high double-digit operating profit growth, 
an exceptional performance in the South African retail market. 

PEP Africa
PEP Africa, which contributes 3.6% to group revenue, experienced a very challenging year, marked by the lagging effect of low commodity 
prices, foreign exchange shortages, and high inflation rates that continue to weigh on consumer spending.

At constant exchange rates, merchandise sales decreased by 1.8% and like-for-like sales reduced by 8.7%. Excluding Angola and Zimbabwe, 
merchandise sales growth of 12.3% was achieved, supported by double-digit sales growth in Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia.

Speciality
The speciality division achieved satisfactory results despite a challenging environment. Merchandise sales growth amounted to 12.5%, 
and 6.9% on a like-for-like basis was achieved. 

Tekkie Town reported good sales growth and respectable like-for-like growth for the year, despite senior management disruptions 
and a competitive trading environment. A new management team was appointed, and the business remains on track to reach 400 stores in FY19. 

The customer value proposition in Dunns remains a focus area and a positive trend is emerging as stores are consolidated.

John Craig reported excellent results following the repositioning of the business to focus on the Polo and Muratti in-house brand.

Shoe City celebrated its 150th store opening during the year, but had a challenging year with performance impacted by significant price 
deflation in footwear.

Refinery reported very good results and is profitable in what is only its second year of operation. The brand has successfully gained 
traction with young adult customers.

Furniture, appliances and electronics

The furniture, appliances and electronics segment reported good results with a strong year-on-year improvement and achieved its 
turnaround objectives. 

Segmental revenue increased by 10.6% to R8.6 billion. The business is now profitable from an ongoing operations perspective 
and is optimally positioned following its restructure, brand consolidation, and significant reduction in credit reliance to 18.1%. 
The operating loss of R137 million was mainly due to the performance and closure of the POCO brand.

Merchandise sales growth amounted to 9.7% and like-for-like growth of 4.7% was achieved. The brands’ customer proposition 
is proving successful with all brands reporting improved trading, despite the challenging durable goods market where consumer 
spending is easily deferred. 

Credit remains an important sales enabler, with 27.5% of furniture brands’ sales and 7.8% of electronics and appliances brands’ sales 
transacted on credit. 

The business continues its digital transformation to an omni-model with omni-solutions, including the introduction of extended aisle 
capability in-store, new online marketing channels, and commissioning of an online sales distribution centre. Improved efficiencies 
and controls were achieved from digital supply chain delivery systems and data analytics.

Building materials 

The building materials segment experienced a difficult year, due to a subdued economy with low business confidence and a highly 
competitive environment within the building industry. 

Segmental revenue increased by 19.9% to R8.1 billion, while operating profit decreased by 11.9% to R214 million. This includes 
the contribution of the BSG business, which was acquired on 1 October 2017.

Excluding BSG, the business reported a decline in merchandise sales of 3.1% and a like-for-like sales decline of 1.6%.

Discounting of sales prices was required to compete in the marketplace, which placed pressure on profitability.

The two acquisitions over the last three years (Iliad and BSG) have caused some distraction in the business. To this end, a Customer 
Centricity and Values programme was launched during the year to renew focus on driving sales.

Good cost control was maintained across the business, which supported profitability.

FinTech

The segment increased revenue by 35.5% to R5.0 billion, while operating profit increased by 10.6% to R250 million.

The FLASH business, which represents more than 90% of this segment’s revenue, reported aggressive growth. FLASH provides virtual 
solutions in the informal market and increased virtual turnover by more than 20%. The number of FLASH traders increased to 145 000 
from 121 000 a year ago. 

The Southern View Finance SA call centre and Van As debt collection operations performed below expectation due to additional 
costs incurred.

Outlook

Management remains confident that the group’s defensive market positioning and relentless focus on providing value to customers will 
continue to underpin good performance and results. While the challenging trading environment and low business confidence is expected 
to continue for the foreseeable future, this environment will provide opportunities for Pepkor to grow market share. Based on this, 
the group plans to open 300 stores, on a net basis, in the 2019 financial year, equating to approximately 4.0% retail space growth.

Performance by the CFH retailers is expected to improve as they move into inflationary pricing, and there are numerous initiatives 
under way by the respective retail brands to capitalise on market opportunities, all of which are focused on customer convenience. 

With the furniture business having completed its restructure, it has a good foundation to trade from going forward. The business 
is optimally positioned to take advantage of improvements in consumer confidence and opportunities to grow market share by focusing 
on top-line sales to build further scale. 

The building materials sector is expected to remain under pressure in the medium term, until confidence in the economy is restored 
and government infrastructure initiatives are followed through. Focus will be on developing a strong foundation for the business 
from which it can grow in the future.

Appreciation

The Pepkor group comprises 48 000 experienced and dedicated employees who drive the culture of providing value to customers. 
Management and the board are grateful for their loyalty and continued dedication during a challenging year. The board would like 
to thank its shareholders, customers and suppliers for their continued support.

Basis of preparation

The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements 
for summarised financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to summarised financial statements. The Listings 
Requirements require summarised financial statements to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement 
and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued 
by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, 
as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements from which the summarised consolidated financial statements were derived are in terms 
of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those accounting policies applied in the preparation of the previous 
consolidated annual financial statements.

Financial statements

These summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., 
who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The auditor also expressed an unmodified opinion on the annual financial statements

and ‘Operational performance’ and any reference to future financial information included in the summarised financial information, has 
not been audited and is the sole responsibility of the board. This announcement does not include the information required pursuant 
to paragraph 16A(j) of IAS 34. The full consolidated financial statements are available at the issuer’s office upon request. The auditor’s 
report does not necessarily report on all the information contained in this announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that, 
in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor’s engagement, they should obtain a copy of the auditor’s report

Significant events

Guarantee to RMB in relation to investment company and impairment of loans due by key management and employees 
Pepkor, through its subsidiaries, has been a guarantor of third-party debt related to an investment company since 2012. The investment 
initially consisted of Pepkor shares, but was exchanged for Steinhoff shares in 2015 following Steinhoff’s acquisition of Pepkor. 
Following the decline in the Steinhoff share price after the publication of Pepkor’s results in 2017, the risk of liability in this 
regard could no longer be considered to be remote and as such the group has provided an amount of R451 million.

In addition, a provision for an impairment of loans associated to the third-party debt amounting to R60 million was raised.

Refinancing of Steinhoff funding
Pepkor successfully refinanced its Steinhoff shareholder funding facilities with various South African banks and financial institutions.

The refinancing ensured that Pepkor is financially independent. The facilities were used to settle the Steinhoff shareholder funding, 
which Steinhoff in turn used to settle its external obligations to which Pepkor group companies were co-guarantors to. Pepkor group 
companies have subsequently been released from all guarantees relating to the Steinhoff shareholder funding. 

The new funding facilities are subject to covenants, which are well within the recommended range.

Events subsequent to the reporting period

As announced on 23 November 2018, Pepkor has agreed to terminate its existing commercial relationship with Century Capital Proprietary 
Limited (CenCap), in a phased approach.

Under the current commercial agreements, CenCap, a subsidiary of Wands Investments Proprietary Limited (Wands), is responsible 
for the funding of credit books that provide credit to customers of JD Group (JD consumer credit) and unsecured personal loans 
(Capfin loans) using the PEP and Ackermans retail footprint. Wands carries the credit risk related to these financial services. 
Wands is a subsidiary of Fulcrum Financial Services SA. Pepkor, through its internal financial administration service operations 
(call centre and debt collection operations), provides administration and collection services (outsourced services) to CenCap related 
to the JD consumer credit and Capfin loans provided to Pepkor customers in return for a fee.
 
Subsequent to year-end, Pepkor considered its options and decided not to pursue the acquisition of the credit books owned by CenCap, 
but instead to build its own credit books. With regard to the existing credit books, commercial agreements were renegotiated, 
granting Pepkor the right to continue collection of the CenCap-owned loan books for the run-down period of the books, up to 
a maximum period of three years, and to render the outsourced services at a market-related fee.

Pepkor further agreed to purchase 100% of the issued shares in FGI Holdings Proprietary Limited (FGI) from Wands for a purchase price 
of approximately R150 million. FGI provides insurance products via its subsidiaries under the Abacus brand to Pepkor customers 
and contains highly regulated, liquid assets. The acquisition is subject to due diligence and other conditions precedent, normal 
for transactions of this nature.

Basis of segmental presentation

During the period Pepkor revised its internal management reporting structure and consequently revised its segmental reporting to better 
reflect the group’s internal management review structure to the chief operating decision maker (CODM).

The segmental information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS 8: Operating Segments (IFRS 8), which defines requirements 
for the disclosure of financial information of an entity’s operating segments. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified 
on the basis of internal reporting of group components that are regularly reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources to segments 
and to assess their performance. The board of directors has been identified as the CODM.

For management purposes, the group is organised into business units based on their products and services, and has four operating 
and reportable segments as follows:

Clothing and general merchandise retail business units including PEP, Ackermans, PEP Africa, Powersales, Dunns, Refinery, Shoe City, 
Tekkie Town, Tenacity and the corporate office.

Furniture, appliances and electronics merchandise retail business units including Rochester, Russells, Bradlows, Incredible Connection, 
HiFi Corp, Sleepmasters and POCO (closed in 2018).

General building material retail brands include BUCO and Timbercity, while specialist building material brands, servicing both the retail 
and wholesale market, include inter alia Tiletoria, Floors Direct, MacNeil and Cachet. Other brands include B-One, Buchel, W&B Hardware, 
Bildware, Citiwood, Chipbase and Brands 4 Africa.

Auxiliary business units leveraging and utilising the group's retail store footprint in terms of interacting with their respective 
consumer markets include FLASH, Southern View Finance SA (call centre) and Van As (debt collector).

The board of directors evaluates segmental performance based on revenue and operating profit before capital items and one-off items. 
Finance cost and taxation are monitored on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Segment revenue excludes value-added 
taxation. Segment operating profit before capital items represents segment revenue less segment expenses, excluding capital items included 
in note 2.1 and one-off items. Segment expenses include distribution expenses and other operating expenses.

The segment assets are not reviewed separately by the CODM and therefore have not been presented in line with IFRS 8. 

Segmental analysis

Geographical analysis
The revenue, operating profit and assets are all classified as one geographical region.

Major customers
No single customer contributes 10% or more of the group’s revenue.

One-off items
Pepkor, through its subsidiaries, has been a guarantor of third-party debt related to an investment company since 2012. The investment 
initially consisted of Pepkor shares, but was exchanged for Steinhoff shares in 2015 following Steinhoff’s acquisition of Pepkor. 
Following the decline in the Steinhoff share price after the publication of Pepkor’s results in 2017, the risk of liability in this 
regard could no longer be considered to be remote and as such the group has provided an amount of R451 million.

In addition, a provision for an impairment of loans associated to the third-party debt amounting to R60 million was raised.

   The goodwill arising on the acquisition of these companies is attributable to the strategic business advantages acquired, principal 
   retail locations and leases, as well as knowledgeable employees and management strategies that did not meet the criteria for recognition 
   as other intangible assets on the date of acquisition.
   
   BSG was acquired in the current year in order to gain greater exposure to the floor covering segment of the hardware and building 
   supply market; supplement its current wholesale operations; and to gain access to existing distribution capability into Africa.

6. RESTATEMENT

   6.1 Presentation of exchange differences on loans to foreign operations
       During the year, the group identified an error in its presentation of exchange differences on translation of net investments 
       in foreign African operations. 
  
       Although nothing has changed in the net effect in the statement of changes in equity, IAS 21:32 requires that exchange differences 
       arising from the translation of monetary receivables from foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
       to occur are to be recognised in other comprehensive income instead of recognising it directly in the statement of changes in equity. 
  
       Exchange differences on translation of net investment in foreign African operations were previously included in other reserves 
       in 2017 and have been presented separately in the foreign currency translation reserve, with restated comparatives presented. 
       There has been no impact on equity as a result of this reclassification between reserves within equity on the statement 
       of changes in equity.
  
   6.2 Restatement of statement of changes in equity
       In order to better reflect the equity of the group, the classification of total equity as at 30 September 2016 between 
       the various reserve categories has been restated.

       The group was formed as part of a common control transaction. This transaction was accounted for by applying predecessor 
       accounting retrospectively. That is, the financial statements are reflected as though the group was always in existence. 
       As Pepkor Holdings Limited was only formed on 1 July 2017, there were no shares in issue at 30 September 2016. The equity 
       that was allocated to share capital, retained earnings and common control reserve have been moved to other reserves and only

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT - RENEGOTIATION OF COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
PERTAINING TO FINANCIAL SERVICES AND ACQUISITION OF INSURANCE BUSINESS

Pepkor hereby advises that it has agreed to terminate its existing commercial relationship with
Century Capital (Pty) Ltd (""Cencap""), in a phased approach.

1.   BACKGROUND


     Historically, a commercial relationship was established during 2016 between the
     subsidiaries of Pepkor Holdings Limited (""Pepkor"", the ""Company"" or the ""Group"") and
     subsidiaries of Wands Investments Proprietary Limited (collectively ""Wands""). Wands is
     responsible for the funding of credit books that provide financial services to customers of
     certain Pepkor retail brands. Wands carries the credit risk related to these financial
     services. Wands is a subsidiary of Fulcrum Financial services SA (""Fulcrum"").

     The financial services delivered by Wands include:
     1. Credit, provided by Cencap, to customers of the JD Group (""JD consumer credit"")
        and unsecured personal loans (""Capfin loans"") provided by Cencap by using the Pep
        and Ackermans retail footprint.
     2. Insurance products, provided by FGI Holdings Proprietary Limited (""FGI"") under the
        brands of Abacus Insurance and Abacus Life.

     Pepkor, through its internal financial services administration operations (call centre and
     debt collection operations), has to date provided origination, collection, accounting,
     regulatory and compliance services (""Outsourced services"") to Cencap pertaining to JD
     consumer credit, Capfin loans and FGI.

     Pepkor has therefore been responsible for managing all operational aspects of services
     provided to customers, including the customer experience and interaction, except for the
     funding thereof, which has been provided by Cencap.


2. PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS

     Pepkor considered its options and decided not to pursue the acquisition of the credit books
     owned by Cencap, but instead will build its own credit books. With regard to the existing
     credit books, commercial agreements were renegotiated, granting Pepkor the right to
     continue collection of the Cencap-owned loan books for the run-down period of the books,
     up to a maximum period of 3 years and render the Outsourced services at a market-related
     fee (""Commercial Agreements"").

     Pepkor further agreed to purchase 100% of the issued shares in FGI from Wands for a
     purchase price of circa R150 million (""the FGI Transaction""). FGI contains highly
     regulated, liquid assets. The acquisition is subject to a due diligence and other conditions
     precedent, normal for transactions of this nature.

     The Commercial Agreements and FGI Transaction are herein collectively referred to as
     ""the Proposed Transactions"".


3.   RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS

     The ability of Cencap to continue funding financial services provided to Pepkor customers
     is uncertain. This presents a business risk to Pepkor as financial services enables sales
     in especially the JD Group retail businesses.

     Pepkor therefore seeks to mitigate any risk to its business operations and aims to:

         1. Take control of the funding of financial services provided to Pepkor customers;
         2. Maintain profitability insofar as it relates to financial services and Pepkor’s
            financial services operations; and
         3. Ultimately, end its commercial relationship with Fulcrum, Wands & Cencap in a
            responsible manner.

     Pepkor further seeks to protect the positive contribution from insurance products provided
     to Pepkor customers by FGI, through its subsidiaries Abacus Life and Abacus Insurance.

     Pepkor already possess the financial services administration capabilities to manage the
     inherent credit risk associated with the internal funding of retail credit and unsecured
     lending books. The Group’s capability is further strengthened by successfully funding and
     managing the clothing and general merchandise retail credit book through Tenacity
     Financial Services since 2007.

     The Proposed Transactions will result in Pepkor gaining control over the customer data
     and book in addition to controlling the customer experience and interactions.

4.   DESCRIPTION OF THE RENEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS AND PARTICULARS OF
     THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS

     The following is a summary of the historic and renegotiated Commercial agreements
     between Pepkor and Cencap:


        1. JD Group
                a. Commercial agreement
                    This current agreement allows Cencap to provide credit (""JD consumer
                    credit"") to customers of the JD Group. Pepkor earns a merchant
                    commission in return. Cencap is responsible for the credit granting criteria
                    of JD consumer credit and bears the credit risk.
                    The effective date of termination of the current agreement was 30
                    September 2018. After this date, JD consumer credit would be originated
                    and funded by Pepkor and therefore no merchant commission would be
                    receivable from Cencap in respect of the period after this date.

      b. Outsource agreement
            Services pertaining to JD consumer credit such as origination,
            administration and collection through its store network are outsourced by
            Cencap to Pepkor for a fee based on a cost recovery basis.
            The effective date of termination of the current outsource agreement was
            30 September 2018. It was replaced by a new outsource agreement with
            an effective date of 1 October 2018 and termination date of
            30 September 2021. In terms of this agreement Pepkor will provide certain
            services to Cencap relating to Cencap’s existing consumer credit book.
            These services include primarily collection (as exclusive agent),
            administration, regulatory and compliance services. The service fee in
            terms of this agreement will be on an arms-length basis.


2. Capfin
      a. Commercial agreement
            The current agreement allows Capfin unsecured personal loan (""Capfin
            loans"") applications to be made in certain Pepkor retail stores for which
            Pepkor earns a distribution fee in return. Cencap is responsible for the
            granting of Capfin loans and bears the credit risk on these Capfin loans.
            The current agreement will terminate on 30 June 2019. At the latest from
            1 July 2019, Capfin loans will be originated and funded by Pepkor and
            therefore no further distribution fees will be receivable from Cencap.


      b. Outsource agreement
            Services pertaining to Capfin loans are outsourced by Cencap to Pepkor
            for a ""cost plus""-fee. These services include inter alia: origination,
            collection, accounting, regulatory and compliance services.
            The current outsource agreement will terminate on 30 June 2019 and will
            continue to operate on a ""cost plus"" recovery basis until then.

            A new outsource agreement will become effective from 1 July 2019 to
            30 September 2021 whereby Pepkor will exclusively collect Capfin loans
            granted before 1 July 2019. Services will include: collection, accounting,
            regulatory and compliance services. The service fee in terms of this
            agreement will be on an arms-length basis.


3. FGI
      a. Insurance services provider commercial agreement
            FGI’s right of first refusal as provider of insurance products is determined
            in terms of the JD credit provider commercial agreement referred to above
            and an undertaking by Pepkor to FGI during 2016 not to cancel this
            commercial agreement before December 2020. This agreement allows the
            Abacus entities to provide insurance products to Pepkor customers that
            are interdependent on JD consumer credit and include credit life insurance
            and product insurance. Pepkor earns commission and administration fees
            in return. As mentioned above, the FGI Transaction is subject to a due
            diligence and other conditions and should the due diligence condition in
            the FGI Transaction not be fulfilled, this period will be extended until June
            2021.

     These renegotiated agreements ultimately results in Pepkor maintaining its income
     streams and profitability insofar as it pertains to financial services operations.


5.   PURCHASE CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF THE FGI ACQUISITION

     Pepkor will pay a purchase consideration of R150 million to Wands based on an estimated
     net asset value of FGI equal to R100 million. Should the net asset value of FGI:

         •   Exceed R100m, the purchase consideration will be increased with the excess; or

         •   Be less than R100m, the purchase consideration will be reduced with the shortfall.


6.   FGI FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     FGI net asset value as on 30 June 2018 was R238 million, after which date a dividend of
     R158 million was declared. FGI consolidated profits after tax for the 12 months ended 30
     June 2018, was R54 million, based on the audited annual financial statements of FGI for
     the year ending 30 June 2018, which were prepared in terms of IFRS.

     various parties, including Fulcrum, Cencap and Wands (""Fulcrum Relationship"").


     Furthermore, entities controlled by the Wiese family (the ""Preference Shareholders"")
     hold preference shares in Southern View Finance Holdings SA (Pty) Ltd (""Southern
     View""), a subsidiary of Wands. The Preference Shareholders entered into agreement/s
     with Wands to acquire Southern View and Cencap in an attempt to secure the
     recoverability of these preference shares, which agreement/s are currently subject to
     conditions precedent. The Preference Shareholders may therefore receive indirectly a
     financial benefit in respect of the Commercial Agreements as shareholders of Cencap
     and / or the application of the sale proceeds of the FGI Transaction to repay a loan owing
     by Wands to Southern View (""Wiese Relationship"")

     Based on the Fulcrum Relationship and the Wiese Relationship, the Pepkor board of
     directors (""Pepkor Board"") has deemed it prudent to appoint PSG Capital (""Independent
     Expert"") as the independent expert to compile a fairness opinion on the Proposed
     Transactions. The Independent Expert has considered the terms and conditions of the
     Proposed Transactions and is of the opinion that the terms and conditions of the Proposed
     Transactions are fair to the shareholders of the Company.

TRADING STATEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS

1. TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2018

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (""JSE""), a listed company is required to
publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes aware that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the financial period to be reported on next, being
the year ended 30 September 2018 (""FY18""), will differ by at least 20% from the most recent
financial   results   for   the   previous   corresponding   period,   being   the   year   ended
30 September 2017 (""FY17"").

As reported at PEPKOR’s interim results during May 2018, the comparability of PEPKOR’s
statutory results is impacted by the following two factors (""Comparability Factors""):

   1.  During FY17 PEPKOR issued 882 million shares. This included 132 million shares for the
       acquisition of Tekkie Town on 1 February 2017 and 750 million shares issued on
       20 September 2017, shortly before the FY17 year end on 30 September 2017, upon
       PEPKOR’s listing on the JSE. This resulted in 3 450 million PEPKOR shares in issue compared
       to a weighted average number of shares of 2 678 million applied in the FY17 statutory
       earnings per share metrics.

       Should a weighted average number of shares of 3 450 million be applied to the FY17
       reported earnings of R3 550 million and reported headline earnings of R3 576 million,
       FY17 statutory earnings per share is reduced by approximately 30 cents. Refer to table
       below.

   2.  As reported in PEPKOR’s interim results on 29 May 2018, FY18 results will be impacted by
       one-off costs pertaining to a provision for exposure on a corporate guarantee and
       associated loans. The total exposure was provided for during the time of the interim
       results and amounted to R500 million.

       These one-off costs of will negatively impact FY18 basic and headline earnings per
       share metrics by approximately 14 cents and is calculated by applying the total impact
       net of tax of R500 million to a weighted average number of shares of 3 450 million.

Taking these factors into account, PEPKOR hereby advises that a reasonable degree of
certainty exist that the Statutory Results will reflect the following:

2. SHOPRITE CALL OPTIONS

Shareholders are referred to the Company’s previous announcement dated 15 December
2017 pertaining to the exercise of call option agreements with PIC, Lancaster, Titan and
Lavender Sky (""call options"") to acquire approximately 23.1% economic interest in, and
approximately 50.6% voting control of Shoprite, which call option agreements were subject to
certain conditions precedent.
It was confirmed then that the call options with Titan and Lavender Sky terminated and that
the board would enter into discussions with the remaining parties, being the PIC and Lancaster,
to assess the way forward.

Following various discussions and based on senior counsel advice, the board confirms the
termination of the call option agreements with the PIC and Lancaster. PEPKOR will therefore
not acquire any economic nor voting interest in Shoprite as described in the Pre-Listing
Statement.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

For the nine months ended 30 June 2018 PEPKOR achieved group revenue growth of 13.8% to
R48.9 billion on a statutory basis. On a Comparable Basis, as defined below, group revenue
growth of 9.2% was achieved.

The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported merchandise sales growth of 7.7% and
like-for-like growth of 2.7%. Retail space increased by 5.4% with the opening of 148 new stores
(91 Pep and 57 Ackermans) during the period. Deflation of approximately 5% in the clothing,
footwear and homeware (CFH) product categories within Pep and Ackermans continued to
weigh on sales growth. Volume growth of 9.6% (5.4% on a like-for-like basis) supported
performance. The impact of deflation on CFH sales growth is expected to reduce during the
fourth quarter of the 2018 financial year. In addition, the month of July showed particularly
strong like-for-like performance.

Pep Africa, comprising approximately 4% of group revenue, continues to experience
challenging operating conditions in addition to deflation. Positive merchandise sales growth
of 4.0% was reported. Like-for-like sales performance improved during the third quarter,
resulting in a decline of 14.7% compared to a decline of 16.2% reported for the six months
ended 31 March 2018.

Strong merchandise sales growth momentum, on a Comparable Basis, continued in the
speciality fashion and footwear brands, reporting growth of 14.0% and like-for-like growth of
7.4% in aggregate. The interim management team at Tekkie Town has successfully stabilised
the business and operations continue to operate in line with expectations.

The furniture, consumer electronics and appliances brands continued to perform well.
Notwithstanding difficult trading conditions in the durables market, merchandise sales growth
of 10.7% and like-for-like growth of 6.3% was reported for the nine-month period.

The building materials and DIY (Do-it-yourself) business continued to operate in a challenging
market. On a Comparable Basis, merchandise sales declined by 1.4% while like-for-like sales
declined by 2.2% for the period under review.

The overall retail environment remains very competitive with financially constrained
consumers. The group’s focus on providing value to customers at affordable prices is expected
to continue supporting group performance during the remainder of the financial year.

The information included above does not constitute an earnings forecast and has not been

TEAM

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement made on 6 July 2018 pertaining to an
interim court order against, inter alia, four senior members of the previous Tekkie Town
management team, interdicting the respondents (“Respondents”) from conducting certain
actions against Tekkie Town.

On 31 July 2018 all parties agreed to an order which protects the Tekkie Town data and further
protects the Tekkie Town business against possible interference with its IT systems, servers,
networks and hardware or software. In terms of the court order:

    1) All the Respondents undertake not to use information proprietary to Tekkie Town;
    2) All the Respondents undertake to destroy any copies or records of @star-speciality
       and @tekkietown email accounts, with the exception of identified email accounts used
       for private business and file an affidavit by 15 August 2018 that this has been done;
    3) All the Respondents undertake to destroy any other data proprietary to Tekkie Town
       and file an affidavit by 15 August 2018 that this has been done; and
    4) Two senior members of the previous Tekkie Town management team record that they
       will not access or interfere with (or attempt to do so) the Tekkie Town information
       technology system, server or network or any Tekkie Town hardware or software either
       in its head office or in any store, in any manner whatsoever.

This outcome is very positive for Tekkie Town and STAR. The interim interdict served as an
immediate prevention of possible interference while the court order made on 31 July 2018
protects the business in the longer term.

      achieve objectives of growth and innovation in an increasingly competitive
      environment. Mark brings a broad range of business competencies including strategy,
      mergers and acquisitions, innovation, technology and digitisation which is crucial in the

      Chamber of Commerce and chairperson of a number of NGOs.

   2) Ms Heather Sonn (“Heather”) tendered her resignation from the Board with effect from
      30 July 2018 in order to focus her efforts on her position as chairperson of the supervisory

      time.

   3) Appointment of Mr Philip Dieperink (“Philip”) as a non-executive director with effect
      from 30 July 2018 to replace Heather.

      Philip earned his honours degree in accountancy at the University of Pretoria. He joined
      Deloitte & Touche (“Deloitte”) in 1980, where he qualified as a chartered accountant
      in 1981. He transferred to the tax division, specialising in corporate and international tax
      planning, and became a tax partner in 1987. After leaving Deloitte, he joined Unitrans
      Limited (“Unitrans”) as chief financial officer and helped to develop the strategic
      direction and growth of the Unitrans group over 10 years, until 2007, when Unitrans was
      purchased by the Steinhoff group. He holds several other appointments within the
      Steinhoff group of companies and currently serves on the boards of directors of
      Steinhoff Asia Pacific Limited and Cofel. In September 2007, he relocated to the United
      Kingdom to assume the position of chief financial officer of Steinhoff UK Holdings
      Limited. Philip was appointed as chief financial officer and member of the
      management board of Steinhoff NV on 20 April 2018.

   4) In accordance with the Company`s standard practices, non-executive directors who
      are categorised as independent, underwent an external evaluation of their
      independence and it was concluded that Jayendra Naidoo should be classified as a
      non-executive director.

   5) The Board has established a social and ethics committee as required by the
      Companies Act no 71 of 2008. This requirement was previously fulfilled by the Steinhoff
      Investment Holdings Limited Governance and Sustainability Committee. Ms.
      Fagmeedah Petersen-Cook has been appointed as the chairperson of the Company`s
      social and ethics committee and Mr Leon Lourens has been appointed as a member
      of the social and ethics committee.

The Board believes that it represents an excellent, diversified set of skills. The recent additions
to the Board boost the set of skills required to ensure that the Board is equipped to deal with
the challenges it faces in a difficult economic environment, and as it implements the strategy
of the business in order to grow and expand. The independence of the Board is strengthened
by the designation of Mr Johann Cilliers as lead independent non-executive director, as
announced on 29 May 2018.

UPDATE ON TEKKIE TOWN

STAR has today obtained from the Western Cape High Court a court order on an urgent basis
against four senior members of the previous Tekkie Town management team interdicting the
respondents from conducting certain actions against STAR which include interference with
the Tekkie Town Information Technology System and destabilising operations.

CEO Leon Lourens commented: “It is regrettable that we have had to take such legal action.
We remain focussed on the continued success of STAR and Tekkie Town with our determined
and committed team and will focus on continued growth. Our ethics and values have never
changed and never will. We will continue to use the necessary legal process available to
protect our business.”

“The interim management and support team, together with staff members who have remained
in the business, continue to operate Tekkie Town in a stable manner. The supply chain is
operational, all stores are trading and performance is in line with targeted levels. The
performance of all other STAR businesses remains unaffected”.

Tekkie Town continues to be an important part of STAR, operating more than 380 stores, and
providing employment to more than 3 000 employees.

TEKKIE TOWN UPDATE

On Tuesday 25 June 2018, Bernard Mostert, the CEO of Tekkie Town, and other senior members
of management, resigned with immediate effect. In response, STAR immediately deployed an
interim management and support team from various other businesses within STAR, led by Riaan
van Rooyen (currently the Operational Director at Ackermans) to stabilise operations and to
ensure continued trading in Tekkie Town stores.

The background to the events occurring at Tekkie Town, as reported on SENS by STAR on
4 June 2018, appear to arise from a claim lodged by the original founders and shareholders of
Tekkie Town against STAR in respect of an earn-out agreement allegedly reached with
Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. As previously reported, STAR maintains that it is not a party
to any such earn out agreement and further confirms that it has received advice from senior
counsel that there is no reasonable prospect of STAR being held liable in this regard.

Tekkie Town is an important part of STAR, operating 368 stores within STAR’s total retail footprint
of more than 5 100 stores and contributes approximately 3% to STAR’s consolidated annual
revenue. More importantly, Tekkie Town currently employs almost 3 200 people whose
livelihoods depend on the continued operation of the Tekkie Town business and STAR is
determined to protect them.

The interim management and support team has been successful in ensuring that trading in
Tekkie Town stores continues normally. Sales performance to date has not been negatively
impacted despite the exit of the previous senior management team and attempts to disrupt
the business. In addition, contingency plans are in place to ensure that Tekkie Town continues
to operate at full capacity.

A notice of demand to remedy a breach was received from Braam van Huyssteen in respect
of the Tekkie Town head office and distribution premises in George. STAR has contested this
legally.

STAR, as a responsible listed company representing strong organisational cultural values which
have stood the test of time, will continue to focus on serving its millions of daily customers and
its 46 000 employees.

CEO Leon Lourens concluded: “Star’s trusted and iconic brands, such as Ackermans and PEP,
are testament to its values and business ethics – a reputation which was built up over many
years in Pepkor. We will stick steadfastly to these ethics and will not entertain any underhanded
tactics from any quarter. STAR will continue to protect the interest of its shareholders and
employees and will vigorously enforce its legal rights in this regard.”

Introduction
The first half of the financial year has proven to be very challenging for STAR from a corporate perspective. It is understandably 
difficult for the market to comprehend what the impact of the events at Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (‘Steinhoff’) 
is or can be on STAR.
 
STAR is a separately listed company and, after the recent refinancing of shareholder funding, is financially independent. The removal 
of all cross guarantees pertaining to the Steinhoff shareholder funding has been a major milestone. The company has taken a conservative 
approach with a specific focus to identify and limit any future downside risk.

STAR consists of some of the most iconic brands in South African retail that operate independently of the corporate noise that exist. 
The majority of the brands in STAR were part of the former Pepkor Holdings group (Pepkor), which has a proud and successful history.

STAR has a decentralised divisional management structure and is fortunate to have very experienced leadership that manages the respective 
brands. Their priority has been to create stability and to focus their teams on the execution of their strategies and customer value 
propositions - something they have indeed done successfully. Excluding the extraordinary items mentioned below, STAR had a satisfactory 
performance for the period under review. 

Extraordinary items for the six months ended 31 March 2018
STAR issued a trading statement on 25 May 2018 describing the impact of the Steinhoff events on the STAR interim results. This followed 
an audit committee meeting earlier that day that confirmed that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that extraordinary losses will 
be incurred, and the quantum thereof. 

STAR, through its subsidiaries, has been a guarantor of third-party debt related to a Pepkor management investment company since 2011. 
The investment initially consisted of Pepkor shares, but was converted to Steinhoff shares in 2015 following Steinhoff’s acquisition 
of Pepkor. Following the finalisation and publication of STAR’s 2017 annual financial statements and the subsequent decline of the Steinhoff 
share price, the risk of liability in this regard can no longer be considered to be remote. Therefore, the STAR board has taken the 
conservative approach to fully provide for STAR’s exposure in this regard, amounting to R440 million. In addition, a provision for 
an impairment of loans associated to the third-party debt, amounting to R60 million, was provided for, thereby sufficiently providing 
for STAR’s exposure in this regard.

Given the decline of the Steinhoff share price, the legacy Steinhoff share incentive scheme (‘Steinhoff scheme’) no longer adequately 
addresses the need to retain, motivate and reward key senior employees of the group. This resulted in the introduction of a cash 
retention scheme at an additional cost of R90 million in the current reporting period.

STAR interim results 
The comparability of STAR’s statutory results is limited by the timing of its internal restructure in July 2017, prior to its listing. 
The issue of 750 million shares (21.47% of issued share capital) upon listing on 20 September 2017 and acquisitions in both the comparative 
and current period materially impact the comparability of the results. 

For purposes of clarity we provide comparable results for the six months ended 31 March 2018 (H1FY18) as further detailed below.

The comparable results as set out in the additional results have been prepared for illustrative purposes only, in order to provide 
shareholders with comparable results. Because of its nature, the historic financial information may not fairly present STAR’s financial 
position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

The comparable results are presented in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information 
issued by SAICA.

The comparable results are the responsibility of the board and were not reviewed or reported on by STAR’s auditors.

In determining the H1FY17 comparable results, the H1FY17 statutory results were adjusted as follows:  
 
1. The STAR reviewed 31 March 2017 results included tax adjustments of a non-recurring nature that has been normalised by way of using 
   the average effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 30 September 2017. Tax adjustments include inter alia deferred tax assets raised 
   on previously unrecognised tax losses and therefore not recurring in nature.

2. The column titled ‘BSG six months ended 31 March 2017’ has been extracted from the Building Supply Group (BSG) management accounts 
   for the six months ended 31 March 2017. BSG was acquired by STAR and consolidated as part of the STAR unaudited results from 
   1 October 2017 to 31 March 2018. The management of STAR is satisfied with the quality of the management accounts of BSG applied. 

3. The column titled ‘Pro forma BSG adjustments’ refers to the finance costs incurred in funding the acquisition of BSG. The costs 
   are not expected to be tax deductible as it is not in the production of taxable income.

Save for otherwise stated, all comparable adjustments will have a continuing effect on the financial results of STAR.

Notes:
(a) The column titled ‘Pro forma STAR as per pre-listing statement’ refers to the pro forma adjusted results of STAR included 
    in annexure 3 of the pre-listing statement prior to the effects of the Shoprite call options.

The comparable results as set out in the additional results have been prepared for illustrative purposes only, in order to provide 
shareholders with comparable results. Because of its nature, the historic financial information may not fairly present STAR’s financial 
position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

The comparable results are presented in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information 
issued by SAICA.

The comparable results are the responsibility of the board and were not reviewed or reported on by STAR’s auditors.
     
In determining the H1FY18 comparable results trading range as detailed in the trading statement, the H1FY18 statutory results were adjusted 
for the following:

1. STAR is party to a guarantee of third-party debt that is underpinned by the Steinhoff International Holdings N.V (Steinhoff) share 
   price. Since the decline of the Steinhoff share price, the risk of liability in this regard (‘Steinhoff share exposure’) can no longer 
   be considered remote. Exposure to the company pertaining to the Steinhoff share exposure, equating to R440 million (taxation of RNil) 
   and the provision for an impairment of loans associated to the third-party amounting to R60 million (taxation of RNil), have been 
   recognised in the H1FY18 results. This will not have a continuing effect on the financial results as STAR has sufficiently provided 
   for its exposure in this regard. 
 
2. The long-term cash retention scheme impact of R90 million (taxation of R25 million) was recognised in the H1FY18 results. This adjustment 
   will have a continuing effect on the financial results of STAR until 2020 by a similar amount, subject to performance.   


COMPARABLE STAR RESULTS

On a comparable basis, STAR delivered a good performance in a challenging retail environment characterised by slow economic growth 
and consumer spending that remains under severe pressure. Additionally, the challenge of deflation continued to impact sales growth 
within the clothing, footwear and homeware (CFH) retailers, which comprise more than 65% of STAR’s revenue. Action plans were implemented 
to mitigate the impact of deflation, resulting in a stronger sales performance during the second quarter. It is expected that the impact 
of deflation will dissipate gradually in the remainder of this financial year.

STAR’s ability to provide the best price and value offerings in the market translated into revenue growth (on a comparable basis) 
of 10.2% to R33.0 billion for the group. STAR added 155 new stores during the period, increasing its footprint to 5 108 stores covering 
2.4 million square metres. 

Operating profit growth was supported by strong growth in Ackermans and the turnaround of the JD Group. Challenging operating conditions 
in Pep Africa and Steinbuild weighed on operating profit growth. STAR reported comparable operating profit growth of 9.0% to R3.3 billion 
(H1FY17: R3.0 billion). Overall, STAR’s comparable operating margin was largely maintained at 10.0% (H1FY17: 10.1%). 


OPERATIONAL REVIEW BASED ON COMPARABLE RESULTS

Pep and Ackermans 
The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported 8.9% sales growth, supported by the opening of 80 stores on a net basis. Like-for-like 
sales growth of 3.5% for the six months was driven by a stronger performance during the second quarter as a result of increased sales 
volumes and interventions to mitigate the impact of deflation.
 
Kidswear, adultwear and homeware reported strong sales growth, with significantly improved margins in FMCG due to private label products, 
and cellular as a result of the direct import of handsets. 

Gross margins were positively affected, mainly due to the impact of a stronger rand. 

The Flash business, which provides virtual solutions in the informal market, continues to grow aggressively and now supports trading 
through more than 131 000 trading devices across the country.

Pep Africa 
Pep Africa, representing less than 4% of STAR group revenue, reported a disappointing performance for the period under review as low 
commodity prices impacted consumer spending in its traditional markets, while volatile exchange rates and a stronger rand affected 
the business. Forex losses amounting to R88 million were incurred during the period.

Sales growth of 6.3% in rand terms was achieved, which includes the opening of 15 new stores. Negative like-for-like sales growth 
was however reported for the period, while gross margins were negatively impacted by currency volatility and stock clearances.

Macro-economic conditions have impacted significantly on the economies of Angola and Zimbabwe and had a severe impact on their results.

JD Group
The turnaround of the JD Group continues, and results for the period were very positive. All retail brands within the group reported 
improved trading compared to the previous period, with total group sales increasing by 11.4% and like-for-like sales growth of 7.3%. 
This performance was achieved despite extremely difficult market conditions for durable goods. 

Margin improvements were achieved in the furniture brands but remain under pressure in the consumer electronics and appliance brands. 
Credit sales are now a much smaller revenue driver compared to historic levels, generating 29% of furniture sales. Significant 
investments were made in systems and processes to provide the group with a solid platform for future growth.

Speciality fashion and footwear
The speciality fashion and footwear division performed well as a group, achieving comparable sales growth of 17.3% overall 
and 10.1% on a like-for-like basis. The store footprint was expanded to 900 stores during the period, growing by 24 stores. 
Good progress continues to be made with the repositioning of the brands.

Tekkie Town showed positive sales growth and introduced credit by in-house provider, Tenacity. The John Craig brand was repositioned 
to a predominantly private label brand, Muratti, and has shown excellent sales growth. Supported by the reintroduction of ladieswear, 
Refinery has performed very well and has achieved great support and brand traction from the market. Shoe City’s performance was 
significantly impacted by deflation and stock imbalances and, as a result, sales growth was below expectation. Dunns’ profitability 
was impacted by high markdowns and stock clearances. A new management team was appointed to further progress the turnaround 
of this brand.

Building materials and DIY
The building materials industry is under severe pressure as economic development and investment in the country has slowed. 
Despite an improved second quarter, revenue declined by 3.6 % (excluding BSG) for the six months. The trend is consistent across 
the general and specialised building materials divisions. Trading margins have been well managed and are in line with expectation. 
Costs have also been contained.

Following a high degree of corporate activity with the acquisitions of Illiad and BSG over the last two years, the focus has now shifted 
to sales initiatives and operational execution. Recent changes in the political landscape has created a more positive economic outlook 
and may assist improved industry growth in the medium to longer term.

Notes to the summarised consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 31 March 2018

Statement of compliance
The summarised consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with the framework concepts 
and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting 
Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Standards Council, the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the information at a minimum as required by IAS 34: Interim Financial 
Reporting and the requirements of the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008. The summarised consolidated interim financial 
statements have been prepared using accounting policies that comply with IFRS, which are consistent with those applied in the consolidated 
financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2017.

Basis of preparation
The summarised consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in millions of South African rand (Rm) on the historical-cost basis, 
except for certain assets and liabilities, which are carried at amortised cost, and derivative financial instruments, which are stated 
at their fair values. The preparation of the summarised consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 31 March 2018 
was supervised by RG Hanekom CA(SA), the group’s chief financial officer.

Restatement
Subsequent to the finalisation and publication of the group’s 2017 audited annual financial statements, an error was identified 
in the accounting treatment of unrealised exchange rate differences pertaining to the group’s net foreign investment in the Pep Africa 
operations. In terms of IAS 21: The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, exchange differences pertaining to the translation 
of foreign currency monetary items receivable from or payable to foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
to occur, should be recognised initially in other comprehensive income. Notwithstanding the fact that the group recognised such exchange 
differences in the statement of changes in equity, these items were not included in the statement of other comprehensive income.

Financial statements
These results have not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s auditors. All forward-looking information is the responsibility 
of the board of directors and has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s auditors. The results were approved by the board 
of directors on 28 May 2018.

Additional related parties
The forensic investigation underway at the group’s controlling shareholder, Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (‘Steinhoff’), 
includes aspects that may influence the identification of related parties at the STAR group level. This is as a result of possible 
significant influence of Steinhoff over the Fulcrum Financial Services SA group companies (‘Fulcrum’). Fulcrum provides consumer 
financing to some of STAR’s customers. As a result, the related party disclosure in STAR’s 2017 audited financial statements may need 
to be enhanced to include the relationship and transactions with Fulcrum. Any such restatement, pending the outcome of the forensic 
investigation, will not impact STAR’s historical financial performance nor financial position and merely includes qualitative disclosure 
as required in terms of IAS 24: Related party disclosures.

Accounting policies
The accounting policies utilised in the preparation of the summarised consolidated interim financial information are consistent 
with those of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017.

Events subsequent to the reporting period
On 23 May 2018, the refinancing of the Steinhoff shareholder funding (‘shareholder funding’) was completed with the conclusion 
of agreements between STAR (and its designated wholly-owned subsidiaries) and various South African financial institutions. 
The repayment of the shareholder funding also facilitated the release of STAR and its subsidiaries from all third-party guarantees related 
to the financing of the shareholder funding. The company raised a total of ZAR18 billion stand-alone financing facilities, which was well 
received by the SA market with the overall demand exceeding the company’s requirements. The additional ZAR2 billion, over and above what 
was required to settle the shareholder funding, was raised in line with STAR’s funding needs and growth in operations.

Changes to the board/board committees
The following changes to the board occurred during the reporting period:
AB la Grange      - resigned 24 January 2018
MJ Jooste         - resigned 5 December 2017

   in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors. This resulted in a restatement 
   of the six months ended March 2017 and 12 months ended September 2017 figures, in particular the statement of other comprehensive 
   income and the statement of changes in equity. The aggregate effect of the restatement on the comparative figures are as follows:

FINANCIAL REVIEW BASED ON STATUTORY RESULTS

Good operational performance was overshadowed by the effects as described in STAR’s pre-listing statement and this set of results. 
Caution should be exercised when comparing the statutory six-month unaudited financial results with the six-month comparative period. 
In particular, earnings growth on a statutory basis is not representative and should be considered on a comparable basis.

On a statutory basis, STAR achieved revenue growth of 15.9% to R33 billion during the six months ended 31 March 2018. This is, however, 
inflated by the acquisition of Tekkie Town, acquired 1 February 2017, and BSG, acquired on 1 October 2017. Excluding the effects 
of the Steinhoff-related losses of R590 million, operating profit before capital items on a statutory basis increased by 18.3% from 
the prior year. This is inflated by the acquisition of Tekkie Town and BSG. A deflationary operating environment and very challenging 
trading conditions in Pep Africa weighed on performance. The 21.9% increase in operating expenses includes the extraordinary losses 
of R590 million and higher distribution costs due to increased sales units as a result of deflation. In addition, costs pertaining 
to the Tekkie Town and BSG businesses are included in the current period.

Operating margin in the discount and value reporting segment was particularly affected by the effects of deflation resulting 
from the stronger rand. The acquisition of Tekkie Town and BSG added scale to the Speciality reporting segment, which contributed 
to operating profit margin expansion from 2.3% in the six-month comparative period to 6.1% in the current period.

Tax rate
The effective tax rate of 41.7% includes the impact of the extraordinary items as previously mentioned. The normalised effective 
tax rate of 33.8% was affected by higher withholding taxes in Angola and the derecognition of certain deferred tax assets pertaining 
to the consumer electronics and appliances brands and Pep Africa.

Working capital
Investment in net working capital increased by R1 343 million from March 2017 to R5 447 million, largely due to the settlement 
of creditors being brought forward as a result of the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter this year.

Capital structure
Shareholders are reminded that, as part of the listing process, the balance sheet was restructured and significant debt was introduced 
in the form of Steinhoff shareholder funding shortly before listing. STAR successfully refinanced and settled the Steinhoff shareholder 
funding on 23 May 2018 after raising R18 billion from local banks. STAR subsidiaries were in turn released from all Steinhoff debt 
guarantees relating to the shareholder funding. The new funding terms are in line with the previous terms. Preference shares were 
introduced to facilitate the redemption of funding preference shares issued by Steinhoff and the release of STAR and its subsidiaries 
from the related guarantee. The calculated interest cover of 7.6 times is expected to reduce in future due to the timing of introduction 
of the debt in the calculation of the net interest expense.

Cash flow
The cash conversion (cash generated from operations/EBITDA) was 22.4% compared to 41.6% in the comparative period. The general low cash 
conversion in the interim results ended March indicates the effects of seasonality in the operations, in addition to the impact of earlier 
settlement of certain suppliers within the furniture retail and DIY brands.

The group continued investment in its retail footprint by expanding its total store footprint by 143 stores (excluding 12 BSG stores) 
to 5 108 stores. 

Outlook
While the competitive retail environment is expected to inhibit real growth for the remainder of the 2018 financial year, STAR’s positive 
sales momentum is expected to continue. This is underpinned by STAR’s defensive discount and value product and service offering and the 
expectation that the deflationary impact on the CFH retail brands decline as the 2018 summer season nears. Sales growth in CFH is expected 
to be supported by strong growth in the Speciality fashion and footwear brands and the continued sales momentum in the Pep and Ackermans 
brands. 

The JD Group is expected to maintain revenue growth momentum, while growth in the building materials industry is expected to remain 
constrained.
 
The group’s targeted 350 net store openings for the 2018 financial year has been revised downwards to 330 due to slowdown of expansion 
in Africa.

On a comparable basis, management expects operating margins for the year to be maintained. 

The STAR board resolved that no interim dividend will be declared.  

Appreciation
STAR is fortunate to have experienced and dedicated employees in the operating companies and the board is grateful for their loyalty 
and continued dedication towards their customers and STAR during a period that has required extraordinary effort. The board would like 
to thank its shareholders, customers and suppliers for their continued support.

In determining the H1FY17 Comparable Results, the H1FY17 statutory results were adjusted as
follows:

    1. The STAR Reviewed 31 March 2017 results included tax adjustments of a non-recurring
       nature which has been normalised by way of using the average effective tax rate for
       the 12 months ending 30 September 2017. Tax adjustments include inter alia deferred
       tax assets raised on previously unrecognised tax losses and therefore not recurring in
       nature.

    2. The column titled “BSG 6 months ended 31 March 2017” has been extracted from the
       BSG management accounts for the six months ended 31 March 2017. BSG was
       acquired by STAR and consolidated as part of the STAR unaudited results from 1
       October 2017 to 31 March 2018. The management of STAR is satisfied with the quality
       of the management accounts of BSG applied.

    3. The column titled “Pro forma BSG adjustments” refers to the finance costs incurred in
       funding the acquisition of BSG. The costs are not expected to be tax deductible as it is
       not in the production of taxable income.

    Save for otherwise stated, all comparable adjustments will have a continuing effect of the
    financial results of STAR.

    Notes:

    (a) The column titled “Pro forma STAR as per Pre listing Statement” refers to the pro forma
        adjusted results of STAR included in annexure 3 of the Pre-listing Statement prior to the
        effects of the Shoprite Call Options.
    (b) Rounded

In determining the H1FY18 Comparable Results trading range as detailed in the Trading
Statement, the H1FY18 statutory results were adjusted for the following:
   1. STAR is party to a guarantee of third party debt which is underpinned by the Steinhoff
       International Holdings N.V (“Steinhoff”) share price. Since the collapse of the Steinhoff
       share price, the risk of liability in this regard (“Steinhoff Share Exposure”) can no longer
       be considered remote. Exposure to the Company pertaining to the Steinhoff Share
       Exposure, equating to R440 million (taxation of R Nil) and the provision for an
       impairment of loans associated to the third party amounting to R60 million (taxation of
       R Nil) have been recognised in the H1FY18 results. This will not have a continuing effect
       on the financial results as STAR has been sufficiently provided for its exposure in this
       regard.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2018

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE”), a listed company is required to

certainty exists that the financial results for the financial period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from the most recent financial results for the previous corresponding period.

STAR’s interim results for the six months ended 31 March 2018 (“H1FY18”) will be published on
SENS on 29 May 2018.

Comparability of results

In an effort to enable comparability of the H1FY18 results, certain adjustments were made to
the comparative period’s statutory results for the six months ended 31 March 2017 (“H1FY17”),
as summarised below. This provides shareholders with comparable results (“Comparable

        upon the listing of STAR.

Results publication on 29 May 2018

The impact of the events which continue to unfold at STAR’s controlling shareholder, Steinhoff
International Holdings N.V. (“Steinhoff”), have been significant and STAR management has
focused on assessing and mitigating any impact of this on STAR.

STAR is party to a guarantee of third party debt related to a historic Pepkor Holdings
management investment scheme which is underpinned by the Steinhoff share price. Since the
collapse of the Steinhoff share price, the risk of liability in this regard can no longer be
considered to be remote.

Furthermore, a cash retention scheme was put in place for STAR key senior management
(“Employees”) to supplement the existing long-term Steinhoff share incentive scheme
(“Steinhoff Scheme”). Given the decline of the Steinhoff share price, the Steinhoff Scheme no
longer adequately addresses the need to retain, motivate and reward Employees of the
Group who are able to influence the performance on a basis which aligns the interests of such
Employees with that of STAR and its Shareholders.

The STAR board has taken the conservative approach to fully provide for STAR’s exposure in
these matters.

STAR hereby advises that a reasonable degree of certainty exist that the Statutory Results for
H1FY18 will reflect the following:

    -   EPS will be between 33.4 cents and 39.0 cents, being between 44.2% and 52.2% lower
        than the 69.9 cents achieved per the Statutory Results; and

    -   HEPS will be between 33.4 cents and 39.0 cents, 45.1% and 53.1% lower than the 71.1
        cents achieved per the Statutory Results.

However, to enable comparability, Comparable Results for H1FY18 are included below which
exclude the effect of the above matters, thereby providing a view of STAR’s true trading
performance.

    -   Earnings per share (“EPS”) will be between 50.8 cents and 54.4 cents, being between
        10.3% and 18.3% higher than the 46.0 cents achieved per the Comparable Results; an

    -   Headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) will be between 50.7 cents and 54.5 cents, being
        between 8.2% and 16.2% higher than the 46.9 cents achieved per the Comparable
        Results;

NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE IN AUDITOR

After careful consideration and by mutual agreement with STAR management and its Audit
Committee, Deloitte South Africa (“Deloitte”) has decided to resign as the external auditor of
STAR, effective 23 May 2018.

Deloitte’s decision to resign came after engagement with STAR’s management and Audit
Committee regarding restructuring the audit of STAR and its subsidiaries to reduce the existing
duplication of effort among the different audit firms to continue to comply with professional
standards.

A significant component of the STAR group is audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc.
(“PWC”) and this scenario necessarily causes an inefficient duplication of effort in order for
Deloitte to comply with professional auditing standards.

Shareholders are therefore advised that, in terms of paragraph 3.78 of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, PWC has been appointed as the Company's external auditor, effective 23 May
2018, thereby replacing Deloitte. Mr Anton Hugo will act as the designated audit partner for
the current financial year ending 30 September 2018.

COMPLETION OF THE REFINANCING OF SHAREHOLDER FUNDING AND OTHER MATTERS

1. COMPLETION OF THE REFINANCING OF SHAREHOLDER FUNDING

    STAR shareholders are referred to the announcement made on 15 December 2017
    pertaining to the refinancing of Steinhoff shareholder funding amounting to c.ZAR16 billion
    at 30 September 2017 (“the Shareholder Funding”), as included in STAR’s 2017 audited
    annual financial statements.

    The refinancing of the Shareholder Funding was completed with the conclusion of
    agreements between STAR (and its designated wholly-owned subsidiaries) and various
    South African financial institutions. The repayment of the Shareholder Funding also
    facilitated the release of STAR and its subsidiaries from all third party guarantees related
    to the financing of the Shareholder Funding.

    The Company raised a total of ZAR18 billion stand-alone financing facilities (“New
    Facilities”) which was well received by the SA market with the overall demand exceeding
    the Company’s requirements. The refinancing was arranged and co-ordinated by
    FirstRand Bank Limited, acting through its Rand Merchant Bank division (“RMB”).

    The additional ZAR2 billion, over and above what was required to settle the Shareholder
    Funding, is being raised in line with STAR’s funding needs and growth in operations.

    The New Facilities comprise:

    The STAR board would like to express its appreciation to the various South African financial
    institutions for their support in this process and especially to RMB for the arrangement and
    co-ordination thereof.

2. APPROVAL OF PROPOSED RESOLUTION IN TERMS OF SECTION 44 OF THE COMPANIES ACT,
    NO 71 OF 2008

    A condition to the issue of the Funding Preference Shares by a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    STAR (“the Issuer”) to South African financial institutions referred to above, included that
    STAR guarantees the Issuer’s contractual obligations that relate to the Funding Preference
    Shares.

    The Company confirms that STAR shareholders representing 88.98% of STAR’s issued share
    capital voted in favour of such guarantee as set out in the circular distributed to
    shareholders on 19 April 2018. Accordingly, the special resolution was approved. The issue
    of these Funding Preference Shares facilitated the redemption of funding preference
    shares issued by Steinhoff and the release of STAR and its subsidiaries from the related
    guarantee.

SUBMISSION OF RESOLUTIONS TO STAR SHAREHOLDERS IN TERMS OF SECTION 60 OF THE
COMPANIES ACT, 2008 (ACT 71 of 2008), AS AMENDED (“the Act”)

The board of directors of STAR announced on 15 December 2017 that it planned to refinance
the shareholder loans owing by STAR to Steinhoff Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd (“Steinhoff Africa
Holdings”) and any other companies which form part of the same group of companies as
Steinhoff Africa Holdings (but excluding STAR and its subsidiaries).

As part of the refinancing process, STAR envisages that one of its wholly owned subsidiaries
(the ""Issuer"") will issue funding preference shares to South African financial institutions (the
""Subscribers"") to fund a portion of that refinance. The Subscribers have indicated that they
are willing to subscribe for preference shares with an aggregate subscription price of
approximately R6 billion subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions precedent. One such
condition precedent is that STAR guarantees the Issuer's contractual obligations which relate
to the funding preference shares to the Subscribers.

Shareholders are advised that the board of directors of the Company (“the Board”) resolved
to submit to them a special resolution in terms of section 44 of the Act, in order to obtain
authority to provide a guarantee to the Subscribers for the Issuer's contractual obligations
which relate to the funding preference shares, as referred to above.

In terms of section 60(1) of the Act, a resolution that could be voted on at a shareholders’
meeting may instead be submitted for consideration to the shareholders entitled to exercise
voting rights in relation to the resolution, and which may be voted on in writing by such
shareholders entitled to exercise voting rights in respect of such resolution, within 20 (twenty)
business days after the resolution was submitted to them.

Section 60(2) of the Act provides that a resolution contemplated in terms of section 60(1) of
the Act will have been adopted if it is supported by shareholders entitled to exercise
sufficient voting rights for it to have been adopted as a special resolution, at a properly
constituted shareholders’ meeting, and if adopted, such resolution will have the same effect
as if it had been approved by voting at a shareholders’ meeting.

A notice, together with the proposed special resolution, a form of written consent and a form
of written instruction (“the Notice”), was distributed to shareholders today, 19 April 2018. A
copy of the Notice is available on the Company’s website: www.steinhoffafricaretail.co.za.

The record date for determining which shareholders are entitled to vote on the proposed
special resolution in terms of the written consent was Friday, 13 April 2018.

DISCLOSURE OF DISPOSAL OF SECURITIES

In accordance with section 122(3)(b) of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008 as amended, and

in accordance with paragraph 3.83(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, shareholders

are hereby advised that the Company has received formal notification in the prescribed form

that:


Ainsley Holdings Proprietary Limited (“Ainsley”), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Steinhoff

International Holdings N.V. (“Steinhoff”) has disposed of ordinary shares of the Company such

that the total interest in the ordinary shares of the Company now held by Ainsley amounts to

71.01% (previously 76.81%) of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company.


In this regard, shareholders are referred to the closing announcement published by Steinhoff

on 12 April 2018 in terms of which it confirmed that Steinhoff had successfully placed

200 000 000 ordinary shares in STAR through an accelerated bookbuild process.


The board of directors of STAR records its appreciation to Steinhoff for the responsible manner

in which this disposal of shares was concluded. The participation in the disposal process

included a broad spread of retail, long-only and hedge fund investors. The disposal further

results in STAR achieving the minimum free float of 20% as required by the JSE and is expected

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

In a competitive retail environment, STAR achieved revenue growth of 15.5% to R18.4 billion
during the three months ended 31 December 2017. On a comparable basis, revenue growth
amounted to 8.5% for the quarter. This excludes the contribution from the newly acquired
Building Supply Group (BSG), effective 1 October 2017, and includes the contribution of the
Tekkie Town business in both the current and comparable quarters.

The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported 6.3% revenue growth and 1.9% like-for-
like sales growth for the quarter. As guided in STAR’s annual results presentation in December
2017, performance was affected by deflation as a result of the strengthened Rand. Growth in
sales units of 9.8% (6.2% on a like-for-like basis) supported performance as lower prices were
passed on to customers. Subsequent to December, resilient back-to-school campaigns
resulted in like-for-like sales growth of 4.9% during the month of January 2018.

The furniture, consumer electronics and appliances brands increased market share and
reported strong revenue growth of 12.1% and like-for-like sales growth of 7.4% during the
quarter.

The building materials and DIY (Do-it-yourself) business continued to operate in a challenging
market. During the first quarter revenue declined by 5.1% while like-for-like sales declined by
3.4% (excluding BSG).

The speciality fashion and footwear businesses, which focuses on the adult apparel market,
had a successful quarter, reporting revenue growth of 19.9% and like-for-like sales growth of
12.5%. This performance was supported by strong growth achieved by Tekkie Town and the
repositioned retail brands.

While the challenges of deflation on the performance of Pep and Ackermans is expected to
continue, management remains confident that the more affordable offer and lower prices
within these brands will continue to resonate with a financially constrained consumer.
Notwithstanding the building materials market which is expected to remain subdued, the
positive momentum in the remainder of the STAR group is expected to further drive
performance in the 2018 financial year.

In evaluating the 2017 financial year’s performance (FY17), the following factors influence comparability:

- Change in financial year-end: STAR’s financial year-end was changed from June to September in 2016, and therefore the comparative 
  statutory numbers pertain to a 15-month period.
- Impact of acquisitions and one-off restructuring - refer to the ‘Additional information’ section of these results.
- Impact of listing on earnings per share: Issuing 750 million new shares on 20 September 2017 increased the total number of shares 
  in issue to 3 450 million.

To enhance comparability, performance commentary is provided based on pro forma results that are based on the 12-month periods ending 
30 September 2017 (FY17PF) and 30 September 2016 (FY16PF) and adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and one-off restructuring costs.

During a period characterised by downbeat consumer confidence and low growth, STAR delivered a solid operating performance. A continued 
focus on price leadership and value offerings across STAR’s expanding store footprint drove market share gains in major retail brands. 
For the 12 months to September 2017, pro forma revenue increased by 13.2% to R58.6 billion (FY16PF: R51.8 billion), and pro forma 
operating profit was up 25.2% to R6.1 billion.

Notably, trading densities continued to rise above cost inflation while STAR expanded its retail presence through trading space growth 
of 5% to 2.3 million square meters. STAR group opened 272 stores on a net basis, and the acquisition of Tekkie Town added 308 stores 
to the group’s footprint. As at September 2017, STAR traded from 4 953 retail locations.

STAR’s strategic focus on lowering the cost of doing business and accessing new products and services through existing infrastructure 
drove group operating profit growth. The operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 10.4% of total sales. Pep and Ackermans 
were the main contributors to group operating profit growth, in addition to the turnaround of the furniture and appliances business.


OPERATIONAL REVIEW

Discount and value
This division reported revenue of R44.1 billion and operating margin strengthened. Revenue growth was largely attributable 
to Pep and Ackermans, which, in aggregate, account for 85% of divisional revenue. Like-for-like revenue growth of 6.5% was achieved 
by Pep and Ackermans in aggregate, influenced by a weaker fourth quarter. Within product categories, kids’ wear and cellular delivered 
stand out performances. Home, adult wear and FMCG also supported growth. 

The Flash business, servicing customers in informal areas, performed well, driven by a 23% increase in active traders with the number 
of devices exceeding 121 000 at year-end.

Following the closure of approximately 300 stores, the restructuring of the furniture and appliances business is complete. Despite 
closing uneconomical trading locations and the operational disruption caused by the restructuring, the business increased revenue 
on a comparable basis, reaching break-even operating profit.

Africa, being countries other than South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (SA and BLNS), represents approximately 
5% of STAR group revenue. A constrained economic environment and currency volatility in some of these countries continued to weigh 
on operations, resulting in reduced momentum in store openings. In addition, adjustment of product costing rates to manage exchange 
rate volatility slowed growth in Angola.

Discount and value brands opened a total of 222 stores on a net basis during FY17, expanding the total footprint to 3 679 stores 
at 30 September 2017.

Speciality
The speciality division, now enlarged by the Tekkie Town footwear business, contributed approximately 25% to group revenue, supported 
by a robust performance from the Clothing, Footwear and Home (CFH) retail brands. Operating margin strengthened, supported by improved 
profitability in the do-it-yourself (DIY) business and improved performance in the other retail brands. 

In line with its peers, the DIY business experienced a challenging year. Weak market demand for building materials and a store 
portfolio review resulted in a revenue contraction and 17 store closures. That said, the portfolio review, which is nearing completion, 
contributed to improved profitability through integration cost benefits.

The G2 brands reported an acceptable performance in a challenging market where margins are comparatively lower to other businesses 
within the group. 

In speciality bedding, Sleepmasters continued to perform well, expanding its store footprint to 168 stores at 30 September 2017.

Speciality brands opened 50 stores on a net basis during FY17, resulting in a total footprint of 1 274 stores at 30 September 2017.


FINANCIAL REVIEW

Good revenue momentum has been maintained in the business and the increased profitability achieved during the year is most encouraging. 
All divisions contributed to improved pro forma operating profit compared to the prior year, with group pro forma operating profit 
(before capital items) at R6 078 million (FY16PF: R4 855 million) representing growth of 25.2%.

As described in STAR’s pre-listing statement and this set of results, caution should be exercised when comparing the statutory 
12-month audited financial statements with the 15-month comparative period. In particular, earnings growth on a statutory basis 
is not representative and should be considered on a pro forma basis. 

Tax rate
The effective tax rate was 30.9%, marginally higher than the statutory South African tax rate, mainly due to withholding taxes.

Working capital
Net working capital increased by R805 million, largely as a result of the acquisition of Tekkie Town and increased inventory levels 
of a larger store base, in anticipation of the festive season trading period. 

Capital structure
As part of the listing process, the balance sheet was restructured and the net debt on 30 September 2017 amounted to R12.0 billion, 
resulting in a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. Shareholders are reminded that the debt was only introduced as part of the listing 
process at the end of the period and the calculated interest cover of 10.9 times is expected to reduce in future.

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations before working capital changes increased by 20.8% to R7 269 million (fifteen months to 30 September 2016: 
R6 016 million).

The cash conversion (cash generated from operations/operating profit before capital items) was 111%, despite cyclical increased inventory 
levels in anticipation of the build-up to the festive season. Cash flow was further supported by the furniture retail business’s focus 
on lay-by products and the group’s limited credit sales, which amounted to 12% of total revenue. 

Outlook
While real market growth is expected to be subdued, positive sales momentum is expected to continue as STAR’s more affordable offer 
and lower prices resonate with a constrained consumer. Similarly, the positive momentum in the speciality division is expected to continue 
at improved margins, further supporting group margins. 

In addition, the business is well on track to open another 350 stores during the 2018 financial year.

Maintaining a low cost of doing business will remain a focus area within all retail brands. STAR plans to expand its distribution capacity 
in South Africa with the fit out of two distribution centres and the development of a new distribution centre in Angola, resulting in an 
increase in the capital expenditure-to-revenue ratio to 3%. 

The group will continue to explore new trading formats and also expand its market share in ladies’ wear and additional services.

As communicated during the listing process, STAR was only listed for 11 days during the 2017 financial year and thus no further dividend 
will be declared for FY17. The group targets a dividend cover of two times headline earnings for the next financial year. 

Appreciation
STAR’s board of directors would like to thank the group’s employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers for their continued support 
and loyalty.

NOTES TO THE SUMMARISED ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2017

Statement of compliance
The provisional summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with the framework concepts 
and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting 
Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Standards Council, the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited as applicable to provisional reports, the information at a minimum 
as required by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting and the requirements of the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008 as applicable 
to the summarised financial statements. The summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that 
comply with IFRS, which are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2016.

Basis of preparation
The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared in millions of South African rand (Rm) on the historical cost basis, except 
for certain assets and liabilities that are carried at amortised cost, and derivative financial instruments that are stated at their fair 
values. The preparation of the summarised consolidated financial statements and the full set of consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 was supervised by RG Hanekom CA(SA), the group’s chief financial officer. The full set of financial statements 
was approved by the board on 30 November 2017. The comparative amounts comprise the aggregated historical financial information, being 
the Steinhoff Africa Retail Assets group recorded historical information, which was prepared in accordance with IFRS and section 8.1 
to 8.13 of the JSE Listings Requirements for the 15 months ended 30 September 2016.

Internal restructure accounting
The acquisition by Steinhoff Africa Retail Limited of the Steinhoff Africa Retail Assets are common control transactions, as all 
the combining entities, being Steinhoff Africa Retail Limited and the Steinhoff Africa Retail Assets, are ultimately controlled by 
the same party, being Steinhoff International Holdings N.V., before and after the combination, and that control is not transitory.

As IFRS provides no guidance for common control transactions, the following principles of US GAAP have been applied:
When accounting for a transfer of assets or exchange of shares between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net 
assets or the equity interests shall initially measure the recognised assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the 
accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer. If the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities transferred differ from 
the historical cost of the parent of the entities under common control, for example, because fair value adjustments in business combinations
have been recognised on consolidation, then the financial statements of the receiving entity shall reflect the transferred assets 
and liabilities at the historical cost of the group. As a result, the receiving entity effectively applies pushdown accounting in its 
separate financial statements.

There is no change in value for the net assets received, because there is no change in control over the net asset or equity interests 
from the ultimate parent’s perspective. A difference between any proceeds transferred and the carrying amounts of the net assets received 
is recognised in equity in the receiving entity’s separate financial statements. No additional goodwill is created.

Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share and headline earnings per share
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares weighed the shares issued in terms of the private placement from the date of issue,
being 20 September 2017, as well as the issue of the shares relating to the purchase of Tekkie Town from the date of acquisition, 
1 February 2017. The remaining ordinary shares were assumed to be in issue since the beginning of the 2016 financial year. This treatment 
is in line with the principles applied in accounting for the transfer of assets between entities under common control, detailed in the basis
of preparation.

Financial statements
The consolidated financial statements for the year, which have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, and their accompanying unmodified audit 
report as well as their unmodified audit report on this set of summarised financial information, are available for inspection at the 
company’s registered office. Information included under the headings ‘Outlook’ and ‘Operational review’ and any reference to future 
financial information included in the summarised financial information, has not been audited or reviewed. The auditor’s report does 
not necessarily report on all the information contained in this announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that, in order to obtain 
a full understanding of the nature of the auditor’s engagement, they should obtain a copy of the auditor’s report together with the 
accompanying financial information from the issuer’s registered office. The results were approved by the board of directors on 
30 November 2017.

Accounting policies
The accounting policies of the group have been applied consistently to the periods presented in the summarised consolidated financial 
statements.

Events subsequent to the balance sheet date
Effective 1 October 2017, Steinbuild acquired 100% of Building Supply Group (‘BSG’). The purchase consideration was based on an enterprise 
value of R646 million and is subject to a potential 13% adjustment, up or down, dependent on BSG’s 12-month results to 30 September 2018.

STAR has exercised call options whereby it will indirectly acquire 128.2 million Shoprite ordinary shares from various parties. 
The implementation of the call options remains subject to the required regulatory approvals (expected by middle 2018) and will result 
in STAR indirectly acquiring a 23.1% economic interest in Shoprite,and voting control of 50.6%.

The consideration payable for the implementation of the call options will be settled through the issue of 1.7 billion STAR shares, 
representing approximately 33.6% interest in the ordinary share capital of STAR.

   5.3 Diluted earnings and diluted headline earnings per share

       and basic headline earnings per share.
  
   5.4 As a result of the weighting of shares, the current year’s per share numbers should be adjusted before any future profit 
       forecasts are based on them.

Notes and assumptions
(1) The column titled ‘Audited STAR group for the 12 months ended 30 September 2017’ represents the actual audited results for 
    the STAR group for the 12 months ended 30 September 2017.
(2) The column titled ‘Tekkie Town reviewed four months ended 31 January 2017’ has been extracted from the Tekkie Town financial 
    statements, reviewed by Grant Thornton and audit partner C Minie, for the four months ended 31 January 2017. Tekkie Town 
    was acquired by the STAR group and consolidated as part of the STAR group results from 1 February 2017.
(3) The column titled ‘JD Group discontinued brands 12 months ended 30 September 2017’ includes one-off expenses that the group 
    was not allowed to provide for during the 2016 financial year, which relates to the one-off JD Group brand consolidation during 
    the 2017 financial year. 

Pro forma period ended 30 September 2016
The pro forma 12-month prior year actual results illustrate the impact of acquiring the Steinhoff Africa Retail Assets (‘SARA’); 
acquiring Tekkie Town and Iliad; and removing the one-off JD Group discontinued brands and related restructuring costs. These adjustments 
have been described in detail in the pre-listing statement (PLS) dated 4 September 2017. Refer Annexure 1F on pages 194 and 195 of the PLS. 
The amounts adjusting revenue, EBIT and EBITDA remain unchanged from previously disclosed amounts.

Shareholders are referred to STAR’s Pre-listing Statement dated 4 September 2017 (“Pre-listing
Statement”) and the successful listing by the Company on the main board of the JSE Limited
(“JSE”) on 20 September 2017 (the “Listing”).

In addition to the Listing and as referred to in the Pre-listing Statement, STAR has, as part of its
planned expansion and subject to certain terms and conditions, exercised call options to
acquire approximately 23.1% economic interest in and approximately 50.6% voting control of
Shoprite.

STAR’s vision is to continue to focus on being the preferred and most convenient destination
for the African consumer and all other stakeholders, by providing everyday essential products
at affordable prices. In furthering this vision, STAR remains of the opinion that a strategic
investment in a leading African food and grocery retailer will support its ability to further
enhance its relevance to the growing African consumer base, and better protect its ability to
compete against international retailers. In this regard, the investment in Shoprite, one of
Africa’s leading food and grocery retailers with a track record of successful growth and
expansion in South Africa and across the continent, will add a complementary food and
grocery offering to STAR.

The implementation of the investment in Shoprite is subject to a number of conditions
precedent as set out in the Pre-listing Statement, which include, inter alia, merger filings with
various African Competition Authorities. To this end, the filings are being completed and will
be submitted to the relevant authorities in the foreseeable future.

Shareholders will be informed once all the conditions precedent for the implementation of the
transaction have been met.

STABILISATION ANNOUNCEMENT

As set out in STAR’s Pre-Listing Statement dated 4 September 2017, Ainsley Holdings Proprietary
Limited (the “Overallotment Shareholder”), granted Citigroup Global Markets Limited, acting as
stabilisation manager on behalf of the Joint Global Coordinators noted below (the “Stabilisation
Manager”), a call option to purchase up to 50,000,000 existing STAR ordinary shares from the
Overallotment Shareholder (the “Call Option”). The Call Option would enable the Stabilisation
Manager to close out any existing short positions from the over-allotment of shares in connection
with STAR’s initial private placement, for a period of 30 calendar days post listing.

Shareholders are hereby informed that the Stabilisation Manager has not affected any stabilisation
transactions as STAR shares have traded consistently above the offer price since listing.
Accordingly, the Call Option between the Stabilisation Manager and the Overallotment
Shareholder will be exercised in full, with the result that no future stabilisation transactions will be
effected. Post the Call Option being exercised, Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. will indirectly
hold 76.81% of STAR’s issued share capital.

PRICING ANNOUNCEMENT

1. RESULTS OF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT

   With reference to STAR’s Pre-listing Statement dated 4 September 2017 (“Pre-listing Statement”) and
   the announcements released on 23 August 2017 and 4 September 2017, regarding the private
   placement by way of an offer for subscription by the Company of its ordinary shares (“Shares”), subject
   to certain conditions (“Private Placement”), the Company advises that it has successfully raised an
   aggregate amount of R15.4 billion, through the placement of 750 million Shares (“Placement Shares”)
   at a price of R20.50 per Share (“Placement Price”). The Placement Shares will, upon their issue,
   represent approximately 21.74% of the total issued Shares immediately after Listing (as defined below).

   As part of STAR’s commitment to the development and support of the South African government’s
   Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”) initiatives, it has placed to Lancaster 101 (RF) Proprietary
   Limited (“Lancaster 101”), on a preferential basis, and Lancaster 101 has agreed to subscribe for,
   302 439 024 of the Placement Shares at the Placement Price, representing an aggregate amount of
   approximately R6.2 billion (“BEE Placement”). The BEE Placement will represent approximately 8.77% of
   the total issued Shares immediately after Listing (as defined below). The Private Placement excluding
   the BEE Placement was 4.8 times oversubscribed.

   The bookbuild process in relation to the Private Placement closed on Thursday, 14 September 2017.
   The settlement date and expected date of the listing of STAR (“Listing”), which is subject to
   confirmation that a spread of shareholders has been achieved that is acceptable to the securities
   exchange operated by the JSE Limited, is expected to be Wednesday, 20 September 2017
   (“Settlement Date”).
  Based on a total of 3 450 000 000 Shares in issue at the Settlement Date, the Placement Price implies a
  total market capitalisation of R70.7 billion for STAR. The proceeds from the Private Placement (net of
  costs) will be distributed to subsidiaries of Steinhoff International.

2. OVERALLOTMENT OPTION

  A further 50 000 000 existing Shares (“Overallotment Shares”) were allotted to invited investors by a
  subsidiary (“Overallotment Shareholder”) of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (“Steinhoff
  International”) at the Placement Price. The Overallotment Shares were placed pursuant to an option
  (“Overallotment Option”) which the Overallotment Shareholder has granted to the stabilisation
  manager, Citigroup Global Markets Limited (“Stabilisation Manager”), for a period commencing on
  the Settlement Date and ending 30 days thereafter (“Stabilisation Period”).

  The Stabilisation Manager, acting on behalf of the Joint Global Coordinators (as set out below and as
  defined in the Pre-Listing Statement), may effect transactions, subject to applicable laws and
  regulations and only during the Stabilisation Period, which may support the market price of the Shares.
  Such stabilisation, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time without prior notice and will in any
  event be discontinued after the Stabilisation Period. There is, however, no assurance that the
  Stabilisation Manager will undertake any stabilisation actions.

3. LOCK-UP ARRANGEMENTS

  Steinhoff International and its subsidiaries will continue to hold 2 700 000 000 Shares representing
  approximately 78.26% of the total issued Shares immediately after the Listing (assuming no exercise of
  the Overallotment Option).

  Subject to certain exceptions, including the issuance of the Shoprite Consideration Shares (as defined
  in the Pre-listing Statement) and a placement to a limited number of institutional investors of Shares
  with a market value not exceeding the Rand equivalent of USD 50 million, the Company has entered
  into a 180-day share lock-up with the Joint Global Coordinators.

  Steinhoff Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited and Lancaster 101 have also entered into a 180-day share
  lock-up agreement subject to certain customary exceptions.

STEINHOFF AFRICA RETAIL LIMITED (“STAR”) – PRE-LISTING STATEMENT PUBLISHED

Shareholders of Steinhoff are referred to the various announcements released regarding the
planned listing of STAR, a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinhoff, on the main board of the securities

1. INTRODUCTION

   Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (“Steinhoff International”) has previously announced, its indirectly
   held wholly owned subsidiary, STAR’s intention to list its issued ordinary share capital on the main board
   of the securities exchange operated by the JSE, with the goal of creating a diversified listed retail
   company of significant size and scale with its roots in Africa.

   STAR confirms that the JSE has now granted the Company a listing of its issued ordinary shares in the
   “5373 Broadline Retailers” sector of the JSE main board under the abbreviated name “SHRetail”, share
   code “SRR” and ISIN ZAE000247995, subject to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out in
   paragraph 5.5 below (the “Listing”). The Listing is expected to be effective from the commencement
   of trading on Wednesday, 20 September 2017 (“Listing Date”).

   This announcement, including the abridged pre-listing statement below, is not an invitation to the
   public to acquire or subscribe for securities in any jurisdiction and is issued in compliance with the JSE
   Listings Requirements for the purpose of providing information to selected persons in South Africa and
   other jurisdictions in relation to STAR, and does not constitute, envisage or represent an offer to the
   public, nor does it constitute a prospectus, in each case as contemplated in the South African
   Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008 (“Companies Act”).

2. PRIVATE PLACEMENT

  The Listing will be accompanied by a capital raising through a private placement in order to establish
  the public shareholding spread and liquidity required by the JSE (“Private Placement”).

  The Private Placement is to occur by way of an offer of Shares by the Company, for subscription,
  subject to certain conditions, to selected investors in South Africa and other jurisdictions (“Invited
  Investors”), to whom the Private Placement will specifically be addressed, and by whom the Private
  Placement will be capable of acceptance.

  Up to 750 000 000 Shares will be offered and will, upon their issue, represent up to approximately 21.74%
  of the total issued Shares immediately after the Listing (“Placement Shares”). Up to a further 50 000 000
  existing Shares (“Overallotment Shares”) may be sold to Invited Investors by a subsidiary of Steinhoff
  International (“Overallotment Shareholder”) pursuant to an option (“Overallotment Option”) which the
  Overallotment Shareholder intends to grant to the stabilisation manager, Citigroup Global Markets
  Limited, (“Stabilisation Manager”) for a period commencing on Listing and ending 30 days thereafter
  (“Stabilisation Period”).

  The Placement Shares, together with the Overallotment Shares (if the Overallotment Option is
  implemented in full) represent an aggregate of up to approximately 23.19% of the total issued Shares
  immediately after Listing. On Listing, 3 450 000 000 Shares, constituting the entire issued ordinary share
  capital of STAR subsequent to the Private Placement, are expected to be listed on the main board of
  the exchange operated by the JSE. Proceeds (net of costs) from the Placement Shares will be
  distributed to STAR’s existing shareholders, wholly owned subsidiaries of Steinhoff International.

  It is currently expected that the price at which the Placement Shares will be offered to Invited Investors
  in terms of the Private Placement (“Placement Price”) will be in the price range between R18.00 and
  R23.00 per Placement Share (“Placement Price Range”). However, the Placement Price may ultimately
  be outside the Placement Price Range. Irrespective of the final Placement Price, if the Directors of
  STAR, in their discretion determine that it would not be advisable to proceed with the Private
  Placement, STAR shall not be obliged to proceed with the Private Placement.
  The Company has agreed to place to Lancaster 101 (RF) Proprietary Limited (“Lancaster”) on a
  preferential basis, and Lancaster has agreed to subscribe for, such number of Placement Shares as
  have a value of approximately R6.2 billion at the Placement Price (“BEE Placement”), as part of STAR’s
  commitment to the development and support of South African government’s Black Economic
  Empowerment (“BEE”) initiatives. The BEE Placement will represent approximately 8.83% of the total
  issued Shares immediately after Listing at an approximate midpoint of the Placement Price Range.

  Subject to certain exceptions, including the issuance of the Shoprite Consideration Shares (as defined
  below) and a placement to a limited number of institutional investors of Shares with a market value
  not exceeding the Rand equivalent of USD 50 million, the Company has entered into a 180-day share
  lock-up with the Joint Global Coordinators (as set out below).

  Steinhoff Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited and Lancaster have also entered into a 180-day share
  lock-up agreements subject to certain customary exceptions.

3. DISTRIBUTION OF PRE-LISTING STATEMENT

  STAR will today publish a pre-listing statement regarding the Listing and the Private Placement and
  containing detailed information regarding STAR (“Pre-listing Statement”). The Pre-listing Statement will

       STAR owns the Steinhoff Africa Retail Assets to be listed. The date of registration of STAR was
       22 May 2017. STAR will remain a subsidiary of Steinhoff International and hence will continue to
       benefit from the group sourcing, scale advantages, shared best practices and strategic direction,

       will continue to focus on its vision to be the preferred and most convenient destination for the
       African consumer and all other stakeholders, by providing everyday essential products at

            transaction switch, Flash enables millions of virtual transactions to take place daily in the
            informal markets of South Africa.
    Brands operating through the Value channel focus on a bigger assortment, quality and range,
    and include:

        middle market of value-seeking consumers with a household income of over R5 000 per

    -   Bedding, consisting of Sleepmasters which is a retailer of beds, bed sets and mattresses.

5.2.   RATIONALE FOR LISTING

       The purpose of the Listing is to create a diversified listed retail company of significant size and scale
       with its roots in Africa. The Listing will also allow investors wishing to access the African growth story
       to invest directly into the Company. The separation of Steinhoff International’s emerging and
       developed market retail businesses is a natural progression given their distinct strategic and
       geographic focus.

       In addition, the Listing of STAR is expected to:

       -   result in Steinhoff International’s African exposure being held through a controlling interest in a
           separately listed entity, which can be independently valued as an emerging market, Africa
           focused, retail company;
       -   provide the Company with access to capital in order to grow its business, both organically and
           by way of future acquisitions, including the Shoprite Transaction (as detailed below);
       -   provide Shareholders with a liquid, tradeable asset within a regulated environment and with a
           market-determined share price; and
       -   assist in the incentivisation of senior employees of the STAR Group through listed shares that are
           more closely aligned to the African business.


5.3.   KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND OUTLOOK

       For the 12 months ended 30 September 2016, the STAR Group reported revenue of R51 234 million,
       earnings before interest and tax and capital items (“EBIT”) of R3 485 million and earnings before
       interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and capital items (“EBITDA”) of R4 397 million.

       During the periods under review, the STAR Group made two sizeable acquisitions and implemented
       a brand consolidation and restructure of the furniture operations. These acquisitions, the
       consolidation and the restructure will have a positive impact on the performance of STAR going
       forward. After adjusting for the acquisitions and one-off brand consolidation and restructuring
       related expenditure, the STAR Group would have reported revenue of R51 766 million, EBIT of
       R4 855 million and EBITDA of R5 776 million on a pro-forma basis for the 12 months ended
       30 September 2016.

       Looking ahead, after the aforementioned adjustments, the STAR Group expects to achieve pro
       forma EBIT of R6 063 million and pro-forma EBITDA of R7 016 million for the 12 months ending
       30 September 2017 (“FY17”). STAR expects to list with approximately a two times net debt to FY17
       EBITDA ratio. Further store openings and organic initiatives will provide opportunities for expanding
       operating margin and maintaining strong growth momentum.

5.4.   SHOPRITE TRANSACTION

       STAR has entered into various call option agreements with various parties, in terms of which STAR
       could acquire economic and voting interests in Thibault Square Financial Services Proprietary
       Limited and Shoprite Holdings Limited (“Shoprite”) (“Call Options”). After implementation of the Call
       Options, STAR will hold approximately 22.7% of the economic interest and approximately 49.85% of
       the voting rights in Shoprite. In the event that the specific repurchase of 8 683 327 Shoprite ordinary
       shares, as addressed in a circular to Shoprite shareholders dated 7 August 2017 is implemented, the
       percentages referred to above will increase to approximately 23.1% and 50.61% respectively. The
       consideration will be settled through the issue of STAR shares (the “Shoprite Consideration Shares”)
       that will represent an approximate 33.63% interest in the ordinary share capital of STAR after the
       Listing and the acquisitions under the Call Options.

       It should be noted that STAR will continue with the Listing regardless of whether the Call Options are
       implemented and Shoprite will continue to maintain its separate listing on the JSE after the
       implementation of the Call Options. The exercise and implementation of the Call Options will not
       require STAR to extend a mandatory offer to the remaining Shoprite shareholders in terms of the
       Companies Act and the Takeover Regulations as defined in the Companies Act and also will not
       require additional shareholder approval in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements or otherwise. The
       implementation of the Call Options remains subject to certain conditions precedent, including
       regulatory approvals such as Competition Authorities’ approval.

       Further details regarding the Shoprite Transaction appear in the Pre-listing Statement.

5.5.   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

       The Private Placement and the Listing are subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions
       precedent (“Conditions Precedent”):

       -   the approval for the Listing granted by the JSE on 1 September 2017 not being revoked or
           withdrawn; and
       -   as at the Listing Date, at least 12.5% of the Company’s Shares being held by at least 1 000 public
           shareholders, this being the level acceptable to the JSE in terms of a formal dispensation
           granted to the Company in connection with the Listing, and the JSE being satisfied that there
           will be sufficient liquidity on the Listing Date.

       Should any of the Conditions Precedent fail or should the Directors determine not to proceed with
       the Private Placement, the Private Placement and any acceptance thereof shall not be of any
       force or effect and no person shall have any claim of whatsoever nature against the Company or
       any other person as a result thereof, there being no duty on the Company, Steinhoff International
       or their respective directors or officers to procure that the Conditions Precedent are fulfilled.

STAR ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO FLOAT ON THE JSE MAIN BOARD

STELLENBOSCH, 23 August 2017, Steinhoff Africa Retail Limited (“STAR” or the “Company”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Steinhoff, is pleased to announce its intention to list its issued ordinary share
capital on the main board of the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited (the “JSE”),
subject to market conditions and approval by the JSE (the “Listing”), which is still expected to be
completed before the end of September 2017.

STAR is a leading low-cost retailer servicing value-conscious consumers in Sub-Saharan Africa. With
over 4 800 stores to date, STAR has one of the largest retail footprints in the region and has a proven
and sustainable price leadership strategy across multiple brands and retail categories that is
based upon sourcing products at low cost and distributing them through STAR’s extensive retail
platform. The Company operates across various stable and growing sectors, including apparel,
footwear, household goods, furniture, consumer electronics, appliances, general merchandise
and building materials, while also providing financial and mobile services.

STAR was established on 1 July 2017 following an internal restructuring by Steinhoff of its African
retail assets (“the STAR Group”). Since Steinhoff will continue to be a controlling shareholder in the
Company, the STAR Group will continue to leverage off Steinhoff’s strategic expertise, centralised
sourcing, manufacturing and logistics expertise in order to maximise operating efficiencies across
its retail operations following the Listing.
More information on the STAR Group will be available on the Company’s website:
www.steinhoffafricaretail.co.za



KEY STRENGTHS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

The following key strengths and competitive advantages are expected to contribute to the
continued growth and success of the STAR Group:

•   retail champion with largest footprint in formalising African market;

•   high exposure to Africa’s emerging consumer class;

•   defensive discount model winning in a changing consumer environment;

•   “Best Price Leadership” strategy effective in developing customer loyalty and volume growth;

•   established multi-brand strategy offerings across the entire discount and value spectrum;

•   nationwide coverage in key African markets serving customers at their convenience;

•   superior supply chain management expertise and extensive sourcing scale, protecting prices;

•   strong organic and innovative growth opportunities and initiatives;

•   highly cash generative and robust operating model with track record of strong financial
    performance; and

•   innovative and experienced management team, with loyal and committed employees.


GROWTH STRATEGY

The STAR Group’s vision is to be the preferred destination for delivering value to the African
consumer and all other stakeholders. The STAR Group seeks to do this by providing everyday
products at affordable prices and serving customers at their convenience, and aims to achieve
this strategy through various organic and innovative growth opportunities and initiatives, which
include, among others, the roll-out of new stores, leveraging its store footprint to capitalise on
virtual product development, increasing its market share in financial and other services, entry into
new product offerings and services, and leveraging group synergies and operating platforms to
lower costs. The STAR Group will also continue to explore categories of products and services in
which it has low market shares with a view to expand in these areas.


KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND OUTLOOK

For the 12 months ended 30 September 2016, the STAR Group reported revenue of R51 234 million,
earnings before interest and tax and capital items (“EBIT”) of R3 485 million and earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and capital items (“EBITDA”) of R4 397 million.
During the periods under review the STAR Group made two sizeable acquisitions and
implemented a brand consolidation and restructure of the furniture operations. These acquisitions,
the consolidation and the restructure will have a positive impact on the performance of STAR
going forward. After adjusting for the acquisitions and one-off brand consolidation and
restructuring related expenditure, the STAR Group would have reported EBIT of R4 855 million and
EBITDA of R5 776 million on a pro-forma basis for the 12 months ended 30 September 2016.

Looking ahead, after the aforementioned adjustments, the STAR Group expects to achieve pro
forma EBIT of R6 063 million and pro-forma EBITDA of R7 016 million for the 12 months ending 30
September 2017 (“FY17”). STAR expects to list with approximately two times net debt to FY17
EBITDA ratio. Further store openings and organic initiatives will provide opportunities for expanding

In connection with the Private Placement, each of Citigroup, Investec, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, RMB
and Standard Bank and any of their respective affiliates, may take up a portion of the Shares as a principal
position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell or otherwise deal for their own accounts
in such Shares and other securities of STAR or related investments in connection with the Private Placement
or otherwise. Accordingly, references in the Pre-listing Statement, once published, to the Shares being issued,
offered, subscribed, acquired, placed or otherwise dealt in should be read as including any issue or offer to,
or subscription, acquisition, placing or dealing by any of Citigroup, Investec, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley,
RMB and Standard Bank and any of their respective affiliates acting in such capacity. In addition, Citigroup,
Investec, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, RMB and Standard Bank may enter into financing arrangements and

respective affiliates intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in
accordance with any legal or regulatory obligations to do so.

In connection with the Private Placement, the Company may appoint a stabilisation manager, who may,
subject to the JSE Listings Requirements and other applicable law, over-allot Shares or effect other
transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Shares at a level higher than that which might
otherwise prevail for a limited period after the date of the Listing. However, there will be no obligation on the
stabilisation manager to do so. Such stabilising action may under no circumstances continue beyond the
30th calendar day after the date of the Listing.

accordingly, approximate) and should be treated with caution. Such information has not been audited or
