NEWS RELEASE

18 November 2020

Anglo American rough diamond sales value for De Beers’ ninth sales cycle of 2020

Anglo American plc announces the value of rough diamond sales (Global Sightholder Sales and
Auctions) for De Beers’ ninth sales cycle of 2020, amounting to $450 million.

                            Cycle 9 2020(1)                 Cycle 8 2020(2)                 Cycle 9 2019
                             (provisional)                      (actual)                      (actual)
Sales value(3)                   $450m                            $467m                        $400m
  (1)   Cycle 9 2020 provisional sales value represents sales as at 16 November 2020
  (2)   Cycle 8 2020 actual sales value represents sales between the dates of 21 September and 9 October.
  (3)   Sales values are quoted on a consolidated accounting basis. Auction sales included in a given cycle are 
        the sum of all sales between the end of the preceding cycle and the end of the noted cycle.

Owing to the restrictions on the movement of people and products in various jurisdictions around
the globe, De Beers Group has continued to implement a more flexible approach to rough
diamond sales during the ninth sales cycle of 2020, with the Sight event extended beyond its
normal week-long duration. As a result, the provisional rough diamond sales figure quoted for
Cycle 9 represents the expected sales value for the period 2 November to 16 November and
remains subject to adjustment based on final completed sales.

Bruce Cleaver, CEO, De Beers Group, said: “Steady demand for De Beers Group’s rough
diamonds continued in the ninth sales cycle of the year, reflecting stable consumer demand for
diamond jewellery at the retail level in the US and China, and expectations for reasonable
demand to continue throughout the holiday season. However, the resurgence of Covid-19
infections in several consumer markets presents ongoing risks.”

Anglo American Platinum closes ACP Phase B resulting in temporary build in work-in-
progress inventory

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released today
to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

Anglo American Platinum has made the pre-emptive decision to close the Anglo Converter Plant
(ACP) Phase B unit, following a series of water leaks, to ensure an ongoing safe operating
environment, protect employees and protect the integrity of the plant and surrounding processing
assets.

Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo American Platinum states:

“As indicated in our Q3 production report on 22 October, the ACP Phase B unit has been fragile
and has unfortunately recently experienced a number of further instances of water leaks. Whilst
the ACP management team has done extraordinary work to keep the unit operating safely over
the past several months, we have taken this pre-emptive decision to now close the ACP Phase
B unit to ensure we protect our employees, operating environment and the integrity of our assets.
Whilst this early closure will result in a temporary build up in work-in-progress inventory, we
continue to make good progress with the rebuild of the main ACP Phase A unit, which we expect
to complete towards the end of this year.”

Increased monitoring, controls and systems were implemented to continually assess the ACP
Phase B unit and further water leaks were discovered. The ACP Phase B unit underwent a
planned and measured shutdown. Whilst the ACP management team has been able to complete
repairs to previous water leaks, after a comprehensive assessment, and with further water leaks
discovered, the ACP Phase B unit now requires more extensive repair work. As a result, the ACP
Phase B unit has been closed for a full rebuild in 2021.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company has refined 2.4 million PGM ounces. As production
continues at c.94% of normal production levels, the closure of ACP Phase B unit until ACP Phase
A unit is recommissioned will result in an increase in work-in-progress inventory, whose release
will commence once the ACP is operational. The Company has made significant progress with
the Phase A unit and remains on track to commission it before the end of this year, ahead of the
original schedule of Q2 2021.

As a result of the closure of the ACP Phase B unit, the Company has lowered its refined
production and sales guidance for 2020 to c.2.5 million PGM ounces (previously 3.1-3.3 million
PGM ounces). There is no change to other guidance, including M&C production which remains
at between 3.6 – 3.8 million PGM ounces. The Company has contingency plans in place and will
be engaging with customers to minimise any disruption to contractual obligations.

As at 31 October 2020, the Company remains in a net cash position of c.R28 billion (unaudited)
and has R25 billion of committed facilities available.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum’s PGM production process, treating
furnace matte from the company’s smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the
furnace matte from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting
converter matte is then slow-cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP,
material moves to the Magnetic Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled
and the PGM fraction is separated magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the
MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield
platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive
operations, development projects and undeveloped resources, provides many of the metals and
minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing
consumer-driven demands of developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart

Anglo American reinforces sustainability commitment and pathways to decarbonisation

Anglo American plc (“Anglo American”) is today presenting its annual sustainability performance
update, including a clear pathway to achieve carbon neutrality across its operations by 2040.

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: “We have long understood the
inextricable link between our sustainability performance and our financial performance and ability
to generate returns. A sustainable business comes from being a purposeful business: competitive,
resilient and agile – a business that thrives through economic and social cycles – of course
underpinned by non-negotiable values.

“Sustainability lives at the very heart of our strategy, not as an adjacent activity, but embedded
in how we do our work. Much of what we are driving for, particularly in terms of our energy and
water ambitions, will be achieved through the technologies we are implementing – hence the
inseparable connection between our technology work and our Sustainable Mining Plan outcomes
under our FutureSmart Mining™ programme. Bulk Ore Sorting alone can deliver a c.10%
reduction in energy and water intensity for an operation, for example. Our Sustainable Mining
Plan that we developed in 2017, and that we structured to drive environmental, social and
governance performance, is part of the transformation of our business and is designed to deliver
value to all our stakeholders.

“Tackling climate change is the defining challenge of our times. We have set ourselves an
ambitious goal of carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040, with eight of our assets to get
there by 2030. Our underlying principle is to reduce carbon going into the atmosphere and we
have clear pathways. For Scope 1 and 2, these include:

    •   ongoing transition of our portfolio towards those metals and minerals which support
        a greener, cleaner, more sustainable world – thermal coal operations in South Africa
        planned for likely demerger;
    •   reducing our energy consumption and intensity through P101 performance
        improvements, and technologies and digitalisation – we met our 2020 target of a 22%
        reduction in emissions a year early;
    •   increased use of renewable energy – we will use 100% renewables in Chile from 2021
        and Brazil from 2022, and we begin trials of our green hydrogen fuel-cell powered haul
        truck in South Africa in 2021; and
    •   use of nature-based solutions on land we manage and using resources that we control
        where we can show carbon reduction alongside improving local biodiversity.

“We’re also taking a considered approach to tackling Scope 3 emissions. In some of the 15
categories in our published inventory, we have a high level of control or influence over the source
of the emissions and so we can drive emissions down. Our customers’ emissions of course make
up most of our Scope 3, particularly in the steel value chain, and we have little control of, or
influence over those emissions. We are evaluating the best ways for us to play our part, including
through partnerships with our customers where we can build on a mutual ambition to reduce
emissions through shared capabilities.

“When I look at the overall direction of our business, combined with the integrated way we
consider the full breadth of sustainability, our suite of products is aligned with demand from:

    •   a consumer driven world with a growing population;
    •   an increasingly electrified and connected world as demand for higher standards of living
        grows and grids follow; and
    •   a greener world as a focus on preserving our environment leads to changing behaviour
        in a range of areas – increased renewables, the growing hydrogen economy, tighter
        emissions standards and more modern, cleaner steel making.

“Two thirds of our output will be focused on later cycle demand as thermal coal moves out of the
portfolio, replaced by growth in Copper and Crop Nutrients. We are well positioned to run the
business sustainably and – being disciplined with our capital – to grow the business sustainably
as well.”

Sustainable Mining Plan updates

Our 2020 Sustainable Mining Plan targets that relate to energy use, GHG emissions and water
are unchanged and performance will be assessed at the end of the year. The time period for
achieving the other 2020 targets has been extended to 2021 following the Anglo American
Board’s decision to allow flexibility in order to help the business focus on the priorities of keeping
our people and communities safe and of sustaining our operations during the Covid-19 pandemic

Furthermore, and as detailed in Anglo American’s 2019 Sustainability Report, water baseline
data is to be reset in 2020 to ensure that the reporting criteria are aligned with ICMM definitions
for water accounting. That work will be completed by the end of the year and we will start reporting
against our 2030 targets from 2021. We will update on the delivery of our 2020 water targets
early next year and have identified additional water projects to implement in the coming years to
drive towards our 2030 targets. For ease of reference, our 2020 water targets are to reduce the
abstraction of fresh water by 20% and increase water-recycling levels to 75%; and our 2030
target is to reduce the abstraction of fresh water in water-scarce regions by 50%.

Notes to editors:
Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive
operations, development projects and undeveloped resources, provides many of the metals and
minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing
consumer-driven demands of developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart
of our business, we use innovative practices and the latest technologies to mine, process, move
and market our products to our customers – and to discover new resources – safely and
sustainably.

As a responsible producer of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, the
steelmaking ingredients of iron ore and metallurgical coal, and nickel – with crop nutrients in
development and thermal coal operations planned for divestment – we are committed to being
carbon neutral across our operations by 2040. We work together with our business partners and
diverse stakeholders to unlock sustainable value from precious natural resources for the benefit
of the communities and countries in which we operate, for society as a whole, and for our
shareholders. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people’s lives.

Forward-looking statements:
This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical
facts included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American’s
financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of
management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American’s
products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking
statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo
American, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future.
Important factors that could cause Anglo American’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production
during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and
development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics
and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to
produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects
of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of
competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety,
health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts
over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American’s most
recent Annual Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk
factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American
expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers (the “Takeover Code”), the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE
Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock

looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American’s expectations with regard
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing
in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American will
necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.

NEWS RELEASE

22 October 2020

Production Report for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""Anglo American has continued its strong
operational recovery, with a 24%(1) increase in production compared to Q2. We are currently operating at
about 95%(2) of our normal capacity - testament to our efforts to protect operational continuity across our
business, whilst maintaining comprehensive measures across our operations to safeguard the lives and
livelihoods of our workforce and host communities, as part of our holistic response to Covid-19.

""Continued strong performance at the Collahuasi copper operation in Chile helped mitigate our overall year-
on-year production decrease to 3%(1) compared to Q3 2019, despite planned maintenance at Minas-Rio iron
ore in Brazil and excluding the effect of the suspended Grosvenor metallurgical coal operation in Australia.

""We have also seen encouraging improvement in demand for rough diamonds as we approach the holiday
selling season, although there is still some uncertainty in terms of the timing of a sustained recovery.""

Q3 highlights

-   Copper production increased by 4% as Collahuasi in Chile increased production by 17% due to ongoing
    strong performance.
-   PGMs production was broadly flat as a strong performance from the open pit Mogalakwena mine, with
    12% higher palladium production, largely mitigated lower production from the underground Amandelbult.
-   In Iron ore, the pipeline inspection and maintenance at Minas-Rio in Brazil was completed successfully

Rough diamond production decreased by 4% to 7.2 million carats driven by planned reductions in production
to reflect the lower demand for rough diamonds due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 related measures
remain in place to safeguard the workforce while maintaining operational continuity.

In Botswana, production decreased by 15% to 4.8 million carats due to the planned treatment of lower grade
material at both Jwaneng and Orapa, with production targeted at levels to meet lower demand.

Namibia production decreased by 43% to 0.2 million carats as the marine fleet suspended production for part
of Q3 to reflect lower demand and one vessel was in dock for planned maintenance during the period.

South African production increased to 1.2 million carats due to an expected change in ore mix, with more ore
sourced from the higher grade material from the last cut of the open pit (rather than from low grade
stockpiles) as the mine transitions to the underground.

Production in Canada increased by 17% to 0.9 million carats, due to treatment of higher grade material at
Gahcho Kue.

Demand for rough diamonds showed signs of improvement in the quarter as Covid-19 restrictions gradually
eased in cutting and polishing centres and consumer markets ahead of the key end of year holiday season.
Rough diamond sales totalled 6.6 million carats (6.5 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from three
sights compared with 0.3 million carats (0.2 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from two(3) sights in Q2
2020 and 7.4 million carats (7.1 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from three sights in Q3 2019.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance is unchanged at 25-27 million carats (100% basis), subject to continuous review based
on the disruptions related to Covid-19 as well as the timing and scale of the recovery in demand.

(1) De Beers Group production is on a 100% basis, except for the Gahcho Kue joint venture which is on an attributable 51% basis.
(2) Consolidated sales volumes exclude De Beers Group's JV partners' 50% proportionate share of sales to entities outside De Beers Group 
    from Diamond Trading Company Botswana and the Namibia Diamond Trading Company, which are included in total sales volume (100% basis).
(3) Sight 3 in Q2 2020 was cancelled due to Covid-19-related restrictions on the movement of people and product.

At Collahuasi, attributable production increased by 17% to 75,500 tonnes due to continued strong plant
performance, higher copper recovery (92.0% vs 87.7%) reflecting plant improvement initiatives, and planned
higher ore grade (1.27% vs 1.14%).

Production from El Soldado decreased by 23% to 10,800 tonnes as a result of planned lower ore grade
(0.78% vs 0.92%).

The year to date average realised price of 273c/lb includes 123,825 tonnes of copper that at 30 September
was provisionally priced at an average price of 302c/lb.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance has been tightened to 630,000-660,000 tonnes (previously 620,000-670,000 tonnes),
subject to the extent of further Covid-19 related disruption.

Metal in concentrate production

Platinum production decreased by 2% to 516,500 ounces and palladium production was flat at 352,200 ounces.

Own mined platinum production decreased by 4% to 337,800 ounces and palladium production increased by
2% to 266,800 ounces. Production at Mogalakwena increased by 7% for platinum and 12% for palladium,
due to higher throughput and improvements in concentrator recovery. Amandelbult platinum production was
down 13% and palladium was down 11% due to the continuation of Covid-19 protocols and as Tumela
Upper section comes to the end of its life. Unki and Mototolo production were also higher.

Purchase of platinum in concentrate increased by 2% to 178,700 ounces and purchase of palladium in
concentrate decreased by 4% to 85,400 ounces, driven by changes in mix.

Refined production

Following the restart of the ACP Phase B unit in Q2, refined production has ramped up steadily. However,
refined production for platinum and palladium was lower than in Q3 2019 by 13% and 2%, respectively, due
to increased levels of monitoring and intermittent stoppages to inspect the plant. The stoppages have
resulted in a slight increase in work-in-progress inventory between Q2 2020 and Q3 2020. Furthermore, the
mix of metals refined was impacted by the strong recovery of mining activities at Mogalakwena, which is
palladium-rich. The repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are progressing well and are currently expected to
complete towards the end of 2020.

Sales volumes decreased by 17% for both platinum and palladium, driven by lower refined production and a
rebuild of refined inventory. Due to the slight increase in work-in-progress inventory and the rebuild of refined
inventory, sales volumes are expected to be lower than metal-in-concentrate production in H2 2020.

The year to date average realised basket price of $4,468/Pt ounce reflects strong palladium and rhodium
prices, with the mix of metals reverting towards normalised levels following disruption in the first half of 2020.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance (metal in concentrate) is revised to 1.7-1.8 million ounces of platinum (previously 1.5-
1.7 million ounces) and 1.1-1.2 million ounces of palladium (previously 1.0-1.2 million ounces), subject to the
extent of any further Covid-19 related disruptions.

(1)   Volumes are reported as wet metric tonnes. Product is shipped with ~9% moisture.

Kumba - Total production decreased by 9% to 9.5 million tonnes with Sishen's production 9% lower at 6.5
million tonnes and Kolomela's 10% lower at 3.0 million tonnes.

Production was reduced in response to both the elevated finished stock levels at the end of Q2 2020 due to
Covid-related rail and port constraints, and in anticipation of the annual rail and port maintenance scheduled
for Q4 2020. Consequently, stock levels were drawn down to 5.4 million tonnes (1) from 6.2 million tonnes(1)
as at 30 June 2020. Reduced levels of production supported additional focus on scheduled maintenance and
operational improvement.

Sales volumes increased by 7% to 10.9 million tonnes(1) driven by a 13% increase in export sales as
Transnet's performance returned to pre-Covid-19 levels, with a significant improvement in loading rates at
the port.

Year to date, Kumba product Fe content averaged 64.3%, while the average lump:fines ratio was 67:33.
Consequently, the year to date average realised price of $103/tonne (FOB South Africa) was higher than the
62% Fe benchmark price of $90/tonne (FOB South Africa, adjusted for freight) due to these premiums.

Minas-Rio - Production decreased by 18% to 5.0 million tonnes, reflecting an approximately one month
planned stoppage to carry out routine internal scanning of the pipeline. The inspection was completed
successfully with operations resuming as scheduled at the start of October.

The year to date average realised price of $96/tonne (FOB Brazil) was higher than the Metal Bulletin 66 price
(FOB Brazil, adjusted for freight and moisture) of $86/tonne, reflecting product quality, including higher
(~67%) Fe content.

Full Year Guidance

Kumba production guidance is unchanged at 37-39 million tonnes, subject to the extent of further Covid-19
related disruption.

Minas-Rio production guidance is unchanged at 22-24 million tonnes, subject to the extent of further Covid-
19 related disruption.

(1)   Sales volumes and stock differ to Kumba's standalone results due to sales to other Group companies.

Metallurgical Coal - Export metallurgical coal production decreased by 26% to 4.8 million tonnes, principally
due to the suspension of operations at Grosvenor following the underground gas ignition incident in May
2020. Open cut operations have been scaled back at Dawson and Capcoal in response to Covid-19 reduced
demand for lower quality metallurgical coal.

The ratio of hard coking coal production to PCI/semi-soft coking coal was 82:18, lower than in Q3 2019
(85:15), due to a lower proportion of product coming from the underground operations.

The year to date average realised price for hard coking coal was $114/tonne, which was lower than the
benchmark price of $129/tonne due to a lower volume of premium quality hard coking coal produced from
Moranbah and Grosvenor.

Thermal Coal, South Africa - Export thermal coal production increased by 7% to 4.6 million tonnes,
principally driven by the ramp up of the Navigation lifex section at Khwezela.

Since August, all mines have been operating at circa 90% production due to the impact of Covid-19
measures to safeguard the workforce. Covid-19 measures in the logistics chain have affected the loading of
volumes onto trains resulting in higher stockpiles at operations.

Thermal Coal, Colombia - Attributable export thermal coal production decreased by 50% to 1.0 million
tonnes as a result of an ongoing strike at Cerrejon, which started in September. This more than offset the
ramp up in production earlier in Q3 following the lifting of lockdown restrictions.

The year to date weighted average realised price for export thermal coal from South Africa and Colombia
was $53/tonne (South Africa was $56/tonne and Colombia was $45/tonne). This was 10% lower than the
weighted average quoted FOB price from South Africa and Colombia due to timing differences and quality
discounts relative to the industry benchmark.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance for metallurgical coal is maintained at 16-18 million tonnes.

Production guidance for export thermal coal is revised to c.19 million tonnes (previously c.21 million tonnes),
owing to the ongoing strike disruption in Colombia, subject to the extent of further Covid-19 related
disruption.

in South Africa were offset by improved Australian production from stronger mining performance and higher
concentrator yield.

Manganese alloy production decreased by 37% to 18,300 tonnes, with one plant in South Africa on care and
maintenance since the Covid-19 lockdown. In addition, a binding agreement was reached for the sale of the
TEMCO alloy smelter in Australia.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION

Exploration and evaluation expenditure decreased by 13% to $59 million. Exploration expenditure decreased
by 10% to $26 million driven by decreased activity in copper, nickel and diamonds. Evaluation expenditure
decreased by 15% to $33 million, driven by overall decreased activity, in particular in diamonds, due to
Covid-19.

CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND OTHER ITEMS

Anglo American is taking a cautious and responsible approach to the remobilisation of workers at the
Quellaveco copper project in Peru, amid challenging conditions. Peru experienced an increase in Covid-19
infection rates during the quarter, and we have responded with a further strengthening of our robust health
protocols to protect our workforce whilst continuing to provide significant support to the local community to
help manage the impact and spread of Covid-19. To-date, ~8,500 workers have returned to site and our
focus in Q4 is on safely completing the remobilisation of site, with the majority of the ~10,000 workforce
expected on-site during the quarter, while productivity rates are expected to recover through the rest of the
year, subject to the extent of further Covid-19 related disruption. First production is still expected in 2022
and, based on current expectations for remobilisation and ramp-up of activity, total project capital
expenditure (100% basis) is also unchanged at $5.3-$5.5 billion, of which the Group's share is $2.7-$2.8
billion.

NOTES

-   This Production Report for the quarter ended 30 September 2020 is unaudited.
-   Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown in this Production Report.
-   Copper equivalent production shows changes in underlying production volume. It is calculated by
    expressing each product's volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue into copper
    equivalent units by dividing by the copper price (per tonne). Long-term forecast prices are used, in order
    that period-on-period comparisons exclude any impact for movements in price.

Notes to editors:

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential ingredients in almost every
aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive operations, development projects and undeveloped
resources, provides many of the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that
meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of
our business, we use innovative practices and the latest technologies to mine, process, move and market our products
to our customers - and to discover new resources - safely and sustainably.

As a responsible producer of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, the steelmaking ingredients
of iron ore and metallurgical coal, and nickel - with crop nutrients in development and thermal coal operations planned
for divestment - we are committed to being carbon neutral across our operations by 2040. We work together with our
business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock sustainable value from precious natural resources for the benefit
of the communities and countries in which we operate, for society as a whole, and for our shareholders. Anglo American
is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.

Forward-looking statements and third-party information:

This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included
in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position, business,
acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including
development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and
Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or
achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American's present and future
business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future. Important factors that could
cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and
commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other
operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, sustainability aspirations,
the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the
availability of transportation infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating
costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant
areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in
taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates,
conflicts over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American's most recent
Annual Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue
reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American expressly disclaims
any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the UK
Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of
the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and
the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any
forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or
any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing in this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American will necessarily match or exceed its
historical published earnings per share.

Certain statistical and other information about Anglo American included in this announcement is sourced from publicly
available third-party sources. As such, it has not been independently verified and presents the views of those third
parties, though these may not necessarily correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American
expressly disclaims any responsibility for, or liability in respect of, such information.

Anglo American rough diamond sales value for De Beers’ eighth sales cycle of 2020

Anglo American plc announces the value of rough diamond sales (Global Sightholder Sales and
Auctions) for De Beers’ eighth sales cycle of 2020, amounting to $467 million.

                                             Cycle 8 2020(1)     Cycle 7 2020(2)     Cycle 8 2019
                                              (provisional)         (actual)           (actual)
Sales value(3)                                   $467m              $334m              $297m
 
(1) Cycle 8 2020 provisional sales value represents sales as at 9 October 2020
(2) Cycle 7 2020 actual sales value represents sales between the dates of 19 August and 10 September.
(3) Sales values are quoted on a consolidated accounting basis. Auction sales included in a given cycle 
    are the sum of all sales between the end of the preceding cycle and the end of the noted cycle.

Owing to the restrictions on the movement of people and products in various jurisdictions around
the globe, De Beers Group has continued to implement a more flexible approach to rough
diamond sales during the eighth sales cycle of 2020, with the sight event extended beyond its
normal week-long duration. As a result, the provisional rough diamond sales figure quoted for
Cycle 8 represents the expected sales value for the period 21 September to 9 October and
remains subject to adjustment based on final completed sales.

Bruce Cleaver, CEO, De Beers Group, said: “We continue to see a steady improvement in
demand for rough diamonds in the eighth sales cycle of the year, with cutters and polishers
increasing their purchases as retail orders come through ahead of the key holiday season. It’s
encouraging to see these demand trends, but these are still early days and there is a long way
to go before we can be sure of a sustained recovery in trading conditions.”

The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and
secondary listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the
Namibia Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Nothing in this announcement or the Tender Offer Memorandum constitutes an offer of securities in the United
States of America. The securities referred to above have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the
United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The New Issue, and the guarantee
thereof, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other
jurisdiction of the United States. The New Issue is being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified
institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to certain
non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to applicable law, the Company or any of its affiliates may at any time and from time to time following

favorable than those contemplated by the Tender Offer.

This announcement must be read in conjunction with the Tender Offer Memorandum. This announcement and the

with respect to the Tender Offer. If any holder of Securities is in any doubt as to the action it should take, it is
recommended to seek its own legal, accounting and financial advice, including as to any tax consequences,
immediately from its stockbroker, bank manager, attorney, accountant or other independent financial adviser. Any
individual or company whose Securities are held on its behalf by a broker, dealer, bank, custodian, trust company or
other nominee or intermediary must contact such entity if it wishes to participate in the Tender Offer. None of the
Company, the Dealer Managers, the Information and Tender Agent and any person who controls, or is a director,
officer, employee or agent of such persons, or any affiliate of such persons, makes any recommendation as to
whether holders of Securities should participate in the Tender Offer.

OFFER AND DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

This announcement and the Tender Offer Memorandum do not constitute an invitation to participate in the Tender
Offer in any jurisdiction in which, or to or from any person to or from whom, it is unlawful to make such offer or
invitation or for there to be such participation under applicable securities laws. The distribution of this
announcement and the Tender Offer Memorandum in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into

None of the Tender Offer, this announcement, the Tender Offer Memorandum or any other documents or materials
relating to the Tender Offer have been or will be submitted to the clearance procedures of the Commissione

France

Neither this announcement, the Tender Offer Memorandum nor any other document or material relating to the
Tender Offer have only been and shall only be distributed in France to qualified investors as defined in Article 2(e)

General

The Tender Offer does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Securities (and Offers to
Sell will not be accepted from Holders) in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. In those
jurisdictions where the securities or other laws require the Tender Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer or
similar and any of the Dealer Managers or any of the Dealer Managers' respective affiliates is such a licensed broker
or dealer in any such jurisdiction, the Tender Offer shall be deemed to be made by such Dealer Manager or such
affiliate, as the case may be, on behalf of the Company in such jurisdiction.

Each Holder participating in the Tender Offer will be deemed to give certain representations in respect of the
jurisdictions referred to above and generally as set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Any tender of Securities
for purchase pursuant to an Offer to Sell pursuant to the Tender Offer from a Holder that is unable to make these
representations may be rejected. Each of the Company, the Dealer Managers and the Information and Tender Agent
reserves the right, in its absolute discretion (and without prejudice to the relevant Holder's responsibility for the
representations made by it), to investigate, in relation to any tender of Securities for purchase pursuant to the Tender
Offer, whether any such representation given by a Holder is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a
result the Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such Offer to Sell may be
rejected.


The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and secondary
listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the Namibia Stock
Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

NEWS RELEASE

11 September 2020

Anglo American rough diamond sales value for De Beers’ sixth and seventh sales cycles of 2020

Anglo American plc announces the value of rough diamond sales (Global Sightholder Sales and
Auctions) for De Beers’ sixth and seventh sales cycles of 2020, amounting to $116 million and
$320 million, respectively.

                               Cycle 7 2020(1)              Cycle 6 2020(2)               Cycle 7 2019
                               (provisional)                    (actual)                     (actual)
Sales value(3)                     $320m                         $116m                        $287m
 (1)   Cycle 7 2020 provisional sales value represents sales as at 10 September 2020
 (2)   Cycle 6 2020 actual sales value represents sales between the dates of 27 July and 13 August.
 (3)   Sales values are quoted on a consolidated accounting basis. Auction sales included in a given cycle are 
       the sum of all sales between the end of the preceding cycle and the end of the noted cycle.

Owing to the restrictions on the movement of people and products in various jurisdictions around
the globe, De Beers Group has continued to implement a more flexible approach to rough
diamond sales during the sixth and seventh sales cycles of 2020, with the normal week-long
Sight events extended towards near-continuous sales. As a result, the provisional rough diamond
sales figure quoted for cycle 7 represents the expected sales value for the period 19 August to
10 September, and remains subject to adjustment based on final completed sales.

Bruce Cleaver, CEO of De Beers Group, said: “Diamond markets showed some continued
improvement throughout August and into September as Covid-19 restrictions continued to ease
in various locations, and manufacturers focused on meeting retail demand for polished diamonds,
particularly in certain product areas.

“Overall industry sentiment has become more positive as jewellers in the key US and Chinese
consumer markets gained confidence ahead of the important year-end holiday season,
supported by strong bridal diamond jewellery demand across markets. Accordingly, we saw a
recovery in rough diamond demand in the seventh sales cycle of the year, reflecting these retail
trends, following several months of minimal manufacturing activity and disrupted demand
patterns in all major markets. It’s clear that the recovery is at an early stage and we expect that
it will take some time to get back to pre-Covid-19 levels of demand.”

ANGLO AMERICAN CAPITAL PLC 1 LAUNCHES CASH TENDER OFFER
FOR A SERIES OF ITS U.S. DOLLAR SECURITIES

Anglo American Capital plc (the “Company”) has today invited holders of its U.S.$600,000,000 4.125% Senior
Securities due September 27, 2022 guaranteed by Anglo American plc (the “Securities”) to tender any and all of
their Securities for purchase by the Company for cash (the “Tender Offer”), on the terms of, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the New Issue Condition (as defined below) and the other conditions contained in, a tender
offer memorandum dated September 8, 2020 (the “Tender Offer Memorandum”). Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this announcement have the same meaning as assigned to them in the Tender Offer Memorandum.

Holders are advised to read carefully the Tender Offer Memorandum for full details of, and information on
the procedures for participating in, the Tender Offer.

Rationale for the Tender Offer

The Tender Offer and the proposed New Issue (defined below) are being made by the Company as part of the
Company's ongoing pro-active balance sheet management and are aimed at extending the Company’s debt maturity
profile.

Securities purchased by the Company pursuant to the Tender Offer will be cancelled and will not be re-issued or re-
sold. Securities which have not been successfully submitted and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer
will remain outstanding after the Settlement Date.

Tender Consideration

1 (LEI TINT358G1SSHR3L3PW36)
2 (LEI 549300S9XF92D1X8ME43)
                                                                      
Purchase Price

Subject to the New Issue Condition being satisfied or waived, holders of Securities validly tendered at or prior to the
Expiration Time and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer, will receive the Purchase Price and any
Accrued Interest on the Settlement Date.

The “Purchase Price” for each U.S.$1,000 in nominal amount of Securities will be determined in the manner
described in the Tender Offer Memorandum by the Dealer Managers at the Pricing Time by reference to the sum of
(i) the Purchase Spread and (ii) the Reference Yield as reported on the Bloomberg Reference Page PX1 at the
Pricing Time.

The sum of the Purchase Spread and the Reference Yield is referred to herein and in the Tender Offer Memorandum
as the “Purchase Yield”. Specifically, the Purchase Price per U.S.$1,000 in nominal amount of the Securities will
equal the value per U.S.$1,000 in nominal amount of all remaining payments of principal and interest on such
Securities to be made to (and including) the maturity date of the Securities, discounted to the Settlement Date in
accordance with the formula set forth in the Schedule to the Tender Offer Memorandum, at a discount rate equal to
the Purchase Yield, minus Accrued Interest on U.S.$1,000 in nominal amount of the Securities to, but excluding, the
Settlement Date.

Price Determination

The Dealer Managers will calculate the Purchase Yield, Purchase Price and Accrued Interest on behalf of the
Company, and their calculation will be final and binding, absent manifest error. The Company will publicly
announce the actual Purchase Price and Accrued Interest for the Securities as soon as reasonably practicable after
they are determined.

Because the Purchase Price for the Securities is based on a fixed spread pricing formula linked to the yield on the
Reference Treasury Security, the actual amount of cash that may be received by a Holder tendering the Securities
pursuant to the Tender Offer will be affected by changes in such yield during the term of the Tender Offer before the
Pricing Time. After the Pricing Time, when the Purchase Price for the Securities is no longer linked to the yield on
the Reference Treasury Security, the actual amount of cash that may be received by a tendering Holder of the
Securities pursuant to the Tender Offer will be known and Holders of the Securities will be able to ascertain the
Purchase Price for the Securities in the manner described above.

Accrued Interest

The Accrued Interest Amount will be calculated on the basis of the current and prevailing interest rate and paid to
each Holder who has validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) Securities for purchase (and whose Offer to sell
has been accepted) pursuant to the Tender Offer.

New Issue Condition

The Company announced on September 8, 2020 its intention to hold investor calls with a view to issuing U.S. dollar
benchmark-sized securities in the international capital markets (the “New Issue”), subject to market conditions. The
purchase of any Securities by the Company pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject, without limitation, to the
successful completion (in the sole determination of the Company) of the New Issue (the “New Issue Condition”).
The settlement of the Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company of the New Issue
Condition.

New Issue Priority

The Company will, in connection with the allocation of the New Issue, consider whether Holders have validly
tendered or indicated their firm intention to the Company or the Dealer Managers to tender their Securities, and the
aggregate nominal amount of Securities tendered or intended to be tendered by such Holder. Therefore, a Holder                                                        
that wishes to subscribe for the New Issue in addition to tendering the Securities for purchase pursuant to the Tender
Offer may, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, receive priority (the “New Issue Priority”) in the
allocation of the New Issue, subject to the issue of the New Issue and such Holder making a separate application for
the purchase of such New Issue to one of the Dealer Managers (in their capacity as joint lead managers of the issue
of the New Issue) in accordance with the standard new issue procedures of such joint lead manager.

However, the Company is not obliged to allocate the New Issue to a Holder who has validly submitted or indicated a
firm intention to submit an Offer to Sell its Securities pursuant to the Tender Offer. Any allocation of the New Issue,
while being considered by the Company as set out above, will be made in accordance with customary new issue
allocation processes and procedures.

In the event that a Holder validly tenders its Securities pursuant to the Tender Offer, such Securities will remain
subject to such tender and the conditions of the Tender Offer as set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum
irrespective of whether that Holder receives all, part or none of any allocation of New Issue for which it has applied.

The Company reserves the right at any time to waive any or all of the Conditions of the Tender Offer (including, but
not limited to, the New Issue Condition as set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum).

If the Company decides to accept for purchase any validly tendered Securities, then all Securities validly tendered
will be accepted for purchase in full.

Tender Offer Period and Results

The Tender Offer commenced today, September 8, 2020 and will end at the Expiration Time, unless extended, re-
opened, and/or terminated as provided in the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The relevant deadline set by any intermediary for the submission of Electronic Offer Instructions will be
earlier than this deadline.

The results of the Tender Offer are expected to be announced on September 15, 2020. The acceptance of Securities
for purchase is conditional on the satisfaction of the conditions of the Tender Offer as provided in the Tender Offer
Memorandum, including the satisfaction or waiver of the New Issue Condition. The Settlement Date for the Tender
Offer is expected to be September 17, 2020 (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the New Issue Condition). In
order to receive the Tender Consideration, holders of Securities must validly tender (and not validly withdraw) their
Securities by the Expiration Time, by delivering, or arranging to have delivered on their behalf, a valid Electronic
Offer Instruction that is received by the Information and Tender Agent by the Expiration Time. If any holder of
Securities wishes to tender its Securities but such holder cannot comply with the procedures for submission of a
valid Electronic Offer Instruction by the Expiration Time, such holder may tender its Securities according to the
guaranteed delivery procedures, as further described in the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The Securities are denominated, and accordingly can only be tendered by Holders, in the Minimum Denomination,
being U.S.$200,000 and in excess integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 thereafter. Offers to Sell which relate to a
nominal amount of Securities of less than the Minimum Denomination will be rejected.

See the Tender Offer Memorandum for further details on submitting an Electronic Offer Instruction or the
guaranteed delivery procedures.

Once the Company has announced the results of the Tender Offer in accordance with applicable law, the Company’s
acceptance of Electronic Offer Instructions (including, where applicable, any notice of guaranteed delivery) in
accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer will be irrevocable. Electronic Offer Instructions (including, where
applicable, any notice of guaranteed delivery) which are so accepted will constitute binding obligations of the
submitting Holders and the Company to settle the Tender Offer.

General

The Tender Offer does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Securities (and Offers to
Sell will not be accepted from Holders) in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. In those
jurisdictions where the securities or other laws require the Tender Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer or
similar and any of the Dealer Managers or any of the Dealer Managers' respective affiliates is such a licensed broker
or dealer in any such jurisdiction, the Tender Offer shall be deemed to be made by such Dealer Manager or such
affiliate, as the case may be, on behalf of the Company in such jurisdiction.

Each Holder participating in the Tender Offer will be deemed to give certain representations in respect of the
jurisdictions referred to above and generally as set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Any tender of Securities
for purchase pursuant to an Offer to Sell pursuant to the Tender Offer from a Holder that is unable to make these
representations may be rejected. Each of the Company, the Dealer Managers and the Information and Tender Agent
reserves the right, in its absolute discretion (and without prejudice to the relevant Holder's responsibility for the
representations made by it), to investigate, in relation to any tender of Securities for purchase pursuant to the Tender
Offer, whether any such representation given by a Holder is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a
result the Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such Offer to Sell may be
rejected.

The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and secondary
listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the Namibia Stock
Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Rationale for the Tender Offers and proposed New Issue

The Tender Offers, together with the U.S.$ Notes Tender Offer (as defined below) and the proposed New Issue are
being made as part of the Company's ongoing pro-active balance sheet management and are aimed at extending the
Company’s debt maturity profile.

1           (LEI TINT358G1SSHR3L3PW36)
2           (LEI 549300S9XF92D1X8ME43)

Details of the Tender Offers

The Company announced today its intention to issue U.S. dollars benchmark-sized notes in the international capital
markets (the “New Issue”). The purchase of any Notes by the Company pursuant to the Tender Offers is subject,
without limitation, to the successful completion (in the sole determination of the Company) of the New Issue (the “New
Issue Condition”).

A Noteholder that wishes to subscribe for the New Issue in addition to tendering Notes for purchase pursuant to the
Tender Offers may, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, receive priority (the ""New Issue Priority"") in
the allocation of the New Issue, subject to the issue of the New Issue and such Noteholder making a separate application
for the purchase of such New Issue to one of Banco Santander, S.A. or BNP Paribas in accordance with the standard
new issue procedures of such joint lead manager all on the terms and as further described in the Tender Offer
Memorandum.

Subject to the right of the Company to extend, terminate, withdraw or amend the terms and conditions of the Tender
Offers, as at the date of this announcement the Company proposes to accept valid tenders of Notes for purchase
pursuant to the Tender Offers for cash such that the total amount payable by the Company for all of the Notes accepted
for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, (including Derivative Costs but excluding Accrued Interest payable in
respect of such Notes) (the “Total Amount Payable”) is a cash amount of no greater than the Euro Equivalent of the
cash amount in U.S.$ of net proceeds received by the Company from the successful completion of the New Issue (the
“New Issue Amount”) less the Euro Equivalent of the U.S.$ Tender Total Amount Payable (as defined below) by the
Company for all the U.S.$600,000,000 4.125 per cent. Senior Notes due 2022 of the Company (the “U.S.$ Notes”)
accepted for purchase pursuant to the tender offer made by the Company in respect of the U.S.$ Notes, with an
aggregate nominal amount outstanding of U.S.$.600,000,000, which was announced on 8 September 2020 (the “U.S.$
Notes Tender Offer”). However, the Company reserves the right to allocate a significantly lower or significantly
higher amount (or no amount) of cash for the purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers (the final cash amount
the Company, in its sole discretion, decides to apply to the Tender Offers being the “Capped Spend Amount”). For the
avoidance of doubt, the U.S.$ Notes Tender Offer is not the subject of the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The “U.S.$ Tender Total Amount Payable” means the total amount in U.S. dollars that would be payable (including
U.S.$ derivative costs but excluding U.S.$ accrued interest) by the Company for all U.S.$ Notes validly tendered and
accepted for purchase pursuant to the U.S.$ Notes Tender Offer.

The Company is not under any obligation to accept for purchase any Notes tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers and
reserves the right to determine the allocation of the Capped Spend Amount between each series of the Notes (each a
“Series”) for the purposes of determining the nominal amount of Notes due 2021 to be accepted for purchase (if any)
and the nominal amount of the Notes due 2022 to be accepted for purchase (if any) (together, the “Series Acceptance
Amounts” and each a “Series Acceptance Amount”) in its sole discretion, and reserves the right to accept significantly
more or less (or none) of the Notes of either Series as compared to the other Series of Notes. The acceptance for
purchase by the Company of Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers is at the sole discretion of the
Company and tenders may be rejected by the Company for any reason.

The Company will pay, for the Notes of each Series accepted by it for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers and
subject to the New Issue Condition being satisfied or waived, the relevant Purchase Price (expressed as a percentage
and rounded to the third decimal place, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards) to be determined in the manner described
in the Tender Offer Memorandum by reference to the relevant Fixed Purchase Yield.

The Purchase Price in respect of each Series of Notes is intended to reflect a yield to maturity of the Notes of such
Series on the Settlement Date equal to the relevant Fixed Purchase Yield. Specifically, the Purchase Price for each
Series of the Notes will equal (a) the value of all remaining payments of principal and interest on each such Series up to
and including the relevant maturity date of such Series, discounted to the Settlement Date at a discount rate equal to the
relevant Fixed Purchase Yield, minus (b) the relevant Accrued Interest Amount.

The calculation of the Purchase Price and Accrued Interest Amount for each Series of the Notes will be made by the
Joint Dealer Managers on behalf of the Company, and such calculations will be final and binding on the Noteholders,
absent manifest error.

The Accrued Interest Amount will be calculated on the basis of the applicable interest rate for the relevant Notes and
paid to each Noteholder who has validly tendered Notes for purchase (and whose Offer to Sell has been accepted)
pursuant to the Tender Offers.

The Company reserves the right at any time to waive any or all of the Conditions of the Tender Offers (including, but
not limited to, the New Issue Condition).

In the event that Offers to Sell are received in respect of an aggregate nominal amount of a Series which is greater than
the relevant Series Acceptance Amount, a pro rata reduction will be applied to such Offers to Sell in respect of the
Relevant Series. Any such reduction will be calculated as described in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Offers to Sell
which relate (including after any pro-rating) to a nominal amount of Notes of any relevant Series of less than the
Minimum Denomination will be rejected.

Electronic Offer Instructions

In order to participate in, and be eligible to receive the Tender Consideration in respect of the Notes pursuant to, the
Tender Offers, Noteholders must validly tender their Notes by delivering, or arranging to have delivered on their behalf,
a valid Electronic Offer Instruction that is received by the Tender Agent by 16:00 hours (London time) on
15 September 2020. Electronic Offer Instructions will be irrevocable except in the limited circumstances described
in the Tender Offer Memorandum.

The Notes are denominated, and accordingly can only be tendered in the Tender Offers, in the Minimum Denomination
of €100,000 and permitted integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

A separate Offer to Sell must be completed on behalf of each beneficial owner and in respect of each Series of Notes.
Before making a decision whether to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers, Noteholders should carefully consider
all of the information in the Tender Offer Memorandum and, in particular, the risk factors set out under the heading
""Risk Factors"".

Unless stated otherwise, announcements in connection with the Tender Offers will be made by the delivery of notices to

London Stock Exchange. Such announcements may also be made by the issue of a press release to a Notifying News
Service. Copies of all such announcements, press releases and notices can also be obtained upon request from the
Tender Agent, the contact details for which are set out below. Significant delays may be experienced where notices are
delivered to the Clearing Systems and Noteholders are urged to contact the Tender Agent for the relevant

Noteholders are advised to carefully read the Tender Offer Memorandum for full details of, and information on,

PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA AND UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The New Issue is not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU)
2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the New Issue or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the New Issue or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the
UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. MiFID II professionals/ECPs-only/No PRIIPs KID – eligible
counterparties and professional clients only (all distribution channels).

respect of any tax consequences, from its broker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other independent financial, tax

by law. Persons into whose possession this announcement and/or the Tender Offer Memorandum comes are required by
each of the Company, the Joint Dealer Managers and the Tender Agent to inform themselves about, and to observe, any
such restrictions. Neither this announcement nor the Tender Offer Memorandum constitutes an offer to buy or the
solicitation of an offer to sell Notes (and Offers to Sell will not be accepted from Noteholders) in any circumstances in
which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. In those jurisdictions where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the
Tender Offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer or similar and any of the Joint Dealer Managers or any of the
Joint Dealer Managers' respective affiliates is such a licensed broker or dealer or similar in any such jurisdiction, the

of the Company in such jurisdiction.
Each Noteholder participating in the Tender Offers will be deemed to give certain representations in respect of the
jurisdictions referred to below and generally as set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Any tender of Notes for
purchase pursuant to an Offer to Sell pursuant to the Tender Offers from a Noteholder that is unable to make these
representations may be rejected. Each of the Company, the Joint Dealer Managers and the Tender Agent reserves the
right, in its absolute discretion (and without prejudice to the relevant Noteholder's responsibility for the representations
made by it), to investigate, in relation to any tender of the Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, whether
any such representation given by a Noteholder is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a result the
Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such Offer to Sell may be rejected.

United States

by any means or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce of or of any facilities of a national securities
exchange of, the United States. This includes, but is not limited to, facsimile transmission, electronic mail, telex,
telephone, the internet and other forms of electronic communication. The Notes may not be tendered in the Tender
Offers by any such use, means, instrumentality or facility from or within the United States or by persons located or
resident in the United States or by any person acting for the account or benefit of a person located or resident in the
United States. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and the Tender Offer Memorandum and any other documents
or materials relating to the Tender Offers are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly mailed or otherwise
transmitted, distributed or forwarded (including, without limitation, by custodians, nominees or trustees) in or into the
United States or to any persons located or resident in the United States. Any purported tender of Notes in the Tender
Offers resulting directly or indirectly from a violation of these restrictions will be invalid and any purported tender of

operations. By the end of June, we were back at c.90% capacity across the portfolio (1) and the significant
transformation of our underlying operational capabilities that has made the business more resilient helped to deliver
$3.4 billion of underlying EBITDA*.

""The safety of our people comes first, no matter what. We have made so much progress, yet we are acutely aware
that serious incidents continue in our business, none more alarming than at our Grosvenor underground mine in
Australia in May. Across the global business, we recorded another all-time low injury frequency rate, representing a
further 3% improvement compared to the record low of 2019 and a 62% improvement since 2013.

""Looking beyond the near term, we continue to invest in high quality growth. We still expect first production at our
world class Quellaveco copper project in Peru in 2022, despite the prolonged slowdown through the national
quarantine, reflecting the excellent progress achieved prior to March. The trajectory of our portfolio is towards later
cycle products, with development of our recently acquired Tier 1 Woodsmith polyhalite fertiliser project continuing to
progress well, while in May we set out our plans to exit our remaining South African thermal coal operations.

""During the second half, I expect our product diversification and Operating Model to continue to serve us well. As the
global economy recovers, PGMs, copper and iron ore are all particularly well positioned, while De Beers, as the
world's leading diamond business, is taking all appropriate steps to address the effects of acute disruption. As a
company, we are continuing to invest and grow, with our products increasingly geared towards a fast growing
population and a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world.""

- Profit attributable to equity shareholders of $0.5 billion (30 June 2019: $1.9 billion)

- Basic headline earnings per share of $0.49 compared to $1.48 in the comparative period
- Investing in high quality growth in later cycle products, including Quellaveco (copper) and Woodsmith (fertiliser)
- Working towards exit from remaining South African thermal coal operations
- Targeting carbon neutrality across operations by 2040

Notes
1. Shareholders on the UK register of members with an address in the UK will be paid in Sterling and those with an address in a country in the European
   Union which has adopted the Euro will be paid in Euros. Such shareholders may, however, elect to be paid their dividends in US dollars provided the
   UK Registrars receive such election by Friday, 4 September 2020. Shareholders with an address elsewhere will be paid in US dollars except those
   registered on the South African branch register who will be paid in South African rand.
2. Dividend Tax will be withheld from the amount of the gross dividend of 459.76280 cents per ordinary share paid to South African shareholders at the
   rate of 20% unless a shareholder qualifies for exemption. After the Dividend Tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be 367.81024 cents per ordinary
   share. Anglo American plc had a total of 1,363,118,080 ordinary shares in issue, including 50,488 treasury shares, as at 29 July 2020. In South Africa
   the dividend will be distributed by Anglo American South Africa Proprietary Limited, a South African company with tax registration number 9030010608,
   or one of its South African subsidiaries, in accordance with the Company's dividend access share arrangements. The dividend in South African rand is
   based on an exchange rate of US$1:R16.42010 taken on Wednesday, 29 July 2020, being the currency conversion date.
3. Dematerialisation and rematerialisation of registered share certificates in South Africa will not be effected by CSDPs during the period from the JSE ex-
   dividend date to the record date (both days inclusive).
4. Those shareholders who already participate in the DRIP need not complete a DRIP mandate form for each dividend as such forms provide an ongoing
   authority to participate in the DRIP until cancelled in writing. Shareholders who wish to participate in the DRIP should obtain a mandate form from the
   UK Registrars, the South African Transfer Secretaries or, in the case of those who hold their shares through the STRATE system, their CSDP.
5. In terms of the DRIP, and subject to the purchase of shares in the open market, share certificates/CREST notifications are expected to be mailed and
   CSDP investor accounts credited/updated on or around Monday, 19 October 2020. CREST accounts will be credited on Wednesday, 30 September 2020.
6. Copies of the terms and conditions of the DRIP are available from the UK Registrars or the South African Transfer Secretaries.
7. The US$:GBP/EUR conversion rates will be determined by the actual rates achieved by Anglo American buying forward contracts for those currencies, during
   the two days preceding the announcement of the conversion rates, for delivery on the dividend payment date.

Notes to editors:
Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential ingredients in almost every
aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive operations, development projects and undeveloped
resources, provides many of the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that
meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart
of our business, we use innovative practices and the latest technologies to mine, process, move and market our
products to our customers - and to discover new resources - safely and sustainably.

As a responsible producer of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, the steelmaking ingredients
of iron ore and metallurgical coal, and nickel - with crop nutrients in development and thermal coal operations planned
for divestment - we are committed to being carbon neutral across our operations by 2040. We work together with our
business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock sustainable value from precious natural resources for the benefit
of the communities and countries in which we operate, for society as a whole, and for our shareholders. Anglo American
is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.

Kumba Iron Ore approves Kapstevel South project at Kolomela

Anglo American notes the announcement made by Kumba Iron Ore this morning, the text of
which appears below.

Kumba is pleased to announce the approval of its Kapstevel South project at its Kolomela mine
by both the Company’s and Anglo American’s boards.

The total capital cost of the project will be approximately R7 billion, including pre-stripping. It is
anticipated that the addition of the Kapstevel South pit will deliver an after-tax internal rate of
return of ~25% and allow Kolomela to maintain an estimated EBITDA margin of >35% in the long-
term.

The project entails the development of a new pit, Kapstevel South and associated infrastructure
at Kolomela. The pit is a conventional truck and shovel operation producing high quality direct
shipping ore (DSO). Whilst the pit is included in the current life of mine, it contributes significantly
to sustaining production of ~13Mt for the remaining life of mine. Pit establishment and waste
stripping will commence this year with first ore expected in 2024.

Themba Mkhwanazi, CEO of Kumba, said: “The approval of this project, at a time when the global
and South African economies face the challenges of Covid-19, underscores Kumba’s positive
longer-term outlook for demand for its high-quality product. It also demonstrates our commitment
to extend the lives of our mines and continue providing much-needed jobs and livelihoods in the
Northern Cape region.”

The operational and financial forecasts provided in this announcement are estimates and the
financial information has not been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

Forward-looking statements:
This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical
facts included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American’s
financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of
management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American’s
products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking
statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo
American, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American’s present
and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future.
Important factors that could cause Anglo American’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production
during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and
development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics
and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to
produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects
of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of
competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety,
health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts
over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American’s most
recent Annual Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk
factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American
expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers (the “Takeover Code”), the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE
Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock
Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-
looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American’s expectations with regard
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing
in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American will
necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.

Anglo American plc
Production Report for the second quarter ended 30 June 2020

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""Anglo American has shown resilience in
addressing the challenges posed by Covid-19, acting quickly to help safeguard the lives and livelihoods of
our workforce and host communities. Our comprehensive response supported the continuity of the majority
of our operations during varying degrees of lockdown in different jurisdictions, albeit at reduced capacity in
many cases. Continued strong performances from our Minas-Rio iron ore operation in Brazil and the
Collahuasi copper operation in Chile helped mitigate our overall decrease in production to 18% (1), as we also
addressed operational issues at our metallurgical coal and PGM operations. Building up from a production
level of around 60%(1) of total capacity in April, we continue to increase and had reached about 90% (1) of
production capacity by the end of June.

""Beyond the current business imperatives, we continue to ensure that our business is well positioned for the
long term, including the nature of our portfolio evolution and societal responsibilities. During the quarter, we
have confirmed our plans to work towards an exit from our remaining thermal coal operations in South Africa,
in line with our overall trajectory towards later cycle products. And, benefiting from the ongoing
transformation of our physical processes through our FutureSmart Mining™ programme, we set out our clear
aim of achieving carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040 - an ambitious and important commitment
for us as a business, for our employees and our diverse stakeholders.""

Q2 highlights

-   Minas-Rio in Brazil continued its strong operational performance, with 6.2 million tonnes of high quality
    iron ore production, reflecting ongoing P101 productivity improvements.
-   Collahuasi in Chile increased copper production by 38% due to strong performance.
-   Metallurgical coal production decreased by 32% to 4.0 million tonnes due to two incidents underground,
    at Moranbah and Grosvenor, as well as longwall moves at Grosvenor and Grasstree.
-   Covid-19 lockdowns across southern Africa affected De Beers, PGMs, Kumba and Thermal Coal, with
    lower refined PGMs production due to the repairs and ramp-up of the ACP.

Rough diamond production decreased by 54% to 3.5 million carats, primarily due to the Covid-19 lockdowns
in southern Africa. Mining operations resumed following regional lockdowns with Covid-19 measures in place
to safeguard the workforce; with production at lower levels reflecting reduced demand for rough diamonds
due to the pandemic.

In Botswana, production decreased by 68% to 1.8 million carats, principally due to a nationwide lockdown
from 2 April to 18 May and the implementation of Covid-19 measures to safeguard the workforce. Operations
restarted from mid-May, with production targeted at levels to meet the lower demand.

Namibia production increased by 7% to 0.4 million carats as the Mafuta crawler vessel was under planned
maintenance in Q2 2019. With targeted regional lockdowns in Namibia in response to Covid-19, marine
operations implemented measures to enable operational continuity while safeguarding the workforce. This
more than offset the decrease in production from Covid-19 at the land operations.

South African production decreased by 3% to 0.6 million carats primarily due to Covid-19 measures. The
production shutdown was partly offset by higher grades from the open pit material prior to transition to the
underground. The treatment plant restarted mid-April ramping up to normal capacity by the end of April.

Production in Canada decreased by 27% to 0.8 million carats, primarily due to Victor reaching the end of its
life in Q2 2019. At Gahcho Kue, production decreased by 11% to 0.8 million carats due to Covid-19 measures.

During Q2, the demand for rough diamonds was significantly impacted by a combination of Covid-19
restrictions impacting consumer demand and access to southern Africa, as well as severely limited
midstream cutting and polishing capacity due to lockdowns, particularly in India. Rough diamond sales
totalled 0.3 million carats (0.2 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) compared with 9.0 million carats 
(8.3 million carats on a consolidated basis)(2) in Q2 2019. The third Sight of 2020 was cancelled due to Covid-19-
related travel restrictions and, in response to the unprecedented industry conditions, De Beers also offered
Sightholders the option to defer up to 100% of their allocations at the fourth and fifth Sights. Rough diamond
consolidated sales(2) in Q2 2020 decreased to $56 million (Q2 2019: $1.3 billion), driven by lower volumes
and prices.

The H1 2020 average realised rough diamond price decreased by 21% to $119/carat (H1 2019: $151/carat),
driven by a higher proportion of lower value rough diamonds sold and an 8% reduction in the average rough
price index.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance is unchanged at 25-27 million carats (100% basis), subject to continuous review based
on the disruptions related to Covid-19 as well as the timing and scale of the recovery in demand.

(1) De Beers Group production is on a 100% basis, except for the Gahcho Kue joint venture which is on an attributable 51% basis.
(2) Consolidated sales volumes exclude De Beers Group's JV partners' 50% proportionate share of sales to entities outside De Beers Group from 
    Diamond Trading Company Botswana and the Namibia Diamond Trading Company, which are included in total sales volume (100% basis).

(1) Copper production shown on a contained metal basis. Reflects copper production from the Copper business unit only 
    (excludes copper production from the Platinum Group Metals business unit).

Copper production increased by 5% to 166,800 tonnes due to continued strong plant performance at
Collahuasi, partially offset by expected lower production at Los Bronces due to lower water availability
resulting from the unprecedented drought conditions in central Chile. Current Covid-19 measures to
safeguard our people and communities, including reductions in workforce, while preserving the longer term
integrity of the assets are not expected to significantly impact production in 2020.

Production from Los Bronces decreased by 12%, to 80,700 tonnes, as a 15% reduction in plant throughput
(10 million tonnes vs 12 million tonnes) due to lower water availability was partially offset by planned higher
grades (0.85% vs 0.81%).

At Collahuasi, attributable production increased by 38% to 75,700 tonnes, a historical record for the
operation, driven by higher throughput (14 million tonnes vs 12 million tonnes) and record copper recovery
(92.0% vs 87.3%), reflecting plant improvement projects implemented during 2019, as well as planned
higher grades (1.31% vs 1.21%).

Production from El Soldado decreased by 21% to 10,400 tonnes as a result of lower grades (0.76% vs. 0.92%).

Sales volumes of 293,800 tonnes in H1 2020 were impacted by temporary port closures in Chile due to
heavy tidal swells limiting vessel availability in June. The average realised price of these sales was 250c/lb
($5,512/t), broadly in line with the average LME price.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance for the year remains unchanged at 620,000-670,000 tonnes, subject to water
availability and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Metal in concentrate production

Platinum and palladium production decreased by 41% to 307,400 ounces and 34% to 228,400 ounces,
respectively.

Own mined platinum production decreased by 45% to 188,700 ounces and palladium production decreased
by 33% to 173,300 ounces. This was largely driven by Covid-19 lockdowns with Mogalakwena operating at
c.50% through April before ramping up to normal levels by the end of the quarter. Amandelbult was not
operating during April but ramped up to c.50% production at the end of the quarter and is expected to reach
85% production levels by the end of the year.

Purchase of platinum in concentrate decreased by 33% to 118,700 ounces and purchase of palladium in
concentrate decreased by 36% to 55,100 ounces, largely due to the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined production for platinum and palladium decreased by 73% to 160,600 and 66% to 147,400,
respectively. This was largely driven by a force majeure incident at the ACP (Anglo Converter Plant) on 10
February, which led to the closure of both Phase A and Phase B units from 6 March, with Phase B returning
to steady state on 12 May. Following a subsequent closure during the first two weeks of June, the ACP
Phase B has since ramped-up and is operating at full capacity. Repairs to Phase A are ahead of schedule
with completion estimated at the end of Q4 2020.

Platinum sales volumes decreased by 67% to 195,700 ounces and palladium sales volumes decreased by
66% to 160,800 ounces due to lower refined production in the period, which was partially offset by a
drawdown in refined metal inventory to supplement sales.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance (metal in concentrate) is unchanged at 1.5-1.7 million ounces of platinum and 1.0-1.2
million ounces of palladium, subject to the extent of any further Covid-19 related disruptions.

(1) Volumes are reported as wet metric tonnes. Product is shipped with ~8-9% moisture.

Kumba - Total production volumes decreased by 20% to 8.5 million tonnes. This reflects lower workforce
levels in response to the Covid-19 lockdown, the subsequent re-opening of operations with reduced
workforce levels of c.50% and the ramp-up in production to normal run-rates in June.

Sishen production reduced by 21% to 5.8 million tonnes and Kolomela's by 17% to 2.7 million tonnes.

Sales volumes decreased by 23% to 8.1 million tonnes (1) due to Covid-19 logistics constraints affecting
Transnet and poor weather conditions, as well as no domestic offtake.

Finished stock levels increased to 6.2 million tonnes(1) from 5.6 million tonnes(1) as at 31 March 2020 due to
the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions at the port.

In the first half of 2020, the average lump to fines ratio in the Kumba product was 65:35 (H1 2019: 68:32),
while the Fe content averaged 64.4% (H1 2019: 64.3%).

Minas-Rio - Production increased by 5% to 6.2 million tonnes, reflecting a continued strong performance,
with P101 productivity initiatives supported by robust operational stability. Current Covid-19 measures in
place to safeguard the workforce and communities are not expected to significantly affect 2020 production.

Metallurgical Coal - Export metallurgical coal production decreased by 32% to 4.0 million tonnes, principally
due to two incidents underground as well as longwall moves at Grosvenor and Grasstree. In January, a fall
of ground at Moranbah delayed the completion of a longwall move with the operation restarting ahead of
schedule in mid-May. At Grosvenor, operations have been suspended since the beginning of May following a
gas ignition incident underground. The investigation into the incident at Grosvenor is under way and mining
operations will restart only when it is safe to do so, with any additional safety measures in place. Disruption
to operations from Covid-19 has been limited, with measures in place to help safeguard the workforce and
local communities. Open cut operations have been scaled back at Dawson and Capcoal in response to
reduced demand for lower quality metallurgical coal.

As a result of the lower volumes following these operational issues, the H1 2020 unit cost is expected to be
circa $97/tonne.

The ratio of hard coking coal production to PCI/semi-soft coking coal was 81:19, lower than in Q2 2019
(85:15), due to a lower proportion of product coming from the underground operations.

Thermal Coal South Africa - Export thermal coal production decreased by 22% to 3.6 million tonnes due to
Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, as well as sections at Goedehoop that reached their end of life.

All mines operated at c.50% at the start of lockdown in late March, with open pit operations ramping up to
70% as lockdown measures were eased in May. Since June, all mines have been operating at circa 80%
due to the impact of Covid-19 measures to safeguard the workforce. Similar measures in the logistics chain
have affected the loading of volumes onto trains resulting in higher stockpiles at operations.

Thermal Coal Colombia - Attributable export thermal coal production decreased by 62% to 0.8 million
tonnes as a result of the impact of the local Covid-19 lockdown and planned lower production in response to
demand. Mining operations recommenced in early May and are expected to progressively ramp-up over the
course of Q3.

The H1 2020 weighted average realised price for export thermal coal from South Africa and Colombia was
$56/tonne. This was 7% lower than the weighted average quoted FOB price from South Africa and Colombia
principally due to discounts for energy content of coal.

Full Year Guidance

Following the temporary suspension of operations at Grosvenor since the start of May, production guidance
for metallurgical coal is revised to 16-18 million tonnes (previously 19-21 million tonnes), subject to the
extent of further Covid-19 related disruption.

Production guidance for export thermal coal is revised to c.21 million tonnes (previously c.22 million tonnes)
due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions and lower production in response to demand at Cerrejon
and remains subject to the extent of further Covid-19 related disruption.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION

Exploration and evaluation expenditure decreased by 39% to $43 million. Exploration expenditure decreased
by 42% to $18 million driven by decreased activities across most products, in particular diamonds, due to
Covid-19. Evaluation expenditure decreased by 36% to $25 million, driven by decreased works in
Metallurgical Coal and at Sakatti (Copper / PGMs).

CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND OTHER ITEMS

By the end of the quarter, there was a circa $1.3 billion build-up of working capital, largely due to Covid-19
impacts on demand for diamonds, ACP repairs affecting refining activity at PGMs and late June weather
impacts on vessel loading at both Copper and Kumba.

NOTES

-   This Production Report for the quarter ended 30 June 2020 is unaudited.
-   Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown in this Production Report.
-   Copper equivalent production shows changes in underlying production volume. It is calculated by
    expressing each product's volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue into copper
    equivalent units by dividing by the copper price (per tonne). Long-term forecast prices are used, in order
    that period-on-period comparisons exclude any impact for movements in price.

Notes to editors:
Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential ingredients in almost every
aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive operations, development projects and undeveloped
resources, provides many of the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that
meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of
our business, we use innovative practices and the latest technologies to mine, process, move and market our products
to our customers - and to discover new resources - safely and sustainably.

As a responsible producer of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, the steelmaking ingredients
of iron ore and metallurgical coal, and nickel - with crop nutrients in development and thermal coal operations planned
for divestment - we are committed to being carbon neutral across our operations by 2040. We work together with our
business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock sustainable value from precious natural resources for the benefit
of the communities and countries in which we operate, for society as a whole, and for our shareholders. Anglo American
is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.

Forward-looking statements and third-party information:

This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included
in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position, business,
acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including
development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and
Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or
achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American's present and future
business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future. Important factors that could
cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and
commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other
operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining
and processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transportation
infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of
sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the
actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety,
health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts over land
and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American's most recent Annual Report.
Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be
placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American expressly disclaims
any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the UK
Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of
the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and
the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any
forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or
any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing in this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American will necessarily match or exceed its
historical published earnings per share.

Certain statistical and other information about Anglo American included in this announcement is sourced from publicly
available third-party sources. As such, it has not been independently verified and presents the views of those third
parties, though these may not necessarily correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American
expressly disclaims any responsibility for, or liability in respect of, such third-party information.

Our report on payments to governments made by Anglo American and its subsidiary undertakings
for the year ended 31 December 2019, as required under the UK's Reports on Payments to
Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015), was filed at Companies House
today. The UK Regulations enact domestic rules in line with Chapter 10 of the EU Accounting
Directive. The report also satisfies the requirements of Rule 4.3A of the Disclosure Guidance and
Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK.

Anglo American Platinum update on ACP Phase B repair

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released today
to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

Anglo American Platinum announced on 3 June 2020 that a water leak had been detected in the
high-pressure cooling section of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. All employees
were safely evacuated as a precaution. The Company took the decision to temporarily close the
ACP Phase B unit to secure a safe operating environment, protect employees and protect the
integrity of the plant.

The detailed technical investigation into the cause of the water leak shows localised damage to
a single cooler tube that is now being replaced and confirms that this leak is unconnected to the
repair work recently completed on the ACP Phase B unit. Other maintenance is being carried out
and additional controls put in place whilst the ACP Phase B unit is off-line in order to provide
greater operational stability. The repair work is expected to be completed next week, and
recommissioning will then start once a detailed risk-based assurance process has confirmed it is
safe to do so.

A prudent approach will be taken to safely ramp up the ACP Phase B unit. Increased monitoring
will likely result in intermittent stoppages to inspect the plant until the repairs to the ACP Phase
A unit are completed. The repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are progressing well and are now
expected to complete towards the end of 2020 due to the successful accelerated procurement of
key long-lead time items.

Anglo American Platinum will continue to receive concentrate from third parties and joint ventures
under the purchase of concentrate and toll agreements and will continue to deliver metal to
customers.

The stoppage of the ACP Phase B for repairs of this water leak is not expected to have any
impact on full year refined production guidance, which remains at between 3.1 – 3.6 million PGM
ounces.

NEWS RELEASE
Anglo American Platinum temporary closure of ACP Phase B

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released today
to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

Anglo American Platinum announces that on 31 May 2020 a water leak was detected in the high-
pressure cooling section of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. Our systems allowed
us to bring the unit down pro-actively and safely. All employees evacuated the area safely.

Whilst a detailed technical investigation into the cause of this leak and potential repairs is under
way, the Company has taken the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit to ensure
an ongoing safe operating environment, protect employees and protect the integrity of the plant.
This latest action is separate from the repair work that was recently completed at the ACP Phase
B unit and there is no damage to the prior repairs or to the furnace.

An update from the Company will be provided as soon as more information is available, expected
to be early next week.

In the meantime, the repair of Phase A unit is progressing well and is unaffected by the current
work at ACP Phase B unit.

12 May 2020

Mark Cutifani presentation to Bank of America Global Metals, Mining and Steel Conference

Anglo American Chief Executive, Mark Cutifani, today presents an overview of how Anglo
American is “Delivering through volatile times” at Bank of America’s annual Global Metals, Mining
and Steel Conference.

Mr Cutifani said: “We continue to focus on delivering across the many facets of our business.
Most immediately, we are proactively managing the health, social and economic effects of the
pandemic, considering the entire ecosystem of our business. Our global WeCare programme
supports both lives and livelihoods – of our people, their families and our host communities,
spanning four pillars: physical health, mental health, living with dignity, and community response.
Our operations and host communities must both be healthy to prosper on a sustainable basis.

“The significant and broad-based improvements we have made to our business stand us in good
stead, both during this uncertain time and as we move towards the economic recovery phase.
Our portfolio and asset quality position us well for the recovery, leveraging our technical,
operational and product marketing capabilities to deliver the best returns from our asset base.
We see further transformational improvements ahead through our P101 and FutureSmart
MiningTM programmes, including driving our operations towards carbon neutrality before 2040. In
combination with our ongoing portfolio evolution – with Quellaveco in copper, and Woodsmith in
crop nutrients, and our expected exit from our thermal coal operations in South Africa in the next
two to three years – we are well positioned for future demand themes and the needs of modern
consumers and society.”

Notes to editors:

About WeCare
WeCare is Anglo American’s global response programme to support the lives and livelihoods of
our workforce and host communities through the health, social and economic effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our mines and host communities, which are also often home to much of
our workforce, operate as an ecosystem and both must be healthy to prosper.

Across our operational footprint and in those communities that are local to our operations, our
WeCare programme provides information and extensive practical support across four pillars of:
physical health, mental health, living with dignity, and community response.

Physical Health – education and behavioural change to support personal health and hygiene;
health screening and testing; PPE and medical equipment and facilities.

Mental Health – employee support programmes to assist with mental health management,
including employee App and online events and digital materials.

Living with Dignity – direct employee and community support to combat gender-based and
domestic violence; work with health authorities to identify abuse cases and referrals to support
mechanisms.

Community Response – wide-ranging livelihoods programme to support communities through
the social and economic effects of the pandemic, including: public information campaigns aimed
at health and hygiene; health screening and COVID-19 testing; support for health service
provision; continuation of essential services (e.g. water, energy, accommodation); food package
distribution; employee match-giving programme; support for SMEs and entrepreneurs; support
for teachers and students; job training for post-pandemic employability; regional development
planning to enhance local economic activity for the long term.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of
the world’s developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we
use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world – safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner – of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, steelmaking and thermal coal, and nickel – we are the custodians of what are precious
natural resources. We work together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to
unlock the sustainable value that those resources represent for our shareholders, the
communities and countries in which we operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is
re-imagining mining to improve people’s lives.

Notification of transactions by Directors / PDMRs

Awards of Ordinary Shares were made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) at nil
cost on 6 May 2020 to Directors/PDMRs as detailed below.

The Remuneration Committee has approved the grant of 2020 LTIP awards, which will pay-out based
on the achievement of stretching performance conditions over three years, as disclosed in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report of the Company’s 2019 Integrated Annual Report. These conditions
include both relative and absolute performance milestones set before the COVID-19 crisis took hold,
and a number of challenging measures relating to, for example, energy and climate change.

The LTIP awards were delayed from the usual grant date of early March, to allow for shareholder
approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the rules of the Anglo American LTIP 2020, at
the Company’s AGM on 5 May. A share price of £18.133 (JSE: ZAR.362.507), set in early March, and as
approved by the Remuneration Committee, has been used to determine the number of shares
awarded.

These awards will vest in March 2023, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions as
explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report of the Company’s 2019 Integrated Annual Report.
The vested Shares will then be subject to a further holding period of two years and will be released in
March 2025.

In respect of Resolution 21 (Disapplication of pre-emption rights), the authority sought by the
Company was to disapply pre-emption rights only up to 2.5% of the issued share capital, rather than
5% as it has sought previously and which is aligned with the Investment Association’s share capital
guidelines and market practice for FTSE listed companies. However, Anglo American is mindful of the
concerns expressed by a number of its South African shareholders which has led to Resolution 21 not
receiving a high level of support. The Company will engage with its South African shareholders to
clarify their concerns.

Anglo American Platinum ramps up ACP plant to restart refined PGM production

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released today
to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

Anglo American Platinum has safely and successfully completed the repair of the Anglo
Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. The ACP and full downstream processing operations are
completing a safe ramp-up and expect to be fully operational from 12 May 2020. Force majeure
to suppliers of concentrate will be lifted on that date.

CEO of Anglo American Platinum, Natascha Viljoen, stated:

“I am pleased to report that we have safely and successfully completed the repair of the ACP
Phase B unit ahead of schedule, enabling the restart of refined production of our platinum group
metals and our base metals. We were vigilant in adhering to strict health and safety protocols to
keep the repair team safe during the lockdown, whilst ensuring that we were able to implement
social distancing and hygiene requirements which form our new way of working during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

We have carried out substantial testing to ensure the stability of the ACP Phase B unit, and as
we complete the ramp-up, we are engaging with suppliers of concentrate to lift force majeure
imminently. All temporary commercial arrangements applicable during the force majeure period
will revert to normal commercial terms.”

The estimated final cost of repairs for ACP Phase B is c.R150 million, in line with the lower end
of guidance provided. Repair work on the ACP Phase A unit continues and is progressing in line
with the project plan. All orders for long lead items have been placed and the dismantling work
started on site.

Due to the time taken to refine the respective platinum group and base metals, the force majeure
notice remains in effect for our refined metal customers. Force majeure arrangements with these
customers will be lifted in the future and in line with the provisions of our agreements.

Given the collective uncertainty around the start-up of ACP, the ramp-up of mining operations
and the potential impact of COVID-19, Anglo American Platinum retains its current guidance and
will provide an update as appropriate when we have further information and clarity on production.

A safe and successful repair under lockdown

In accordance with lockdown regulations, the repair team was able to continue with repairs
throughout the extended lockdown period in South Africa. All materials required for repairs were
ordered and available on site ahead of the lockdown, and there were no supply chain disruptions
that impacted the ability to complete the repairs. Safety protocols were implemented on site in
line with Government approvals and regulations. A construction work risk review was completed
to determine work phasing, method of execution, key resource identification and increased health
protocols.

The ACP construction repair team was split into two teams that self-isolated for the duration of
the repair work, and COVID-19 specific health protocols were put in place for cleaning, screening
and transport to site. A new shift pattern was introduced that fostered social distancing. Increased
site hygiene measures for sanitisation, together with site safety and health supervision were
implemented to ensure safety and quality of construction. We have reported zero injuries, zero
health issues or positive COVID-19 cases and did not experience any health and safety or
construction issues during the repair and ramp up.

The Company’s ability to continue these essential repairs during lockdown has been critical to
the resumption of the processing pipeline. As a result of the incidents at the ACP, and the need
to shut operations to secure a safe operational environment for employees, the Company could
not process any metal to final product during this period. With mining activity resuming to varying
degrees under the current Level 4 lockdown restrictions, the Company is now able to begin
processing concentrate and releasing metal from the pipeline.

NEWS RELEASE

23 April 2020

Anglo American plc
Production Report for the first quarter ended 31 March 2020

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""Our overwhelming priority is the safety of our
people, their families and our host communities. We have taken extensive measures across our business to
help safeguard against the spread of COVID-19, while also protecting the integrity of our assets to enable a
swift return to normal levels of operation when appropriate. The onset of varying degrees of lockdown or
distancing measures in a number of our operating countries towards the end of the quarter, combined with the
impact of longwall moves in our Metallurgical Coal business, led to 4%(1) lower production compared to the
same period of 2019, despite continued strong iron ore production at Minas-Rio.""

Q1 highlights

-   Minas-Rio in Brazil continued its strong operational performance, with 6.4 million tonnes of premium grade
    iron ore production, reflecting P101 productivity improvements.

-   Continued strong performance from Collahuasi in Chile, with a 16% increase in copper production partly
    offsetting the expected impact of the ongoing water constraints at Los Bronces.

-   Metallurgical coal production decreased by 8% to 3.8 million tonnes due to the timing of longwall moves.

-   The start of a COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa had a limited impact of c.2% on Q1 production; however,
    refined PGMs production was significantly reduced by the announced convertor plant outage.

-   Completed $0.5 billion cash acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc and its UK Woodsmith polyhalite project.

                                                                                  Q1 2020   Q1 2019   % vs. Q1 2019

Rough diamond production was in line with prior year at 7.8 million carats, with limited impact from COVID-19
measures introduced at the end of the quarter in producer countries.

Botswana production decreased by 5% to 5.6 million carats, driven by a 7% decrease at Orapa due to
challenges related to commissioning of new plant infrastructure and maintenance, while production at Jwaneng
reduced by 4% due to planned lower grade.

Namibia production increased by 6% to 0.5 million carats due to planned higher grade at the marine operations.

In South Africa, production increased by 97% to 0.8 million carats as the final ore from the open pit is mined
prior to transition to underground.

Production in Canada decreased by 19% to 0.8 million carats, primarily due to the closure of Victor, which
reached the end of its life in Q2 2019. Gahcho Kue production increased by 4% to 0.8 million carats due to
strong plant performance.

Rough diamond sales totalled 8.9 million carats (8.3 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from two sales
cycles, an increase compared to Q1 2019 (7.5 million carats from two sales cycles; 7.2 million carats on a
consolidated basis)(2) , driven primarily by the fact that the early part of 2019 saw lower demand due to higher
polished stocks. Sales volumes increased year-on-year despite adverse demand impacts in Q1 2020 from
COVID-19, with customers given the option to defer some allocations in the second sales cycle, offset by a shift
in demand towards lower value goods. The third sales cycle of 2020 was not held due to COVID-19-related
restrictions on the movement of people and product, and customers were provided with flexibility to defer all
their allocations from Sight 3 until later in the year.

Full Year Guidance

In response to the impact of COVID-19 on mining operations, wholesale trading activity and consumer traffic in
key consumer markets, production guidance has been revised to 25-27 million carats (previously 32-34 million
carats), subject to continuous review based on the disruptions related to COVID-19 as well as the timing and
scale of the recovery in trading conditions.

(1)   De Beers Group production is on a 100% basis, except for the Gahcho Kue joint venture which is on an attributable 51% basis.
(2)   Consolidated sales volumes exclude De Beers Group's JV partners' 50% proportionate share of sales to entities outside De Beers Group from Diamond Trading Company
      Botswana and the Namibia Diamond Trading Company, which are included in total sales volume (100% basis).

(1)   Copper production shown on a contained metal basis. Reflects copper production from the Copper business unit only (excludes copper production from the Platinum Group
      Metals business unit).

Copper production decreased by 9% to 147,100 tonnes, largely due to an expected reduction at Los Bronces,
driven by the continued drought conditions in central Chile, partially offset by continued strong plant
performance at Collahuasi.

Production from Los Bronces decreased by 25%, to 68,700 tonnes with a 42% reduction in plant throughput 
(7 million tonnes vs 12 million tonnes) due to lower water availability, partially offset by planned higher grades
(1.0% vs 0.8%). Chile´s central zone continues to face unprecedented climate conditions, with this drought
being the longest since records began.

At Collahuasi, attributable production increased by 16% to 66,500 tonnes driven by higher plant throughput 
(14 million tonnes vs 13 million tonnes) and higher copper recovery (89.1% vs 86.3%), due to plant optimisations
and improvements implemented during 2019, as well as planned higher grades (1.20% vs 1.16%).

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance for the year is unchanged at 620,000-670,000, subject to water availability and the extent
of further COVID-19-related disruptions.

Metal in concentrate production

Platinum and palladium production both decreased by 7%, to 440,900 ounces and 303,100 ounces,
respectively.

Own mined platinum production decreased by 7% to 299,400 ounces and palladium production decreased by
7% to 232,900 ounces. This was largely driven by Eskom load-shedding impacting concentrators as well as
initial impact of the 35-day lockdown implemented in South Africa from 27 March in response to COVID-19, in
particular with underground operations going onto care and maintenance.

Purchase of platinum in concentrate decreased by 6% to 141,500 ounces and purchase of palladium in
concentrate decreased by 7% to 70,200 ounces, due to lower purchases from the Kroondal joint venture and
Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine due to force majeure associated with the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP)
shutdown and reduced activity under lockdown measures.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined platinum production decreased by 34% and palladium decreased by 26% on a like-for-like basis(1). This
was largely driven by the shutdown of the ACP for repairs which started on 6 March 2020. Refined platinum
production decreased by 42% to 240,300 ounces and refined palladium production decreased by 33% to
197,100 ounces.

Repair of the ACP is progressing well and is on track to start-up within the expected timeframe, by 25 May.
Platinum sales volumes decreased by 42% to 239,900 ounces and palladium sales volumes decreased by 24%
to 222,500 ounces due to lower refined production in the period.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance (metal in concentrate) is revised to 1.5-1.7 million ounces of platinum (previously 2.0-2.2
million ounces) and 1.0-1.2 million ounces of palladium (previously c.1.4 million ounces), subject to the extent of
further COVID-19-related disruption.

Kumba - Production volumes were broadly unchanged at 9.4 million tonnes.

Sishen's production increased by 2% to 6.6 million tonnes, while production at Kolomela decreased by 7% to
2.9 million tonnes as unfavourable weather conditions resulted in safety-related stoppages and equipment
reliability challenges.

Sales volumes(1) were broadly unchanged at 10.7 million tonnes.

With sales ahead of production, stock was drawn down reducing finished stock levels to 5.6 million tonnes (1)
from 6.6 million tonnes(1) as at 31 December 2019.

Minas-Rio - Production increased by 31% to 6.4 million tonnes, reflecting P101 productivity initiatives that have

39 million tonnes (previously 41.5-42.5 million tonnes), subject to the extent of further COVID-19-related
disruptions.

Minas-Rio production guidance is unchanged at 22-24 million tonnes, subject to the extent of further COVID-19-
related disruptions. The planned one-month production stoppage to carry out routine internal scanning of the

Metallurgical Coal - Export metallurgical coal production decreased by 8% to 3.8 million tonnes primarily due
to a longwall move at Grosvenor. Production at Moranbah increased, despite a roof collapse on 30 January
during a long wall move, because of its extended longwall move in Q1 2019; the operation is on track for restart
at the beginning of June.

The ratio of hard coking coal production to PCI/semi-soft coking coal was 79:21 (Q1 2019: 79:21).

Thermal Coal South Africa - Export thermal coal production reduced by 5% to 4.2 million tonnes as sections
at Goedehoop approach their end of life, as well as a limited initial impact from the COVID-19 lockdown in
South Africa.

Thermal Coal Colombia - Attributable export thermal coal production decreased by 10% to 2.0 million tonnes
as a result of planned lower production in response to weak market conditions and the initial impact of COVID-19.

Full Year Guidance

Production guidance for metallurgical coal is unchanged at 19-21 million tonnes, subject to the extent of further
COVID-19-related disruptions.

Production guidance for export thermal coal based on the current lockdown measures in South Africa and
Colombia has been revised to c.22 million tonnes (previously c.26 million tonnes), subject to the extent of
further COVID-19-related disruptions.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION

Exploration and evaluation expenditure decreased by 12% to $61 million. Exploration expenditure increased by
9% to $25 million driven by increased work in Copper and Metallurgical Coal. Evaluation expenditure decreased
by 22% to $36 million, driven by decreased works in Copper at the Los Bronces Underground Project (Chile)
and Sakatti (Finland), partially offset by increased spend in Metallurgical Coal.

CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND OTHER ITEMS

The Group successfully completed the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc and its Woodsmith polyhalite project in
the UK on 17 March 2020 for cash consideration of $0.5 billion with net debt of $0.2 billion plus fair value
adjustments(1).

NOTES

-  This Production Report for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 is unaudited.
-  Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown in this Production Report.
-  Copper equivalent production shows changes in underlying production volume. It is calculated by expressing
   each product's volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue into copper equivalent units by
   dividing by the copper price (per tonne). Long-term forecast prices are used, in order that period-on-period
   comparisons exclude any impact for movements in price.

NEWS RELEASE

23 April 2020

Anglo American business update in response to COVID-19

Anglo American is today providing an update on the current status of its global operations,
production guidance for 2020, and various actions it is taking across the business given the
uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anglo American Chief Executive, Mark Cutifani, said: ""Ensuring the safety of our people, their
families and our host communities continues to be our priority in all our decision-making as we
respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, more than ever, we continue to play a vital role in
many of our operating countries in providing support where it's most needed.

""Most of our sites around the world are continuing to operate, with our focus on safety reflected
through appropriate health, hygiene and distancing measures. We are taking all necessary steps
to ensure the security and integrity of our assets for the long term, preserving our ability to swiftly
return affected operations to normal levels of production when appropriate.

""We are also implementing a number of cash improvement measures, including operating cost
reductions of at least $0.5 billion and an approximately $1.0 billion reduction to our 2020 capital
expenditure guidance. This further builds on our already robust current liquidity position of $14.5
billion. Anglo American is a resilient and diversified metals and minerals business with a portfolio
of attractive growth options spanning different products and time horizons. We are acting to
protect our optionality through this uncertain period and will continue to act in the best interests
of our shareholders, our employees, customers and our broad range of stakeholders across
society.""

Operational update

Anglo American continues to support the actions taken by governments in its host countries to
curb the spread of COVID-19 and safeguard people's health and wellbeing. We have
implemented appropriate measures across the operations, with a focus on de-densification of the
workforce, rigorous health screening, and isolation where needed.

-   At De Beers, lockdown measures have significantly impacted diamond production in
    southern Africa, manufacturing in India and retail operations in the United States, while
    consumer demand has returned to the Chinese market. Production guidance for 2020 has
    been reduced in line with anticipated demand by c.7 million carats to 25-27 million carats,
    with lower volumes at all operations.

-   At our copper operations in Chile, Los Bronces and Collahuasi, production is at normal levels
    despite the workforce being reduced, by 50% and 40% respectively, to ensure adequate de-
    densification and health screening measures.

-   At Platinum Group Metals, Mogalakwena is operating with a c.50% level of workforce.
    Amandelbult, Mototolo, the joint venture mines and the Mortimer and Waterval smelters are
    on temporary care and maintenance. Polokwane smelter is continuing to operate. Repair of
    the ACP is progressing well and is on track to start-up within the expected timeframe, by 25
    May. We anticipate overall PGM production levels will progressively build, with full production
    expected by year-end.

-   At our Kumba iron ore operations in South Africa, we are operating with a c.50% level of
    workforce, with production expected to progressively increase through May and June. Minas-
    Rio in Brazil is operating at normal levels with appropriate safety protocols in place to ensure
    social distancing. The scheduled one-month production stoppage to carry out routine internal
    scanning of the pipeline has been deferred to the second half of the year (previously
    scheduled for Q2).

-   Metallurgical coal operations in Australia are continuing at normal levels despite revised
    rotations to manage social distancing and the impact of interstate travel restrictions.

-   Export thermal coal operations in South Africa continue with a c.50% level of workforce, with
    production expected to progressively increase through May and June. The Cerrejon thermal
    coal joint venture in Colombia is on temporary care and maintenance.

-   The Barro Alto nickel operation in Brazil is continuing at normal levels with appropriate
    protocols in place to ensure social distancing.

Projects update

Anglo American benefits from an extensive pipeline of high quality growth projects. However, the
prevailing measures to deal with COVID-19 and economic uncertainty are likely to result in delays
to both project approvals and commissioning of certain in-progress projects.

In Peru, where strict national quarantine measures are in place, we withdrew most of our 15,000
strong workforce from our Quellaveco copper project site in mid-March, maintaining only critical
works. In support of the government's continuing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, we
have now decided to suspend non-critical works for up to three months, thereby providing greater
certainty for planning a safe and responsible restart. Given the very good development progress
achieved to date, we still expect first production in 2022, with the project now likely to be at the
upper end of the $5.0-5.3 billion guidance (100% basis), pending final confirmation once the
project remobilises. 2020 capex for the project on a 100% basis is revised to $1.2-1.5 billion
(previously $1.5-1.7 billion), with our 60% share being $0.7-0.9 billion (previously $0.9-1.0 billion).

At the Woodsmith Project in the UK, strict social distancing measures are allowing essential work
to progress, with 2020 capex expected to remain at ~$0.3 billion 10.

2020 production guidance update

The impact of the known disruptions on the previously issued 2020 production guidance is

Capital deferral and cost savings

As a result of numerous structural and performance actions taken in recent years, Anglo
American is a significantly more resilient business and well placed to respond to these
unprecedented circumstances. There is significant uncertainty about the measures required to
control COVID-19 and the human and economic consequences that may eventuate. Anglo
American has therefore planned a range of escalating measures to ensure that the business
withstands additional macro-economic volatility, while safeguarding long-term shareholder and
stakeholder interests.

We have initially identified operating cost savings of at least $0.5 billion in addition to c.$1.5 billion
earnings benefit arising from both weaker producer currencies and oil prices, based on previously
guided sensitivities, at spot rates. Operating cost measures being implemented include
restrictions on discretionary spending, including certain R&D and marketing spend, reductions in
central overheads, demobilisation of non-essential services and deferral of certain exploration
and evaluation activities. Given the level of uncertainty in the operational outlook, the 2020 cost
and volume target of $0.4 billion is under review.

There has been some re-prioritisation of discretionary capital expenditure and this, coupled with
favourable foreign exchange from the stronger US dollar, is expected to result in a c.$1 billion10
reduction to the previously issued capital expenditure guidance 11 for 2020, with new guidance of
$4.0-$4.5 billion, including Woodsmith. Revisions to 2020 capital plans may impact spend in
future years.

Balance sheet and liquidity

Anglo American is in a strong financial position going into this period of global uncertainty
following consistent and disciplined implementation of its balanced capital allocation policy.
Gearing is in line with long-term objectives and the liquidity position is robust. The Group had
liquidity of $14.5 billion at the end of March, with more than $6 billion of cash, including the
proceeds from $1.5 billion of US bond issuances.

There are no financial covenants associated with the Group's bonds or the core $4.5 billion
revolving credit facility, the maturity of which was extended to March 2025 on 10 February 2020
and remains undrawn. Anglo American is committed to maintaining its investment grade credit
ratings. We will continue with our balanced capital allocation strategy, including appropriate
action to protect and enhance our strong liquidity position during this period of heightened
economic uncertainty. The Group's dividend in relation to the second half of 2019 is due to be
paid as planned on 7 May subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 5 May.

Supporting our employees and host communities

We have implemented an extensive health awareness and support programme called ""WeCare"",
specifically to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and full-time contractors, and
also measures in support of our host communities, around the world during the COVID-19
pandemic. As part of this programme, we are helping colleagues better understand how to protect
themselves and others from catching the virus, monitoring their health to pick up early symptoms,
and to manage their health if they test positive for COVID-19. For example, all operational
colleagues are self-monitoring for symptoms, including checks prior to, during and after their shift,
with any symptoms being reported via our 'Engage' app that triggers medical assistance.

communities, please visit: https://www.angloamerican.com/sustainability/covid-19-update.

Forward-looking statements:
This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding
Anglo American's financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend
policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans
and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves
and Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may
cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to
be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo
American's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American
will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and
commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery
rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of
infectious diseases, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to produce
and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit,
the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world,
the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes
in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where
Anglo American operates, conflicts over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk
factors identified in Anglo American's most recent Annual Report. Forward-looking statements
should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be
placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo
American expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable
law, the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Takeover Code""), the UK Listing Rules, the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings
Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss
Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other
applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking
statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is
based. Nothing in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per
share of Anglo American will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.

Notes
(i) Please note that national forms may vary due to specific national legislation (Article 3(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC)
as for instance the applicable thresholds or information regarding capital holdings.

(ii) Full name of the legal entity and further specification of the issuer or underlying issuer, provided it is reliable and
accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity). Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK
issuer.

(iii) Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding
(e.g. expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.

(iv) This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or
exercising voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h)/ Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC;

financial instruments referred to in Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.3.1).

As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total
positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide
for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.

In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to
(h)), the following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned:

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (b)), the natural person or le-
      gal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural
      person or legal entity who is transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (c)), the natural person or le-
      gal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention
      of exercising them, and natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (d)), the natural person or le-
      gal entity who has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached
      to the shares and the natural person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is
      created;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (e)), the controlling natural
      person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under Article 9 (DTR 5.1), un-
      der letters (a) to (d) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d)) or under a combination of any of those sit-
      uations, the controlled undertaking;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (f)), the deposit taker of the
      shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the
      depositor of the shares allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (g)), the natural person or le-
      gal entity that controls the voting rights;

      - in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (h)), the proxy holder, if he
      can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder
      allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies).

(v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should
be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Article 10
of that Directive (DTR5.2) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification
of funds managed by management companies).

(vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took
place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate
event took effect. 

(vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing
shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.

(viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with national law, please note that it
might not be necessary in accordance with national law to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding
is below that threshold.

(ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached ""direct holding"" and voting rights ""indirect hold-
ing"", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns – if there is no com-
bined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.

(x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.
xiIf the financial instrument has such a period – please specify this period – for example once every 3 months starting
from (date).

(xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-
adjusted basis (Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC) (DTR 5.3.3.A).

(xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then
the second option applies.

(xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be
presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary
undertaking discloses the notification as only thus the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In
case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains
have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free
row, A, E, F etc.).

(xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively
held have to be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable
threshold themselves.

(xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

2020 Annual General Meeting

On 9 March 2020, the Company published the notice convening its Annual General Meeting
(AGM) for 2.30pm (UK time) on 5 May 2020. Since then, the UK government has introduced
a number of measures to limit the impact and spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). These
measures include the restriction on all gatherings of more than two people in public, thereby
limiting the ability of shareholders to attend the AGM.

The Board recognises that the AGM is a valuable forum that provides shareholders with an
opportunity to raise questions and comments to the Board. However, the health and safety of
the Company's employees, shareholders and wider stakeholders are of paramount
importance and the Board fully supports the measures being taken by the government. On
this basis, and assuming the continuation of containment and/or distancing measures,
shareholders will not be able to attend the Company’s 2020 AGM in person.

In order to comply with relevant legal requirements, this year’s AGM will be convened with the
minimum necessary quorum of two shareholders. This will be facilitated by the Company.

It is nevertheless important that shareholders cast their votes in respect of the business of the
AGM as early as possible. This can be done by completing a proxy form or submitting proxy
instructions electronically. Shareholders are encouraged to appoint the ""Chairman of the
meeting"" as their proxy to vote on their behalf. Proxy instructions must be received by 2.30pm
(UK time) on Friday, 1 May 2020. Further details on how to submit a proxy form can be found
at www.angloamerican.com/investors/shareholder-information/electronic-communication-
and-proxy-voting

Instead of attending this year’s AGM, shareholders are invited to submit any questions they
may have by email to cosec.admin@angloamerican.com by 2.30pm (UK time) on Friday, 1
May 2020. Responses to questions will be published on our website following the AGM.

Shareholders should continue to monitor the Company's website and announcements for any
updates regarding the AGM.

The Board would like to take this opportunity to thank all shareholders for their support and
understanding in these unprecedented circumstances and wishes them well, particularly
during this time.

Anglo American update on De Beers’ third rough diamond sales cycle of 2020

Anglo American announces that due to the public health restrictions on the movement of people
and product in Botswana, South Africa and India, which prohibit customers from traveling and
prevent the shipment of goods to customers’ international operations, De Beers Group will not
hold its third Sight of 2020.

De Beers Group is enabling Sightholders to defer 100% of their Sight 3 allocations to later in the
year, and will continue to seek innovative ways to meet Sightholders’ rough diamond supply
needs in the coming weeks.

Anglo American updates response to COVID-19

Anglo American is providing an update on how it is responding operationally to the fast-evolving
global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anglo American Chief Executive, Mark Cutifani, said: “Anglo American’s priorities are the safety,
health and wellbeing of our people and all those who interact with our business around the world.
We also have a clear responsibility to protect the integrity of our business and assets so that we
are ready to restart and ramp up any affected operations safely and as quickly as possible once
permitted to do so. This approach will enable us to minimise any interruption of supply to our
customers and be in a position to support what will be a vital economic recovery phase for the
countries in which we operate and the global economy.”

South Africa

Anglo American notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on
23 March in relation to a 21-day nationwide lockdown that took effect at midnight on Thursday
26 March, in order to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.

Anglo American has consulted with the government authorities and industry bodies in South
Africa to determine and agree the appropriate measures to be taken across its operational and
other business activities. Such measures are to protect people’s safety and health, the continuing
provision of essential services to local communities, the security and integrity of the assets, the
supply of essential raw materials to customers, and the ability to return operations to normal
levels of activity as swiftly as possible once the lockdown restrictions are eased, in support of the
country’s broader economic interests.

In line with South African Government requirements, Anglo American is implementing all
appropriate measures across its South African operations, with a focus on de-densification of the
workforce, rigorous health screening, and isolation where needed. The status of operations is
expected to be as follows during the lockdown period:

    •   Kumba Iron Ore:
           o Sishen and Kolomela mines continue to operate with a c.50% level of workforce.
    •   Anglo American Platinum:
           o Mogalakwena mine and the mechanised Mototolo mine continue to operate with
             a reduced workforce and production, subject to further planning, as will the
             associated concentrator and smelter facilities;
           o Repair of the ACP plant continues, as planned;
           o Amandelbult, Modikwa (JV) and Kroondal (JV) underground mines, as well as
             the Mortimer and Waterfall smelters, are being placed onto care and
             maintenance.
    •   De Beers:
           o Venetia mine will operate with a c.75% reduced workforce.
    •   Thermal Coal:
           o Operations continue with a c.50-70% reduced workforce and production;
           o Isibonelo, which supplies Sasol’s fuel production facility, operates with a c.20%
             reduced workforce.
    •   The rail and port logistics infrastructure to support the export of iron ore and coal is
        expected to continue to service the operations during this period.
    •   Supply chain planning is in place and any impact of the 21-day lockdown is being
        monitored and addressed where feasible.

Anglo American will also continue to provide a number of essential services, including security;
mine maintenance; tailings facility safety management; water treatment; community water
supply; increased capacity in Anglo American’s hospitals; accommodation provision; health,
safety and emergency response; and critical head office services.

Mr Cutifani added: “In South Africa, our operations play a vital role in many of our host
communities, including in terms of jobs and the provision of a number of essential community
services, including access to water, energy and accommodation. We are wholly committed to
supporting the country’s effort to combat COVID-19, including continuity of such services, and
will continue to work with government and across the industry to provide all possible support.”

Peru – Quellaveco Project

The Government of Peru has extended its initial 15-day national quarantine period by 13 days to
12 April. As announced on 17 March, Anglo American has temporarily withdrawn the majority of
employees and contractors from its Quellaveco copper project in Peru and construction work is
significantly reduced, with only critical areas of the project continuing as normal, until such time
as workers can return safely.

UK – Woodsmith Project

In line with the British Government’s measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Anglo
American is in the process of pausing most construction and development activity on its
Woodsmith polyhalite project. Appropriate action is being taken to enable safe and swift
resumption of work.

Production from Anglo American’s major operations in other countries has not been impacted
materially to date and we are taking all appropriate preventative measures to reduce the
probability of the virus spreading, including by reducing the density of people on our sites.

Guidance update

Based on the 21-day lockdown period in South Africa and allowing for a safe ramp-up of
operations thereafter, Anglo American would expect a 2020 production volume impact of 2-3mt
at Kumba Iron Ore (based on the c.50% reduction in the workforce) and 1.5-2mt of export thermal
coal. As previously disclosed, the production of refined PGM’s is on hold until 25 May 2020, when
we expect the ACP convertor to come back onstream.

Anglo American will provide any additional guidance on its South African and other operations in
its scheduled 1Q 2020 Production Report on 23 April 2020.

24 March 2020

Anglo American response to South Africa’s COVID-19 measures

Anglo American notes the statement made by the President of the Republic of South Africa on
the evening of Monday 23 March in relation to a 21-day nationwide lockdown, to take effect at
midnight on Thursday 26 March, in order to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa.
Anglo American will review the detailed regulations relating to this action that are being published,
including in relation to exemptions for certain business activities, and will issue a further
statement in due course.

Anglo American’s priorities are the safety, health and wellbeing of our people and all those who
interact with our business around the world. We recognise the critical role that our operations
play in our host operating countries, including in terms of jobs and our local communities. We are
therefore also working together with the Government of South Africa to ensure the continuity of
our business where appropriate in order to minimise any unintended consequences of the
announced lockdown.

NEWS RELEASE

Anglo American secures future of Woodsmith polyhalite project

On 20 January 2020, the boards of Sirius Minerals Plc (Sirius), Anglo American plc (Anglo
American) and Anglo American Projects UK Limited (Bidco) announced that they had reached
agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued
ordinary share capital of Sirius by Bidco (the Acquisition), to be implemented by means of a
Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act (the Scheme).

The Court sanctioned the Scheme on 13 March 2020 and the Scheme became effective this
morning, 17 March 2020. Anglo American, through its wholly owned subsidiary Anglo American
Projects UK Limited, has now completed the Acquisition of Sirius and its Woodsmith Project in
the UK.

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: “Today marks a new chapter for the
Woodsmith Project, the employees of the business and everyone who has an interest in its future.
This is a project with clear potential as a Tier 1 supplier of premium quality, low carbon fertiliser
to help meet food demand for a fast growing global population.

“Anglo American brings greater certainty to the business and the development of the Woodsmith
Project, building upon our long experience in the global fertiliser market covering most of the last
50 years. The project itself offers the prospect of sustained employment and economic stimulus
for North Yorkshire and Teesside for many decades to come and, when the mine is ramped up,
a boost in exports to benefit the wider British economy.

“The team has done a remarkable job, designing the mining operation to have minimal physical
impact on its natural surroundings as well as progressing both its development and the market
for POLY4 to where they are today. We share a vision of working towards a smarter future for
mining – a safer future with a smaller environmental footprint to ensure that we can supply the
essential metals and minerals the world needs, and do so sustainably. The Woodsmith Project
exemplifies this approach.

“We recognise the role the project will continue to play in its local communities and, as promised,
I am pleased to confirm that we are today transferring £1 million into the project’s charitable
foundation. The foundation supports so many good local causes, including education and skills
training, community sports clubs and broader local regeneration. We intend to contribute further
amounts of £1 million on this date for each of the next three years, prior to the foundation
receiving a substantial royalty income when the mine begins production.”

Notes to editors:
The Woodsmith Project is a mine and associated infrastructure that is in development in North
Yorkshire and Teesside, in the northeast of England. It is a potential Tier 1 mining asset, in terms
of scale, resource life, operating cost profile and the nature and quality of its fertiliser product.
The project includes the world’s currently largest known high-grade polyhalite deposit with a
reported Reserve of 290 million tonnes, a grade of 88.8% and a Resource of 2.69 billion tonnes.
The mine infrastructure has been designed to be sympathetic to its natural surroundings and for
the mining and underground transport of the polyhalite to the Materials Handling Facility on
Teesside to cause minimal surface impact.

The Woodsmith Project will produce POLY4, a premium quality, multi-nutrient fertiliser certified
for organic use that contains four of the six key nutrients necessary for plant growth: potassium,
sulphur, magnesium and calcium. It can be used as an attractive low-chloride alternative to (and
for blending with) traditional fertiliser products on a cost-effective basis and is particularly valuable
for major high value crops, such as tea, coffee, beans, potatoes, and many fruits and vegetables.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of
the world’s developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we
use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world – safely, responsibly and
sustainably.
As a responsible miner – of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel – we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we
operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people’s
lives.

Anglo American temporarily slows Quellaveco copper project construction

Anglo American plc (“Anglo American”) announces the temporary withdrawal of the majority of
employees and contractors from its Quellaveco copper project in Peru, following the Government
of Peru’s announcement of a 15-day national quarantine to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Construction work on the project will therefore be significantly slowed, with only critical areas of
the project continuing as normal, until such time as workers can return safely.

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: “The safety and health of everyone must
come first, ever more so at times such as these. We are in the process of safely demobilising
most of the 10,000 strong construction workforce at our Quellaveco copper project, in support of
the Government of Peru’s measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Our development of this
world-class project has progressed ahead of schedule and within our budget and we would
expect to be able to accommodate this slowdown within our market guidance on both timing and
costs at this stage.”

The Quellaveco copper project is expected to begin production in 2022, with an expected capital
cost of $5.0 to 5.3 billion. During the first ten years of full production, Quellaveco is expected to
produce approximately 300,000 tonnes per year at a cash cost of $1.05 per pound of copper.

i Please note that national forms may vary due to specific national legislation (Article 3(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC) as for
instance the applicable thresholds or information regarding capital holdings.

ii Full name of the legal entity and further specification of the issuer or underlying issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate
(e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity). Indicate in the relevant section whether the issuer is a non UK issuer.

iii Other reason for the notification could be voluntary notifications, changes of attribution of the nature of the holding (e.g.
expiring of financial instruments) or acting in concert.

iv This should be the full name of (a) the shareholder; (b) the natural person or legal entity acquiring, disposing of or exercising
voting rights in the cases provided for in DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h)/ Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC; (c) all parties to the
agreement referred to in Article 10 (a) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (a)) or (d) the holder of financial instruments
referred to in Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.3.1).

As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or different total positions
of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the standard form does not provide for a specific method
how to notify cases of acting in concert.

In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h)), the
following list is provided as indication of the persons who should be mentioned:

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (b)), the natural person or legal entity that
acquires the voting rights and is entitled to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is
transferring temporarily for consideration the voting rights;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (c)), the natural person or legal entity
holding the collateral, provided the person or entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and
natural person or legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (d)), the natural person or legal entity who
has a life interest in shares if that person or entity is entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares and the natural
person or legal entity who is disposing of the voting rights when the life interest is created;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (e)), the controlling natural person or legal
entity and, provided it has a notification duty at an individual level under Article 9 (DTR 5.1), under letters (a) to (d) of Article 10
of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (a) to (d)) or under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (f)), the deposit taker of the shares, if he
can exercise the voting rights attached to the shares deposited with him at his discretion, and the depositor of the shares
allowing the deposit taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (g)), the natural person or legal entity that
controls the voting rights;

- in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Article 10 of that Directive (DTR5.2.1 (h)), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the
voting rights at his discretion, and the shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise
the voting rights at his discretion (e.g. management companies).

v Applicable in the cases provided for in Article 10 (b) to (h) of Directive 2004/109/EC (DTR5.2.1 (b) to (h). This should be the
full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to the natural person or legal entity referred to in Article 10 of that
Directive (DTR5.2) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest notifiable threshold
for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with national practices (e.g. identification of funds managed by
management companies).

vi The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or disposal took place or the
other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the date when the corporate event took effect.

vii The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository receipts representing shares, to
which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is suspended.

viii If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with national law, please note that it might not
be necessary in accordance with national law to disclose the extent of the holding, only that the new holding is below that
threshold.

ix In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached ""direct holding"" and voting rights ""indirect holding"", please
split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please
leave the relevant box blank.

x Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares ends.

xi If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 3 months starting from
(date).

xii In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented on a delta-adjusted basis
(Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC) (DTR 5.3.3.A).

xiii If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking then the
second option applies.

xiv The full chain of controlled undertakings starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity has to be
presented also in the cases, in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the subsidiary undertaking
discloses the notification as only thus the markets get always the full picture of the group holdings. In case of multiple chains
through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held the chains have to be presented chain by chain
leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

xv The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively held have to
be presented irrespectively whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

xvi Example: Correction of a previous notification.

Notification of transactions by Directors / PDMRs

The Company announces transactions in its Ordinary Shares by PDMRs.

Vesting of Shares awarded at nil cost under the Company's Bonus Share Plan (""BSP"") and Long Term
Incentive Plan (""LTIP"").

On 4 March 2020, awards made under the BSP and LTIP vested to Directors/PDMRs and shares were
released and sold to cover withholding taxes on 5 March as noted below at P19.429 per share.

In the case of awards granted under the LTIP in 2017, the relevant performance conditions were met
as to 92.47% (further details can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report of the Company's
2019 Integrated Annual Report). The awards are also subject to the vesting cap approved by the
Company's Remuneration Committee in 2017, however, the value of the vesting cap was not reached
on this vesting and therefore no shares lapsed as a result of the cap. The awards therefore vested to
the following Directors/PDMRs, to the extent noted below. The remaining portion of the share awards
did not vest and lapsed on the same date.

Awards granted under the BSP to PDMRs vest in two tranches. The first tranche, equal to two thirds of
the award, vests three years after grant. The remaining third vests as a second tranche five years from
grant. First tranches of the 2017 BSP awards and second tranches of the 2015 BSP awards have vested
as set out below.

All shares were released net of shares sold to cover taxes as indicated below. The net shares released
under all LTIP awards are subject to a further two-year holding period, during which time they may not
be sold or transferred.

Clare Davage
Deputy Company Secretary

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential ingredients in
almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining operations and
undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more
sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of the world's developed
and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we use innovative practices
and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process, move and market our
products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron ore, coal
and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work together with our
business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that those resources
represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we operate, and for society as
a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.

Forward-looking statements:
This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in
this document, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position, business, acquisition and
divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans
and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates),
are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or
industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding
Anglo American's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the
future. Important factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of
global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and
other operational capabilities, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products
profitably, the availability of transportation infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and
operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in
relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes in
taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts
over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in the section of this document titled  Managing
Risk Effectively'. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance
should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this
document. Anglo American expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Takeover Code""), the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the
Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX
Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to
release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in
Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such
statement is based. Certain statistical and other information about Anglo American included in this document is sourced from
publicly available third-party sources. As such, it has not been independently verified and presents the views of those third
parties, though these may not necessarily correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American expressly
disclaims any responsibility for, or liability in respect of, such third party information.

APPENDIX A - PRINCIPAL RISKS

We define a principal risk as a risk or combination of risks that would threaten the business model,
future performance, solvency or liquidity of Anglo American. In addition to these principal risks, we
continue to be exposed to other risks related to currency, inflation, community relations, environment,
litigation and regulatory proceedings, changing social expectations, infrastructure and human
resources. These risks are subject to our normal procedures to identify, implement and oversee
appropriate mitigation actions, supported by internal audit work to provide assurance over the status
of controls or mitigating actions. These principal risks are considered over the next three years as a
minimum, but we recognise that many of them will be relevant for a longer period.

Principal risks 2- 11 on pages 46 - 49

CATASTROPHIC RISKS

We also face certain risks that we deem catastrophic risks. These are very high severity, very low
likelihood events that could result in multiple fatalities or injuries, an unplanned fundamental change
to strategy or the way we operate and have significant financial consequences. We do not consider
likelihood when assessing these risks, as the potential impacts mean these risks must be treated as a
priority. Catastrophic risks are included as principal risks.

For more on catastrophic risks see page 46

RISK APPETITE

We define risk appetite as  the nature and extent of risk Anglo American is willing to accept in relation
to the pursuit of its objectives'. We look at risk appetite from the context of severity of the
consequences should the risk materialise, any relevant internal or external factors influencing the risk,
and the status of management actions to mitigate or control the risk. A scale is used to help determine
the limit of appetite for each risk, recognising that risk appetite will change over time.

If a risk exceeds appetite, it will threaten the achievement of objectives and may require a change to
strategy. Risks that are approaching the limit of the Group's risk appetite may require management
actions to be accelerated or enhanced to ensure the risks remain within appetite levels.

For catastrophic and operational risks, our risk appetite for exceptions or deficiencies in the status of
our controls that have safety implications is very low. Our internal audit programme evaluates these
controls with technical experts at operations and the results of that audit work will determine
the risk appetite evaluation, along with the management response to any issues identified.

Further details on the risk management and internal control systems and the review of their
effectiveness is provided on page 108

APPENDIX C - STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The
directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS
regulation, and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. The directors must not approve
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:

 -       Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 -       Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent
 -       State whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework has been
         followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
         statements
 -       Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
         presume that the Company will continue in business.

In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1 requires that directors:

 -       Properly select and apply accounting policies
 -       Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
         reliable, comparable and understandable information
 -       Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is
         insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
         and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance
 -       Make an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the Group's transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the Group's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
for the year ended 31 December 2019

We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
(a) The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards,
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of Anglo American plc
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole
(b) The strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of Anglo American plc and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face
(c) The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and
understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's
performance, business model and strategy.

Anglo American Platinum announces temporary shutdown of the Anglo Converter Plant
(ACP) and declares force majeure

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released
today to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

Anglo American Platinum announces the temporary shutdown of the entire Anglo Converter Plant
(ACP), part of the chain of processing facilities, and the need to declare force majeure.

The Company's ACP phase A converter plant, at Waterval smelter in Rustenburg, was damaged
following an explosion within the converter on 10 February 2020. Nobody was injured in the
incident and work has started to repair phase A, which is expected to be completed by Q2 2021.

As per normal business procedure, the phase B unit was commissioned to take over from the
phase A plant and was in the process of ramping up to steady state, when water was detected
in the furnace. Notwithstanding extensive testing being conducted to determine the source of the
water, and a number of circuits being isolated, water continued to be observed in the furnace.
This poses a high risk of explosion and the Company has determined that it has no other option
but to temporarily shut down the phase B unit, to ensure the safety of all employees, and avoid
a catastrophic event. It is anticipated that the repair works to fix the phase B unit will take
approximately 80 days.

As a result of the temporary closure of the entire ACP, Anglo American Platinum has had to
declare force majeure to customers, suppliers of third-party purchase of concentrate and
suppliers of tolling material, as we are unable to complete the processing of material during the
converter repair. Production from own mines will continue, and the concentrate from the mines
will continue to be smelted at one of the four smelter complexes. However, production from own
mines, as well as third party material will not be able to be converted to refined production while
the ACP is undergoing repairs.

Initial estimates of the impact on AAP refined production are shown in the guidance below:

Forward-looking statements:
This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding
Anglo American's financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend
policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans
and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves
and Mineral Resources), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo
American's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American
will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and
commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery
rates and other operational capabilities, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the
ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transportation infrastructure,
the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the
availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions
in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities
such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of
regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American's most recent Annual
Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors
and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo
American expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable
law, the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Takeover Code""), the UK Listing Rules, the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings
Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss
Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other
applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking
statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard
thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is
based.

Nothing in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of
Anglo American will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.
Certain statistical and other information about Anglo American included in this announcement is
sourced from publicly available third-party sources. As such, it has not been independently
verified and presents the views of those third parties, though these may not necessarily
correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American expressly disclaims any
responsibility for, or liability in respect of, such third party information.

Notes to editors:

The ACP plant is a key part of Anglo American Platinum's PGM production process, treating
furnace matte from the company's smelters. At the ACP plant, sulphur and iron contained in the
furnace matte from the smelters are converted to sulphur dioxide and slag. The resulting
converter matte is then slow-cooled to concentrate PGMs into a metallic fraction. From the ACP,
material moves to the Magnetic Concentration Plant (MCP), where the converter matte is milled
and the PGM fraction is separated magnetically. The PGM-bearing material then moves from the
MCP to the Precious Metals Refinery (PMR), where the PGMs are separated and purified to yield
platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and gold.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of
the world's developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we
use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we
operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's
lives.

Anglo American welcomes new system for capital flows in South Africa

Anglo American welcomes the announcement made by South Africa's Minister of Finance, Tito
Mboweni, in the Budget Speech on 26 February 2020, in which he announced a number of
measures to facilitate cross-border financial transactions, in support of trade and investment.
The annexures to the Budget Review provide additional detail, including a shift from the current
policy of exchange controls to a risk-based capital flow management system that is in line with
international best practice.

The new system will provide companies in South Africa, including Anglo American, with increased
flexibility to manage cash resources to optimal effect. The adoption of a risk-based capital flow
management system supports South Africa's economic growth and investment goals and is a
further positive step towards building South Africa's attractiveness as a globally competitive
investment destination.

Anglo American Chief Executive, Mark Cutifani, commented: ""We are encouraged by the
announcement from South Africa's Minister of Finance of this new system for capital flows. We
believe in the clear benefits of the government continuing to implement effective policy measures
that are supportive of attracting investment to spur the economy for the benefit of all South
Africans.

""Mining is a critical driver of economic growth, transformation and development across many
communities in South Africa and for the country as a whole. We see considerable opportunity for
South Africa to compete more effectively for global investment in its precious natural resources
which can then help deliver a more prosperous South Africa. Anglo American's commitment to
South Africa stretches back more than 100 years and we will continue to play our role in making
South African mining safer, smarter and globally competitive - as both a leading global mining
company and one of the largest investors in the country.""

Anglo American notes that, as set out in Annexure E to the Budget Review, certain exchange
control conditions previously applicable to it will be aligned to the current foreign direct investment
criteria. In terms of the new system for capital flows that will align South Africa's approach with
international best practice, Anglo American will engage with the South African Reserve Bank and
National Treasury in respect of how it will apply to its business in South Africa.

Notes to editors:

Anglo American's investment commitment in South Africa

Anglo American has committed to investing $6 billion (c.R72 billion) between 2018 and 2022 on
sustaining and extending the lives its mining operations in South Africa.

This commitment includes the more than R30 billion Venetia Underground Project - the largest
single investment in South Africa's diamond industry in decades - the Mogalakwena PGMs
complex, and Kumba's ongoing development of the Sishen and Kolomela mines. Through this
investment commitment, Anglo American is supporting 47,000 jobs at its operations in South
Africa while also stimulating the regional economies of Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga and
the Northern Cape, where many of the company's mining operations are located in South Africa.

In addition to the 47,000 people employed directly by the Company in South Africa, Anglo
American aims to create five jobs outside the mine for each job at the mine by 2030.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company, and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of
the world's developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we
use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we
operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's
lives.

The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and
secondary listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the
Namibia Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Anglo American Platinum announces appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released this
morning to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

The Board of Anglo American Platinum Limited (""Anglo American Platinum"") announces the
appointment of Natascha Viljoen as CEO, with effect from 16 April 2020, following Chris Griffith's
decision to step down after more than seven years to pursue other career opportunities.

Norman Mbazima, Chairman of Anglo American Platinum, said: ""I am delighted to welcome
Natascha Viljoen as CEO of Anglo American Platinum. Natascha is a seasoned senior executive,
bringing 28 years of operational experience from across our mining industry, spanning many
different countries, metals and minerals including, of course, the PGMs. She knows us and our
business well, having worked with our executive team over the last five years in leading the
changes required to transform the performance of - and commercial value from - our processing
operations.""

Ms Viljoen is currently Group Head of Processing for Anglo American, a role she has held since
2014. In that role, she has led a trusted global team that has unlocked value across Anglo
American's processing operations safely and with a long term perspective, recognising their
critical commercial place in the mining value chain.

Prior to joining Anglo American, Natascha was Executive Vice President of Processing at Lonmin
while also leading the company's sustainability, employee health, environmental and stakeholder
relations work at various times. Natascha began her career as an engineer at Iscor and, amongst
other roles, took on leadership positions at AngloGold and was General Manager of BHP's
Klipspruit Colliery before joining Lonmin in 2008.

Under Natascha's leadership, her team has successfully leveraged and accelerated technology
development and deployment to unlock the full potential of mineral endowments through
processing, delivering significant financial value and competitive advantage. She and her team
are recognised for their work in developing Coarse Particle Recovery technology which enables
the separation of metals from rock using a fraction of the energy and water of traditional methods,
while increasing throughput and productivity.

Natascha Viljoen said: ""I feel really excited to take on my new role at Anglo American Platinum
and I am fortunate to inherit a business in such a strong position. Chris Griffith has reshaped our
PGMs portfolio to be fit for the future and I believe we now have an opportunity to re-imagine how
we operate - in our mines and our host communities. It is also our responsibility to build upon
the wide variety of applications for our platinum group metals that already play a critical role in
so many areas of modern life, from clean transport and energy, to health and jewellery, of course.

""Safety is paramount, always, while building a purpose-led high performance culture with
stakeholders front of mind is critical to the future of our business. We will work to ensure that
what we do and the benefits we bring for all our stakeholders are sustainable in every sense.""

Natascha Viljoen will join Anglo American Platinum on 1 April 2020 and the Group Management
Committee of Anglo American plc on 16 April 2020.

Anglo American Preliminary Results 2019

Continuing delivery underpins 9% increase in underlying EBITDA to $10.0 billion

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""We continue building on the fundamental structural
and operational improvements we have embedded across our business. The result is founded on high quality, low
cost, world class assets. We have also benefited from product and market diversification, with strong precious
metals and iron ore prices offsetting weakness in diamonds and coal, generating a 9% increase in underlying
EBITDA to $10.0 billion, a 19% ROCE and a Total Shareholder Return of 31% for the year.

""We continue to invest in high quality, value-adding growth projects across the business, including in copper,
diamonds and metallurgical coal, which will drive our volume, margin and cash flow growth over the medium and
longer term. Combined with our share buyback of $0.8 billion during the second half of the year, net debt at year
end was less than 0.5x EBITDA and we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet through the cycle.

""The safety of our people is always front of mind. It is tragic that we continue to experience serious safety incidents,
in which four of our employees died at managed operations in 2019. And while 2019 was our best safety
performance in our history, our progress strengthens our determination to deliver on our commitment to zero harm.
Across the business, we recorded another all-time low injury frequency rate, representing a 17% improvement
compared to 2018 and a 59% improvement over the last six years.

 ""At the heart of our operational performance is the improving stability and predictability provided by our Operating
Model. We are also starting to see considerable further efficiency and productivity benefits through our P101
programme to deliver additional value from our equipment, our key processes, and our FutureSmart Mining(TM)
approach to technology, digitalisation and sustainability. Compared to 2012, our productivity has more than
doubled and unit costs have decreased by 29% (nominal basis), driving a 12 point increase in Mining EBITDA
margin to 42%.

""Underlying cost and volume benefits were $0.4 billion - adjusted to $0.1 billion on a net basis to reflect external
factors, including the drought in Chile and Eskom power disruptions in South Africa. Since 2012, we have delivered
$4.7 billion of annual underlying EBITDA improvement and have the plans in place to add $3-4 billion of annual
underlying EBITDA improvement by 2022, relative to 2017.

""Consistent delivery of underlying improvements continues to enhance Anglo American's competitive position. We
have transformed our operations and delivered significant financial uplift, while building our broad sustainability
performance. Guided by our Purpose, we are continuing to reposition our business responsibly for a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world.""

Notes

1. Shareholders on the UK register of members with an address in the UK will be paid in Sterling and those with an address in a country in the
   European Union which has adopted the Euro will be paid in Euros. Such shareholders may, however, elect to be paid their dividends in US dollars
   provided the UK Registrars receive such election by Wednesday, 8 April 2020. Shareholders with an address elsewhere will be paid in US dollars
   except those registered on the South African branch register who will be paid in South African rand.
2. Dividend Tax will be withheld from the amount of the gross dividend of R7.03106 per ordinary share paid to South African shareholders at the rate
   of 20% unless a shareholder qualifies for exemption. After the Dividend Tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be R5.62485 per ordinary
   share. Anglo American plc had a total of 1,366,570,089 ordinary shares in issue, including 336,137 treasury shares, as at 18 February 2020. In
   South Africa the dividend will be distributed by Anglo American South Africa Proprietary Limited, a South African company with tax registration
   number 9030010608, or one of its South African subsidiaries, in accordance with the Company's dividend access share arrangements. The dividend
   in South African rand is based on an exchange rate of US$1:R14.9597 taken on Wednesday, 19 February 2020, being the currency conversion
   date.
3. Dematerialisation and rematerialisation of registered share certificates in South Africa will not be effected by CSDPs during the period from the JSE
   ex-dividend date to the record date (both days inclusive).
4. Those shareholders who already participate in the DRIP need not complete a DRIP mandate form for each dividend as such forms provide an
   ongoing authority to participate in the DRIP until cancelled in writing. Shareholders who wish to participate in the DRIP should obtain a mandate
   form from the UK Registrars, the South African Transfer Secretaries or, in the case of those who hold their shares through the STRATE system,

Notes to editors:
Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential ingredients in almost every
aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining operations and undeveloped resources provides
the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing
consumer-driven demands of the world's developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our
business, we use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process, move
and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron ore, coal and nickel -
we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work together with our business partners and diverse
stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and
countries in which we operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.

NEWS RELEASE

17 February 2020

Anglo American Platinum announces that Chris Griffith is to step down as CEO

Anglo American plc notes the announcement by Anglo American Platinum Limited released this
morning to the Johannesburg stock exchange. The text of the announcement is copied below:

The Board of Anglo American Platinum Limited (""Anglo American Platinum"") today announces
that Chris Griffith has informed the Board of his intention to step down as Chief Executive Officer
and as an executive director of the Company after more than seven years. This follows his
decision to pursue other career opportunities. Mr Griffith will step down at the Company's AGM
on 16 April 2020 and his successor, who is expected to be an internal candidate from within the
Anglo American group, will be announced in the near future.

Norman Mbazima, Chairman of Anglo American Platinum, said: ""On behalf of the Board, I would
like to thank Chris for leading Anglo American Platinum during the last seven years. His
exceptional contribution to improving safety and the operational and financial turnaround of the
business has produced excellent results. The focus on innovation and developing diverse
markets for our range of metals, see Anglo American Platinum well positioned to continue
growing from its current position of strength. Chris has notched up many significant achievements
during his 30-year career with Anglo American and we wish him the very best for the future.""

Chris Griffith said: ""I have enjoyed the significant challenge of leading one of the world's great
precious metals businesses over the last seven years. This has been the pinnacle of my long
and fulfilling career with Anglo American - ending it back at Anglo American Platinum, which was
where my career started 30 years ago. We have made tremendous progress at Anglo American
Platinum on many fronts, from safety improvements to successfully completing the significant
restructuring and repositioning of the portfolio of assets, which continue to deliver industry leading
returns. After more than seven years at the helm, and given all that we as a team have achieved,
this is now the natural time for the next generation of leadership to take this business forward
and deliver further value. I would like to thank my executive team, senior management and all
Anglo American Platinum employees for their hard work, dedication and support that has taken
this great Company to where it is today.""

Notes to editors:
Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
greener, more sustainable world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of
the world's developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we
use innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we
operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's
lives.

NEWS RELEASE
23 January 2020

Anglo American plc
Production Report for the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2019

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""We have delivered our full year production targets
across the business. Production is up 4%(1) for the quarter led by the continued successful ramp-up at
Minas-Rio in Brazil. Increased production at Metallurgical Coal in Australia was offset by the drought in Chile
impacting water availability at Los Bronces, as well as the anticipated lower production from De Beers as
Venetia transitions to underground in South Africa and Victor reached the end of its mine life in Canada. As
planned, we received the operating licence for the tailings dam raise at Minas-Rio before the end of 2019.""

Key highlights
-   A 10%(2) increase in platinum and palladium volumes due to higher grades and throughput.

-   Strong performance from Collahuasi as well as productivity improvements at Los Bronces have partially
    mitigated the impact of production losses at Los Bronces due to the continued drought.

-   Continued strong performance from our Bulks business, reflecting the stability of operations under the
    Operating Model and progress in driving P101 levels of equipment performance to industry best practice
    and beyond.

     - Minas-Rio continued its strong operational performance, with 6.2 million tonnes of high grade iron ore
       production in Q4. The tailings dam raise operating licence was received in December 2019.

     - Kumba iron ore production of 11.8 million tonnes reflected improved run-rates following maintenance
       earlier in the year.

     - Metallurgical coal production increased by 11% to 6.3 million tonnes due to the timing of longwall
       moves, as well as improved wash plant throughput and equipment efficiency.

Rough diamond production decreased by 15% to 7.8 million carats, driven by lower production levels in
South Africa and Botswana. While trading conditions have improved since Q3 2019, production was reduced in
response to softer rough diamond demand conditions experienced in the year.

Botswana production decreased by 7% to 5.9 million carats. Orapa production decreased by 29%, caused by a
delay in an infrastructure project and expected lower grades. This was partially offset by a 21% increase at
Jwaneng driven by planned increases in both tonnes treated and grade.

Namibian production decreased by 10% to 0.5 million carats, driven by Debmarine Namibia where production
decreased by 9% to 0.4 million carats due to routine vessel maintenance in Q4 2019.

In South Africa, production decreased by 65% to 0.4 million carats due to lower volumes of ore mined at Venetia
as it approaches the transition from open pit to underground. In addition, Voorspoed production ended in Q4 2018 
when it was placed onto care and maintenance in preparation for closure.

Production in Canada decreased by 3% to 1.0 million carats, primarily due to the closure of Victor, which
reached the end of its life in Q2 2019. Gahcho Kue production increased by 28% to 1.0 million carats due to
strong plant performance.

Rough diamond sales totalled 7.0 million carats (6.6 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from two sales
cycles, which compares with 9.9 million carats of sales (9.3 million carats on a consolidated basis) (2) from three
sales cycles in Q4 2018.

For the full year, rough diamond sales volumes were 8% lower at 30.9 million carats (29.2 million carats on a
consolidated basis)(2) compared with 33.7 million carats (31.7 million carats on a consolidated basis)(2) in 2018.
In 2019, overall demand for rough diamonds was lower as a result of challenges in the midstream, with higher
polished inventories and caution due to macro-economic uncertainty.

The full year consolidated average realised price of $137/ct was lower (2018: $171/ct), due primarily to a higher
proportion of lower value rough diamonds sold in 2019 and a 6% lower rough diamond price index.

2020 Production Guidance
Production guidance for 2020(1) is unchanged at 32-34 million carats, subject to trading conditions. The higher
production anticipates an improvement in trading conditions compared with 2019, and is driven by an expected
increase in production from Venetia.

(1)   De Beers Group production is on a 100% basis, except for the Gahcho Kue joint venture which is on an attributable 51% basis.
(2)   Consolidated sales volumes exclude De Beers Group's JV partners' 50% proportionate share of sales to entities outside 
      De Beers Group from Diamond Trading Company Botswana and the Namibia Diamond Trading Company, which are included in total 
      sales volume (100% basis).

(1)   Copper production shown on a contained metal basis. Reflects copper production from the Copper business unit only 
      (excludes copper production from the Platinum Group Metals business unit).

Copper production decreased by 13% to 158,800 tonnes, largely impacted by a reduction at Los Bronces,
driven by the continued drought conditions in central Chile, partially offset by continued strong plant
performance at Collahuasi.

Production from Los Bronces decreased by 28%, to 71,700 tonnes with a 44% reduction in plant throughput 
(7 million tonnes vs 13 million tonnes) resulting from lower water availability. This was partly offset by strong mine
performance, in particular a step-up in shovel productivity as a result of P101 improvements, and planned
higher grades (0.99% vs. 0.81%). Chile s central zone continues to face unprecedented climate conditions, with
2019 being one of the driest years on record and the driest since the start of the current decade-long drought.

At Collahuasi, attributable production increased by 4% to 72,200 tonnes, another record in copper concentrate
production, with planned lower grades (1.25% vs 1.28%) more than offset by a strong plant performance that
benefited from the ongoing long-term plant improvement plan.

2019 sales volumes were 643,900 tonnes, at an average realised price of 273c/lb ($6,019/t), in line with the average LME price.

Metal in concentrate production

Platinum and palladium production both increased by 10%, to 531,700 ounces and 360,400 ounces, respectively.

Own mined platinum production increased by 18% to 361,900 ounces and palladium production increased by
17% to 275,000 ounces. This was driven by increased production at Mogalakwena due to higher grade and
throughput, and from Amandelbult, due to the ramp-up of the Dishaba lower section, as well as the inclusion of
100% of Mototolo volumes following the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the asset in November 2018. This
was partially offset by the impact of Eskom power outages, which reduced overall own mined volumes by 8,500
platinum ounces and 6,000 palladium ounces.

Purchase of platinum in concentrate decreased by 5% to 169,800 ounces and purchase of palladium in
concentrate decreased by 9% to 85,400 ounces, the result of lower purchases from joint ventures, as Mototolo
became 100% owned in November 2018, as well as lower production from Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine.

Refined production and sales volumes

Refined platinum production(1) decreased by 18% to 629,700 ounces and refined palladium production(1)
decreased by 20% to 396,600 ounces. Excluding the impact of the tolled volumes that were previously
purchased as concentrate, refined platinum production was flat and palladium decreased by 6% as improved
operational performance at the processing facilities was offset by the impact of Eskom power outages. These
power outages in Q4 resulted in an inventory build-up of circa 45,000 platinum ounces and circa 27,000 palladium ounces.

Platinum sales volumes(1) decreased by 14% to 668,300 ounces and palladium sales volumes(1) decreased by
4% to 435,800 ounces due to lower refined production in the period.

The full year price per platinum ounce for the basket of metals sold increased by 27% to $2,819/ounce
compared to 2018 due to 48% and 73% price increases in palladium and rhodium, respectively.

2020 Production Guidance

Production guidance (metal in concentrate) is unchanged at 2.0-2.2 million ounces of platinum and
approximately 1.4 million ounces of palladium, subject to Eskom power performance.

(1)   Does not include tolled volumes.

Kumba - Total production volumes increased by 16% to 11.8 million tonnes, due to higher production at both
Sishen and Kolomela.

Sishen's production increased by 19% to 8.3 million tonnes as a result of improved operational performance in Q4 2019.

Kolomela's production increased by 10% to 3.5 million tonnes, reflecting the ramp-up in production following the
temporary closure of the DMS plant for an infrastructure upgrade in Q1 2019 and its subsequent re-opening, on
schedule, in Q4 2019.

Total sales decreased by 10% to 10.5 million tonnes, driven by a 73% decline in domestic sales to 0.2 million
tonnes due to lower domestic customer off-take with the winding down of the Saldanha Steel plant. Export sales
were 5% lower at 10.2 million tonnes.

Total finished stock increased to 6.6 million tonnes(1) at Q4 2019 from 5.1 million tonnes at Q3 2019, as a result
of lower domestic sales. Rail performance improved significantly in 2019, with port stock levels well set for Q1 2020.

In the fourth quarter, the average lump to fines ratio in the Kumba product was 66:34 (full year: 67:33), while the
Fe content averaged 64.1% (full year: 64.2%).

The full year FOB realised price was $97/tonne, reflecting the reversal, driven by price movements, of gains
from provisionally priced sales that supported the first half realised price of $108/tonne.

Minas-Rio - Production of 6.2 million tonnes was driven by continued strong operational performance, stability
due to higher grade ore from the Step 3 mine area and productivity initiatives.

The construction of the tailings dam raise was completed in August 2019 and approval for the conversion of the
installation licence to an operating licence was granted on 23 December.

The full year FOB realised price was $79/tonne, reflecting the reversal, driven by price movements, of gains
from provisionally priced sales that supported the first half realised price of $92/tonne.

2020 Production Guidance

Kumba production guidance for 2020 is unchanged at 42-43 million tonnes.

Minas-Rio production guidance for 2020 is unchanged at 22-24 Mt, which includes a one-month production
stoppage in Q2 to carry out routine internal scanning of the pipeline.

(1)   Sales volumes and stock differ to Kumba's standalone Q4 results due to sales to other Group companies.

Metallurgical Coal - Export metallurgical coal production increased by 11% to 6.3 million tonnes primarily due
to the timing of longwall moves at Grosvenor and Grasstree, as well as improvements in wash plant throughput
at Moranbah-Grosvenor and equipment productivity at Dawson.

In the fourth quarter, the ratio of hard coking coal production to PCI/semi-soft coking coal was 81:19 (full year 2019: 83:17).

Thermal Coal South Africa - Export thermal coal production was flat at 4.5 million tonnes.
Thermal Coal Colombia - Attributable export thermal coal production decreased 2% to 2.3 million tonnes in
response to weak market conditions.

The full year weighted average realised price for export thermal coal from South Africa and Colombia was
$59/tonne. This was 10% lower than the weighted average quoted FOB price from South Africa and Colombia,
due to lower than benchmark energy content coal from South Africa.

2020 Production Guidance

Metallurgical coal production guidance for 2020 is unchanged at 21-23 million tonnes. This reflects the sale of a 12% interest in the Grosvenor mine 
that is expected to complete during the year, equalising the ownership across the Moranbah-Grosvenor integrated operations.

Thermal coal production guidance for 2020 is unchanged at circa 26 million tonnes.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION

Exploration and evaluation expenditure increased by 15% to $92 million. Exploration expenditure increased by
52% to $44 million driven by increased drilling activities in Copper, PGMs and Kumba Iron Ore. Evaluation
expenditure decreased by 4% to $49 million largely due to decreased works in Copper, partially offset by
increased spend in Metallurgical Coal, Thermal Coal and De Beers.

CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND OTHER ITEMS

During the quarter, charges recognised within EBITDA relating to rehabilitation provisions are currently
estimated to be $0.1 billion at De Beers and $0.1 billion at Copper.

NOTES
-    This Production Report for the quarter ended 31 December 2019 is unaudited.
-    Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown in this Production Report.
-    Copper equivalent production shows changes in underlying production volume. It is calculated by expressing
     each product's volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue into copper equivalent units by
     dividing by the copper price (per tonne). Long-term forecast prices are used, in order that period-on-period
     comparisons exclude any impact for movements in price.
-    Please refer below for information on forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements:

This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts
included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position,
business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future
operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production
forecasts and Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be materially different
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American's present and
future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future. Important
factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from
those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period,
levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development
capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, the availability of mining and processing
equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transportation
infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the
availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant
areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and
changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo
American operates, conflicts over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in
Anglo American's most recent Annual Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in
light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American expressly
disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers (the ""Takeover Code""), the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial
Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the
SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other
applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained
herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events,
conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Nothing in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American
will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share. Certain statistical and other
information about Anglo American included in this announcement is sourced from publicly available third-party
sources. As such, it has not been independently verified and presents the views of those third parties, though
these may not necessarily correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American expressly

                        ANGLO AMERICAN PROJECTS UK LIMITED

                     (a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American plc)

Summary
-    The boards of Anglo American plc (""Anglo American""), Anglo American Projects UK Limited
     (""Bidco"") and Sirius Minerals Plc (""Sirius"") are pleased to announce that they have reached
     agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which Bidco shall
     acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sirius (the ""Acquisition""). The
     Acquisition is intended to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of
     the Companies Act.

-    Under the terms of the Acquisition, Sirius Shareholders shall be entitled to receive:

                      for each Sirius Share                   5.50 pence in cash

-    The Offer Price represents a premium of approximately:

     -      34.1 per cent. to the Closing Price of 4.10 pence per Sirius Share on 7 January 2020
            (being the last Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period);
     -      46.5 per cent. to the volume-weighted average price of 3.75 pence per Sirius Share
            since Sirius' 17 September 2019 strategic review announcement to 7 January 2020
            (being the last Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period);
     -      53.4 per cent. to the one-month volume-weighted average price of 3.59 pence per
            Sirius Share to 7 January 2020 (being the last Business Day prior to the
            commencement of the Offer Period); and
     -      61.7 per cent. to the three-month volume-weighted average price of 3.40 pence per
            Sirius Share to 7 January 2020 (being the last Business Day prior to the
            commencement of the Offer Period).

-   The Acquisition values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sirius at
    approximately P404.9 million.

-   If, on or after the date of this announcement and on or prior to the Effective Date, any dividend,
    distribution or other return of value is declared, made or paid by Sirius on the Sirius Shares,
    the Offer Price shall be reduced correspondingly. In such circumstances, Sirius Shareholders
    would be entitled to retain any such dividend, distribution or other return of value declared,
    made or paid.

-   In September 2019, Sirius announced that it was undertaking a strategic review in order to
    assess the development plan for its North Yorkshire polyhalite project (the ""Project"") and an
    appropriate financing structure to provide relevant funding. Sirius also announced that the
    strategic review would include a broader process to seek a major strategic partner in the
    Project. In November 2019, Sirius provided an update on the progress of this strategic review,
    including a revised two-stage development plan.

-   Anglo American identified the Project as being of potential interest some time ago, given the
    quality of the underlying asset in terms of scale, resource life, operating cost profile and the
    nature and quality of its product. The Project has the potential to fit well with Anglo American's
    established strategy of focusing on world-class assets, particularly in the context of Anglo
    American's portfolio trajectory towards later cycle products that support a fast-growing global
    population and a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world. The key elements underlying the
    rationale include:

          -     Asset quality: Anglo American believes that the Project has the potential to become
                a world-class, low-cost and long-life asset. Sirius has progressed the development
                of the Project to an advanced stage, with construction now under way for over two
                years. Sirius has indicated that this is currently the world's largest known high-grade
                polyhalite deposit with a JORC Reserve of 290 million tonnes, with a grade of
                88.8%, and a Resource of 2.69 billion tonnes. The Resource indicated by Sirius has
                the scale, thickness and quality to be mined efficiently through a relatively simple,
                low-energy, non-chemical production process. Sirius has indicated that the Project
                could operate at an EBITDA margin potentially well in excess of 50% leaving the
                Project well positioned for strong through-the-cycle profitability with an anticipated
                long asset life.

          -     Development pathway: At this stage, the Project requires a significant amount of
                further financing to develop and commission the operation that has proven
                challenging for Sirius to procure on an economic basis. Anglo American, as one of
                the world's leading mining companies, has the resources and capabilities to help
                build on the achievements of the Sirius team. Anglo American remains committed
                to its disciplined capital allocation framework. In the first two years after successful
                completion of the Acquisition, development work on the Project is expected to be
                broadly in line with Sirius' revised development plan although Anglo American
                intends to update the development timeline, optimise mine design and ensure
                appropriate integration with its own operating standards and practices. During this
                period and subject to the update, development work of approximately US$300
                million per annum is expected. Anglo American believes that there is the potential
                for long-term benefits from Anglo American's technical expertise in both the
                development and operational phases, as well as from Anglo American's recognised
                Operating Model to drive safety and productivity to world-leading standards.
                Integration into Anglo American's global marketing network would provide full mine-
                to-market capabilities and build on Anglo American's institutional experience in the
                world's major fertiliser markets.

            -   Premium product: Sirius' polyhalite product, POLY4, is a multi-nutrient fertiliser
                certified for organic use and has the potential to generate demand at a competitive
                cost that supports a strong margin. POLY4 is an attractive low-chloride alternative
                to, and for blending with, traditional fertiliser products on a cost-effective basis. It
                includes four of the six key nutrients that plants need to grow - potassium, sulphur,
                magnesium and calcium. The use of fertilisers is one of the most effective ways to
                improve agricultural yields and therefore help to address the anticipated future
                imbalance between food, feed and biofuel demand and supply caused by a fast-
                growing global population and limited additional land availability for agricultural use.

Recommendation
-    The Sirius Directors, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard as to
     the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and
     reasonable. In providing their advice to the Sirius Directors, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and
     Lazard have taken into account the commercial assessments of the Sirius Directors. In
     addition, the Sirius Directors consider the terms of the Acquisition to be in the best interests
     of Sirius Shareholders as a whole.

-    Accordingly, the Sirius Directors intend to recommend unanimously that Sirius Shareholders
     vote in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the
     General Meeting as the Sirius Directors who hold Sirius Shares have irrevocably undertaken
     to do or procure to be done in respect of their own beneficial holdings, amounting, in
     aggregate, to 172,462,637 Sirius Shares representing, in aggregate, approximately 2.46 per
     cent. of the issued share capital of Sirius as at 16 January 2020 (being the latest practicable
     date prior to this announcement).

Timetable
-   It is intended that the Acquisition will be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement of
    Sirius under Part 26 of the Companies Act, further details of which are contained in the full
    text of this announcement (and will be included in the Scheme Document). Anglo American
    and Bidco reserve the right to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer, subject
    to the Panel's consent and the terms of the Co-operation Agreement.

-   The Acquisition shall be put to Sirius Shareholders at the Court Meeting and at the General
    Meeting. In order to become Effective, the Scheme must be approved by a majority in number
    of the Sirius Shareholders voting at the Court Meeting, either in person or by proxy,
    representing at least 75 per cent. in value of the Sirius Shares voted. In addition, a special
    resolution implementing the Scheme must be passed by Sirius Shareholders representing at
    least 75 per cent. of votes cast at the General Meeting.

-   The Acquisition is subject to further conditions and terms set out in Appendix I to this
    announcement, including the receipt of the relevant clearances from the competition and
    regulatory authorities.

-   Bidco and Sirius intend to work together (to the extent legally permissible) to engage
    constructively with relevant stakeholders.

-   It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing further information about the Acquisition
    and notices of the Court Meeting and the General Meeting, shall be sent to Sirius
    Shareholders within 28 days of this announcement and it is expected that the Scheme will
    become Effective by 31 March 2020.

Commenting on the Acquisition, Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said:

""Anglo American's recommended offer provides greater certainty for Sirius' Shareholders,
employees and wider stakeholders, while bringing the prospects for the development of this potential
Tier 1 Project closer to reality. We intend to bring Anglo American's financial, technical and product
marketing resources and capabilities to the development of the Project, which of course would be
expected to unlock a significant and sustained associated employment and economic stimulus for
the local area.

""The addition of the Project supports our ongoing transition towards supplying those essential metals
and minerals that will meet the world's evolving needs - in terms of the undoubted need for cleaner
energy and transport, and providing infrastructure and food for the world's fast-growing and
urbanising population. Our development of the Project in the years ahead reinforces the quality of
our portfolio and our long-term growth profile, further enhancing our ability to deliver leading returns
on a sustainable basis and enduring value for all stakeholders.""

Commenting on the Acquisition, Russell Scrimshaw, Chairman of Sirius, said:

""Four months ago, following the setbacks in the bond market, we took the difficult decision to slow
the pace of development of our project and initiate a strategic review to reassess how best to unlock
the long term value for our Shareholders, the community, the UK, and our customers all around the
world.

""The scope of the strategic review was to consider and incorporate optimisations to the Project
development plan and to explore alternative funding solutions, including looking for a strategic
partner to acquire a minority interest in the Project to provide those funds and support the senior
debt financing required to complete the Project.

""We were successful in reducing the initial funding needs of our Project to map out a way to develop
the Project in a way that better aligned risk to capital providers but, despite an extensive global
search for a strategic investor, we have to date not received a firm proposal for a partial Project
stake. The only viable proposal was received from Anglo American in early January, who were only
interested in pursuing a 100% control transaction.

""Alternative financing solutions have also been pursued in parallel to the strategic partner process,
which resulted initially in a non-binding proposal being received in December 2019 and subsequently
a revised proposal being received on 9 January 2020. However, in the opinion of the Sirius Board
and its advisers, the terms of the proposal received and the conditions attached are not acceptable
in their current form. It is highly unlikely that acceptable revisions to this financing proposal can be
delivered and implemented by the end of March 2020.

""We acknowledge that to many Shareholders our decision as a board to recommend this offer will
have come as a shock. Your board deeply regrets that we could not deliver the complete stage two
financing in 2019 despite a very broad and thorough process. Going into the strategic review the
Sirius Board's strong preference was a solution that allowed current Shareholders to participate as
fully as possible in the future development of the Project. Following the strategic review process it
is clear that no such options are currently available to us and in that context Anglo American's offer
is the only feasible option.

""We also recognise the returns that this offer would represent are not what either our shareholders
or the Sirius Board had previously hoped for. We regret that we are not able to deliver on our long-
term goal of Sirius being able to deliver the Project into production, although we assure all
stakeholders that the team has worked tirelessly and diligently over the last nine years to try and
achieve that. However, given the current cash constraints of Sirius, and lack of realistic and
deliverable alternative financing and development options, we believe this to be a fair approach from
Anglo American, a company committed to approaching the Project in the right way, and with the
resources to complete the job.

""We now face a stark choice. If the Acquisition is not approved by Shareholders and does not
complete there is a high probability that the business could be placed into administration or
liquidation within weeks thereafter. This outcome would most likely result in Shareholders losing all
of their investment, as well as put the future of the entire Project, and its associated benefits for the
local area and the UK, at risk.

""This is the context in which your board must assess the offer for your company and, having given
due consideration, your board believes the Acquisition to be in the best interests of Sirius and all of
its stakeholders, providing Shareholders with some financial return.""

1   Introduction
    The boards of Anglo American plc (""Anglo American""), Anglo American Projects UK Limited
    (""Bidco"") and Sirius Minerals Plc (""Sirius"") are pleased to announce that they have reached
    agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which Bidco shall
    acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sirius (the ""Acquisition""). The
    Acquisition is intended to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of
    the Companies Act.

2   The Acquisition
    Under the terms of the Acquisition, which shall be subject to the Conditions and further terms
    set out in Appendix I to this announcement and to be set out in the Scheme Document, Sirius
    Shareholders shall be entitled to receive:

                 for each Sirius Share                   5.50 pence in cash

    The Acquisition values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sirius at
    approximately P404.9 million and represents a premium of approximately:

    -      34.1 per cent. to the Closing Price of 4.10 pence per Sirius Share on 7 January 2020
           (being the last Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period);

    -      46.5 per cent. to the volume-weighted average price of 3.75 pence per Sirius Share
           since Sirius' 17 September 2019 strategic review announcement to 7 January 2020
           (being the last Business Day prior to the commencement of the Offer Period);

    -      53.4 per cent. to the one-month volume-weighted average price of 3.59 pence per
           Sirius Share to 7 January 2020 (being the last Business Day prior to the
           commencement of the Offer Period); and

    -      61.7 per cent. to the three-month volume-weighted average price of 3.40 pence per
           Sirius Share to 7 January 2020 (being the last Business Day prior to the
           commencement of the Offer Period).
    If, on or after the date of this announcement and on or prior to the Effective Date, any dividend,
    distribution or other return of value is declared, made or paid by Sirius on the Sirius Shares,
    the Offer Price shall be reduced correspondingly. In such circumstances, Sirius Shareholders
    would be entitled to retain any such dividend, distribution or other return of value declared,
    made or paid.

    It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing further information about the Acquisition
    and notices of the Court Meeting and the General Meeting, shall be sent to Sirius
    Shareholders within 28 days of this announcement and it is expected that the Scheme will
    become Effective by 31 March 2020.

3   Background to and reasons for the Acquisition
    In September 2019, Sirius announced that it was undertaking a strategic review in order to
    assess the development plan for its North Yorkshire polyhalite project (the ""Project"") and an
    appropriate financing structure to provide relevant funding. Sirius also announced that the
    strategic review would include a broader process to seek a major strategic partner in the
    Project. In November 2019, Sirius provided an update on the progress of this strategic review,
    including a revised two-stage development plan.

    The Project, once developed, is expected to produce a premium fertiliser product that has the
    potential to generate demand both on a standalone basis and when blended with existing
    products at a competitive cost that would support attractive margins.

    Anglo American is a leading global mining company with a world-class portfolio of mining and
    mineral processing operations and undeveloped resources, combined with a worldwide
    marketing network through which it sells its products to customers. Anglo American has a
    clear, asset-led strategy and the quality, long life and growth potential of those mineral assets
    are the foundation of the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of its business.

    Anglo American identified the Project as being of potential interest some time ago, given the
    quality of the underlying asset in terms of scale, resource life, operating cost profile and the
    nature and quality of its product. The Project has the potential to fit well with Anglo American's
    established strategy of focusing on world-class assets, particularly in the context of Anglo
    American's portfolio trajectory towards later cycle products that support a fast-growing global
    population and a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world.

    Anglo American believes that the offer provides certainty to Sirius Shareholders, employees
    and wider stakeholders, whilst Anglo American brings financial, technical and marketing
    resources and capabilities to progress the Project over time, with the potential for associated
    employment and economic benefits for the local area. Anglo American remains committed to
    its disciplined capital allocation framework. In the first two years after successful completion
    of the Acquisition, development work on the Project is expected to be broadly in line with
    Sirius' revised development plan although Anglo American intends to update the development
    timeline, optimise mine design and ensure appropriate integration with its own operating
    standards and practices. As part of that process, Anglo American will review the residual
    capital for the Project under its ownership. Sirius currently expects incremental capital of
    approximately US$3.3 billion in order to reach a production level of 10 mtpa and assuming a
    P90 contingency. During these first two years and subject to the update, development work
    of approximately US$300 million per annum is expected. In line with its capital allocation
    framework Anglo American will also keep potential syndication of the Project under review.

    Within Anglo American's portfolio, the Project is expected to benefit from Anglo American's
    technical expertise in both the development and operational phases, as well as from Anglo
    American's recognised Operating Model to drive safety and productivity to world-leading
    standards. Integration into Anglo American's marketing network provides further potential
    through full mine-to-market capabilities and institutional experience in the world's major
    fertiliser markets.

    Anglo American notes the following key attributes of the Project from its initial assessment:

    Anglo American believes that the Project has the potential to become a world-class, low-cost
    and long-life asset. Sirius has progressed the development of the Project to an advanced
    stage, with construction now under way for over two years. Sirius has indicated that this is
    currently the world's largest known high-grade polyhalite deposit with a JORC Reserve of 290
    million tonnes, with a grade of 88.8% and a Resource of 2.69 billion tonnes. The Resource
    indicated by Sirius has the scale, thickness and quality to be mined efficiently through a
    relatively simple, low-energy, non-chemical production process. Anglo American expects that
    this could result in total unit costs of US$40-50 per tonne at an initial level of production of 10
    mtpa. Sirius has indicated that the Project could operate at an EBITDA margin potentially well
    in excess of 50%, leaving the Project well positioned for strong through-the-cycle profitability
    with an anticipated long asset life.

    Development pathway

    As at 30 September 2019, US$1.1 billion has been invested in the development of the Project,
    with construction supported by the appointment of well-proven contractors including DMC
    Mining Services Ltd, Strabag AG, Worley Parsons Ltd and P. J. Carey (Contractors) Limited.

    All material development, operational and export approvals are in place and access rights
    secured for the current development plan including the sinking of an operation and a service
    shaft, the construction of the proposed mineral transport system (""MTS"") and the material
    handling facility (""MHF"") as well as the refurbishment of the port handling facility. The MTS
    will transport product 37km underground, directly from the mine to the MHF. This will have
    direct access to dedicated, deep-water harbour facilities.

    Prior to completion of the Acquisition, Sirius intends to provide Anglo American and Bidco with
    information relating to its ongoing cash balance and cash flow requirements in respect of the
    Offer Period, provided that Anglo American and Bidco agree that such information shall not
    be used as the basis for invoking any Condition to the Acquisition. Anglo American, Bidco and
    Sirius intend to work with each other (to the extent legally permissible) to ensure that the
    business continues to address the financial challenges it faces in the long-term best interests
    of Sirius and its stakeholders.

    Premium product

    Global fertiliser demand is driven by factors including food, feed and fuel demand, which are
    in turn driven by population growth, diet, arable land per capita and biofuel demand. The use
    of fertilisers is one of the most effective ways to improve agricultural yields and therefore help
    to address the anticipated future imbalance between food, feed and biofuel demand and
    supply. Fertilisers are therefore likely to have a critical role to play in a sustainable future.

    Sirius' polyhalite product, POLY4, is a multi-nutrient fertiliser certified for organic use and has
    the potential to generate demand at a competitive cost that supports a strong margin. POLY4
    is an attractive low-chloride alternative to, and for blending with, traditional fertiliser products
    on a cost-effective basis. It includes four of the six key macro-nutrients necessary for plant
    growth, being potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium, and has been certified for organic
    use.

    Over a period of 7 years, a total of 492 trials across 54 different crops in 31 different countries
    have been undertaken by Sirius to support discussions with customers on the technical and
    commercial applications of POLY4. These have shown that polyhalite can improve crop yield,
    quality and taste. Polyhalite can also improve plant resistance to drought, frost, insects and
    diseases. Trials are ongoing and will continue to take place during the review phase.

    POLY4 will be positioned as a premium product as a result of its multi-nutrient, lower-chloride
    composition. POLY4 and Sulphate of Potash have significantly lower chloride content (less
    than five per cent.) than the most commonly used potash fertilizer, Muriate of Potash
    (approximately 40 per cent.). This is important because many of the world's major crops, such
    as tea, coffee, beans, potatoes, and many fruits and vegetables, are particularly sensitive to
    chloride. Sirius has also identified that POLY4 generates significantly less CO2 per tonne
    relative to both Sulphate of Potash and Muriate of Potash (less than, approximately, 93% and
    85% respectively).

    As a result of the significant benefits and potential for POLY4, Sirius has been able to enter
    into a number of customer offtake agreements with well-established counterparties such as
    Archer Daniels Midland Company, BayWa AG, Cibrafertil Companhia Brasileira de
    Fertilizantes, Indian Farmers Fertilisers Cooperative Ltd, Wilmar Group and Qatar Chemical
    and Petrochemical Marketing and Distribution Company Q.p.J.S.C. A large proportion of
    these agreements have specific price levels recognising the value from key nutrients and
    have been set up on a take-or-pay basis. In total, these offtake arrangements accommodate
    production in excess of 10 mtpa. Based on January 2019 prices, the indicative weighted
    average FOB price for POLY4 would be approximately US$140 per tonne under the offtake
    agreements as outlined in Sirius' May 2019 prospectus. This figure is not a forecast of future
    pricing and future pricing could be materially different.

    Investing in the United Kingdom

    The Project is located in North Yorkshire in the United Kingdom and offers the potential for
    significant investment and sustained job creation in the region, both directly and indirectly.
    Key stakeholders, including the North York Moors National Parks Authority, Scarborough
    Borough Council and a number of local landowners continue to express their support for its
    development.

    As a sign of its intent to support the sustainable development of the Project's host
    communities, Anglo American intends to make a voluntary contribution of P4 million to the
    Sirius Minerals Foundation, with P1 million to be paid on completion of the Acquisition and a
    further P1 million to be paid on the anniversary of completion of the Acquisition for the next
    three years.

4   Recommendation
    The Sirius Directors, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard as to
    the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and
    reasonable. In providing their advice to Sirius Directors, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard
    have taken into account the commercial assessments of the Sirius Directors. In addition, the
    Sirius Directors consider the terms of the Acquisition to be in the best interests of Sirius
    Shareholders as a whole.

    Accordingly, the Sirius Directors intend to recommend unanimously that Sirius Shareholders
    vote in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the
    General Meeting as the Sirius Directors who hold Sirius Shares have irrevocably undertaken
    to do or procure to be done in respect of their own beneficial holdings, amounting, in
    aggregate, to 172,462,637 Sirius Shares, representing, in aggregate, approximately 2.46 per
    cent. of the issued share capital of Sirius as at 16 January 2020 (being the latest practicable
    date prior to announcement).

    Further details of these irrevocable undertakings (including the circumstances in which they
    shall fall away) are set out in Appendix III to this announcement.

5   Background to and reasons for the recommendation
    On 17 September 2019 Sirius announced that, as a result of market conditions impacting its
    ability to deliver its Stage 2 Financing, it would be slowing the pace of development on its
    North Yorkshire polyhalite project and undertaking a strategic review over a period of six
    months. The purpose of the strategic review was to consider and incorporate optimisations to
    the project development plan and to explore alternative funding solutions, including
    conducting a process with the aim of identifying and securing a strategic investor in the
    project, in order to reassess the best way to unlock the value of the project for Sirius
    Shareholders, the community, the UK, and Sirius' customers all around the world. Sirius
    believed that the compelling economics of the Project provided a strong basis for a revised
    funding plan, but that it would require time to bring together components of such a plan and
    to assess investor appetite for a revised funding plan. The strategic review also recognised
    the difficult market conditions in the project finance market for single asset companies with a
    greenfield mining project and took into account the feedback received from prospective senior
    debt providers (including during Stage 2 Financing) around the risks associated with
    construction. Sirius had identified strategic partners as a way to bring extra capital into the
    Project to strengthen the credit case, as well as to potentially provide extra support during
    construction.

    As at 31 August 2019, Sirius had approximately P180 million of unrestricted cash. That
    amount did not provide sufficient liquidity for Sirius to continue the development of the project
    in line with its original development schedule for any significant period of time. Therefore, the
    Sirius Board determined that the scope of development works would be scaled down to
    provide time to conduct the strategic review of the project development and to explore various
    funding options. The reduced pace of development focused on maintaining key areas of the
    Project to preserve the most value for the Project.

    During the preliminary phase of the strategic review, Sirius assessed the development options
    available to significantly de-risk the proposition for any future senior debt providers. In the
    debt raising processes conducted by Sirius over the last three years, one common aspect
    identified by prospective credit providers had been the perceived risk associated with deep
    shaft construction. On 11 November 2019, Sirius announced an update to the strategic review
    which had identified a two-stage development plan to enable Sirius to achieve the key de-
    risking milestone of first polyhalite, when the service shaft reaches the polyhalite ore body,
    with an upfront capital requirement of ~US$600 million (in addition to existing cash resources)
    for this initial scope. The deferred scope of additional works required to reach an installed and
    ramped up production capacity of 10 mtpa contemplated up to US$2.5 billion of further capital
    expenditure thereafter. At the same time, Sirius announced that it was seeking to have the
    initial scope funded from the proceeds of either the strategic investor process or through a
    structured debt financing package, with either potentially incorporating the issue of new equity
    or an equity-like component to the financing package. Sirius confirmed that the strategic
    partner and debt financing processes were underway with the aim of securing ~US$600
    million of initial scope funding, with various parties engaged and assessing information.

    Sirius and its advisers have undertaken an extensive global engagement process, covering
    mining and fertilizer companies, broader natural resource and industrial companies, financial
    sponsors, sovereign wealth funds and family offices, as well as providers of structured finance
    and mezzanine investors. Sirius has facilitated access to project information, conducted site
    visits and management presentations, supported due diligence requirements and held
    discussions with parties interested in the Project. Sirius has also evaluated capital markets
    financing options including institutional equity and retail equity investors, senior mezzanine
    and junior debt and convertible debt. The Sirius Board has carefully and regularly reviewed
    the progress of the revised funding plan. It has monitored the status of all parties involved in
    the strategic investor and debt financing processes and has evaluated discussions and
    proposals received against the objectives of the strategic review and the Sirius Group's
    remaining liquidity position.

    As at 31 December 2019, Sirius had approximately P59.9 million of unrestricted cash, which
    was broadly in line with the expected capital spend when the strategic review was announced
    on 17 September 2019. Unless Sirius is able to secure additional funding or a merger or
    acquisition transaction involving Sirius by the end of March 2020 or soon thereafter, the Sirius
    Board would be required to place Sirius into administration or liquidation, which could result
    in Shareholders losing all of their investment in Sirius.

    In conjunction with this review, Anglo American actively explored an interest in Sirius during
    Q4 2019. On 6 January 2020 the Sirius Board received a non-binding indicative proposal from
    Anglo American expressing an interest in acquiring Sirius. On 8 January 2020, Sirius
    announced that it was in advanced discussions with Anglo American regarding a possible all-
    cash offer of 5.50 pence per Sirius Share for the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital
    of Sirius. Following receipt of the Anglo American proposal, the Sirius Board carefully
    assessed the merits of the proposal against the potential alternative options from other parties
    involved in the ongoing strategic investor and debt financing processes and also in light of the
    Sirius Group's current and expected liquidity position.

    The most advanced alternative proposal was a potential debt financing proposal from a
    consortium of financial investors. In December 2019, Sirius received a non-binding term sheet
    from the consortium to form the basis of a US$680 million funding package to cover the initial
    scope of work. On 9 January 2020, Sirius received a revised non-binding term sheet from the
    consortium. The Sirius Board reviewed the proposed terms and conditions, together with its
    advisers, and concluded that the consortium's conditions and the time it would take to meet
    such conditions were such that there is a very material risk that the overall funding package
    would not be implementable by the end of March 2020. Based on the backdrop of the search
    for a standalone funding solution undertaken over the last 4 months and the extensive
    discussions held during that timeframe, the Sirius Board believes that, at this time, there is
    not likely to be an alternative to the Acquisition other than administration or liquidation.

    In this context, the Sirius Directors view the Acquisition as the only viable way forward for
    Sirius. It provides certainty of value in cash to Sirius Shareholders (as against potentially
    losing all of their investment) and, as a result of the support of the Project by Anglo American,
    provides greater certainty of outcome for Sirius' creditors. In addition, it safeguards the Project
    by placing it into a group with the financial, technical and marketing resources and capabilities
    to progress it over time; it protects the employees, and allows the community, region and the
    UK to continue to benefit from the Project.

    The Sirius Directors, who have been so advised by J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard as to
    the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and
    reasonable. J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard are providing independent financial advice to
    the Sirius Board for the purposes of Rule 3 of the Takeover Code. In providing advice to the
    Sirius Board, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Lazard have taken into account the commercial
    assessments of the Sirius Board.

    The Sirius Directors consider the terms of the Acquisition to be in the best interests of Sirius
    Shareholders as a whole. The Sirius Directors therefore unanimously recommend that Sirius
    Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Special Resolution
    to be proposed at the Sirius General Meeting.

    The Acquisition will mark a continuation of Anglo American's long experience in the fertiliser
    market over much of the last 50 years, having owned and operated assets both in the U.K
    and more recently in Brazil until 2016 when it ceased to have any interests in the fertiliser
    market.

    Bidco

    Bidco is a newly incorporated indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American, and is a
    private limited company incorporated in England and Wales.

    Bidco has not traded since incorporation, nor has it entered into any obligations, other than in
    connection with the Acquisition.

7   Information on Sirius
    Sirius is a public limited company registered in England and Wales. The Sirius Shares are
    listed on the Official List.

    Sirius was previously quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and
    the Sirius Shares were admitted to trading to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange
    on 28 April 2017. Since then, the Company's principal activities have been to raise funds to
    invest in developing potential mining opportunities. Prior to the acquisition of York Potash
    Limited and the Project in January 2011, such development opportunities included projects in
    North Dakota, Queensland and Western Australia. These projects and associated project
    companies are now dormant or wound up, and Sirius' resources have been dedicated to the
    development of the Project.

8   Directors, management, employees and locations
    Employees and management

    Anglo American attaches great importance to the skill and experience of Sirius' management
    and employees and recognises that the commitment of the management and employees of
    Sirius will be important to Anglo American going forward, particularly in relation to the
    development of the Project and therefore, save as set out in ""Sirius senior management and
    incentivisation arrangements"" below, Anglo American does not intend to make any material
    change in the conditions of employment of Sirius employees, unless otherwise agreed with
    the relevant employee.

    Anglo American intends to support the Sirius management team in conjunction with the
    broader resources of Anglo American in order to proceed with the development of the Project
    following a further review of the development plan. Anglo American remains committed to its
    disciplined capital allocation framework. In the first two years after successful completion of
    the Acquisition, development work on the Project is expected to be broadly in line with Sirius'
    revised development plan although Anglo American intends to update the development
    timeline, optimise mine design and ensure appropriate integration with Anglo American's own
    operating standards and practices. Following completion of the Acquisition, Anglo American
    does not intend to initiate any material headcount reductions within the current Sirius
    organisation or any material changes in the balance of skills and functions of the Sirius
    employees and management but may provide additional support to the Project through the
    use of Anglo American's skills and capabilities. Anglo American intends to continue to support
    Sirius' existing engineering apprentice scheme.

    Sirius currently has a head office in Scarborough with a small registered office in London.
    Following completion of the Acquisition, Anglo American intends to maintain Sirius'
    Scarborough office and to close Sirius' London office. Anglo American intends to maintain
    Sirius' executive, sales and projects functions across both locations and consolidate certain
    corporate and support functions with corresponding Anglo American functions. Anglo
    American has not yet determined whether these steps will result in headcount reductions but
    Anglo American would expect that any required reductions would not be material in number.

    It is expected that, upon completion of the Acquisition, each of the non-executive members of
    the Sirius Board shall resign from his/her office as a Sirius Director.

    Existing rights and pension schemes
    Anglo American has given assurances to the Sirius Directors that, following completion of the
    Acquisition, the existing contractual and statutory rights and terms and conditions of
    employment, including pension obligations, of the management and employees of the Sirius
    Group will be fully safeguarded in accordance with applicable law. The Sirius Group has
    confirmed to Anglo American that the only pension scheme it currently makes available to its
    employees is a defined contribution pension scheme provided through an external provider
    and it does not have any current or historical liability exposure to any pension arrangements
    providing benefits on a defined benefit basis. Anglo American therefore does not anticipate
    any pensions underfunding risk or exposure to any pension scheme deficit arising under
    legislation to, or in respect of, the Sirius Group employees following completion of the
    Acquisition.

    Sirius senior management and incentivisation arrangements

    Each of the Sirius Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; General Counsel and
    Company Secretary; Chief Development Officer; Chief Marketing Officer; External Affairs
    Director and People Director have agreed that they will remain with the Sirius business
    following completion of the Acquisition, for a period of at least one year. Anglo American has
    therefore agreed that during the period of one year following completion there will be no
    changes to these individuals' remuneration arrangements in respect of salary, benefits and
    pensions, and that during this period they will continue to participate in a bonus and a long-
    term incentive arrangement in accordance with their current ordinary level of annual bonus
    and long-term incentive participation. The annual bonus and long-term incentive
    arrangements will be cash-based and subject to terms, including in relation to continued
    employment and performance conditions, to be determined in due course.

    Locations, fixed assets and research and development

    Except as referred to in ""Employees and management"" above, Anglo American does not
    intend to make any material restructurings or changes in location of Sirius' operations and
    places of business following completion of the Acquisition.

    No changes are envisaged by Anglo American with respect to the redeployment of Sirius' fixed
    asset base.

    Sirius' research, or global agronomy, programme is designed to provide scientific data on
    specific crop responses to POLY4 and POLY4-based NPK blends to support ongoing
    discussions with customers on the technical and commercial applications of POLY4. Anglo
    American intends to continue to support Sirius' research programme.

    The Acquisition shall not have any impact on the existing business of Anglo American.

    De-listing

    Prior to the Scheme becoming Effective, it is intended that applications will be made to the
    London Stock Exchange to cancel trading in Sirius Shares on the London Stock Exchange's
    Main Market for listed securities and to the FCA to cancel the listing of Sirius Shares from the
    Official List, in each case to take effect on or shortly after the Effective Date.

    Other

    No statements in this paragraph 8 constitute ""post-offer undertakings"" for the purposes of
    Rule 19.5 of the Takeover Code.

9    The Sirius Share Plans
     Participants in the Sirius Share Plans shall be contacted regarding the effect of the Acquisition
     on their rights under the Sirius Share Plans and appropriate proposals shall be made to such
     participants in due course. Further details of the terms of such proposals shall be included in
     the Scheme Document and in separate letters to be sent to participants in the Sirius Share
     Plans.

10   The Convertible Bonds
     Anglo American will make an appropriate proposal to the Convertible Bondholders. Anglo
     American intends to treat the Effective Date as the date of occurrence of a ""Change of Control""
     under the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds. Under such proposals, Convertible
     Bondholders will have the right:

     -       to convert their Convertible Bonds at their prevailing conversion price prior to the
             Effective Date of the Scheme. Convertible Bondholders who exercise this right will
             participate in the Scheme as holders of Sirius Shares and will receive the Offer Price
             for each Sirius Share then held; and/or

     -       subject to completion of the Acquisition, to convert their Convertible Bonds during the
             period of 60 days following the Effective Date at the enhanced change of control
             conversion price. Convertible Bondholders who exercise this right will (as a result of
             amendments to Sirius' articles of association proposed to be implemented as from the
             Effective Date) receive the Offer Price for each Sirius Share they would have
             otherwise been entitled to on conversion, rather than the resulting Sirius Shares;
             and/or

     -       subject to completion of the Acquisition to redeem their Convertible Bonds, in the case
             of the Sirius 2023 Bonds, at their principal amount plus accrued interest and, in the
             case of the Sirius 2027 Bonds, at their accreted principal amount plus accrued
             interest, in each case in accordance with the terms of the relevant Convertible Bonds.

     Further details of these proposals shall be included in the Scheme Document and in the
     separate notice to be given to the Convertible Bondholders in due course.

     Convertible Bondholders that do not exercise any of these rights will retain the right (for so
     long as their Convertible Bonds remain outstanding and in accordance with the terms and
     conditions of the Convertible Bonds) either to continue to hold their Convertible Bonds or to
     convert their Convertible Bonds at the prevailing conversion price following the end of the 60-
     day change of control period. Convertible Bondholders who exercise this conversion right will
     not be entitled to the enhanced change of control conversion price and will receive the Offer
     Price for each Sirius Share they would otherwise have been entitled to on conversion, rather
     than the resulting Sirius Shares (as a result of amendments to Sirius' articles of association
     proposed to be implemented as from the Effective Date). For the avoidance of doubt, the
     Acquisition is not conditional upon the approval of the Convertible Bondholders.

11   Hancock royalty deed
     Pursuant to a royalty financing agreement dated 25 October 2016 entered into between Sirius,
     York Potash Limited, York Potash Processing 
     and (ii) use the confidential information only in connection with the Acquisition.

     These confidentiality obligations shall remain in force until, inter alia, completion of the
     Acquisition. Anglo American Services (UK) Limited, on behalf of the Anglo American Group,
     also agreed to certain standstill undertakings, all of which ceased to apply upon the release
     of this announcement.

     Co-operation Agreement

     Anglo American, Bidco and Sirius have entered into a Co-operation Agreement dated 20
     January 2020, pursuant to which:
     (i)     Anglo American and Bidco have agreed to use their reasonable endeavours to secure
             the regulatory clearances and authorisations necessary to satisfy the Regulatory
             Conditions as promptly as is reasonably practicable;

     (ii)    Anglo American, Bidco and Sirius have agreed to certain undertakings to co-operate
             in relation to such regulatory clearances and authorisations; and

     (iii)   subject to Sirius complying with its obligations referred to in (ii) above, Anglo American
             and Bidco have agreed to use their reasonable endeavours to: (a) submit the definitive
             application form to Brazil's Council for Economic Defence and its entities (""CADE"") as
             soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within two Business Days after this
             announcement; and (b) generally progress the applications for Clearances in order to
             allow the Clearances to be obtained as soon as reasonably practicable.

     The Co-operation Agreement shall be terminated with immediate effect if: (i) Anglo American,
     Bidco and Sirius so agree in writing; or (ii) the Acquisition, with the permission of the Panel,
     lapses, terminates or is withdrawn in accordance with its terms (other than in certain limited
     circumstances).

     Anglo American and Bidco have the right to terminate the Co-operation Agreement if: (i) the
     Sirius Directors announce that they shall not convene the Court Meeting or the General
     Meeting or that they do not intend to publish the Scheme Document; (ii) the Court Meeting or
     the General Meeting is not held by the 22nd day after 5 March 2020 (or such later date as may
     be agreed by Anglo American and Sirius); (iii) the Court Sanction Hearing is not held by the
     22nd day after 8 April 2020 or, if CADE do not consider that the application form is eligible for
     the fast-track review procedure, the 22nd day after 27 May 2020 (or such later date as may be
     agreed by Anglo American and Sirius); (iv) the Sirius Directors otherwise withdraw, adversely
     modify or adversely qualify the recommendation referred to in this announcement; (v) a
     competing proposal is recommended by the Sirius Directors or effected; or (vi) any Condition
     not waived is incapable of satisfaction, or any Condition incapable of waiver is incapable of
     satisfaction (where such invocation has been permitted by the Panel). The Co-operation
     Agreement shall also terminate: (i) if the Scheme is not approved by the Sirius Shareholders
     at the Court Meeting and/or the General Meeting or the Court refuses to sanction the Scheme;
     or (ii) unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, if the Effective Date has not occurred
     by the Long Stop Date.

     The Co-operation Agreement also records Anglo American's, Bidco's and Sirius' intentions to
     implement the Acquisition by way of the Scheme, subject to Anglo American and Bidco having
     the right, subject to the consent of the Panel, to implement the Acquisition by way of a
     Takeover Offer.

     The Co-operation Agreement also contains provisions that shall apply in respect of the Sirius
     Share Plans and certain other employee incentive arrangements.

15   Structure of and Conditions to the Acquisition
     It is intended that the Acquisition shall be effected by means of a Court-approved scheme of
     arrangement between Sirius and Sirius Shareholders under Part 26 of the Companies Act,
     although Anglo American and Bidco reserve the right to implement the Acquisition by way of
     a Takeover Offer (subject to Panel consent and the terms of the Co-operation Agreement).

     The purpose of the Scheme is to provide for Bidco to become the holder of the entire issued
     and to be issued share capital of Sirius. This is to be achieved by the transfer of the Sirius
     Shares to Bidco, in consideration for which the Sirius Shareholders who are on the register of
     members at the Scheme Record Time shall receive cash consideration on the basis set out
     in paragraph 2 of this announcement.

     The Acquisition shall be subject to the Conditions and further terms set out below and in
     Appendix I to this announcement and to be set out in the Scheme Document and shall only
     become Effective, if, among other things, the following events occur on or before the Long
     Stop Date or such later date as may be agreed by Anglo American and Sirius (with the Panel's
     consent and as the Court may approve (if such approval(s) are required)):

     (i)      the approval of the Scheme by a majority in number of the Sirius Shareholders who
              are present and vote, whether in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting and who
              represent 75 per cent. in value of the Sirius Shares voted by those Sirius
              Shareholders;

     (ii)     the resolutions required to approve and implement the Scheme being duly passed
              by Sirius Shareholders representing the requisite majority or majorities of votes cast
              at the General Meeting (or any adjournment thereof);

     (iii)    the approval and sanction of the Scheme by the Court (with or without modification
              but subject to any modification being on terms acceptable to Sirius and Anglo
              American);

     (iv)     the delivery of a copy of the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies; and

     (v)      CADE having approved the consummation of the Acquisition unconditionally
              pursuant to the Brazilian competition law No 12529 of 30 November 2011 and
              CADE's Internal Regiment (approved by CADE Regulation No. 22 of 19 June 2019),
              or, if approved with conditions, on such conditions as are reasonably satisfactory to
              Anglo American.

     The Scheme shall lapse if:

      -       the Court Meeting and the General Meeting expected to take place no later than 5
              March 2020 are not held by 27 March 2020 (or such later date as may be agreed
              between Anglo American and Sirius);

      -       the Court Sanction Hearing expected to take place no later than 8 April 2020 is not
              held by 30 April 2020 or, if CADE do not consider that the application form is eligible
              for the fast-track review procedure, the Court Sanction Hearing expected to take place
              no later than 27 May 2020 is not held by 18 June 2020 (or such later date as may be
              agreed between Anglo American and Sirius); or

      -       the Scheme does not become Effective by the Long Stop Date,

      provided, however, that the deadlines for the timing of the Court Meeting, the General Meeting
      and the Court Sanction Hearing as set out above may be waived by Anglo American, and the
      deadline for the Scheme to become Effective may be extended by agreement between Sirius,
      Anglo American and Bidco.

     Subject to satisfaction (or waiver, where applicable) of the Conditions, the Scheme is
     expected to become Effective by 31 March 2020.
 
     Upon the Scheme becoming Effective, it shall be binding on all Sirius Shareholders,
     irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the General
     Meeting.
     Further details of the Scheme shall be included in the Scheme Document. It is expected that
     the Scheme Document, containing further information about the Acquisition and notices of the
     Court Meeting and the General Meeting, shall be sent to Sirius Shareholders within 28 days
     of this announcement. The Scheme Document and Forms of Proxy will be made available to
     all Sirius Shareholders at no charge to them.

16   De-listing
     Prior to the Scheme becoming Effective, it is intended that applications will be made to the
     London Stock Exchange to cancel trading in Sirius Shares on the London Stock Exchange's
     Main Market for listed securities and to the FCA to cancel the listing of Sirius Shares from the
     Official List, in each case to take effect on or shortly after the Effective Date.

     The last day of dealings in Sirius Shares on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange
     is expected to be the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Date and no transfers
     shall be registered after 6.00p.m. on that date.

     On the Effective Date, share certificates in respect of Sirius Shares shall cease to be valid
     and entitlements to Sirius Shares held within the CREST system shall be cancelled.

     It is also proposed that, following the Effective Date and after its shares are delisted, Sirius
     shall be re-registered as a private limited company. A resolution to approve the re-registration
     will be proposed at the General Meeting.

17   Dividends
     Sirius has not declared any dividends for the financial year 2018 and half-year period ended
     30 June 2019.

     If, on or after the date of this announcement and on or prior to the Effective Date, any dividend,
     distribution or other return of value is declared, made or paid by Sirius, the Offer Price shall
     be reduced correspondingly. In such circumstances, Sirius Shareholders would be entitled to
     retain any such dividend, distribution or other return of value declared, made or paid.

18   Sirius ADRs
     The Scheme shall not be extended to holders of Sirius ADRs. Therefore, if the Scheme
     becomes Effective, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the ""Sirius Depositary""), shall
     call for surrender of the Sirius ADRs and, upon those surrenders, shall deliver the
     consideration under the Acquisition, net of applicable fees, expenses, taxes and
     governmental charges, to the holders of the Sirius ADRs entitled to them in accordance with
     the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Thereafter, the Sirius ADR program shall be terminated.

     Holders of Sirius ADRs shall not be entitled to vote directly on the Scheme and the Acquisition.
     However, holders of Sirius ADRs have the right to instruct the Sirius Depositary how to vote
     the Sirius Shares in respect of the Sirius Shares underlying the Sirius ADRs, subject to and
     in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement.

     Holders of Sirius ADRs that wish to vote directly on the Scheme and the Acquisition must
     surrender their Sirius ADRs to the Sirius Depositary, pay the Sirius Depositary's fees and
     charges in accordance with the Deposit Agreement and become holders of Sirius Shares prior
     to the Scheme Voting Record Time, in each case subject to and in accordance with the terms
     of the Deposit Agreement. Holders of Sirius ADRs that wish to vote directly on the Scheme
     should take care to surrender their Sirius ADRs in time to permit processing to be completed
     by the Sirius Depositary and its English custodian prior to the Scheme Voting Record Time.
     Any person that holds Sirius ADRs through a broker or other securities intermediary should
     contact the intermediary to determine the date by which such intermediary must be instructed
     to act in order that the necessary processing can be completed in time.

19   Disclosure of interests in Sirius
     Save in respect of the irrevocable undertakings referred to in paragraph 4 above and as
     disclosed below, as at the close of business on 16 January 2020 (being the last practicable
     date prior to the date of this announcement) neither Anglo American, nor any of its directors,
     nor, so far as Anglo American is aware, any person acting in concert (within the meaning of
     the Takeover Code) with it has either (i) any interest in or right to subscribe for any relevant
     securities of Sirius; (ii) any short position in respect of relevant Sirius Shares (whether
     conditional or absolute and whether in the money or otherwise), including any short position
     under a derivative, any agreement to sell or any delivery obligation or right to require another
     person to purchase or take delivery; (iii) any dealing arrangement of the kind referred to in
     Note 11 on the definition of acting in concert in the Takeover Code, in relation to Sirius Shares
     or in relation to any securities convertible or exchangeable into Sirius Shares; or (iv) borrowed
     or lent any relevant Sirius Shares (including, for these purposes, any financial collateral
     arrangements of the kind referred to in Note 4 on Rule 4.6 of the Takeover Code), save for
     any borrowed shares which had been either on-lent or sold:

         Name                      Nature of Interest        Number of Sirius
                                                             Shares
         Ian Ashby                 Holder of ordinary        1,166,665
                                   shares


     ""Interests in securities"" for these purposes arise, in summary, when a person has long
     economic exposure, whether absolute or conditional, to changes in the price of securities (and
     a person who only has a short position in securities is not treated as interested in those
     securities). In particular, a person shall be treated as having an 'interest' by virtue of the
     ownership, voting rights or control of securities, or by virtue of any agreement to purchase,
     option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.

20   General
     Anglo American and Bidco reserve the right to elect (with the consent of the Panel and subject
     to the terms of the Co-operation Agreement) to implement the Acquisition by way of a
     Takeover Offer for the Sirius Shares not already directly or indirectly owned by the Anglo
     American Parties as an alternative to the Scheme. In such event, the Takeover Offer shall be
     implemented on the same terms, so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the
     Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments, including (without limitation) an acceptance
     condition set at a level permitted by the Panel.

     The Acquisition shall be made subject to the Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix
     I to this announcement and to be set out in the Scheme Document. The bases and sources
     of certain financial information contained in this announcement are set out in Appendix II to
     this announcement. A summary of the irrevocable undertakings given in relation to the
     Acquisition is contained in Appendix III to this announcement. Certain terms used in this
     announcement are defined in Appendix IV to this announcement.
     It is expected that the Scheme Document, containing further information about the Acquisition
     and notices of the Court Meeting and the General Meeting shall be sent to Sirius Shareholders
     within 28 days of this announcement and it is expected that the Scheme will become Effective
     by 31 March 2020.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to
events and depend on circumstances that shall occur in the future. These events and
circumstances include changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and
regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business
combinations or disposals. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialises or if any
one or more of the assumptions proves incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those
expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed
in the light of such factors.

Neither Sirius nor any of Anglo American nor any member of the Anglo American Group, nor any
of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-
looking statements in this announcement shall actually occur. Given these risks and uncertainties,

No profit forecasts or estimates
No statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast or estimate for any period and
no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per

necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Anglo
American or Sirius, as appropriate.

Disclosure requirements of the Takeover Code
Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Takeover Code, any person who is interested in 1 per cent. or more of any
class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any
offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to
be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the
offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short
positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company
and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom
Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day
following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London
time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror
is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of
a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure.
Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Takeover Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1 per cent.
or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the
dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for,
any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror,
save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing
Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London
time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.

If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they shall be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).

Details of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position
Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the
Panel's website at http://www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk/, including details of the number of relevant
securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. If
you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a
Dealing Disclosure, you should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638
0129.

            CONDITIONS AND FURTHER TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION

Part A: Conditions of the Scheme and the Acquisition

1    The Acquisition is conditional upon the Scheme becoming unconditional and effective, subject
     to the Takeover Code, by not later than the Long Stop Date.

2    The Scheme shall be subject to the following conditions:

     2.1
             (i)      its approval by a majority in number of the Sirius Shareholders who are
                      present and vote, whether in person or by proxy, at the Court Meeting and
                      who represent 75 per cent. or more in value of the Sirius Shares voted by

Part B: Certain further terms of the Acquisition

1    Subject to the requirements of the Panel, Anglo American reserves the right to waive:

     (a)     the deadline set out in Condition 1, subject to the agreement of Anglo American and
             Sirius, and any of the deadlines set out in Condition 2 for the timing of the Court
             Meeting, General Meeting and the Court Sanction Hearing. If any such deadline is not
             met, Anglo American shall make an announcement by 8.00 a.m. on the Business Day
             following such deadline confirming whether it has invoked or waived the relevant
             Condition or agreed with Sirius to extend the deadline in relation to the relevant
             Condition; and

     (b)     in whole or in part, all or any of the above Conditions 3(a) to (g) (inclusive).

2    If Anglo American is required by the Panel to make an offer for Sirius Shares under the
     provisions of Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, Anglo American may make such alterations to any
     of the above Conditions and terms of the Acquisition as are necessary to comply with the
     provisions of that Rule.

3    The Scheme and the Acquisition shall not become Effective if:

     (a)     in so far as the Acquisition or any matter arising from or relating to the Scheme or
             Acquisition constitutes a concentration with a Community dimension within the scope
             of the Regulation, the European Commission either initiates proceedings under Article
             6(1)(c) of the Regulation or makes a referral to a competent authority in the United
             Kingdom under Article 9(1) of the Regulation and there is then a CMA Phase 2
             Reference; or

     (b)     the Acquisition or any matter arising from or relating to the Scheme or Acquisition
             becomes subject to a CMA Phase 2 Reference,

     in each case, before the date of the Court Meeting.

4    Other than as required under the terms of the Co-operation Agreement, Anglo American shall
     be under no obligation to waive (if capable of waiver), to determine to be or remain satisfied
     or to treat as fulfilled any of Conditions 3(a) to (g) (inclusive) by a date earlier than the latest
     date for the fulfilment of that Condition notwithstanding that the other Conditions of the
     Acquisition may at such earlier date have been waived or fulfilled and that there are at such
     earlier date no circumstances indicating that any of such Conditions may not be capable of
     fulfilment.

5    The Sirius Shares acquired under the Acquisition shall be acquired fully paid and free from all
     liens, equities, charges, encumbrances, options, rights of pre-emption and any other third
     party rights and interests of any nature and together with all rights now or hereafter attaching
     or accruing to them, including, without limitation, voting rights and (subject to paragraph 6
     below) the right to receive and retain in full all dividends and other distributions (if any)
     declared, made or paid, or any other return of value (whether by reduction of share capital or
     share premium account or otherwise) made, on or after the date of this announcement.

6    If, on or after the date of this announcement and prior to or on the Effective Date, any dividend,
     distribution or other return of value is declared, paid or made or becomes payable by Sirius
     and with a record date on or prior to the Effective Date, Anglo American reserves the right
     (without prejudice to any right of Anglo American, with the consent of the Panel, to invoke
     Condition 3(e)(ii) of this Appendix I) to reduce the consideration payable under the Acquisition
     to reflect the aggregate amount of such dividend, distribution or other return of value. In such
     circumstances, Sirius Shareholders would be entitled to retain any such dividend, distribution
     or other return of value declared, made or paid.

     If and to the extent that any such dividend, distribution or other return of value is paid or made
     on or prior to the Effective Date, and Anglo American exercises its rights under this paragraph
     6 to reduce the consideration payable under the Acquisition, any reference in this
     announcement to the consideration payable under the terms of the Acquisition shall be
     deemed to be a reference to the consideration as so reduced.

     If and to the extent that any such dividend, distribution or other return of value has been
     declared or announced but not paid or made or is not payable by reference to a record date
     on or prior to the Effective Date or shall be (i) transferred pursuant to the Acquisition on a
     basis which entitles Anglo American to receive the dividend, distribution or other return of
     value and to retain it; or (ii) cancelled, the consideration payable under the terms of the
     Acquisition shall not be subject to change in accordance with this paragraph 6.

     Any exercise by Anglo American of its rights referred to in this paragraph 6 shall be the subject
     of an announcement and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be regarded as constituting
     any revision or variation of the Acquisition.

7    Anglo American and Bidco reserve the right to elect (with the consent of the Panel and subject
     to the Co-operation Agreement) to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer for
     the Sirius Shares as an alternative to the Scheme. In such event, the Takeover Offer shall be
     implemented on the same terms, so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the
     Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments, including (without limitation) an acceptance
     condition set at a level permitted by the Panel and the Co-operation Agreement.

8    The availability of the Acquisition to persons not resident in the United Kingdom may be
     affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. Persons who are not resident in the United
     Kingdom should inform themselves about and observe any applicable requirements.

9    The Acquisition is not being made, directly or indirectly, in, into or from, or by use of the mails
     of, or by any means of instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other
     electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any
     facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any jurisdiction where to do so
     would violate the laws of that jurisdiction.

10   The Acquisition is governed by the law of England and Wales and is subject to the jurisdiction
     of the English courts and to the Conditions and further terms set out in this Appendix I and to
     be set out in the Scheme Document. The Acquisition shall be subject to the applicable
     requirements of the Takeover Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange and the Financial
     Conduct Authority.

11   Under Rule 13.5(a) of the Takeover Code, Anglo American may not invoke a Condition to the
     Acquisition so as to cause the Acquisition not to proceed, to lapse or to be withdrawn unless
     the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the Condition are of material
     significance to Anglo American in the context of the Acquisition. Condition 2 of Part A of
     Appendix I and, if applicable, any acceptance condition if the Acquisition is implemented by
     means of a Takeover Offer, are not subject to this provision of the Takeover Code.

12   Each of the Conditions shall be regarded as a separate Condition and shall not be limited by
     reference to any other Condition.

      Offer Price, in respect of a total of approximately 1,053,506,079 Sirius Shares. This figure is
      illustrative only and the actual figure will depend, inter alia, on market data as at the Effective
      Date.

    such lapse or withdrawal; or

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

8 January 2020


Anglo American response to statement from Sirius Minerals Plc (""Sirius"")

Anglo American plc (""Anglo American"") notes the announcement released today by Sirius
regarding a possible offer for Sirius by Anglo American.

Anglo American confirms that it is in advanced discussions with Sirius in relation to a possible
offer at a value of 5.5 pence per Sirius share, in cash (the ""Proposal""). The Proposal would value
the entire issued share capital of Sirius at approximately P386 million.

In September 2019, Sirius announced that it was undertaking a strategic review in order to assess
the development plan for its North Yorkshire polyhalite project (the ""Project"") and an appropriate
financing structure to provide relevant funding. Sirius also announced that the strategic review
would include a broader process to seek a major strategic partner in the Project. In November
2019, Sirius provided an update on the progress of this strategic review, including a revised two-
stage development plan.

Anglo American identified the Project as being of potential interest some time ago, given the
quality of the underlying asset in terms of scale, resource life, operating cost profile and the nature
and quality of its product. The Project has the potential to fit well with Anglo American's
established strategy of focusing on world-class assets, particularly in the context of Anglo
American's portfolio trajectory towards later cycle products that support a fast-growing global
population and a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world.

Anglo American believes that the possible offer could provide certainty to Sirius' shareholders,
whilst Anglo American brings the financial, technical and marketing resources and capabilities to
progress the Project over time. This should also be in the interests of Sirius' broader stakeholders
Anglo American plc including employees and customers. Anglo American notes the following key attributes from its
initial assessment:

    -   Asset quality: Anglo American believes that the Project has the potential to become a
        world-class, low-cost and long-life asset. Sirius has progressed the development of the
        Project to an advanced stage, with construction now under way for over two years. Sirius
        has indicated that this is currently the world's largest known high-grade polyhalite deposit
        with a JORC Reserve of 290 million tonnes, with a grade of 88.8%, and a Resource of
        2.69 billion tonnes. The Resource indicated by Sirius has the scale, thickness and quality
        to be mined efficiently using bulk mining methods through a relatively simple, low-energy,
        non-chemical production process. Sirius has indicated that the Project could operate at
        an EBITDA margin potentially well in excess of 50% leaving the Project well positioned
        for strong through-the-cycle profitability with a long anticipated asset life.

    -   Development pathway: At this stage, the Project requires a significant amount of further
        financing to develop and commission the operation that has proven challenging for Sirius
        to procure on an economic basis. Anglo American, as one of the world's leading mining
        companies, has the resources and capabilities to help build on the achievements of the
        Sirius team. Anglo American remains committed to its disciplined capital allocation
        framework. During the first two years after an offer is successfully completed,
        development work on the Project is expected to be broadly in line with Sirius' revised
        development plan although Anglo American intends to update the development timeline,
        optimise mine design and ensure appropriate integration with its own operating
        standards and practices. Anglo American believes that there is the potential for long-term
        benefits from Anglo American's technical expertise in both the development and
        operational phases, as well as from Anglo American's recognised Operating Model to
        drive safety and productivity to world-leading standards. Integration into Anglo
        American's global Marketing network would provide full mine-to-market capabilities and
        build on Anglo American's institutional experience in the world's major fertiliser markets.

    -   Premium product: Sirius' polyhalite product, POLY4, is a multi-nutrient fertiliser certified
        for organic use and has the potential to generate demand at a competitive cost that
        supports a strong margin. POLY4 is an attractive low-chloride alternative to traditional
        potassium-bearing mineral products on a cost-effective basis. It includes four of the six
        key nutrients that plants need to grow - potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium.
        The use of fertilisers is one of the most effective ways to improve agricultural yields and
        therefore help to address the anticipated future imbalance between food, feed and biofuel
        demand and supply caused by a fast-growing global population and limited additional
        land availability for agricultural use.

Anglo American reserves the following rights:

    -   To reduce the offer consideration by the amount of any dividend or other distribution or
        return of capital which is paid or becomes payable by Sirius after the date of this
        announcement

    -   To introduce other forms of consideration and / or to vary the composition of the
        consideration

    -   To make an offer for Sirius at any time on less favourable terms:

            o   with the agreement or recommendation of the Board of Sirius; or
            o   if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for Sirius on less
                favourable terms; or
            o   if Sirius announces a ""whitewash"" transaction

In accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, Anglo American is now required, by not later than
5.00 pm (London time) on 5 February 2020, the date 28 days after today's announcement, to
either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Sirius in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the
Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Sirius, in which case the
announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. This deadline
will only be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of
the Code.

There can be no certainty that any offer will be made. A further statement will be made as
appropriate.

Unless otherwise stated, information concerning Sirius has been extracted from published
sources. The value attributed to Sirius' share capital is based on an assumed number of Sirius'
issued share capital of 7,020,196,560 ordinary shares as at the close of business on 7 January
2020.

The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and
secondary listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the
Namibia Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be,
solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the
offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is
first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and

Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm
(London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.

If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal
or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a
securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule
8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any
persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).

Anglo American receives operating licence for Minas-Rio tailings facility

Anglo American announces that it has received the next phase of its operating licence for its
Minas-Rio tailings facility in Brazil, following the work to raise the dam as part of the Step 3 licence
area of the mine. The regulatory authorities in Brazil granted the installation licence for this work
in January 2018 and the construction work was completed in accordance with that licence in
August 2019.

Seamus French, CEO of Bulk Commodities at Anglo American, said: ""This is an important
milestone for our Minas-Rio iron ore operation in Brazil towards reaching its full potential. Minas-
Rio has a long asset life of 48 years and produces a high grade, premium quality product for our
customers, supporting lower emissions in the steel industry. We expect Minas-Rio to produce 23
million tonnes in 2019, with a FOB unit cost of c.US$24 per tonne.""

The Minas-Rio tailings dam uses a downstream construction design and is an embankment dam
structure, built using compacted imported earth-fill material, with carefully selected granular
materials for the drainage and filter zones. Tailings are not used to build the dam, and instead
construction materials are placed in controlled layers. This is a conservative and high quality
design for a tailings dam, being designed and built as a water-retaining type of dam.

The Company has a primary listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and
secondary listings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange, the
Namibia Stock Exchange and the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Minas-Rio operates a comprehensive tailings safety management programme, as required by
Anglo American's rigorous Group Technical Standard, and in line with the Brazilian legislation
and best practices around the world. It includes daily inspections, weekly instrument reading and
geotechnical inspections at least every two weeks, as well as quarterly inspections performed by
the Engineer of Record. In addition, a Technical Review Panel, composed of three experienced
specialist engineers, provides an independent review at least once per year. The construction
work and other aspects related to the facility are independently audited by the Brazilian Institute
for Technological Research (IPT), one of the most renowned technical institutes in Brazil, which
sends quarterly reports to the relevant authorities.

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
more electrified world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of the world's
developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we use
innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we

Anglo American: world-class assets driving sustainable competitive returns

Anglo American plc (""Anglo American"" or ""the Group"") is today providing an update to investors
and analysts on the Group's sustained operational and financial performance improvements and
outlook.

The briefing will cover guidance for the current and next three financial years, including in relation
to capital expenditure and production volumes, and a progress update on Anglo American's
organic growth projects.

Mark Cutifani, Chief Executive of Anglo American, said: ""We are building on the complete
transformation of both the quality of our portfolio and our performance over the last six years.
Anglo American is now amongst the very best in terms of our overall cost curve position as a
result of fundamental operating changes, the technical and product marketing expertise we have
applied, and the wholesale upgrade of our portfolio.

""We will continue to upgrade our asset portfolio over time and we see our progress continuing on
all fronts as we also bring a number of high quality growth projects online during the next three
years, delivering 20-25% production growth by 2023.""

Continued performance improvement during 2019 and confident outlook:

- 2019 unit costs expected to reduce by 5%;
- 2019 total production volumes to again increase;
- 2020 production expected to increase by 3%, with cost inflation largely absorbed by
  productivity and cost improvements; and
- expect to meet $3-4 billion target of incremental annual EBITDA between 2017 and 2022.

Stephen Pearce, Finance Director of Anglo American, added: ""We are disciplined in investing to
deliver value-adding growth - focused on quality production volumes, margins and returns. As
we also progress our share buyback of up to $1 billion, our net debt is naturally increasing, albeit
well within our tolerance of less than 1.5x EBITDA. In the last three years, we have restored a
resilient balance sheet, substantially reducing net debt and returning $4.2 billion to our
shareholders.""

Mark Cutifani concluded: ""We expect our next step change in performance to come from a
combination of:

- our P101 programme that is achieving new levels of industry best-practice equipment
  performance across our operations;
- volume growth from existing and new operations, such as Quellaveco; and
- the deployment of our FutureSmart Mining(TM) approach to technology, digitalisation and
  sustainability.

It is this approach that will transform how we discover, mine, process and market our products
and how our stakeholders experience our business - environmentally and socially.

""Anglo American's portfolio spans the high quality products that are aligned to the demographic
and macro trends of a fast growing and urbanising global population in a cleaner, more electrified
and connected world. Combined with our multi-stakeholder mindset to create a sustainable
business in all dimensions, we believe we are well set to keep delivering.""

Notes to editors:

Anglo American is a leading global mining company and our products are the essential
ingredients in almost every aspect of modern life. Our portfolio of world-class competitive mining
operations and undeveloped resources provides the metals and minerals that enable a cleaner,
more electrified world and that meet the fast growing consumer-driven demands of the world's
developed and maturing economies. With our people at the heart of our business, we use
innovative practices and the latest technologies to discover new resources and mine, process,
move and market our products to our customers around the world - safely, responsibly and
sustainably.

As a responsible miner - of diamonds (through De Beers), copper, platinum group metals, iron
ore, coal and nickel - we are the custodians of what are precious natural resources. We work
together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock the sustainable value that
those resources represent for our shareholders, the communities and countries in which we
operate, and for society as a whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's
lives.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding
Anglo American's financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend
policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans
and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and reserves and
resources positions), are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements.

Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo
American's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American
will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and
commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery
rates and other operational capabilities, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the
ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transportation infrastructure,
the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the
availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions
in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities
such as permitting and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of
regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts over land and resource
ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American's most recent Annual
Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors
and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Anglo American expressly disclaims
any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers (the ""Takeover Code""), the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange
of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and
the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any
updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in
Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or
circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Anglo American equalises ownership at integrated Moranbah-Grosvenor operation

Anglo American plc (""Anglo American"") announces the equalisation of ownership across its
integrated metallurgical coal operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor, in Queensland,
Australia.

The long-established Moranbah North mine and processing operation is 88% owned by Anglo
American, with 12% owned by a consortium of Japanese companies (1). The more recently
commissioned and neighbouring Grosvenor mine was developed, and is wholly owned, by Anglo
American and came onstream in 2016. The Grosvenor mine uses Moranbah North's coal
processing infrastructure, where numerous debottlenecking, expansion and product blending
options offer considerable cost, productivity and margin benefits for the integrated operation.

Anglo American has therefore sought to replicate the ownership structure of Moranbah North at
Grosvenor, through the agreed sale of a 12% interest in the Grosvenor mine to the same
consortium partners, in order to align the interests of all of the owners and to facilitate the delivery
of the value creation opportunities set out above. Under the terms of the agreement, which is
subject to a number of conditions prior to completion, Anglo American will receive cash proceeds
of approximately US$141 million in respect of the 12% minority interest in the Grosvenor mine.

Seamus French, CEO of Bulk Commodities at Anglo American, said: ""The alignment of
ownership interests across the Moranbah-Grosvenor operation is an important step forward as
we unlock the considerable additional value that we see. Our ability to expand the plant,
debottleneck various processes, and have the flexibility to blend our naturally high quality
products more effectively, all support the long term competitiveness of what is already a world-
class asset. I am pleased to be building on the successful relationships with our joint venture
partners in delivering Moranbah-Grosvenor's full potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders.""
