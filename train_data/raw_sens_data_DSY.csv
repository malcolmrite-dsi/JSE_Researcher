ACCEPTANCE OF ANNUAL SHARES AWARDED IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY LONG-TERM
INCENTIVE PLAN AND ONCE-OFF AWARDS IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY RETENTION LONG-
TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIPs”)


In compliance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, notification is hereby given that
certain executive directors of the Company and directors of major subsidiaries have accepted
annual awards of ordinary shares allocated in terms of the Discovery long-term incentive plan
(“LTIP”), an equity-settled LTIP. These share awards are subject to vesting conditions that include
performance criteria that are aligned to the organic growth methodology of the Group as
outlined in the Company’s remuneration report and vest equally from the 3rd to the 5th
anniversaries of these awards (between 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2025), provided
the necessary vesting criteria have been achieved.

As outlined in the Company’s remuneration report, the Remuneration Committee of Discovery is
also reviewing the Company’s long-term incentive structures at all levels of management to
mitigate the emerging retention risks as a result of the impact of the recent economic slowdown
and the impact of COVID-19 on the compound performance outcomes for vesting of LTIPs.

Following the above review, the Remuneration Committee recently approved a retention
scheme which includes the allocation of once-off equity settled ordinary share awards. The
vesting of these shares is over three years on 30 September 2023 and is similarly subject to
compound performance conditions currently aligned to the organic growth methodology of the
Group and also subject to certain maximum vesting limitations depending on the outcome of
existing LTIP allocations in issue.

The nature of the interest in respect of each of these awards is direct beneficial, subject to
meeting the vesting performance criteria. The transactions have occurred off-market and the
necessary clearances have been obtained.
The combined allocations accepted, which reflect the maximum that can vest depending on
performance conditions, are set out below:

The information has been extracted from the Audited results for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Resilient operating performance during the pandemic; financial strength and strategic relevance going forward

The full-year period to 30 June 2020 was uniquely complex, with the COVID-19 pandemic creating considerable economic uncertainty, market volatility and societal
need, against an already challenging economic backdrop. Discovery's response was focused on three areas: protecting its people, protecting and supporting its clients,
and supporting country efforts in South Africa - underpinned by a disciplined strategy to maintain Group financial strength and resilience.


Financial Performance

Performance over the period was framed by the following key issues:

Operating performance was resilient

For the full year ended 30 June 2020, core new business was up 5% to R19 173 million, normalised operating profit was up 9% to R8 409 million (before providing for
future COVID-19-related impacts, decreasing by 22% after the provision to R6 069 million) and normalised headline earnings decreased by 26% to R3 747 million.
Normalised headline earnings per share (diluted) decreased by 27% to 566.7 cents and headline earnings per share (diluted) decreased by 94% to 44.7 cents.
The following table summarises the position:

                                                                                                            % change
Metrics                                                                                              over prior year

Group normalised profit from operations (before allowing for COVID-19 provision)                                  9%
Group normalised profit from operations (after allowing for COVID-19 provision)                                 (22%)
Group normalised headline earnings                                                                              (26%)
Headline earnings (after economic assumption changes due to long-term interest rates)                           (94%)

Actuarial dynamics also performed well and demonstrated particular resilience during the final quarter of the year. Over the period, South Africa (SA) and the United
Kingdom (UK) experienced severe lockdowns, however lapse experience was contained within Discovery's actuarial assumptions for all businesses, except Discovery
Invest. Claims experience was also better than assumption for all operations, except VitalityLife, where the effects of the pandemic emerged sooner. New business was
curtailed during the various lockdown periods, but the impact was mitigated by increased digital enablement. This was particularly evident in Ping An Health, which
delivered significant growth through its digital channel during China's lockdown period.


A reserve of R3.4 billion was created to cater for all future COVID-19 impacts

The Group provided R3.4 billion for future COVID-19-related impacts on claims and lapses, so the expected effects to December 2021 are fully recognised and reserved
for in the 2020 reporting year. This resulted in a R2.3 billion profit impact, net of discretionary margins. Discovery's own data and insights have been overlaid onto
global and local data to build sophisticated models to consider three scenarios, with the provisions established in the medium scenario, as a prudent best estimate.


Interest rate movements had a R4.8 billion pre-tax effect on headline earnings

In terms of long-term interest rates, the significant movements in positive real rates of return in SA and negative real rates of return in the UK has a significant effect on
policy values and headline earnings, but none on cash flows, solvency or capital in SA; and since the implementation of the hedge strategy - little impact in the UK. The
impact in the period was R3.6 billion for Discovery Life and £60.5 million net of the valuation of the hedge for Vitality Life, with no bearing on operating performance.
These have been normalised out of the Group's financial result.


The growth model performed well, with substantial, planned investment of R2.2 billion into new businesses

In terms of the growth model, the businesses delivered a resilient operating performance. Established businesses saw an increase in operating profit of 15% before the
COVID-19 provisioning at R9.9 billion (reducing to -13% after), with pleasing new business growth. The emerging businesses saw remarkable growth, delivering a
combined profit of R736 million - 74% higher than the prior period. Investment in new businesses was at 26% of normalised operating earnings (before the COVID-19
reserve), compared with 17% in the previous financial year, with these initiatives demonstrating compelling progress. Discovery Bank completed all migrations onto its
platform and was able to fully fund its credit book with deposits; Vitality Invest doubled total funds under management over the recent six-month period; Umbrella
Funds has a strong pipeline of committed funds; and the V1 platform continued to expand into new markets.


The Group focused on capital strength and liquidity

Regarding capital and cash management, the capital metrics remained above target for all businesses, with internal liquidity bolstered for key businesses. The Group's
Financial Leverage Ratio was at 25.1%(1) and the South African liquidity(2) of R1.9 billion remains above target. These metrics remain resilient into future periods under
the low/stressed COVID-19 scenario.

1 Excludes capitalised lease liabilities under the newly adopted IFRS16 and bank borrowings related to normal course lending and borrowing activities of Discovery Bank
2 South African cash and undrawn committed facilities


The return on embedded value was 2% for the year (5% excluding economic impacts and forex gains), also affected by the COVID-19 provision and other non-economic
methodology and assumption changes predominantly in Discovery Life and VitalityLife.

Heightened relevance of the Vitality Shared-Value business model; continued investment in Discovery's strategic foundation
Discovery is well positioned to respond to the pandemic, given its Shared-Value business model is premised on, and responsive to, three trends being accelerated as a
result of COVID-19. This includes firstly, the behavioural nature of risk, given the emerging importance of healthy living in determining not only non-communicable
disease risk but communicable disease risk as well. Secondly, technology is emerging as a key enabler, given the rush to an online world. Thirdly, there is heightened
demand for purpose-based business models, given the need to find profitable solutions to society's challenges.

The above resulted in continued investment in the model, strengthened by its ongoing recognition and adoption, and by the data supporting its efficacy across
industries. This manifested in developments across the business model's value chain (attraction, conversion, pricing, behaviour change, retention) including the
following: development of a Resilience Index, linking Vitality engagement to the risk of COVID-19 complications; the continued roll-out of Discovery's integrated
capabilities to the global market, courtesy of its V1 platform; the evolution of Discovery Health's leading digital healthcare platform; and AI Quote, an artificial
intelligence quoting tool offering personalised advice to prospective clients.

By leveraging established structures for sharing value combined with sophisticated data tracking and analytics capabilities, the Group was able to rapidly respond to
client needs and provide concessions. Over R750 million was offered to individuals and employers enabling them to continue receiving cover; and a total of R12 billion
was generated in the form of shared value for clients in FY20, spanning premium discounts, cash backs, boosts and value added by managing care.
Business-specific performance

Discovery's Ambition 2023 remains the strategic focus for the medium term, with the goal of being a leading financial services organisation globally, positively
influencing 100 million lives - with 10 million directly insured - and being a powerful force for social good.
Key to achieving this is Discovery's execution of market-specific strategies, namely:

- South Africa: a disruptive composite model, with market-leading businesses and a successful entry into banking
- United Kingdom: a differentiated offering through a composite Vitality Shared-Value business model
- Ping An Health: the leading health insurer in China with over 50 million clients
- Vitality Group: a sophisticated global behaviour-change platform linked to financial services


South Africa

The SA business demonstrated resilience amid the difficult economic and operating environment. Excluding new initiatives, combined new business reduced by 4% to
R12 278 million and operating profit increased by 11% to R8 302 million before the COVID-19 provision (reducing by 3% after). Cash generation across the established
SA businesses was also strong at R5.4 billion and all entities have shown increases in their capital positions.


Discovery Health

Financial resilience

Discovery Health (DH) delivered a strong financial performance despite the challenging period. Normalised operating profit increased by 5% to R3 190 million and total
revenue grew 8% to R8 373 million, with non-scheme revenue showing accelerated growth of 23%. Total new business API decreased by 9% to R6 101 million, affected
by the difficult economic environment and contraction in employment, which translated into a marked year-on-year decline of new business from newly recruited
employees joining existing employee groups. The business continued to tightly control management expenses, resulting in a 1.4% decrease in operational expenses on
a per-member basis (excl. non-recurring COVID-19-related costs). DH made progress in growing non-scheme retail products through Discovery Primary Care, Gap Cover
and Healthy Company, which now account for c.184 000 lives under DH administration and contribute 3% to overall DH revenue.

Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) continued to perform excellently, growing open medical scheme market share to 56.8% in a declining market. The operating
result and solvency were higher than expected as a result of the reduction in health system utilisation during lockdown, which included a 27.5% reduction in hospital
admissions at the end of August 2020. Notwithstanding this higher-than-anticipated surplus, the contribution increase for 2021 must be sufficient to sustain a small
operating surplus and keep up with the utilisation catch-up, in order to mitigate the risk of a high contribution increase for 2022, by which time utilisation is expected to
have recovered fully from the depressed levels due to COVID-19. The surplus built up is thus projected to reverse in 2021 following catch-up of normal non-COVID-19
healthcare utilisation, deferred hospital admissions, a likely muted annual contribution increase and the full year's impact of COVID-19 costs.


Discovery Life

Financial Resilience

Discovery Life (DL) delivered a strong operating performance despite the challenging environment. Claims experience improved significantly compared to FY19,
supporting a 25% increase in normalised operational earnings, pre-COVID-19 provisioning, to R4 029 million (down 8% to R2 971 million after the provision). New
business decreased by 1% to R2 286 million, with strong Automatic Contribution Increases (+10%) and the total in-force premium up by 7%. DL delivered positive
operational experience variances overall and on all key metrics other than policy alterations, given the allowance and take-up of COVID-19 premium relief options and
other buy downs during the lockdown period. The business's financial position remains robust with strong cash flow generation of R2.4 billion, increasing the tangible
free assets to R4.1 billion (both including Discovery Invest) to provide high levels of liquidity. The solvency cover ratio also increased to 182% from 159% at FY19.


Discovery Invest

Financial Resilience

Discovery Invest's performance reflected the challenges of COVID-19 and volatile financial markets. Total Assets under Administration increased by 8% to R99 billion.
Assets under Management increased by 2% to R62.8 billion, with linked funds placed in Discovery funds remaining impressive at 78.3%, down slightly on the prior year
following more conservative investor allocations. Operating profit fell by 14% to R830 million on the back of tax changes, investment in the Invest International launch
and significant sales of Guaranteed Plans during a high period of volatility on the yield curve. Net inflows amounted to R7.6 billion over the period, a decrease of 9.6%,
while new business remained resilient, growing by 2% to R2 667 million.


Discovery Insure

Financial Resilience

Performance was robust over the period, achieving R246 million operating profit (including the share of profit from CMT) - up 59% on the prior year. The Shared-Value
model proposition was evident during this period: enhanced profitability, through reduced claims during lockdown and favourable lapse experience due to better-than-
market client credit profiles, was shared with clients in the form of boosted rewards, to the value of R70 million. New business recovered by year-end to record levels.
Gross Premium Income grew by 14% to R3.7 billion with 6% market share, while gross new business API grew by 5% to R1.1 billion, estimated at between 10% and 15%
market share.


Discovery Bank

Financial Resilience and Operational Progress

Discovery Bank's performance was pleasing, with over 370 000 accounts at end June (489 000 at 13 September) and deposits of R2.4 billion (R3.7 billion at 13
September). Total credit limits granted were R5.5 billion of which R2.0 billion was utilised (R9.6 billion at 13 September with R3.7 billion utilised). The year under review
represented the first year of the Bank's operation. Given the onset of COVID-19, the Bank implemented three strategies, namely; ensuring the successful migration of
over 220 000 Discovery Card accounts from First National Bank to Discovery Bank; pursuing a deposit-led growth strategy, while ensuring the quality of the loan book
and maintaining the quantum spent on the Bank's build within budget; and ensuring rapid learnings from the Shared-Value model to constantly improve the Bank's
user experience and value proposition.

All three strategies were successfully deployed with a system uptime of 99.9%. By the reporting date, the migration was successfully completed and retail deposits
exceeded the loan book, resulting in the Bank having significant surplus liquidity of R3.8 billion and capital strength. The quality of deposits was strong with 65% of
deposits from clients with a Diamond Vitality Money status. The loan book was excellent with arrears 60% lower than market arrears. The Bank's value proposition has
been significantly enhanced via a more accessible Vitality Money experience, more powerful Discovery Miles, and a more intuitive user experience. These
enhancements will be announced at the end of September 2020.


United Kingdom

Financial Resilience

The UK business was affected by the difficult economic and operating environment driven by COVID-19 and persistent low interest rates, among other elements. Over
the period, in respect of the established businesses, combined new business reduced by 12% to £126.3 million (R2 495 million), operating profit increased by 28% to
£93.1 million (R1 840 million) (prior to the COVID-19 reserve, reducing by 61% to £28.2 million (R558 million) after), while total covered lives exceeded 1.3 million, an
increase of 7%.


VitalityHealth

Financial Resilience

VH continued to deliver robust results despite the impact of COVID-19. Operating profit grew 2% to £42.0 million (up 9% to R830 million), which includes the addition of
a significant unearned premium reserve (UPR) set up to better match the earning of premiums with the expected delay in the submission of policyholder claims to
FY21. Operating profit grew 89% to £78.1 million (up 104% to R1 543 million) before setting up this UPR adjustment. New business declined by 15% to £62.7 million (-8%
to R1 238 million) in a challenging sales environment. Despite this, strong retention meant that total lives reached 682 000, up 6%, while earned premiums grew 8% to
£496.8 million (up 16% to R9 813 million), before the additional UPR. The back book was strongly cash flow positive, generating £76.3 million in cash. After new business
acquisition costs and investment in developing the business, VH generated a £57.6 million cash surplus (including the additional UPR).


VitalityLife (VL)

Financial Resilience

VL's normalised operating profit before the COVID-19 provision was 52% lower at £15 million (49% lower at R297 million). After the COVID-19 provision, the normalised
operating loss totalled £13.8 million (R272 million). New business API reduced by 10% to £63.6 million (down 3% to R1 257 million), while earned premiums grew
strongly by 11% to £288.8 million (R5 705 million). Lives covered and in-force policies both grew by 8%, exceeding 621 000 and 470 000 respectively.

Prior to the pandemic, VL faced challenges due to the difficult environment including Brexit uncertainty and persistent low interest rates in combination with challenges
relating to its lapse experience. In response, VL initiated a plan to right-size the business, implemented a hedge for the low and volatile interest rate environment, and
introduced key actions to mitigate lapse risk. COVID-19 introduced additional complexity, which saw VL establish a provision in light of the uncertainty around the
potential impact on claims and lapses over the next 18 months.


Ping An Health (PAH)

Financial Resilience

PAH delivered a solid performance. Total revenue(3) grew by 56% to RMB13.4 billion and new business premium by 33% to RMB6.5 billion. This growth was mainly
driven by strong channel support for its flagship eShengBao product and continued persistency improvements. Sales of this product, which lends itself to online
purchase, did well during the relatively limited COVID-19 lockdown period in China. Profit from operations, represented by the Group's share of after-tax operating
profit less the costs to support the business, grew by 72% to R182 million supported by positive investment returns.

3 Revenue includes policies written on Ping An Health's own insurance license, as well as policies written on Ping An Life's license and directly reinsured to 
  PAH based on the reinsurance treaty terms


Vitality Group

Financial Resilience

Vitality Group (VG) delivered excellent results in a difficult period. Profit of $19.6 million (R308 million) was up 73% from the prior year. Sales showed good progress,
with fee income growing 11% to $72.3 million (R1.1 billion(4)) and insurance partners' integrated premiums reaching $1 billion (R15.8 billion) - an endorsement of the
resilient business model upon which the business is built. Vitality now has a global presence across 24 markets (including the primary markets SA and the UK). Total
Vitality membership grew to 4.1 million, of which 1.5 million are administered on Vitality1, the globally unified systems architecture platform. Membership from
insurance partners' integrated products grew to 1.8 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year.

4 Excludes services related to system implementation and other cost recoveries and rewards


Vitality USA

Vitality USA delivered a pleasing set of results, growing profits 19% from the prior year and membership by 35%. The performance can be attributed in part to a
strategic partnership with Trustmark (an employee benefits company headquartered in Illinois) that drove new business, and changes implemented to optimise the
sales and distribution structures. These strategies are also expected to ensure that the strong performance is sustained going forward and mitigate some of the
challenges expected as a result of COVID-19.

Prospects for growth

Discovery's Shared-Value business model positions it well to deliver continued operational resilience despite the challenging macro environment. Discovery has also
provided for the expected future financial impacts of COVID-19 on claims and lapses to December 2021 during the 2020 financial year. The effect of continued interest
rate volatility is expected to remain a feature of the reported results in the case of Discovery Life, however the hedge in the UK is expected to remove the volatility for
VitalityLife. Solvency, cash and capital are not expected to be negatively impacted by these interest rate movements in SA; and normalised earnings will not be
impacted.

Discovery's Ambition 2023 remains the strategic focus for the medium-term. The Group is well positioned for growth over its planning horizon to 2023, with the capital
plan able to fund its new initiatives. The businesses within the South African composite have created significant insurgency and the composite is well positioned to
continue the SA growth trajectory. The UK composite is embryonic, however the actions taken over the period were key to ensure sustainability in the current
environment and have positioned the business to capitalise in a normalised environment. Vitality Group through capabilities and partnerships is well-placed to leverage
the growing acceptance of the Shared- Value business model. Ping An Health remains committed to investing for longer-term growth, rather than looking to extract
profit or cash in the short to medium-term. Despite the Group's strong capital position, due to the uncertain and potentially volatile economic environment caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Discovery Board has decided not to declare an ordinary dividend for the year ended 30 June 2020.

Further Trading Statement for the year ended 30 June 2020

Shareholders are referred to the detailed trading statement released by Discovery on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service
(SENS) on 15 June 2020 - issued to provide guidance on the potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic - and relating to the
expected financial performance of Discovery for the full year ended 30 June 2020. Discovery is currently in the process of
finalising its financial year-end results and this trading statement serves as a further update.

Continued operating performance resilience
In line with the guidance previously provided, Discovery expects its financial performance for the year ended 30 June 2020
to be resilient, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during the period:
• Normalised operating profit growth is expected to increase by between 5% and 15%, before the establishment of a
  provision for COVID-19 effects, which are expected to emerge post the reporting period;
• Core new business is expected to increase 4%, with similar trends as reported in the previous trading statement; and
• The overall lapse and claims experience has been resilient for the period, with the performance in June 2020 broadly
  similar to the trends seen in the initial stages of the pandemic, as reported in the previous trading statement.

Significant provision for future COVID-19 effects of approximately R3.3bn, in line with previous guidance
In the previous trading statement, Discovery estimated the expected future cost of the COVID-19 pandemic effect to be
approximately R3.3 billion, based on its central (prudent best-estimate) scenario. Taking emerging data into account,
Discovery remains confident that the R3.3 billion estimate is sufficient to provide for the COVID-19 effect post the reporting
period. The impact on normalised profit from operations is still expected to be partially offset by discretionary margins.

Continued volatility in long-term interest rates in both SA and the UK negatively affecting headline earnings
There were significant movements in long-term interest rates in SA and the UK during the period under review - continuing
from the previous SENS announcement to the end of the reporting period, with negative real rates of return in the UK and
positive real rates of return in SA both at historic levels. This volatility has a significant impact on policy values and headline
earnings, but no impact on cash flows, solvency and capital in SA and, since the implementation of the hedge strategy, little
impact in the UK, and will be normalised out of the Group’s financial results, with it having no bearing on operating
performance. The estimated impact of this provided in the previous trading statement was R3.5 billion but, with continued
volatility to the end of the reporting period, it is now estimated to have a further R1.3 billion impact.

The following table summarises the position.
Table 1: Forecast change over prior year
                                                                                              
Metrics                                                                               Forecast % change        Impact since previous
                                                                                      over prior year          trading update
Group normalised profit from operations before allowing for COVID-19 provision        +5% to +15%              no change
Group normalised profit from operations after allowing for COVID-19 provision         -18% to -28%             no change
Group normalised headline earnings                                                    -20% to -30%             no change
Headline earnings (after the impact of long-term interest rates)                      -90% to -100%            Revised

Shareholders are therefore advised that given the above factors:
• Normalised headline earnings per share are expected to remain within the range of between 20% and 30% lower (to
  between 617.5 cps and 540.3 cps compared to reported 771.9 cps for the prior financial year)
• Headline earnings per share are expected to be between 90% and 100% lower (to between 78.9 cps and 0 cps compared
  to reported 789.0 cps for the prior financial year)
• Basic earnings per share are expected to be between 95% and 105% lower (to between 50.1 cps and -50.1 cps compared
  to reported 1 001.5 cps for the prior financial year)

Discovery's financial results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are due to be released on SENS on 16 September 2020.
The information contained in this announcement, including any estimated or forecast financial information on which this
trading statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by Discovery's external auditors.

Trading Statement for the year ending 30 June 2020 and update regarding the COVID-19 pandemic

1.   Preamble: the COVID-19 context

Over the past four months, COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to lives and economies worldwide. As at 14 June
2020, total infections and deaths climbed to over 65,000 and 1,400 respectively in South Africa; 290,000 and 40,000 in the
United Kingdom; and two million and 110,000 in the US. In addition to its health impacts, the pandemic has driven extreme
market volatility, as evidenced by interest rates and equity market movements. For insurers specifically, COVID-19 has
created a uniquely-complex operating and economic environment, with pressure on new business, lapse rates, and potential
future claims; and volatility in interest rates and investment returns.

2.   Financial performance

The financial performance of Discovery for the full year ending 30 June 2020 is expected to consist of:
• A resilient operating performance despite the uniquely-complex COVID-19 environment;
• The creation of a significant provision for expected future COVID-19 effects so that on the Group’s expected scenario
  all claims and economic effects of the pandemic are carried fully in the FY20 year; and
• Materially volatile long-term interest rates in both SA and the UK negatively affecting headline earnings.

In the financial performance commentary that follows, normalised operating profit and normalised headline earnings
exclude the impact of long-term interest rate changes but not the impact of COVID-19 effects. Basic earnings and headline
earnings include the impact of interest rate effects.

The financial performance is summarised as follows:
• New business increased 4% for the eleven months ended 31 May 2020 compared to the prior corresponding period.
• Normalised profit from operations before providing for potential future COVID-19 impacts for the year ending 30 June
  2020 is expected to be between 15% to 25% higher excluding the results of Discovery Bank, and between 5% to 15%
  higher including the results of Discovery Bank.
• Approximately R3.3 billion will be provided for potential future COVID-19 impacts.
• Normalised profit from operations is expected to be between 18% and 28% lower than the prior year, after including
  the potential future COVID-19 impacts.
• Normalised headline earnings is expected to be between 20% and 30% lower than the prior year.
• Headline earnings will be affected by the significant rise in interest rates in South Africa due to COVID-19 and the ratings
  downgrade, and the historically low rates in the UK. Given basic and headline earnings include this effect, these
  measures are very difficult to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty, and could potentially result in a decline of
  those measures between 70% to 90% compared to the prior year.

The following table summarises the position.

3.   Responding to the pandemic: priorities and methodology

The Group’s COVID-19 response prioritised three groups: employees, clients and broader society.
                                                                                                                            
3.1 Protecting employees
Interventions were two-pronged: first, ensuring employee safety, including developing and implementing sophisticated
methodology to identify and protect roughly 2,200 high-risk individuals across SA and UK. Second, balancing employee safety
with business continuity. This involved enabling over 11,000 employees globally to work remotely, with transport and safety
provisions for those deemed essential workers unable to work from home. Throughout, service levels have remained stable.

3.2 Supporting clients
Using Discovery’s data and modelling expertise, interventions focused on identifying members most at risk; and product
innovation across SA and the UK to ensure relevant cover in the current context, while maintaining financial resilience.
Discovery data corroborates published data that the elderly and those with co-morbidities are disproportionately affected;
with emerging evidence that a healthy lifestyle, as measured by Vitality engagement – and formalised in a proprietary
Resilience Index – protects against COVID-19 complications. As a result, more than 30,000 medium to high risk individuals
were identified across the Group, followed by personalised contact. In addition, Discovery enabled employers to further
reach out to their over 100,000 medium to high risk employees.

Innovations included the launch of new COVID-19 specific products (such as the WHO Global Outbreak Benefit and COVID-
19 cash benefit); product enhancements across markets and business lines to cater for COVID-19; and adapting Vitality to
account for the “at home” context (more than 300,000 workouts have been logged online during the COVID-19 crisis in SA
and the UK). Furthermore, the Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model lends itself to COVID-19 concessions, by effectively
unlocking financial value contained in future good health; and over R700 million has been offered to individuals and
employers to date.

3.3 Bolstering communities
Discovery leveraged assets and resources towards providing industry support and playing a nation building role. Discovery
has worked closely with the relevant industry and community bodies to share knowledge and expertise; and has extended
access of its digital platform (DrConnect) for free COVID-19 doctor consultations, to all South Africans.

4.   Resilient operating performance amidst a challenging and volatile macro environment

4.1 Actuarial dynamics during the early COVID-19 cycle
While the impacts of COVID-19 are still in the early stages of the cycle, the operating performance of Discovery has been
resilient in volatile and even extreme conditions:
1. The nature of the products is deemed essential. In the case of COVID-19 the need for both life and health insurance has
   increased, and the lapse experience below illustrates the trade-off between essential need and affordability.
2. The specific Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model creates value for both the healthy and sick, thereby creating a stickier
   client base. The integrated nature of the products adds to this stickiness, with the lapse rate differential between clients
   with one product, compared to those with three or more, being more than 60%.
3. The Vitality Shared-Value Insurance model creates unique structures that have been used to offer valuable concessions
   to customers experiencing difficulties - Discovery Life’s Payback Benefit allows clients to unlock the financial value
   contained in their future good health and Discovery Insure’s Vitality Drive enables cash to be refunded based on the
   extent of driving, and has reduced lapse rates dramatically. As mentioned above, over R700 million has been offered to
   individuals and employers to date.
4. Discovery’s client base is weighted towards the retail affluent segment wherein affordability through difficult economic
   conditions is more robust. The average sum assured in Discovery Life is roughly R2.8 million and 87% of clients are
   classified in the highest socio-economic rating class (earning above R50,000 p.m. or having a tertiary degree).

The following table illustrates the effect of these dynamics.

•      Discovery Life’s new business1 held up well in April and May, and lapses have been low, possibly due to the premium
       relief options that have been made available to clients. Total claims were below expectation during the two months,
       and there were less than five COVID-19 related lump sum claims.
•      Discovery Health’s new business growth slowed, due to minimal new employees being added by existing customers.
       Schemes under Discovery Health’s administration experienced much lower withdrawals and claims during the two
       months. The reduction in claims was driven by the postponement of discretionary and elective healthcare procedures,
       which is expected to reverse. COVID-19 related claims are expected for the period.
•      Discovery Insure’s personal lines lapses were much lower than expected, potentially a result of the dynamic pricing
       structure that was introduced. However as expected, motor downgrades increased during the two months. Motor
       claims were significantly below expectation, but should return to normal levels as lockdown restrictions ease.
•      Discovery Invest saw an increase in paid-up policies during the two months, but funds were sticky with withdrawals
       much lower than expected.
•      Vitality Health saw lower lapses than expected, potentially also a result of the premium relief products that were
       introduced. Similar to Discovery Health, it experienced much lower claims due to the postponement of elective
       treatment as well as the NHS co-opting private hospitals to support patient treatment. Vitality Health intends to reserve
       for this temporary drop in claims volumes given the expectation for claims to be caught up once the pandemic is over.
       This will be included in the Group’s reserve for potential future COVID-19 impacts.
•      Vitality Life lapses showed no sign of increase due to the pandemic, but claims were higher than expected, largely driven
       by COVID-19 related mortality claims as the UK is further in the pandemic cycle.

4.2 New business
Despite the effects of COVID-19 illustrated above, core new business annualised premium income for the Group increased
by 4% for the eleven months ended 31 May 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year. The SA and UK businesses
responded to the social distancing and lockdowns in place with strong digital support for advisors.

Ping An Health saw its strongest sales throughout the COVID-19 period, to some degree benefitting from the lockdown, as
the product can be completed through an online channel, enabling the sales to continue via brokers or direct-to-consumer
through Ping An Health’s own app during the lockdown period.

4  Excludes new initiatives.

5  Excludes new initiatives.

•   SA Composite: Resilient performance across the businesses, with a quick response to COVID-19. Discovery Health in
    particular has increased its spend on servicing and infrastructure to ensure greater support to clients during the early
    stages of the pandemic. Discovery Life’s performance for the eleven months was bolstered by positive experience
    variances across key metrics. Discovery Invest’s revenue is linked to the market value of underlying funds managed –                                                                                                                                                  
    which reduced significantly during March and April 2020, however these have improved more recently. Discovery Insure
    was one of the the first short term insurers to adjust its premiums and rewards criteria for customers driving less.
•   UK Composite: Vitality Health had a strong performance due to claims dynamics explained above. Vitality Life’s
    experience is framed by challenges created by the low interest rate environment that has reduced significantly since
    the Brexit vote, and combined with the emerging COVID-19 environment, the effect is an additive deterioration in the
    claims and lapse experience. As communicated, management have instituted an intense programme to right size Vitality
    Life for this environment which consists of a number of key initiatives to be largely completed by the start of the Group’s
    FY21 year. In addition, provisions are being made in this year for future COVID-19 impacts based on the Group’s prudent
    best estimate COVID-19 modelling scenario, as part of the Group’s overall provision.
•   Vitality Group: Good performance despite a temporary slow-down of insurance partner sales due to COVID-19
    lockdowns. The business is well diversified across geographies, with a significant part of its earnings being USD based,
    and revenue arrangements are a blend of fixed and performance-based fees.
•   Ping An Health: Strong performance driven by the exceptional new business experience.
•   Investment in new initiatives: New initiatives remain a key strategic focus, despite revenue growth expected to be more
    challenging in the period. The Group remains confident about the potential of new initiatives having taken some
    strategic shifts to allow for the different market conditions over the next few periods.
•   Discovery Bank: The migrations of the Discovery Card client base into the Bank have been successful and progressing
    rapidly, with the full migration expected to be completed by end July 2020. The Bank continues to attract new clients
    with its fully digital 24/7 on boarding process – with over 177,000 clients and 330,000 accounts. Deposit growth has
    also continued at a strong trajectory. Discovery Bank has over R2.1 billion in retail deposits. Overall credit utilisation has
    declined during the lockdown and arrears including non-performing loans are still within expectation.

4.4 Approximately R3.3 billion for future potential COVID-19 impacts
Discovery anticipates reserving R3.3 billion for the potential claims and lapse impact of COVID-19 that are projected to
emerge in future periods. This will be partially offset by discretionary margins, with the result that normalised profit from
operations is expected to be between 18% and 28% lower than the prior year. As set out below, the modelling has been
done on a prudent actuarial basis, and is continually being refined by incorporating trends in actual infections and mortality.

The COVID-19 provision has been calculated to estimate the future mortality, morbidity and economic effects of the
pandemic by estimating excess mortality and excess lapses expected to arise in 2021 and 2022 on a variety of scenarios by
setting a stressed, central (prudent best estimate) and light scenario. The central scenario has been used to set the provision,
while the stressed scenario used to test capital and liquidity; the light scenario would result in a material release of provisions
in future years.

In terms of mortality, the key areas of impact are Discovery Life and Vitality Life and the modelling uses the United Kingdom’s
Imperial College studies as a basis for Infection Fatality Rates, in combination with SEIR models based on local observed and
modeled infection reproductive rates to ascertain the duration and impact of the pandemic on the Discovery Life and Vitality
Life insured populations. While the UK is at a more advanced stage of the epidemic than SA, both markets are still subject
to significant uncertainty at this stage, hence a prudent modeling approach has been assumed in both cases.

Excess Health claims in the UK will arise due to the delay of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 period as private hospital
capacity has been co-opted by the NHS. These delayed effects have been modeled and estimated as part of the central
scenario, in addition to claims arising for COVID-19 admissions.

The economic effects were modeled to take account of the economic stresses, particularly on policy lapses, in all of
Discovery’s businesses under the range of scenarios.

In summary, approximately two thirds of the R3.3 billion COVID-19 provision is made up of mortality and morbidity impacts,
with a third from economic impacts. The provision is the aggregate value of these effects expected in 2021 and 2022.

Included in presentation of normalised headline earnings
Although the allowance for the COVID-19 impact is an abnormal provision for future impacts, it is not excluded in the
presentation of normalised headline earnings because it is seen as part of the core operations and will impact future cash
flows.

4.5 The effect of long-term interest rates on IFRS reported earnings
There has been substantial volatility in global markets and in particular, material increases in long-term nominal and real
interest rates in South Africa and low interest rates in the United Kingdom. These result in materially different valuation
rates that are used to discount future cash flows and will emerge as economic assumption changes. For Discovery Life this
impact manifests as a lower discounted value of future cash flows, even though the actual cash flows themselves are not
materially affected. Solvency and liquidity within Discovery Life are not negatively impacted by the higher long- term interest
rates in South Africa.
                                                                                                                                
Based on yields as at 31 May 2020, the impact on profit from operations due to the economic basis change in Discovery Life
would be an approximately R2.7 billion negative effect compared to what it would have been at rates prevailing at the
previous year-end. The effect on the Group’s headline earnings of these interest rate movements will depend on the actual
level of long-term interest rates at the year-end reporting date.

In the UK, Vitality Life’s yield-sensitive back book was protected against further interest rate declines, achieved through a
25-year interest rate hedge that was implemented in October 2019. The hedge reduces cash flow and capital requirement
volatility. The passive interest rate used to discount future cash flows is expected to be reset for the first time at 30 June
2020 and will lead to an IFRS valuation strain in Vitality Life, partially offset by the valuation of the hedge. As communicated
at interims, excluding any basis risk, this would equate to a net negative impact of approximately GBP 40 million for the
financial year.

Excluded in presentation of normalised headline earnings
The recent significant interest rate movements resulted in IFRS valuation strains in respect of Discovery Life and Vitality Life.
Should the observed reference interest rates revert, these valuation strains will reverse. Given there is no bearing on
operating performance, Discovery will exclude the effect in the reported normalised earnings measures. Doing so (excluding
the effect of economic assumptions in the normalised earnings), is directionally consistent with the treatment in IFRS 17
Insurance Contracts, which permits the changes in economic assumptions to be presented in Other Comprehensive Income
(OCI).

4.6 Headline earnings
Shareholders are therefore advised that:
Normalised headline earnings per share (NHEPS) will be between 20% and 30% lower (to between 617.52 cps and 540.33
cps compared to reported 771.9 cps for the prior period).

When including the economic basis changes in headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS), the final
outcome is very volatile as it is largely dependent upon movement in the real and nominal interest rates in South Africa
towards the end of the year. Shareholders are further advised that using current estimates of long-term interest rates in
South Africa:
• Headline earnings per share are expected to be between 70% and 90% lower (to between 236.7 cps and 78.9 cps
  compared to reported 789.0 cps for the prior period).
• Basic earnings per share are expected to be between 70% and 90% lower (to between 300.5 cps and 100.2 cps
  compared to reported 1 001.5 cps for the prior period).

4.7 Capital and liquidity
Discovery is confident that the Group is strong under high stress scenarios, with sufficient liquidity and solvency to weather
uncertain conditions. Capital ratios are expected to remain broadly in the same range as December levels, and above
targeted levels, even after the above considerations. The cash buffer is expected to remain within or above the target range,
with minimal recourse to additional debt.

The resilience of the Group was tested by extensive claims and lapse stresses, with deliberately prudent scenarios. Detailed
epidemiological models were deployed to inform actuarial provisions, and to develop a wide range of scenarios both
nationally and for Discovery’s insured population.

4.8 Dividend policy
Due to the uncertain and potentially volatile economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Discovery will not
be recommending the payment of ordinary dividends. The reintroduction of dividends will be considered when appropriate.

5.   Outlook

Despite a very complex and difficult trading environment the Group remains optimistic about potential growth and
continues to build for the future. In particular:
• In a post COVID-19 environment the issues of health, wellness, and resilience are likely to be fundamental and
  Discovery’s Shared-Value Insurance model will be well placed to capitalise on this in the markets in which it operates.
• The provision for expected COVID-19 effects going forward will mean that on the Group’s prudent best estimate
  assumption, strong growth should revert.

It must be pointed out that the operating environment is complex and volatile and scenarios going forward may be worse
than expected, in which case the Group’s growth would be lower than expected. The Group is confident that it maintains
sufficient liquidity and solvency to weather uncertain conditions.

The Group continues to cautiously monitor how the impact of COVID-19 evolves and its impact on trading conditions.
                                                                                                                              
The information contained in this announcement, including any forecast financial information on which this trading
statement is based, has not been reviewed and reported on by Discovery's external auditors.

Robust performance in a complex period with substantial investment in new initiatives and core businesses performing well with the exception of VitalityLife

Financial performance

Over the six months ended 31 December 2019, all of Discovery's established and emerging businesses, with the exception of VitalityLife, produced robust operating
results. VitalityLife was largely impacted by its previously-announced strategic decision to mitigate its exposure to further interest rate declines in the United Kingdom.
In addition, the Group continued its increased investment into new strategic initiatives - with Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest and Vitality1 showing encouraging traction,
and spend fully provided for in the capital plan.

As a result, Discovery's normalised profit from operations decreased by 7% to R3 551 million, headline earnings decreased by 9% to R2 047 million and normalised
headline earnings decreased by 11% to R2 117 million. New business annualised premium income (API) increased by 17% to R11 116 million (and by 5% to R9 523
million excluding Vitality Group and the take-on of new closed medical schemes in Discovery Health).

In terms of the operating model, the established businesses delivered a robust performance, with profit of R4 301 million, 3% higher than the prior period despite the
loss in VitalityLife. The emerging businesses grew strongly, delivering a combined profit of R253 million, 50% higher than the prior period. In addition, the Group
invested R1 003 million in new strategic initiatives, an increase of 81% over the prior period. Spend on new initiatives is weighted towards the first half of the year and
expected to decrease in the second half. Of this spend, 53% was dedicated to Discovery Bank, which is expected to remain the dominant investment going forward.
Performance of cash and capital metrics remained within guidance, with the Group's Financial Leverage Ratio at 24.3%(1) and the cash buffer at R2.5 billion.

1 Excludes capitalised lease liabilities under the newly adopted IFRS16 and bank borrowings related to normal course lending and borrowing activities.

Normalised headline earnings per share (diluted)(2) decreased by 12% to 322.3 cents and headline earnings per share (diluted)(2) decreased by 10% to 311.7 cents.

Ambition 2023 and Discovery's unique foundation

2 The percentage change in the current period is the same for both undiluted and diluted earnings per share.

As previously mentioned, Discovery has set a bold Ambition for 2023, of being a leading financial services organisation globally, positively influencing 100 million lives -
with 10 million directly insured - and being a powerful force for social good. Central to achieving this is Discovery's unique foundation - its core purpose, values, people
and brand, which all inform a recursive R&D agenda that continually refines the Shared-Value model.

Over the period, there was substantial advancement of the Group's R&D agenda, including ongoing development of Shared-Value capability across the Group (Vitality
Money, Active Rewards 2020); industry capability across silos (Bank, corporate productivity and Shared-Value health insurance) and across all aspects of Discovery's
value chain (Vitality D2C, Vitality Running World Cup).

The globalisation of Discovery's Vitality Shared-Value model is being enabled by Vitality1, the globally unified systems platform. Vitality1 is live in nine markets after 18
months of operating, touching two million members and creating efficiencies in rolling out in new markets. Every day the platform logs more than four million workouts
and allocates more than 35 000 rewards.

As mentioned previously, achieving the Ambition will require continued execution of market-specific strategies:

- South Africa: a disruptive composite model, with market-leading businesses and a successful entry into banking
- United Kingdom: a differentiated offering through a composite Vitality Shared-Value model
- Ping An Health: the leading health insurer in China with over 50 million clients
- Vitality Group: a sophisticated global behaviour-change platform linked to financial services

South Africa

Discovery Bank

During the period, focus was on leveraging key strategic advantages to build a retail-heavy bank of scale; demonstrating the efficacy of the Vitality Shared-Value model
in banking and creating an appealing customer proposition; using Discovery's unique data capability; and executing on a lower cost-to-income FinTech infrastructure
- ultimately ensuring the Bank is a composite maker for the Group.

As at 18 February 2020, Discovery Bank had 78 000 clients with 180 000 accounts, nearly half of which had never held a Discovery Card before; deposits had grown
strongly to R1.2 billion; total credit card spend was R2.6 billion and total credit limits granted was R2.5 billion - with over R1 billion in credit facility used. Early member
engagement is positive and the client base is exhibiting appealing spend, credit, arrears and deposit behaviour, better than the performance of the previous Discovery
Card and considerably better than the market. Growth potential is strong with over 200 000 accounts that still need to be migrated from the FNB Joint Venture; and the
activation of Discovery's advisor channels to sell bank accounts in the second half of the year.

Discovery Health

The strategic focus over the period was on sustaining growth in a contracting medical scheme market; managing medical inflation while optimising cost and quality;
reducing administration costs while maximising service; and ensuring the increasing financial strength and competitive position of Discovery Health Medical Scheme
(DHMS).

Discovery Health (DH) delivered a resilient performance, with normalised operating profit increasing by 8% to R1 575 million. Total new business API (including take-on
of new closed medical schemes) grew by 26% to R4 367 million.

New business API (excluding Vitality and the take-on of new closed medical schemes) was affected by the challenging economic environment and slower employment
growth, declining 4% relative to the prior period, though still robust at R3 289 million. Traditional new membership from employees joining DHMS employer group
clients, which has historically characterised DHMS growth, has retracted and is being replaced by individual members joining DHMS in their personal capacity; the ratio
of these sources of growth has thus inverted. DHMS delivered a strong performance, with a projected positive operating result before investment income, and solvency
of 27.3% for the scheme year ending 31 December 2019(3). The average contributions of DHMS are 16.7% lower than those of competitors per unit of healthcare
benefit.

3 Note that the DHMS results remain subject to finalisation through the annual independent audit currently underway

Discovery Life

The strategic focus over the period was on optimising growth and quality of new business; achieving positive operational experience variances; ensuring balance and
correct correlations within the Shared-Value model; and ensuring products have relevance through member value and engagement.

Discovery Life (DL) had an excellent period, growing earnings by 25% to R1 875 million (off a low base) as a result of improving claims experience and pleasing all-round
performance. New business grew 2% to R1 240 million in a declining market, resulting in over 31% market share in the retail affluent risk market - more than double
the next largest competitor. DL performed strongly against EV assumptions with improvement across all non-economic experience such as claims, lapses, policy
alterations and Vitality status experience, leading to a positive overall EV variance in Life and Invest. The business remains well capitalised with an above-target SCR
coverage of 172%, and generated cash in line with plan.

Discovery Invest

The strategic focus over the period was on growing new business and assets under management in a market attracting low inflows; evolving a unique long-term
Shared-Value model in a market experiencing commoditisation and market pressure; and ensuring superior overall financial outcomes for customers.

Discovery Invest's performance was robust in an environment of weakened inflows. Operating profit grew by 7% to R485 million and assets under administration by
16% to R96.7 billion, driven by improved market performance at the end of the period. Over 78% of linked funds were placed in Discovery funds. Net inflows were
strong relative to the industry at R2.3 billion. Sales were affected by the weak inflow environment, seeing new business (including ACIs) declining by 2% to R1 357
million. The Discovery Balanced Fund continued to perform well and was in the first performance quartile in its sector for three, five, and ten years(4). At the end of the
third quarter, Discovery Collective Investments was the sixth highest retail flow taker, excluding money market funds, with a substantial proportion of flows going to
high-margin business.

Discovery Insure

The strategic focus over the period was on quality growth in the mass affluent space and ensuring the integrity of the Shared-Value model so that with duration - profit,
scale and materiality emerge.

Discovery Insure (DI) saw strong growth during the period, achieving R75 million operating profit - up 21% on the prior year. Gross Premium Income grew by 15% to
R1.8 billion while gross new business API grew by 7% to R551 million. Gross Written Premium (personal lines only) market share was estimated at 6%.

United Kingdom

The strategic focus over the period was on pursuing the composite strategy. For the six months, combined new business increased by 12% to £76.4 million (R1 416
million, up 14%) and total lives exceeded 1.29 million, an increase of 12%. Normalised operating profit for VitalityHealth (VH) and VitalityLife (VL) reduced by 52% to
£19.5 million (R361 million) - after the impact of interest rates and the interest rate hedge for VL. The hedged position provides a greater degree of certainty and
enables operating within risk tolerance levels.

VitalityHealth

The strategic focus over the period was on maintaining exceptional quality of new business; delivering personalised healthcare pathways through digital; and ensuring
service quality.

VitalityHealth continued to deliver strong results. Operating profit grew by 9% to £26.7 million (up 11% to R495 million), although new business declined by 2% to £33.1
million (0.5% to R613 million) in a challenging sales environment, characterised by economic uncertainty and aggressive competitor activity. Total lives reached 674 000,
up 12%, while earned premiums grew 9% to £246.5 million (R4 569 million). The results reflect continued strong performance across key business metrics: the lapse
rate and claims performance was stable and costs remained well managed.

VitalityLife

The strategic focus over the period was on stabilising the impact of external factors on the business; addressing non-economic variances through quality of new
business and retention; and right-sizing the business for the environment.

VL new business API grew by 6% to £34.8 million (8% to R646 million), and earned premiums by 12% to £141.4 million (R2 620 million). Lives covered and in-force
policies both grew strongly by 12%, exceeding 605 000 and 458 000 respectively. Operating profit declined to -£7.2 million (-R134 million). This includes a negative
impact of £16 million due to the hedge structure and related impacts, as well as negative lapse experience, resulting in embedded value reducing by 1%.

VitalityInvest

The strategic focus over the period was on new business growth and product development to support this. VitalityInvest (VI) has made substantial progress, with new
business annual premium equivalent (APE) of £8.5 million(5) (R157 million) over the period, equating to month-on-month growth of 17% and total funds under
management of £105.3 million (R1 952 million).

5 APE calculated as single/10 + annual recurring.

Ping An Health (PAH)

The strategic focus over the period was on delivering on PAH's ambition of being the leading health insurer in China; driving quality of new business; and continuing to
invest for growth and scale.

PAH had a remarkable period, with total revenue growing by 56% to RMB5.3 billion (R11.1 billion), and new business premium growing over 27% to RMB2.6 billion (R5.5
billion). PAH exceeded its written premium target of RMB10 billion for the 2019 calendar year. The Group's share of after-tax operating profit grew by 467% to $4.6
million (R68 million). The tax relief on deductible commissions effected in May 2019 resulted in the effective tax rate reducing to 41% for the period (December 2018:
55%).

Vitality Group

The strategic focus over the period was on pursuing global scale, relevance and materiality; ensuring leading IP, technology and data insights to deliver the best
behaviour-change platform and drive unique customer propositions; and having a transformational impact on the business of partners.

Vitality Group (VG) delivered a pleasing set of results for the period, achieving a profit of $7.5 million (R110 million, up 16% from the prior year). Fee income grew to $35
million (R515 million, up 17%), supported by strong growth in insurance partners' integrated premiums, which reached $591.5 million (R8.7 billion). Total Vitality
membership grew to 4.5 million, of which two million are administered on Vitality1. Membership(6) from insurance partners' integrated products grew to 1.8 million, an
increase of 63% on the prior year.

6 Full Vitality membership.

Priorities for growth

The Group is well positioned for growth over its planning horizon to 2023, with the capital plan intact. Key priority areas are:

1. Execute on VitalityLife's stated plans to manage in the low interest rate environment, stabilise experience variances and return to robust profit in FY 2021
2. Achieve significant traction in new initiatives, most notably Discovery Bank, and ensure short-term new business thresholds are achieved for each initiative
3. Ensure the established businesses retain their insurgency
4. Capitalise on emerging businesses' unique attributes and positioning to achieve scale and materiality

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT: SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Over the six months ended 31 December 2019 (""current period""), all of Discovery's established and
emerging businesses, with the exception of VitalityLife, produced robust operating results. VitalityLife was
largely impacted by its previously announced strategic decision to mitigate its exposure to further interest
rate declines in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Group has continued its budgeted increased
investment into new strategic initiatives.

As a result, normalised profit from operations for the current period is expected to decrease by between
5% and 10% to between R3 609 million and R3 419 million compared to reported R3 799 million for the six
months ended 31 December 2018 (""prior period"") and the Group's normalised headline earnings per share
(diluted) (Notes 1 and 2) for the current period is expected to reduce by between 10% and 15% to between
330 cents and 311 cents compared to reported 366.4 cents for the prior period. Cash, capital and financial
leverage metrics remain well within guidance.

Normalised profit from operations before investment in new initiatives is expected to increase by between
2% and 7% compared to the prior period as per the following reconciliation to normalised profit from
operations.
                                                           Indicative increase / (decrease) in normalised
                                                           profit from key operations for current period
                                                           compared to prior period

 allowing for finance costs)
 Normalised profit from operations                         from -5% to -10%


(*) VitalityLife's result during the current period was impacted by a strategic decision to mitigate its
    exposure to further interest rate declines in the highly volatile, low interest rate United Kingdom
    environment. This was effected by way of an interest rate hedge structure as previously announced.
    This, combined with a generally difficult operating environment in the UK, resulted in VitalityLife
    recording an operating loss for the period, which is a key factor in the higher effective tax rate as
    compared with the prior period.

(**)The group has previously highlighted the continuation of increased investment into strategic
    initiatives including Discovery Bank, VitalityInvest, Vitality1, Umbrella Funds and Discovery Business
    Insurance. Investment spend was budgeted to be higher in the first six months of the year and is
    expected to be lower over the remaining period of the year, further supported by these initiatives
    having gained traction over this period.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised that given the impact of VitalityLife and continuing investment in
new initiatives as described above:
    *    Headline earnings per share (diluted) (Note 1) for the current period is expected to reduce by
         between 8% and 13% to between 319 cents and 302 cents compared to reported 347.2 cents for
         the prior period.
    *    Earnings per share (diluted) (Note 1) for the current period is expected to reduce by between 10%
         and 15% to between 317 cents and 300 cents compared to reported 352.5 cents for the prior
         period.

Discovery's interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2019 are due to be released on
SENS on 20 February 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported on
by the Company's external auditors.

Notes:
1 The expected percentage change in the current period is approximately the same for both diluted and undiluted
earnings per share.
2 The expected difference between normalised profit from operations and normalised headline earnings is
predominantly due to an increase in finance costs in line with the long-term capital plan and a higher average
effective tax rate.

CHANGE IN EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTOR

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised
of the following change in executive director responsibilities at Discovery.

Hylton Kallner as CEO of Discovery's South African operations
Mr Kallner, the current CEO of Discovery Life, will assume the role of CEO of Discovery's South African
operations. In the role, Mr Kallner will lead the composite strategy for Health, Life, Invest, Insure, and
Vitality entities, and will oversee their integration with Vitality and Discovery Bank. Mr Kallner will continue
to chair the SA EXCO, as the core governance forum of the SA composite. Given the strategic importance of
Discovery Bank, it will continue to report to the Group CEO.

As a result of the above change in executive responsibilities of Mr Kallner, the following voluntary disclosure
is made.

Riaan van Reenen as CEO of Discovery Life
Mr van Reenen, the current Discovery Life Limited Chief Actuary, will assume the role of CEO and Director of
Discovery Life, subject to regulatory approval. Given his leadership in the development of Discovery Life's
shared-value business model, Mr van Reenen has played a fundamental role in the business's growth from
start-up to the market leader in terms of new business market share and impact. Mr van Reenen has led the
Discovery Life actuarial valuations team since its inception; he has also led the establishment of the actuarial
functions for Group Risk, Discovery Invest and Vitality Life in the UK.

These appointments are seen as an important step to create necessary focus to achieve the Group's
ambition.

INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHANGES

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised of the
following non-executive director changes at Discovery.

The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr David Macready as independent non-executive director
to the Group Board, effective from 3 February 2020; and as member of the Group Audit Committee, transitioning to
its chairperson with effect from 14 February 2020. Mr Macready will also be appointed as a member of the Actuarial
Committee and Risk and Compliance Committee of the Group.

Mr Macready's membership of the Group Audit Committee will allow for a controlled handover from Mr Les Owen,
independent non-executive director and chairperson of the Group Audit Committee, who has informed the Board of
his intention to retire given his 12-year tenure. This will be effective at the close of the Board meeting scheduled on
14 February 2020.

Appointment of David Macready
Discovery is in an important phase of its development with the recent launch and scaling of its Banking operations,
navigating through a challenging macro-economic environment, as well as its global expansion into different markets
via key partnerships. This requires a unique set of skills and breadth of experience including accounting and actuarial
expertise, together with multinational financial services experience spanning insurance and retail banking; as well as
Board and Audit Committee experience - all within a high-growth and entrepreneurial environment. The Board
believes that Mr Macready's substantial institutional experience is closely aligned to the needs of the Group during
this important phase of its evolution.

Mr Macready (61), a chartered accountant registered with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, is a
seasoned professional having commenced his career at Deloitte & Touche in South Africa and a further six years in the
United Kingdom. Mr Macready has spent the past 22 years in the wider Old Mutual Group, more recently being chief
executive officer of Old Mutual South Africa between 2015 and 2017. Mr Macready was chief executive of Old Mutual
Wealth and Investment Group between 2017 and December 2018. Mr Macready also held a number of key
directorships and audit committee memberships within the Old Mutual and Nedbank Group of companies over the
past 12 years.

Discovery welcomes Mr Macready to the Board.

Planned retirement of Mr Les Owen
Mr Owen has served as an independent non-executive director of the Company since December 2007 and has been
chairperson of the Group Audit Committee, as well as a member of the Actuarial Committee and Risk and Compliance
Committee. During his tenure at Discovery, Mr Owen has played a significant role in these important governance and
stewardship roles. Discovery wishes to thank Mr Owen for his invaluable contribution to the Group over the past 12
years.

Mr Owen will ensure a controlled handover to Mr Macready as the new chairperson of the Group Audit Committee.

ACCEPTANCE OF SHARES AWARDED IN TERMS OF THE DISCOVERY LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

In compliance with the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, notification is hereby given that the following executive
directors and directors of major subsidiaries of the Company have accepted the award of ordinary shares in the
Company.

The Discovery Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting
(AGM) held on 28 November 2019, replaces the cash-settled LTIP with an equity-settled LTIP to align with local
and global best practice in incentivising, motivating and retaining the right calibre of executives and senior
management with the Group. As outlined in the remuneration report of the Integrated Annual Report
(Remuneration report) which was made available to shareholders as part of the AGM notice, the performance
conditions are aligned to the organic growth methodology of the Group and the vesting criteria take account of
the feedback received following shareholder engagement after the 2018 AGM non-binding advisory vote.

Accordingly, the awards accepted by executive directors and directors of major subsidiaries, as contained in this
announcement, will vest from between the 3rd and 5th anniversary of these awards (between 1 October 2022 and
1 October 2024), provided the necessary vesting criteria have been achieved as outlined in the Remuneration
report.

The nature of the interest in respect of each of these awards is direct beneficial, the transactions have occurred
off-market and the necessary clearances have been obtained.

Following a period of medical leave, Mr Herschel Mayers, Executive Director of Discovery and Chief Executive of
VitalityLife and VitalityInvest in the UK, will move from an Executive Role to a Non-Executive role of Vitality in the UK;
and will continue to serve on the Discovery Board, with immediate effect, now as a Non-Executive Director.

Restructure of Health Executives to intensify focus and resource allocation to Discovery's global emerging health
insurance initiatives

Effective 1 January 2020, Dr Jonathan Broomberg, who has been CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited since 2010, will
assume the role of CEO of Vitality Health International (VHI), a new business unit in the Vitality Group International
Inc. Dr Broomberg will also act as Global Head of Health Insurance for the Discovery Group. Dr Ryan Noach, current
Deputy CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited, will be appointed as CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited. This
transition follows an 18 month plan.

Given the considerable growth of Ping An Health and the presence of other opportunities with Discovery's insurance
partners and within specific markets, Dr Broomberg will become the CEO of VHI. Its purpose is to coordinate and
intensify focus and resource allocation to Discovery's global emerging health insurance initiatives. The organisation
believes the opportunities are significant, given the rapid growth of health insurance in most markets around the
world and Discovery's unique health insurance expertise, assets, and shared-value model; together with its
involvement in the preeminent health insurance businesses in South Africa, China and the UK.

In his role as Global Head of Health Insurance for the Discovery Group, Dr Broomberg will play a coordinating role
across all of the health insurance businesses in the Group, and will lead Discovery's health regulatory and policy affairs
globally, including playing an active role in regulatory issues impacting Discovery Health. Dr Broomberg will remain a
Director of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited, and will remain based in Johannesburg.

Dr Ryan Noach will be appointed as CEO of Discovery Health (Pty) Limited. Dr Noach joined Discovery Health in 2008,
was appointed as COO of Discovery Health in 2009 and subsequently as Deputy CEO in 2014. Dr Noach is a medical
practitioner and brings a wealth of healthcare and business experience to his new role, having held various leadership
positions across both the provider and payer side of the Healthcare Industry.
