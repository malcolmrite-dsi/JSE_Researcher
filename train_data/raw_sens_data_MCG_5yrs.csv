Important notice
Shareholders should take note that, pursuant to a provision of the MultiChoice memorandum of
incorporation, MultiChoice is permitted to reduce the voting rights of shares in MultiChoice (including
MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the American Depositary Share (""ADS"") facility) so that the
aggregate voting power of MultiChoice shares that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to
South Africa (as envisaged in the MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation) will not exceed 20% of the
total voting power in MultiChoice. This is to ensure compliance with certain statutory requirements
applicable to South Africa. For this purpose, MultiChoice will presume in particular that:

   •   all MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the MultiChoice ADS facility are owned or held by
       foreigners to South Africa, regardless of the actual nationality of the MultiChoice ADS holder; and
   •   all shareholders with an address outside of South Africa on the register of MultiChoice will be
       deemed to be foreigners to South Africa, irrespective of their actual nationality or domicilium,
       unless such shareholder can provide proof, to the satisfaction of the MultiChoice board, that it
       should not be deemed to be a foreigner to South Africa, as envisaged in article 40.1.3 of the
       MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation.

Shareholders are referred to the provisions of the MultiChoice memorandum of incorporation available

REVIEWED INTERIM RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT
Condensed consolidated interim financial results for the period ended 30 September 2020

EXECUTIVE REVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE
MULTICHOICE GROUP (MCG OR THE GROUP) DELIVERED RESILIENT RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020
The group added 1.2m 90-day active subscribers year on year (YoY) to close the period ended 30 September 2020 (1H FY21) on 
20.1m households and exceeds the 20m subscriber milestone for the first time. This represents growth of 6% YoY, similar to the 
prior year, as increased consumer demand for video entertainment services and an easing of electricity shortages in southern 
Africa were offset by rising consumer pressure in many markets. The 90-day subscriber base is split between 11.4m households 
(57%) in the Rest of Africa and 8.7m (43%) in South Africa.    

Revenue increased 2% (-1% organic) to ZAR26.1bn, with subscription revenues of ZAR22.2bn increasing a solid 5% (3% organic) 
YoY. Top-line momentum was significantly impacted by COVID-19 in the following areas:
- Advertising revenue declined ZAR0.6bn YoY, mainly due to a lack of sport advertising and a generally softer advertising market 
  as a result of lower economic activity. This has, however, returned to nearly pre-COVID-19 levels in the months of August 
  and September.
- Commercial subscriptions were ZAR0.3bn lower than the prior period with hotels, restaurants and other commercial customers 
  largely closed during lockdowns. Although business in the hospitality industry has resumed in recent months, it is expected 
  to take some time to fully normalise.
  
Group trading profit rose 19% to ZAR5.7bn (38% organic), benefitting from a ZAR0.5bn (ZAR1.2bn organic) reduction in losses 
in the Rest of Africa and a resilient performance in South Africa. The trading profit impact of COVID-19 was largely neutral, 
as the ZAR0.9bn revenue loss mentioned above was offset by ZAR0.8bn in delayed content costs.

A strong focus on cost reduction allowed for a further ZAR1bn in costs being eliminated from the base during the period. 
Overall costs decreased 2% compared to the prior period (-9% organic) and resulted in the group maintaining its target of 
delivering positive operating leverage by keeping the growth rate in costs below that of revenue growth.

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 41% on the prior period at ZAR2.7bn. 
The strong earnings growth was attributable to the improvement in trading profit and lower realised foreign exchange losses.

Consolidated free cash flow of ZAR2.1bn was down 13% compared to the prior period. This was mainly due to the end of a 
contractual agreement on the southern Africa transponder lease whereby an upfront prepayment reduced lease payments for the 
first 36 months of the lease term, together with current period foreign exchange movements (ZAR0.5bn), as well as an increase 
in capital expenditure related to a multiyear investment programme to futureproof the group's customer service, billing and 
data capabilities (ZAR0.4bn).

The group continued its strategic focus of investing in local content and produced 1 870 additional hours, despite
disruptions caused by strict early COVID-19 lockdown measures. As a result, the total local content library is now nearing
59 000 hours.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, the group paid direct cash taxes of ZAR2.0bn, slightly more than the prior
year due to higher profitability.

Net interest paid increased to ZAR252m, primarily as a result of the translation of interest on USD transponder lease
liabilities at a weaker ZAR:USD exchange rate.

The strength of the balance sheet is critically important given the uncertain longer-term economic impact of COVID-19
and potential challenges for certain markets in the Rest of Africa as a result of a lower oil price. Some ZAR9.0bn in
net assets, including ZAR7.3bn in cash and cash equivalents, combined with ZAR4.5bn in undrawn facilities, provide
ZAR11.8bn in financial flexibility to fund the group's operations. This strong financial position is after ZAR4bn was 
utilised to settle the MCG and Phuthuma Nathi dividends in September.

The group operates in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have a
notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the Rest of Africa where revenues are
earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. Where relevant in this short-form
announcement, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency, as well as acquisitions and
disposals to better reflect underlying trends. These adjustments are quoted in brackets as organic, after the equivalent
metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These measures constitute pro forma financial
information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form announcement.

Dividend
No dividend has been declared based on the interim results.

(""MultiChoice"" or ""the Company"")

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its condensed consolidated
interim financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2020 (""current period"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
The board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two most appropriate indicators of the
operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to the group’s interim financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (“prior period”), the
group expects core headline earnings per share for the current period to be between 40% (175 ZAR cents) and 45%
(197 ZAR cents) higher than the prior period’s reported 437 ZAR cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 15% (R0.7bn) and 20% (R1.0bn) higher than the prior period’s reported
R4.8bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding M&A) trading profit is
expected to be between 35% (R1.7bn) and 40% (R1.9bn) higher than the prior period’s reported R4.8bn.

The improved financial performance for the current period was achieved despite continued macro-economic
headwinds across the continent, including the impact of COVID-19 which especially depressed advertising revenues
and commercial subscription revenues. The timing of content costs and a strong focus on overall cost reduction
allowed the group to drive a further reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa segment, which has been the largest
contributor to the improvement in group performance.

Core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro forma financial information in terms of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its pro forma nature, may not fairly present the
group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated
by adjusting headline earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of
intangible assets arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business
Combinations; c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses;
e) certain fair-value adjustments under IFRS; f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts; g) non-recurring
empowerment transactions and h) acquisition-related costs. Organic trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign
currency movements and changes in the composition of the group.

Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
Compared to the prior period, the group expects earnings per share for the current period to be between 68% ( 230
ZAR cents) and 74% (250 ZAR cents) higher than the prior period´s reported earnings per share of 336 ZAR cents.

Headline earnings per share for the current period is expected to be between 65% (220 ZAR cents) and 70% (240
ZAR cents) higher than the prior period´s reported headline earnings per share of 341 ZAR cents. The key reasons
for the movements are an improvement in trading performance and lower realised foreign exchange losses due to
more favourable forward exchange contracts maturing.

Further details will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim financial results, due to be released on the
Stock Exchange news service on 12 November 2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

Annual results announcement

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND MAIDEN CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2020

EXECUTIVE REVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE
MultiChoice Group (MCG or the group) delivered solid results for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Despite global and country-specific macroeconomic challenges, the group added 0.9m 90-day active subscribers to reach 
19.5m households as at 31 March 2020 (FY20). This represents growth of 5% year on year (YoY), which is somewhat lower 
compared to the prior year due to rising consumer pressure in many markets, drought-related electricity shortages in 
southern Africa, and the fact that last year's growth benefited from specific one-off events such as the FIFA World Cup 
which did not recur this year.     

Revenue increased 3% (2% organic) to ZAR51.4bn and included subscription revenue of ZAR42.8bn, which increased 4% 
(3% organic) YoY. Top line momentum was affected by modest subscriber growth due to macro-headwinds in certain markets, 
the group's strategic decision not to increase Premium prices in South Africa and a reduction in sub-licence revenues 
from the South African public broadcaster. This was offset by an increased contribution of 12% (4% organic) by the 
technology business, Irdeto.             

Group trading profit rose 14% to ZAR8.0bn (29% organic), benefiting from a ZAR0.8bn (ZAR1.8bn organic) reduction in 
losses in the Rest of Africa. A strong focus on cost containment allowed for a further ZAR1.4bn in costs to be 
eliminated from the base during the year. Overall costs were contained to a 1% increase compared to the prior year 
(-3% organic) and resulted in positive operating leverage, with the group achieving its target of keeping the growth 
rate in costs below that of revenue growth.      

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 38% on the prior year at 
ZAR2.5bn, despite the impact of the additional 5% share in SA being allocated to Phuthuma Nathi (PN) in March 2019.
Excluding this once-off change in the South African non-controlling interest, core headline earnings would have 
grown 57% YoY.

Consolidated free cash flow of ZAR5.2bn was up 59% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by an improvement in 
the trading result from the Rest of Africa and a reduction in working capital.

The board recommends that a maiden annual gross dividend be declared at 565 SA cents per listed ordinary 
share (ZAR2.5bn).

The group remains fully committed to broad-based black economic empowerment and transformation. In line with
prior commitments, an offer was made to PN shareholders on 25 September 2019, to exchange up to 20% of their
PN shares for shares in the MultiChoice Group. The offer closed on 28 October 2019 and resulted in 3.7m shares
being issued to PN shareholders, while the group acquired 3.8m shares in PN in return. Following the
conclusion of this share swap, the group's overall interest in MultiChoice South Africa increased from 75.0% 
to 76.4%.

The group continued its strategic focus of investing in local content, increasing the library of hours
available by 8%. As a result, the total local content library now exceeds 56 800 hours.

Capital expenditure of ZAR0.8bn was slightly down on the prior year and included a ZAR0.2bn investment as
part of a multi-year programme to futureproof the group's customer service, billing and data capabilities.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, the group paid direct cash taxes of ZAR4.0bn, slightly higher
than the prior year driven by higher profitability.

The strength of the balance sheet is critically important given the uncertain economic impact of COVID-19
and the lower oil price. Some ZAR9.8bn in net assets, including ZAR9.1bn of cash and cash equivalents, combined
with ZAR5bn in undrawn facilities, provides ZAR14.1bn in financial flexibility to fund the business. This
strong financial position is after spending ZAR1.7bn on share buy-backs (including ZAR0.7bn to fund the MCG
restricted share plan) and ZAR1.5bn to settle the FY19 PN dividend during the year.

We operate in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have
a notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the RoA where revenues are
earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. Where relevant in this
short-form announcement, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency, as well 
as acquisitions and disposals to better reflect underlying trends. These adjustments (non-IFRS performance
measures) are quoted in brackets as organic, after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). These non-IFRS performance measures constitute pro forma financial information in 
terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form
announcement.

Dividend declaration
The board recommends that a maiden annual gross dividend be declared at 565 SA cents per listed ordinary
share (ZAR2.5bn). This dividend declaration is subject to approval of the MultiChoice South Africa Holdings
Proprietary Limited (MCSAH) dividend at their annual general meeting on Wednesday, 26 August 2020. The 
finalisation date for the dividend declaration by the company will be Thursday, 27 August 2020. Subject to the
aforementioned MCSAH approval, dividends will be payable to the company's shareholders recorded in the register 
on the record date, being Friday, 11 September 2020. The last date to trade cum dividend will be on Tuesday, 
8 September 2020 (shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 9 September 2020). Share certificates may not be
dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 9 September 2020 and Friday, 11 September 2020, both dates 
inclusive. The dividend payment date will be Monday, 14 September 2020. The dividend will be declared from income. 
It will be subject to the dividend tax rate of 20%, yielding a net dividend of 452 SA cents per listed ordinary
share to those shareholders not exempt from paying dividend tax. Dividend tax will be 113 SA cents per listed
ordinary share. The issued ordinary share capital as at 10 June 2020 was 442.5m ordinary shares (including 15.6m
shares held in treasury). The company's income tax reference number is 9485006192.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its consolidated annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 (""FY20"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
The board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two most appropriate indicators of the
operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to results for the year ended 31 March 2019 (""prior year""), the group expects core headline earnings per
share for FY20 to be between 35% (144 ZAR cents) and 40% (164 ZAR cents) higher than the prior year´s 410 ZAR
cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 10% (R0.7bn) and 15% (R1.1bn) higher than the prior year´s
R7.0bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding any M&A) trading profit is
expected to be between 25% (R1.8bn) and 30% (R2.1bn) higher than the prior year's reported R7.0bn.

The improved financial performance for FY20 was achieved despite continued macro-economic headwinds across
the continent. Management focus on cost containment allowed the business to offset these challenges and drive a
further reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa segment, which has been the largest contributor to the improvement in
group performance.

Core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro-forma financial information in terms of the
JSE Limited Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its pro forma nature, may not fairly present the
group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated
by adjusting headline earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of
intangible assets arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business
Combinations; c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses; e)
certain fair-value adjustments under IFRS; f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts; g) non-recurring
empowerment transactions and h) acquisition-related costs. Organic trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign
currency movements and/changes in the composition of the group.

Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
Compared to the prior year, the group expects earnings per share for FY20 to be between 470 ZAR cents and 510
ZAR cents higher than the prior year´s loss per share of 374 ZAR cents.

Headline earnings per share for FY20 is expected to be between 460 ZAR cents and 500 ZAR cents higher than the
prior year´s headline loss per share of 353 ZAR cents. The key reasons for the movements are:

a)   an improvement in trading performance;
b)   the non-recurring empowerment transaction cost which was incurred in the prior year;
c)   higher unrealised foreign exchange losses due to weaker local currencies, primarily the South African Rand.

Further details will be provided in the consolidated annual financial results, due to be released on SENS on 10 June
2020.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

Important notice

Shareholders should take note that, pursuant to a provision of the MultiChoice memorandum of
incorporation, MultiChoice is permitted to reduce the voting rights of shares in MultiChoice (including
MultiChoice shares deposited in terms of the American Depositary Share (""ADS"") facility) so that the
aggregate voting power of MultiChoice shares that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to

            business purposes;

      cash resources used to acquire the Repurchase Shares.

6.    COMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 5.72 OF THE LISTINGS REQUIREMENTS

Condensed consolidated interim financial Results for the period ended 30 September 2019

Executive review of our performance
MultiChoice Group (MCG or the group) delivered solid results for the period ended 30 September 2019

The group added 1.2m 90-day active subscribers, representing 7% year-on-year (YoY) growth, taking the overall 
90-day active subscriber base to 18.9m households at 30 September 2019 (HY20). In the absence of specific 
one-off events in the prior year, subscriber growth rates reflected more normalised trends. The subscriber 
base is split between 10.7m households in the Rest of Africa (RoA) and 8.2m in South Africa (SA).

Revenue was up 4% (3% organic) to R25.7bn and included subscription revenue of R21.2bn, which grew at similar 
rates. Top line momentum was affected by the group's strategic decision not to increase Premium prices in SA. 
Hardware sales and advertising revenues were lower due to the one-off prior year events, while macro-headwinds in 
certain markets affected disposable income and thus consumer demand.

Group trading profit rose 22% to R4.8bn (33% organic) benefitting from a R0.7bn (R1.2bn organic) reduction in 
losses in RoA. A further R0.7bn in costs were eliminated from the base during HY20 as part of the group's cost 
optimisation programme. This resulted in overall costs being contained to a similar level as the prior period 
(-3% organic) and achieved the group target of keeping the growth rate in costs below that of revenue growth.    

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 24% on the prior period 
at R1.9bn, despite the impact of the additional 5% share in SA allocated to Phuthuma Nathi in March 2019. Excluding 
this once-off change in the SA non-controlling interest, core headline earnings would have grown 37% YoY.

Consolidated free cash flow of R2.4bn was up 32% compared to the prior period. This was achieved after an 
improvement in the trading result from the RoA and a lower investment in set-top boxes.

The group remains fully committed to broad-based black economic empowerment and transformation. In line with
prior commitments, an offer was made to Phuthuma Nathi (PN) shareholders on 25 September 2019, to exchange up
to 20% of their PN shares for shares in MCG. The offer closed on 28 October 2019 and has resulted in 3.7m
shares being issued to PN shareholders, while MCG acquired 3.8m shares in PN in return. Following the conclusion
of this share swap, our overall interest in MultiChoice South Africa increased from 75.0% to 76.4%.

No interim dividend has been declared. The group remains on track to declare a dividend of R2.5bn for FY20.

The group continued its strategic focus on local content, increasing the number of hours produced by 12%. 
As a result, the total local content hours in the library now exceeds 54 000 hours.

Capital expenditure (capex) of R0.3bn was in line with the prior period.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, MCG paid direct cash taxes of R1.9bn. This was 9% higher than the
previous period mainly due to a higher final tax payment in SA.

Net interest paid amounted to R164m, slightly up on the prior period primarily due to the impact of
reclassifying operating leases as finance leases under IFRS 16. The group balance sheet remains strong with 
R9.9bn in net assets, including R6.9bn of cash and cash equivalents. Combined with R3.5bn in undrawn facilities, 
this provides R10.4bn in financial flexibility to fund our business plan. This strong financial position is after
providing R0.8bn for share buybacks (including R0.7bn to fund the MCG restricted share plan) and settling our
R1.5bn dividend to Phuthuma Nathi.

We operate in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have
a notable impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the RoA where revenues are
earned in local currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated.

Where relevant in this short-form announcement, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects
of foreign currency, as well as acquisitions and disposals to better reflect underlying trends. These
adjustments (non-IFRS performance measures) are quoted in brackets as organic, after the equivalent metrics 
reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These non-IFRS performance measures 
constitute pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this short-form
announcement.

No other changes have been made to the directorate of the group.

MULTICHOICE GROUP LIMITED
(incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)

JSE Share Code: MCG ISIN: ZAE000265971
(""MultiChoice"", ""MCG"" or ""the Company"")

Trading statement
Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its condensed consolidated interim
financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2019 (""current period"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
The board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two most appropriate indicators of
the operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-operational items.

Compared to the group´s results for the six months ended 30 September 2018 (""prior year""), the group expects
core headline earnings per share for the current period to be between 20% (70 ZAR cents) and 25% (88 ZAR
cents) higher than the prior year´s 352 ZAR cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 20% (R0.8bn) and 25% (R1.0bn) higher than the prior year´s
R3.9bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding any M&A) trading
profit is expected to be between 30% (R1.2bn) and 35% (R1.4bn) higher than the prior year's reported R3.9bn.

The improved financial performance expected for the current period is despite continued macro-economic
headwinds faced across the continent, which are impacting disposable income at a consumer level. Management
has remained focused on tight cost controls to offset these challenges and continued to reduce losses in the Rest
of Africa segment, which has been the largest contributor to the improvement in group performance.

Core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro-forma financial information in terms of
the JSE Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility of the group's directors,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and may not fairly present the group's financial position,
changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated by adjusting headline
earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of intangible assets
arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business Combinations;
c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses; e) certain fair-
value adjustments under IFRS; and f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts. Organic
trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign currency movements and/changes in the composition of the
group.

Earnings per share and headline earnings per share
Compared to the prior year, the group expects earnings per share for the current period to be between 249 ZAR
cents and 264 ZAR cents higher than the prior year´s earnings per share of 79 ZAR cents.

Headline earnings per share for the current period is expected to be between 256 ZAR cents and 271 ZAR cents
higher than the prior year´s headline earnings per share of 78 ZAR cents.

The key reasons for the movements above are:
  a) an improvement in trading performance as highlighted in the discussion of the growth in trading profit and
     core headline earnings per share above; and
  b) the lower depreciation of the SA Rand against the US dollar compared to the prior period which has led to
     a decrease in unrealised foreign exchange losses on translation of the group's US dollar denominated
     transponder lease liabilities.

Further details will be provided in the condensed consolidated interim financial results, due to be released on
SENS on or about 11 November 2019.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

We refer you to the announcement released on SENS on 30 August 2019, in which MultiChoice
announced its intention to make an offer (""Proposed Acquisition"" or ""MCG Offer"") to shareholders of
PN1 and PN2 to exchange up to 20% of their shares in PN that are listed on the Equity Express Securities
Exchange (""EESE"") for shares in MCG and the further announcement released on 21 October 2019,
setting out the results of the meetings of PN shareholders.

MultiChoice has confirmed that all conditions to the MCG Offer have been fulfilled and the MCG Offer
closed at 14:00 on Monday, 28 October 2019. The results of the MCG Offer are presented below:

*     PN1 shareholders have exchanged 2,599,902 PN1 shares and consequently, on implementation of
      the MCG Offer, MultiChoice will acquire 2,599,902 shares in PN1 in exchange for the issue of
      2,488,107 MCG shares;
*     PN2 shareholders have exchanged 1,240,442 PN2 shares and consequently, on implementation of
      the MCG Offer, MultiChoice will acquire 1,240,442 shares in PN2 in exchange for the issue of
      1,187,103 MCG shares;
*     PN shareholders who have accepted the MCG Offer will receive the offer consideration through
      Singular Services. These MCG shares were made available to PN shareholders on Tuesday,
      29 October 2019, and thus the MCG Offer has been fully implemented.
*     Cash to be paid to shareholders in lieu of fractional entitlements to MCG shares will be settled in
      due course.

Following the implementation of the MCG Offer:

*     the issued share capital of each of PN1 and PN2 will remain unchanged; and
*     the issued share capital of MCG will increase by 3,675,210 shares, constituting a 0.84% increase in
      the issued share capital of MCG.

With reference, to the announcement posted on SENS on Tuesday, 22 October 2019, PN1 and PN2
shareholders voted in favour of combining PN1 and PN2 through the implementation of a scheme of
arrangement. Consequently, following the implementation of the scheme of arrangement, MultiChoice
will have 3,840,344 shares in the new combined entity, once the scheme of arrangement has been
implemented. This has increased the overall MCG interest in MultiChoice South Africa Holdings Group
from 75% to 76.4%.

PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY MULTICHOICE (MCG) OF UP TO 20% OF THE SHARES IN PHUTHUMA
NATHI INVESTMENTS (RF) LIMITED (?PN1?) AND PHUTHUMA NATHI INVESTMENTS 2 (RF) LIMITED
(?PN2?) (COLLECTIVELY ?PN?)

1.    Introduction and rationale

On 21 January 2019, MultiChoice issued its pre-listing statement (?PLS?) in relation to its listing on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (?JSE?) on 27 February 2019. In the PLS, MultiChoice announced
its intention to make an offer to shareholders of PN1 and PN2 (?PN shareholders?) to exchange up
to 20% of their shares in PN that are listed on the Equity Express Securities Exchange (?EESE?) for
shares in MCG (the ?Proposed Acquisition? or the ?MCG Offer?). The purpose of the Proposed
Acquisition is to provide PN shareholders with an opportunity to gain exposure to the rest of MCG?s
assets, while providing additional liquidity to PN shareholders through the JSE listed MCG shares.
This reinforces MCG's commitment to broad, socio-economic transformation in South Africa by
providing opportunities to historically disadvantaged groups and allowing PN shareholders to
participate in potential future value creation.

2.    Description of MultiChoice

Since launching the first pay-TV operation outside the United States in 1986, MultiChoice has grown
into the leading video entertainment operator on the African continent. Today, MCG entertains
over 15.1 million households (18.6m on a 90-day active basis) in 50 countries across multiple
platforms, including digital satellite and terrestrial television, as well as over-the-top video
entertainment services.

3.    Details of the Proposed Acquisition

In terms of the Proposed Acquisition an exchange ratio of 0.97 MCG shares for every 1 PN share
held will be applied. The exchange ratio was based on a 90-day volume weighted average price for
MCG on the JSE and Phuthuma Nathi 1 on EESE, taking into account that PN is trading cum-div. This
will result in MultiChoice acquiring up to 9,000,000 ordinary shares in PN1 (?PN1 shares?) and up
to 4,500,000 ordinary shares in PN2 (?PN2 shares?) and issuing up to 13,095,000 MCG ordinary
shares in consideration (?MCG consideration shares?) to participating PN shareholders. This will
constitute no more than 3% of the issued share capital of the Company prior to the implementation
of the MCG Offer. An indirect ownership stake in MultiChoice South Africa Holdings (Pty) Limited
(?MCSA?) of up to an additional 5% will occur through a maximum 20% share exchange with PN
shareholders, potentially increasing MCG?s total stake in MCSA up to 80% from 75% currently. The
costs of brokerage to fund an accepted offer will be borne by the PN shareholder. Including
brokerage costs, a PN shareholder will receive 0.957 MCG shares for every 1 PN share.

Participation in the Proposed Acquisition is completely voluntary and PN shareholders are not
obliged to participate in the Proposed Acquisition. As MCG?s shares are listed on the JSE, they can
be sold to any investor, whereas PN shares can only be sold to qualifying black South African
investors in terms of the PN entities? Memoranda of Incorporation (?MOI?s?).

The MCG Offer will be available to all PN shareholders who hold more than 20 shares, and is
expected to open on Wednesday, 25 September 2019 and close on Monday, 28 October 2019 (the
?MCG Offer Period?). The Proposed Acquisition will be effective from Tuesday, 29 October 2019,
following the closing of the MCG Offer.

4.    Conditions precedent

The Proposed Acquisition will be subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the following conditions by
no later than 17h00 (South African time) on 25 October 2019, or such later date as MCG may
determine in its sole discretion:
-     the PN1 shareholders having adopted by special resolution at a meeting of the PN1
      shareholders the proposed amendments to the PN1 MOI, which amendments propose to,
      inter alia, amend the restriction on who may hold PN1 shares to allow MCG to acquire the
      PN1 shares;
-     the PN2 shareholders having adopted by special resolution at a meeting of the PN2
      shareholders the proposed amendments to the PN2 MOI, which amendments propose to,
      inter alia, amend the restriction on who may hold PN2 shares to allow MCG to acquire the
      PN2 shares; and
-     application having been made and granted for the listing of the MCG consideration shares on
      the JSE.

5.    Further announcement
The final number of PN shares acquired and MCG shares to be issued in consideration of the
acquisition of the PN shares will be announced following the closing of the MCG Offer.

SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2019

EXECUTIVE REVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE
MultiChoice Group (MCG or the group) delivered solid results for the year ended 31 March 2019.

A total of 1.6m subscribers were added across the continent, representing 12% year-on-year (YoY) growth, taking the
overall active subscriber base to 15.1m subscribers. This was achieved despite continued macroeconomic headwinds and
consumer affordability pressure, illustrating the resilience of our products. The year also marks the first time 
that the Rest of Africa (RoA) base of 7.7m subscribers exceeded the 7.4m subscribers in South Africa.

The group generated revenue of R50.1bn, up 6% on last year (6% organic). Subscription revenue amounted to R41.2bn, up
7% on last year (8% organic). This represents an acceleration in growth from previous years driven by the continued
success of our value strategy in the RoA and a healthy contribution from South Africa. 

Group trading profit rose 11% to R7bn (27% organic) benefiting from a R0.9bn reduction in losses in RoA. As part of
the group's cost optimisation programme, a further R1.3bn in costs were removed from the base during the year. This
resulted in overall costs being contained to an increase of 5% (2% organic) and achieved the group target of keeping 
the rate of growth in costs below the rate of growth in revenue.

The group continued its investment in local content adding a further 4 600 hours to take the local content library to
nearly 50 000 hours. The spend on local general entertainment content as a percentage of total general entertainment
content increased from 38% to 40%, in line with the strategy to reach a target of 45%. 

Core headline earnings, the board's measure of sustainable business performance, was up 10% on last year at R1.8bn.

Consolidated free cash flow of R3.3bn was up 96% compared to the prior year. This was achieved after an improvement in
the trading result from the RoA, the non-recurrence of once-off content prepayments in the prior year and remittances
of cash from Angola.

Capital expenditure of R1bn was slightly up YoY due to additional investments in information technology infrastructure 
to improve customer experience as well as the renewal of our digital terrestrial television (DTT) licence in Nigeria. 
The cash conversion ratio (EBITDA-Capex/EBITDA) remains positive at 90%.

As one of the largest taxpayers in Africa, MCG paid direct cash taxes of R3.7bn, in line with the previous year.

Net interest paid amounted to R305m, an increase of R152m from the previous year. This was due to an increase in the
interest-bearing loan funding received from Naspers in the RoA segment which was capitalised as part of the unbundling.

The group balance sheet is strong with R9.8bn in net assets, including R6.7bn of cash and cash equivalents and 
R3.5bn in undrawn facilities providing R10.2bn in financial flexibility to fund our business plan.

Segmental review
South Africa
The South African business delivered subscriber growth of 8% YoY or 0.5m subscribers and generated revenues of
R33.7bn, up 3% (4% organic) from the prior year. This was on the back of healthy subscriber growth in the mass market 
and despite absorbing a 1% increase in value-added tax by not passing it on to customers. The Premium segment remained 
under pressure as consumers were impacted by rising fuel and other costs and we competed for share of wallet. ARPU 
declined from R335 to R322 due to the ongoing change in subscriber mix towards the mass market. Trading profit was 
in line with the prior year at R10.2bn, while the trading margin remained relatively stable at 30%. 

The segment continued to drive product enhancements by expanding the content offering in some of its bouquets and
adding JOOX, a music streaming service, to its platform. Sustained efforts to grow the digital offering through 
Connected Video and position the business for the future, saw good uptake of both the Showmax and DStv Now services. 
As a result, online subscribers doubled YoY. 

Rest of Africa
The Rest of Africa (RoA) business continued to build on the success of its value strategy by growing the subscriber
base 17% YoY or 1.1m subscribers. The Fifa World Cup resonated extremely positively with our customers and we used 
the event to drive uptake of our products on both the satellite and digital terrestrial platforms. 

The strong subscriber growth translated into revenue growth of 13% (13% organic) to R14.8bn, while trading losses
reduced 19% (41% organic) or R0.9bn (R1.9bn organic) to R3.7bn. Encouragingly, average revenue per user (ARPU) in 
the RoA has stabilised at R159 (FY2018: R160). This is despite the macroeconomic environment that remained 
challenging with material currency depreciation in the Angolan kwanza (60%), Zambian kwacha (17%) and the 
Ghanaian cedi (11%). 

To solidify our position in the Angolan market, we converted the Angolan operation from an agency to a subsidiary,
which has been fully consolidated, from 1 February 2019. 

Cash balances and trade receivables of R298m held in Angola and Zimbabwe that remain exposed to weakening currencies,
have reduced 80% compared to last year's balance. Liquidity constraints in Angola improved considerably in FY2019,
leaving a closing cash position of R168m as at 31 March 2019. 

Technology segment
The Technology segment delivered steady results and contributed R1.6bn in revenues and R0.6bn in trading profit.
Despite the impact of non-recurring projects, which generated revenues in the prior year, tight cost controls 
resulted in trading profits increasing 18% (21% organic) YoY. 

Irdeto had some key customer wins in FY2019, including Tata Sky and Bharti Airtel in India. It continues to invest 
in connected industries, a market which is showing great promise, and that should start contributing more 
meaningfully to group revenues in the medium term.

Empowerment transaction
The group remains fully committed to broad-based black economic empowerment and transformation. To reinforce this, 
on 4 March 2019, the date of the group unbundling from Naspers Limited, the group allocated, for no consideration, 
an additional 5% stake in the MultiChoice South Africa group to Phuthuma Nathi, our black economic empowerment 
scheme. The value of this 5% has been calculated at R1.9bn, after the impact of the non-controlling interest, 
which has an adverse impact on earnings and headline earnings per share of 438 SA cents. 

Prospects
In the year ahead, the group will continue scaling its video-entertainment services across the continent, mainly in
the middle and mass markets. Top-line volume growth combined with inflationary price increases and a focus on cost
containment is expected to deliver a continued reduction in trading losses in the RoA and stable margins in South Africa 
and the Technology segment. Innovation is core to our future, and we will continue to drive the adoption of online 
products (particularly in South Africa).

Dividend
As set out in the pre-listing statement no dividend is being declared for FY2019. The group remains on track to
declare a dividend of R2.5bn, or 569 SA cents per share, for FY2020.

Directorate
On 14 May 2019, Ms Christine Sabwa was appointed to the board as an independent non-executive director. Over the past 
21 years, she gained experience in audit, accounting, special investigations, revenue assurance, risk management,
banking, governance and digital finance.

No other changes have been made to the directorate of the group since the publishing of the pre-listing statement on
21 January 2019. 

Group company secretary
On 1 April 2019, Mrs R J Gabriels relinquished her secretarial duties as acting group company secretary for
MultiChoice Group Limited. Ms D M Dickson was subsequently appointed as the group company secretary on 1 April 2019 
by the board.

Preparation of the summarised consolidated financial results
The preparation of the summarised consolidated financial results was supervised by the group's chief financial
officer, Mr Tim Jacobs CA(SA). These results were made public on 18 June 2019.

We operate in 50 countries, resulting in significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility. This can have a notable
impact on reported revenue and trading profit metrics, particularly in the RoA where revenues are earned in local
currencies while the cost base is largely US dollar denominated. 

Where relevant in this report, amounts and percentages have been adjusted for the effects of foreign currency and
acquisitions and disposals to reflect underlying trends. These adjustments (non-IFRS performance measures) are quoted in
brackets as organic, after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A
reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures (core headline earnings and free cash flow) to the equivalent IFRS metrics
is provided in note 11 of these summarised consolidated financial results. These non-IFRS performance measures constitute
pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in these summarised consolidated
financial results.

Trading statement
Shareholders are advised that the MultiChoice group (""the group"") is finalising its consolidated annual financial
statements for the twelve months ended 31 March 2019 (""current period"").

Core headline earnings per share and trading profit
Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings per share and trading profit as the two
most appropriate indicators of the operating performance of the group, as they adjust for non-recurring and non-
operational items.

Compared to the group´s results for the twelve months ended 31 March 2018 (""prior year"") included within the pre-
listing statement, the group expects core headline earnings per share for the current period to be between 8% (30
ZAR cents) and 12% (45 ZAR cents) higher than the prior year´s reported 374 ZAR cents.

Trading profit is expected to be between 9% (R0.6bn) and 13% (R0.8bn) higher than the prior year´s reported
R6,3bn. On an organic basis (i.e. reflecting results on a constant currency basis, excluding any M&A) trading profit is
expected to be between 24% (R1.5bn) and 30% (R1.9bn) higher than the prior year's reported R6,3bn.

The improved financial performance expected for the current period is mainly driven by solid subscriber growth and a
reduction in losses in the Rest of Africa segment.

As explained in the pre-listing statement, core headline earnings per share and organic trading profit constitute pro
forma financial information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the
responsibility of the group's directors, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and may not fairly present the
group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows or results of operations. Core headline earnings is calculated
by adjusting headline earnings for the following items, net of tax and non-controlling interests: a) amortisation of
intangible assets arising from business combinations; b) accounting adjustments stemming from IFRS 3: Business
Combinations; c) equity-settled share-based payment compensation; d) unrealised foreign currency gains/losses; e)
certain fair-value adjustments under IFRS; and f) non-recurring current and deferred taxation impacts. Organic
trading profit is calculated by excluding foreign currency movements and changes in the composition of the group.

Loss per share and headline loss per share
Compared to the prior year, the group expects loss per share for the current period to be between 673 ZAR cents and
739 ZAR cents lower than the prior year´s reported earnings per share of 332 ZAR cents.

Headline loss per share for the current period is expected to be between 724 ZAR cents and 800 ZAR cents lower
than the prior year´s reported headline earnings per share of 410 ZAR cents.

The key reasons for the movements above are set out below:

    a)   As disclosed in annex 7 of the pre-listing statement, the group had to account for the impact of allocating for
         no consideration a 5% stake in MultiChoice South Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd to Phuthuma Nathi Investments
         1 and Phuthuma Nathi Investments 2 as part of the unbundling process. As a result, loss per share and
         headline loss per share were impacted significantly by the once-off equity-settled share-based
         compensation charge recognised on what was an effective disposal of 5% of the group´s interest in
         MultiChoice South Africa Holdings (Pty) Ltd. While the impact of this transaction is removed from core
         headline earnings per share and trading profit, it is included in both loss per share and headline loss per
         share. This is expected to reduce earnings per share and headline earnings per share by 438 ZAR cents.

    b)   Furthermore, the impact of the depreciation of SA Rand against the US dollar has led to an increase in
         unrealised foreign exchange losses on translation of the group's US dollar denominated transponder lease
         liabilities. This is expected to reduce earnings per share and headline earnings per share by 263 ZAR cents.

Further details will be provided in the consolidated provisional annual results, due to be released on SENS on 18
June 2019.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by the
Company´s external auditor.

and as a primary listing, in the ""Broadcasting and Entertainment"" sector of the

The information in this Abridged Pre-listing Statement has been extracted,
in summarised form, from the full Pre-listing Statement issued by the
Company on Monday, 21 January 2019. This Abridged Pre-listing Statement
is not complete and does not contain all of the information that investors
should consider in relation to the Admission and Unbundling. This Abridged
Pre-listing Statement is issued in compliance with the Listings Requirements
for the purpose of providing information to selected persons in South Africa
and other jurisdictions with regard to the Company.

Capitalised words and expressions used in this Abridged Pre-listing Statement
shall, unless expressly defined herein or indicated otherwise by the context,
bear the meanings given to them in the Pre-listing Statement.

1.  Background and introduction

    As announced on SENS by Naspers on Monday, 21 January 2019, the
    Naspers Board intends to implement the Unbundling by way of a pro rata
    distribution in specie of ordinary shares of no par value in the Company
    (""Shares"") for no consideration to Shareholders in terms of section 46 of
    the Companies Act and section 46 of the Income Tax Act. Naspers intends
    to distribute 438 837 468 Shares (being 100% of the issued Shares and all
    of the Shares held in the Company by Naspers) to Shareholders recorded
    on the Naspers securities register on Friday, 1 March 2019.

    It is expected that Shareholders will receive one Share for every one
    Naspers ""N"" Share held and one Share for every five Naspers ""A""
    Shares held.

    Pursuant to the Unbundling, the Company will be an independent publicly
    traded company.

    The Company was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of MIHH
    for purposes of implementing the Admission and Unbundling. In order
    to facilitate the Admission, Naspers has undertaken a restructuring in
    order to transfer the Business to the Company and will have finalised the
    restructuring steps prior to the Admission. The Restructuring involved
    a number of steps, described in the Pre-listing Statement at ""Part VII -
    Restructuring and Formation of the Group"".

    Subsequent to the Restructuring, the Group includes MCSA, Irdeto SA,
    Main Street 484, Irdeto B.V., Showmax B.V., MAH B.V., DMT, MultiChoice
    Botswana, MultiChoice Namibia and NMS (and any of the subsidiaries,
    associates and/or affiliates of such entities as at the date on which the
    Restructuring is implemented).

    The JSE has conditionally approved the Admission of all of the issued
    Shares in the ""Broadcasting and Entertainment"" sector of the Main
    Board of the JSE under the abbreviated name ""MC GROUP"", share code
    ""MCG"" and ISIN: ZAE000265971, subject to the Unbundling becoming
    operative and the Company obtaining the requisite spread of shareholders
    required by the Listings Requirements. Following the Admission, all the
    issued Shares of the Company will be listed on the exchange operated
    by the JSE in compliance with the Listings Requirements and the laws of
    South Africa.

    The Company's issued share capital comprises 438 837 468 Shares, with
    a stated capital of R0 as at the Last Practicable Date and is expected to
    comprise 438 837 468 Shares with a stated capital of R0 on the Admission
    Date. No Shares are, or on the Admission Date are expected to be, held
    in treasury by the Group.

    The Shares will only be traded on the JSE in Dematerialised or
    Uncertificated Form and accordingly all holders of Shares who hold their
    Shares in Certificated Form will have to dematerialise their Shares should
    they wish to trade on the JSE.

2.  Overview of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates (""Group"")

    The Group is the leading Pan-African video  entertainment platform,
    offering DTH and DTT, as well as online services, in 50 countries across
    sub-Saharan Africa. As at 31 March 2018, the Group serviced 13.5 million
    subscribers, generated more than R47 billion in revenue, with a Trading
    Profit of over R6 billion and core headline earnings of over R1 billion. Having
    invested in and established operational and technology infrastructure
    across the continent for both linear and online services coupled with its
    high-quality, diverse content, the Group believes that it is prepared to
    maintain this leading position as video entertainment grows and evolves
    in Africa. Building on its focus on the customer and further investment in
    its online platforms are expected to provide further growth opportunities
    in the Rest of Africa and Connected Video on the back of healthy cash
    flows in South Africa.

    As the market for video  entertainment develops in Africa, the Group
    has sought to expand its subscriber base by acquiring quality content,
    including sport and local content, for significant periods of time. This
    includes the rights to broadcast live sporting events (through the
    Group's SuperSport Channels) such as the English Premier League,
    Premier Soccer League in South Africa, UEFA Champions League, and
    international rugby and cricket, as well as (through the Group's General
    Entertainment Channels) movies and series with major US and European
    studios. The Group also continues to focus on the development of its
    own original local content through wholly owned subsidiary M-Net in
    key markets across the continent. During the year ended 31 March 2018,
    the Group invested R2.8  billion in local general entertainment content
    (in addition to R1.3 billion on local sport) and improved the ratio of spend
    on local content to total general entertainment content from 34% to 38%.

    The value strategy in the Rest of Africa, of which cost control is a key
    component, is important as the Group looks to return its loss-making Rest
    of Africa operations to profitability. The key pillars of this strategy focus
    on the review of pricing to make content affordable to more consumers,
    accelerating subscriber acquisition through competitive set-top box
    offers, investing in a world-class retention capability and on customer
    service and delivery across the value chain. This strategy has shown
    positive results to date, stimulating subscriber growth, while losses are
    now stabilised, positioning the Business to return to profitability in the
    medium term.

    Connected Video provides the Group's online services through Showmax
    (its subscription video-on-demand division) and DStv Now brands.
    Showmax, launched in August 2015, offers a wide selection of movies and
    television series from leading Hollywood as well as local African studios.
    Showmax is fully localised in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya, and is
    positioned to expand further when the market opportunity presents itself.

    DStv Now provides subscribers an online experience on any streaming
    device and includes the majority of content available on the linear service.
    Through its subsidiary, Irdeto, the Group also provides content protection
    solutions, gaming security, connected transport security technology
    and software security to content owners, platform operators, device
    manufacturers and other providers of digital content. These products and
    services are used to secure and enable the delivery of valuable content
    and access to systems in the Group.

DISCLAIMER

Shareholders that are (i) non-South African natural persons (""Foreign Persons""); or (ii) associations, businesses,
close corporations, companies, concerns, enterprises, firms, partnerships, trusts, undertakings, voluntary
associations or other similar entities (""Entity"") and are incorporated, established or formed in any country other
than South Africa or in which any Foreign Person, directly or indirectly, has a financial interest (as defined in
section 1 of the Electronic Communications Act, 36 of 2005 (""ECA"")) or has any interest in either voting Shares
or paid-up capital of the Company, as contemplated under the ECA, and includes any Entity controlled by Foreign
Persons ((i) and (ii) collectively, ""Foreign Shareholders"") should take note of the variable entitlement to exercise
voting rights attaching to Shares held by Foreign Shareholders in certain circumstances in order to ensure
compliance by the Group with the restrictions placed on it by section 64(1) of the ECA, which restricts the ability
of a Foreign Shareholder to, directly or indirectly, exercise control over a holder of a commercial broadcasting
service licence in terms of the ECA, and have a financial interest or an interest in voting Shares or paid-up capital
in a holder of a commercial broadcasting service licence in terms of the ECA, which restriction is currently placed
at 20%. In particular, if at a meeting of Shareholders Foreign Shareholders hold in excess of 20% of the voting
rights attaching to the Shares, the Foreign Shareholders will be entitled to exercise only a pro rata portion of
the aggregate voting rights attached to the Shares held by all Foreign Shareholders at such time such that the
aggregate voting rights entitled to be exercised by Foreign Shareholders will not exceed 20% of the aggregate
voting rights entitled to be exercised by Shareholders. Please refer to ""Part XIII - Incorporation and Share Capital""
of the Pre-listing Statement which contains a summary of the variable voting rights attaching to Shares held by
Foreign Shareholders and Annexe 16 to the Pre-listing Statement setting out the salient provisions of the Company
MOI, including the terms attaching to Shares and the variable voting rights in relation to Foreign Shareholders.

As set out in the Pre-listing Statement, pursuant to a provision of the Company MOI, the Company is permitted to
reduce the voting rights of Shares (including Shares deposited in terms of the ADS facility) so that the aggregate
voting power of Shares that are presumptively owned or held by foreigners to South Africa (as envisaged in the
Company MOI) will not exceed 20% of the total voting power in the Company, in order to ensure compliance
with certain statutory requirements applicable in South Africa. For this purpose, the Company will presume in
particular that all Shares deposited in terms of the ADS facility are owned or held by foreigners to South Africa,
regardless of the actual nationality of the ADS holder. For further information in relation to the variable voting
structure in place in respect of the Company, please see the Pre-listing Statement.
