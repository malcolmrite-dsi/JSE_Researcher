                                       Speeches by Karen Wood, Chair and
                                       Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer


Karen Wood, Chair

I don’t need to tell any of you that 2020 has been a year like no other.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required all of us to adapt the way we work. While it has presented many challenges, it
has also given us opportunities to connect with people around the world, as today’s meeting has shown.

In response to the pandemic, Graham and his management team moved quickly to deploy South32’s crisis and
emergency protocols. The team was guided by three imperatives: keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe
and reliable operations and supporting the communities we work with.

Graham will speak more about our response to COVID-19 in his address but I do want to recognise the extraordinary
efforts from the entire South32 workforce. I want to pay particular tribute to the operational teams around the world
who have gone above and beyond, in accordance with our Purpose and our Values, to keep our people safe and help
support the communities where we operate.

The Board is deeply grateful to each and every member of the team.

Our people going home safe and well at the end of each day is at the core of everything we do. Sadly, we did not
meet that commitment when in May, Duncan Mankhedi Ngoato lost his life. Duncan was a diesel mechanic who
worked for Modi Mining, a contractor to South32 performing work at the Ifalethu operation which is part of the South
Africa Energy Coal business.

The Board has reviewed the findings of the investigation into Mr Ngoato’s death. Those findings highlighted the
causes and identified additional measures, which we are implementing, to do everything we can to ensure a similar
incident does not happen again. Again, Graham will talk about this in more detail.

This year we have changed our approach to disclosure of fatalities. Historically, it has been our practice to report
fatalities that occur where we have control over the work or the location where the work is being performed.

From this year we will also disclose any fatalities for contractor activities associated with our operations that take
place in locations where we do not have control.

No loss of life is acceptable and is felt – deeply - across South32.

In May we celebrated our fifth anniversary as a company. Over this time, we’ve taken a number of steps to optimise
our portfolio, unlock the full value of our business and identify and pursue new opportunities.

In the last year, we have progressed the divestment of South Africa Energy Coal, completed the review of our
manganese alloy smelters, announced an agreement for the sale of TEMCO in Australia and placed Metalloys in
South Africa into care and maintenance.

We advanced our development projects including the Hermosa project in Arizona and exercised an option with Trilogy
Metals to form the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects joint venture in the Ambler Mining District of Alaska.

These are just some of the milestones that mark our journey so far. Shortly, Graham will talk more about our evolving
portfolio.

Despite volatile prices and government actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 impacting some of our operations, we
delivered a strong operating performance.

We reported Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 1.2 billion US dollars and free
cash flow of 583 million US dollars.

At the end of the 2020 financial year, we had a net cash balance of 298 million US dollars.
                                                                                                                         2
We returned 424 million US dollars to shareholders during the reporting period. This included 323 million US dollars
returned to shareholders as part of our ongoing capital management program.

Of the capital returned, dividends in respect of the financial year totalled 3.2 US cents per share (or 4.7 cents in
Australian dollar terms), including a fully franked final dividend of one US cent per share.

Having expanded our capital management program to 1.43 billion US dollars in February 2020, the Board responded
quickly to preserve the strength of our balance sheet by suspending our on-market share buy-back in March.

Following another quarter of strong operating performance and the further strengthening of our financial position, we
have recently lifted our on-market share buy-back suspension. Our capital management program is 93 per cent
complete with 106 million US dollars remaining to be returned to shareholders, ahead of the program’s extension or
expiry on 3 September 2021.

These decisions were taken consistent with our capital management framework, which prioritises maintaining safe
and reliable operations and an investment grade credit rating.

Our intent is to distribute a minimum of 40% of Underlying earnings as ordinary dividends.

We encourage competition for excess capital – such as investment in the business, acquisitions, greenfield
exploration, share buy-backs, and special dividends.

Over the past five years, we have paid 1.9 billion US dollars in dividends.

The Board’s well-established practice of regularly visiting our operations and offices around the world was disrupted
by COVID-19 during the year. These visits are a very important part of our work and give us the opportunity to better
understand the challenges our people face wherever they are located. They also help inform us of the cultural
aspects of our company’s work that underpin the way we do business.

We did manage to complete visits to Hillside Aluminium in Richards Bay, South Africa, our office in Johannesburg,
and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in New South Wales before COVID-19 intervened.

As you would expect, the Board moved to meet virtually from March with increased frequency. We continued to hear
from local leadership teams and held virtual sessions with the teams at GEMCO, on Groote Eylandt in the Northern
Territory, and at Hillside Aluminium and focused on their responses to COVID-19.

We are anxious to resume our direct engagement with our operational teams as soon as it is possible to do so.

Since the formation of South32, we have been committed to mitigating our impact on the environment.

In the 2020 financial year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 23.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. We are on track to
meet our FY21 target and keep those emissions at or below FY15 levels.

We recognise that if we are to meet our commitment for net zero emissions by 2050, then we need a plan to take us
there.

Work is now underway on our next set of emissions targets and that plan will be released as part of our FY21
reporting.

We are also targeting substantial reductions in our Scope 1 emissions at Worsley Alumina and Illawarra Metallurgical
Coal in Australia – the two assets that account for the bulk of our Scope 1 emissions - and are progressing our
decarbonisation studies for those operations.

We appreciate that our stakeholders want to better understand our rationale for joining industry associations.

There is also an interest in how we might address potential divergent positions on material topics like climate change.

In response - and for the first time - we have published Our Approach to Industry Associations, which outlines our
view on the important role of these groups.

We believe that the right industry associations can help us understand, learn and contribute to industry best practice
while also providing an avenue to engage in, and influence, matters affecting our industry.

When the company was formed in 2015, we defined our Purpose as making a difference by developing natural
resources to improve people’s lives now and for generations to come and being trusted by our owners and partners to
                                                                                                                       3
realise the potential of their resources. That Purpose is unchanged. To do this successfully we must have deep and
respectful relationships with local communities.

Across the world, we have supported our communities with investments of 24 and a half million US dollars focused on
four key areas aligned to community need.

These are: education and leadership, health and social wellbeing, economic participation and natural resource
resilience.

We recognise the traditional rights and values of Indigenous Peoples and respect their cultural heritage.

As a company, we understand the importance of engaging and working with our Traditional Owners and Indigenous
groups in relation to our activities. We work to obtain free prior and informed consent before we operate.

In Australia, we recently launched our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan, which raises the bar on our previous
commitments.

Under the Plan, we will further embed reconciliation activities in our core business practices and decision-making. It
also documents our support for the establishment of a First Nations Voice to be enshrined in the Australian
Constitution as outlined in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

In June, we began an internal review of our approach to cultural heritage management to determine where we may
need to strengthen or enhance our systems. We are involved in discussions to help review current systems across
Australia and ensure all voices are heard and considered.

Our multi-year partnership with the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation to support Indigenous students to
access schooling and complete Year 12 is just one of the ways we’re supporting the development of emerging and
future community leaders.

On the other side of the world, at our Cerro Matoso operation in Colombia, we reached agreement with 15 groups,
including seven Indigenous communities covering engagement, investment and environmental management.

These agreements provide a strong foundation to work in partnership to create healthier and stronger communities.

The work we’re doing is helping to empower Indigenous peoples and communities to make choices and have a say in
the decisions that affect them and this will have a lasting impact that spans future generations.

We know we can only be successful when our communities share in the benefits of what we do.

We also seek to enable economic participation through our commitments to build a diverse workforce that is
representative of the countries and communities where we operate.

I believe that businesses need to find the same passion and commitment for diversity as we do for safety. Outcomes
will be better if we truly reflect the society in which we operate.

We have set targets to increase the number of women who work for us, and in South Africa, to grow the
representation of Black People in our workforce.

Overall representation of women increased by one percent across our business to 19 percent – not yet enough, but
progress.

On our Board, women account for 37.5 percent and on our Lead Team 44 percent – both of which meet our targets.

In South Africa, representation of Black People in our workforce and management is 83 percent, up one percent from
a year earlier and heading towards our target of 85 percent.

Looking ahead, uncertainty is likely to persist in global markets for some time and we expect to face our share of
challenges as the world continues to respond to COVID-19.

We will remain resolute in our focus on preserving our strong balance sheet and on creating long-term value.

Graham and his team are positioning us for further growth and success.

Most importantly, we will all work to ensure everyone goes home safe and well at the end of every shift.



                                                                                                                     4
On behalf of the Board and all shareholders, I want to thank Graham, his lead team and everyone who is part of
South32 for their important and valued contributions.

I’d also like to thank shareholders for your continued support and for joining us today.

I’ll now hand you to Graham.

Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.

While the COVID-19 pandemic only emerged in the second half of the 2020 financial year, it’s impact on our business
was significant and it has heightened our focus on the things that matter most.

I’d like to start by talking to our safety performance, which is fundamental to our success as a business.

The death of Duncan Mankhedi Ngoato, who was fatally injured at our South Africa Energy Coal operation, is
unacceptable. I offer my sincere condolences to Duncan’s family, friends and colleagues for their tremendous loss
and we have provided support to those affected by his death.

A global stop for safety has given our teams the chance to talk about what happened and what we need to do to make
our sites safer.

We conducted a full investigation into the incident in conjunction with Duncan’s employer, Modi Mining. The learnings
from the investigation have been shared at all our sites, and with his employer to prevent a similar tragedy occurring
again.

While we saw a nine per cent year-on-year decrease in our Total Recordable Injury Frequency and increased
reporting of potential incidents and near misses this year, there is still more work to be done in this space.

We’re increasing capability to manage health and safety risk across the organisation, sharing learnings and
continuously improving the way we work.

Nothing is more important than our people going home safe and well.

I’d also like to take a moment to acknowledge Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi.

I first worked with Dr X, as he was fondly known to many of us, when we both sat on the Board of Richards Bay
Minerals. His passion for people, communities and South Africa impressed me greatly.

Over the years’ Dr X provided priceless advice and guidance.

Whenever he visited our operations and offices it was clear to see what an inspiration he was to our people.

Dr X leaves a considerable legacy and he is missed by everyone who knew him.

The COVID-19 pandemic took all of us by surprise this year.

As Karen said, our response has been focused around three areas - keeping our people safe and well; maintaining
safe and reliable operations; and supporting our communities.

Critical controls were introduced, such as screening and testing, additional cleaning and hygiene measures, and
physical distancing to help keep our people safe.

Importantly, we rolled out a range of wellbeing initiatives and support tools to help our people and their families,
including online resources and access to health and wellbeing experts.

To give our people space to focus on the work that matters most, we reviewed our priorities and stopped work that
was not business-critical.

Our communities have also been top of mind. We pledged 7 million US dollars to support our communities to respond
and recover from the health and economic impacts of COVID-19.

I’m proud of how our teams mobilised quickly to respond to this unprecedented event, while rising to the challenges of
working and living in new ways.

                                                                                                                       5
The pandemic has created substantial market uncertainty.

To keep our business resilient, we reduced our planned sustaining capital expenditure, pursued cost efficiencies
across the Group and suspended our on-market share buy-back, with the suspension lifted earlier this month.

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we delivered a strong operating result for the year.

Production records were set at Australian Manganese ore, Hillside Aluminium and Brazil Alumina.

Worsley Alumina delivered a further two per cent increase as the refinery progressed towards sustainable production
at nameplate capacity.

Nine of our 10 operations achieved lower operating costs.

Turning now to our portfolio.

During the year we advanced our strategy to exit lower returning businesses, which is expected to improve margins
and lift return on invested capital.

A key enabler to take our portfolio forward is the sale of South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources, which is subject
to the satisfaction of material conditions. It is on-track for completion in the December 2020 half year.

Following an extensive review, we achieved outcomes for both of our manganese alloy smelters.

In August we entered into a binding conditional agreement with GFG Alliance for the sale of TEMCO. It will continue to
operate into the future, which is a great outcome for our people and the local community.

Unfavourable conditions meant divestment was not an immediate option for Metalloys, which was placed on care and
maintenance. This preserves the option to pursue divestment in the future.

Our strategy of building a pipeline of development options by partnering in early stage greenfield exploration projects
saw us acquire a 50 per cent interest in the Ambler Metals joint venture after we exercised our option with Trilogy
Metals.

Investing in exploration is integral to our strategy and this was an important milestone as we reshape and improve our
portfolio by adding high-quality copper and base metal development options.

At our Hermosa project in Arizona, we advanced the pre-feasibility study for the Taylor Deposit, which is expected to
be completed in the June 2021 half year. We also published our initial Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark
Deposit.

A feasibility study for the Eagle Downs project is progressing, with a final investment decision expected by the end of
the calendar year.

It is my firm belief that when mining is done well and sustainably, it makes a positive difference in the world. We know
we can impact people’s lives for the better through our environmental and social performance and we take that
responsibility seriously.

To demonstrate our commitment to corporate sustainability we signed the United Nations Global Compact. We’re
implementing the Compact’s Ten Principles, which span human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

Further progress was made on our decarbonisation studies at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and Worsley Alumina, the
sites where we want to achieve substantial reductions in Scope 1 emissions.

At our Hermosa project we completed the remediation of two million tonnes of tailings from a legacy mine to reduce
the risk of run-off contaminating local waterways.

Working together with our communities to create shared value is one of the most important ways we can help improve
the way people live and work.

We invested 24.5 million US dollars in community initiatives and activities including the 7 million US dollars we
contributed as part of our COVID-19 response. We also donated one million Australian dollars to bushfire relief efforts
in Australia.

In Colombia, we transferred more than 390 hectares of land to seven Indigenous Councils of the Zenú community and
the Black Community Council of Bocas de Uré for sustainable agriculture.
                                                                                                                   6
To make an impact in the areas that matter most, we developed a framework to measure our investments across
education, economic participation, health and social wellbeing, and natural resource resilience.

Wherever we operate, we engage the local Indigenous communities to make sure our site work programs are
sensitive to areas of cultural significance and the views of our traditional and local communities.

As Karen mentioned, we commenced a review of our approach to cultural heritage management towards the end of
the 2020 financial year which is ongoing.

This year we marked our fifth anniversary as South32. We’ve become a successful, stand-alone company that
delivers on its purpose and strategy.

We couldn’t have done this without the collective efforts of our people and I extend my thanks to all of our teams
around the world.

Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, improved
performance at several operations, and made solid progress on reshaping our business for the future.

Looking forward, we expect market uncertainty to continue for some time.

We’ll continue to progress our strategy, ensuring we preserve our balance sheet and deliver value for shareholders.

We also expect to deliver a further reduction in operating costs across the majority of our operations.

Most importantly, we’ll continue our unwavering focus on creating a safe workplace for all of our people.

Thank you for your ongoing support for South32. I’ll now hand back to our Chair.

Corporate Update
-   We continue to respond to COVID-19, adjusting to the different phases of the pandemic across the jurisdictions
    where we operate, focussing on keeping our people well, maintaining safe and reliable operations and supporting
    our communities.
-   We further simplified our functional support structures by reorganising the accountabilities of our leadership 
    team and will reduce its size to align to our planned portfolio changes. In support of this initial step towards 
    delivering a further US$50M in annualised savings from FY22, we have commenced the staged reduction of our office 
    footprint, including the downsizing of our offices in Singapore and London.
-   Net cash (note 1) increased by US$70M to US$368M, despite a build in working capital during the quarter. Subsequent
    to the end of the period, we paid a fully-franked ordinary dividend of US$48M in respect of the June 2020 half year.
-   We received net distributions (note 2) of US$21M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments 
    (EAI) in the September 2020 quarter following the payment of US$73M (100% share) in royalties at Australia Manganese 
    in respect of the prior 6 month period.
-   Following another quarter of strong operating performance and the further strengthening of our financial position 
    we have lifted our on-market share buy-back suspension. Our US$1.43B capital management program is 92% complete with 
    US$121M remaining to be returned to shareholders, ahead of its extension or expiry on 3 September 2021(note 3).
-   We continued to progress the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings 
    Proprietary Limited (Seriti Resources) (note 4) receiving final approval under Section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum 
    Resources Development Act in the period. Separately the Competition Commission of South Africa recommended the 
    Competition Tribunal conditionally approve the transaction with the Competition Tribunal hearings expected to be finalized
    in the December 2020 quarter. While the transaction remains subject to material conditions including approvals from Eskom
    Holdings SOC Limited (note 5) we expect to agree a resolution for the future of our South Africa Energy Coal business by 
    no later than 31 December 2020. 
-   GEMCO entered into a binding agreement to divest the TEMCO manganese alloy smelter, which is subject to approval from
    Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board. Our Metalloys manganese alloy smelter remains on care and maintenance.


Development and Exploration Update
-   We progressed our pre-feasibility study for the Hermosa project’s Taylor Deposit and scoping study for the Clark Deposit.
    Study work to date supports a potential unconstrained development of Taylor, including its integration with Clark. All options
    under consideration have different cost, permitting and schedule implications. To allow finalisation of this work, the Taylor
    pre-feasibility study is now expected to be concluded in the June 2021 half year at which time we will provide an update on our
    preferred configuration, expected capital profile and timeline to first production.
-   We remain on-track to consider a final investment decision with our joint venture partner for the Eagle Downs Metallurgical
    Coal project by the end of this calendar year.
-   At our Ambler Metals joint venture, permitting of the proposed industrial access road progressed, with the signing of the
    Record of Decision by the United States Bureau of Land Management and issuance of the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit
    by the United States Army Corp. of Engineers. The joint venture also appointed Ramzi Fawaz as its President and CEO during
    the quarter. Mr. Fawaz brings extensive leadership experience in North American project development to the role.
-   We completed a pre-feasibility study for the Eastern Leases at Australia Manganese during the period, progressing the project
    to feasibility stage. The Eastern Leases has the potential to extend the mine life at our low-cost GEMCO mine. Exploration
    drilling in the Southern Areas is expected to recommence in the December 2020 quarter.
-   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
    US$5M during the September 2020 quarter. Our greenfield exploration activity continues to be impacted by COVID-19
    restrictions on the movement of people and equipment, which has limited the ability to execute exploration work programs in
    certain jurisdictions. We continue to review the evolving environment and work with our partners to optimise our exploration
    programs to maximise the benefit of the US$18M we plan to spend in FY21.
-   We directed US$8M towards exploration programs at our existing operations and development options in the September 2020
    quarter (US$7M capitalised), including US$2M at Hermosa (all capitalised).

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production increased by 20% (or 1.0Mt) to 6.3Mt in the September 2020 
quarter as production ramped up following the disruption to operations caused by the nationwide COVID-19 
restrictions in the prior quarter. Export sales benefitted as additional volumes were delivered from new pits 
at the Klipspruit colliery, ahead of mechanical completion of the life extension project, which was achieved
subsequent to the end of the period.

Domestic sales increased by 20% during the September 2020 quarter, as improved 
demand from Eskom following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions was met by higher production volumes from our 
Khutala colliery and a drawdown in finished goods inventory.

As we continue to maximise margins and suspend production from loss-making pits, we now expect H1 FY21 saleable
production to be at the lower end of our 10.5 to 12.5Mt guidance range.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 21% (or 419kt) to 2.4Mt in the September 2020 quarter 
with the operation’s successful return to a three longwall configuration in April 2020 supporting a 22% increase in 
metallurgical coal saleable production. Energy coal saleable production increased by 18% to a record 508kt in the period
as we monetized low-margin coal wash material.

FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 7.7Mt as we plan for lower volumes of energy coal sales over the remainder 
of the year and longwall moves are scheduled for the December 2020 and June 2021 quarters.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 3% (or 26kwmt) to 880kwmt in the September 2020 quarter
as favourable ore characteristics supported an improvement in primary concentrator output, more than offsetting 
lower volumes of our Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) fines product. PC02 fines contributed 9% of total production 
in the period. With its lower relative price realisations, PC02 contributed to an overall modest discount for our
 manganese ore sales to the high grade 44% index (note 10) during the September 2020 quarter.

While we continue to monitor market conditions and the potential impact from the wet season across the remainder of 
the year,FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,500kwmt.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 7% (or 2kt) to 27kt in the September 2020 quarter as one of the four 
furnaces at TEMCO remained offline.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 55% (or 207kwmt) to 581kwmt in the September 2020 quarter 
as the operation returned to full capacity, following the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in the prior quarter. 
We took advantage of favourable market conditions by utilising higher cost trucking as an alternate route to market
 while rail logistics continued to normalise. While we continue to monitor market conditions and the attractiveness 
of higher cost trucking, FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 2,000kwmt.

We did not produce any manganese alloy in the September 2020 quarter as our Metalloys manganese alloy smelter remained 
on care and maintenance.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production decreased by 14% (or 12.6kt) to 76.6kt in the September 2020 quarter as planned
surface maintenance led to a 15% reduction in ore processed. Ore mined volumes declined by a lesser 4% during the period as
continued strong underground performance supported the establishment of run of mine inventory.

Processed silver, lead and zinc grades met our expectations during the September 2020 quarter and FY21 production guidance
remains unchanged (silver 11,800koz, lead 113.9kt and zinc 60.7kt).

  1.         Principal risks and uncertainties

  Risk management

  Our approach to risk management is governed by our risk management framework, which has been in place since the
  inception of our company in 2015. The minimum mandatory requirements for the management of risks that have a
  material impact on our purpose, strategy and business plans are defined in our material risk management standard.

  The framework and the standard are delivered through the System of Risk Management which is aligned to the
  principles of the International Standard for Risk Management AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018. This approach applies to all
  employees, Directors and contractors of the company and its subsidiaries. Our risks are regularly assessed and
  managed at both a company-wide strategic level and at a material tactical level for operations, functions and projects.

  Material risks

  Our System of Risk Management and assurance processes are based on the three lines of defence model and aim at
  managing our material risks. It enables us to:
  – Provide stable and consistent processes, tools and routines to identify and regularly assess the most impactful risks
  and opportunities;
  – Ensure predictable outcomes and prevent unforeseen events with material impacts;
  Registered Office Level 35 108 St Georges Terrace Perth WA 6000 Australia
  ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia                                                                        1
– Ensure risks are well understood and managed at all levels of the organisation; and
– Eliminate risks where appropriate or improve our processes using a risk based approach.
Risks assessed as material are routinely reported to the South32 Lead Team and reviewed by the Risk and Audit
Committee as well as the Sustainability Committee; assisting the Board to carry out its role in overseeing our risk
management and assurance practices. Our reliance on data that supports the management of our material risks has
been significantly improved, with the introduction of our new risk management tool, Global360.

This software connects data relating to the management of our risks, events, hazards and assurance actions,
providing transparency of real-time status of our risks and controls and improving our rate of decision-making and
responses. Aside from helping us manage our operations and functions, reliable data on material risks significantly
contributes towards the management of our strategic risks. This provides insight into trends and emerging themes that
can trigger a review of our business plans or inform a change in strategic direction.

Strategic risks

Our strategic risks and associated management response are evaluated every year. The review process is informed
by external and internal events that could have a potential impact on our organisation, as well as emerging themes
across our material risks. In FY20, we identified 13 strategic exposures that could influence our plans and the
sustainability of our business. With the interruption of COVID-19 we have focused our response on three key areas –
keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and supporting our communities, all of
which are critical to protecting the future of our business.

Ensuring that our people go home safe and well
Strategic Risk: A safe and healthy working environment is fundamental to living our values.

Opportunities: Ensuring that our people go home safe and well drives the culture we aspire to and meets societal
expectations, as well as our expectations of each other.

Threats: The impact of not having a safe working environment can be devastating for our employees, contractors and
communities. It can alter lives, impact shareholder returns, stakeholder confidence and ultimately our licence to
operate.

Our response:
    -   In everything we do, we focus on the health and safety of our people, contractors and communities;
    -   We have a system of risk management, comprehensive health and safety policies, systems and standards
        with associated performance requirements designed to prevent and mitigate potential exposure to health and
        safety risks;
    -   We engage, develop and train our people to ensure our work is well designed and executed;
    -   We investigate actual and potential significant events, put controls in place, and share our learnings across
        the organisation – so that everyone can benefit;
    -   We continuously improve our work environment to make it safer and more productive for our people; and
    -   We have an independent assurance function that reviews our risk register and the associated controls, to test
        how effective they are.


Actions by government, political risks and/or tax authorities
Strategic Risk: When changes in legislation, regulation and/or policy impact our strategic goals and the way we work,
we aim to effectively manage this uncertainty.

This includes uncertainty surrounding direct and indirect taxes, and royalties where we operate, as well as around
broader policy decisions and regulatory changes, relating but not limited to:
    - Nationalisation of mineral resources;
    -   Renegotiation or nullification of contracts;
    -   Leases, permits or agreements; and
    -   Environmental performance.

Opportunities: Proactive engagement leading to strong relationships with governments provides mutual understanding
of drivers for decision-making. This increases clarity around policy and regulatory environments, enables appropriate
and tailored responses to issues, and provides investment certainty.
                                                                                                                   2
Threats: Legislation adverse to our business and regulatory or policy decisions taken by governments can result in
operational disruption, affect future planning or in extreme cases lead to cessation of operations.

Our response:
    -  We have the specialised knowledge we need through employment or consulting, including tax management
       capability, tax advice, and external relations advice;
    -   We monitor political activity in all jurisdictions we operate in;
    -   We engage with our key stakeholders in all jurisdictions where we operate and identify them through active
        mapping and developing engagement plans;
    -   We work through selected industry associations to influence how the industry is positioned;
    -   We monitor policy, legislative and regulatory changes and we also engage with relevant authorities; and
    -   We produce an annual Tax Transparency and Payments to Governments Report, which shows how we meet
        our regulatory tax obligations.


Portfolio composition
Strategic Risk: Our objective is to outperform by offering our shareholders exposure to high-quality operations in
commodities with a strong and sustainable outlook, in jurisdictions where we believe we can operate into the future –
in line with our values.

Opportunities: We invest for value in our preferred commodities and jurisdictions. We do this by progressing our
internal development options, by acquiring exploration opportunities, development projects or existing operations and
by divesting non-preferred exposures that we believe will not generate an acceptable shareholder return.

Threats: If we don’t invest in a disciplined way or divest non-preferred exposures for value, we could reduce
shareholder returns. Climate change, and the transition to a low-carbon economy, may present both risks and
opportunities for our portfolio commodity composition. This is discussed under 'Climate change resilience' on page 30.

Our response:
   -   We keep our strategy front of mind as it informs the decisions we make about portfolio composition. We
       formally evaluate our strategic positioning annually with the Board and provide updates throughout the year;
    -   We have a dedicated greenfields exploration team focused on building a pipeline of low-cost, high-quality
        resource development options;
    -   We apply a rigorously developed and independently verified Commodity Price Protocol (CPP) process, to
        develop long-term views for our portfolio commodities and foreign exchange rates for the jurisdictions we
        operate in;
    -   We maintain a life of operations planning process. By evaluating the embedded options in our operations, we
        can progress with organic options at the right time;
    -   We follow strong due diligence processes for acquisitions and new business ventures;
    -   We apply a standardised valuation methodology with consistent key macroeconomic assumptions;
    -   We have a mature and independent peer review process, which we rigorously follow to inform key investment
        decisions; and
    -   We actively manage portfolio change with dedicated specialists to deliver integration and separation benefits.


Global economic uncertainty, volatility and liquidity
Strategic Risk: Our aim is to manage risks related to uncertain and changing macroeconomic conditions. We do the
same when it comes to the volatility in commodity, currency and debt capital markets, given how much they can
impact our earnings, balance sheet and growth goals.

Opportunities: We retain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating and capital discipline to enhance our
resilience through economic cycles. This approach also provides greater financial flexibility when market conditions
are favourable, which in turn allows us to create strong competition for capital. By investing selectively in our existing
operations and growth opportunities, or increasing returns to shareholders we aim to maximise total shareholder
returns over time.



                                                                                                                      3
Threats: A significant deterioration in economic conditions, market demand and falling commodity prices, and/or an
adverse movement in exchange rates has the potential to significantly reduce profitability, cash flow and total
shareholder returns.

Our response:
   - Our diverse portfolio strengthens our resilience to the disruption of any one commodity, geography or
       operation;
    -   We prioritise a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating, so that we remain in control
        through economic cycles;
    -   We test our financial strength across a range of scenarios, including a depressed demand and pricing
        environment. We also maintain a minimum liquidity buffer;
    -   We adjust our capital management plans according to market conditions;
    -   We maintain strong relationships with high-quality customers and suppliers from all around the world;
    -   We mostly sell our products with reference to floating, market-based prices, which are broadly inversely
        correlated with floating global currency markets and the input costs we’re exposed to; and
    -   We carry out an annual review of commodity prices, which we use to inform our operational plans.


Unexpected major events or natural catastrophes
Strategic Risk: Our operations and transport networks can be disrupted by events such as pandemics, unexpected
natural disasters or major process failures.

Opportunities: Delivering an outstanding performance in health, safety, environment and communities enhances our
operational and business resilience.

Threats: Failure to manage major unexpected events or natural catastrophes could result in a significant event or
other long-term damage that could harm the Group’s financial performance and/or licence to operate. The role of
climate change in increasing the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes is also addressed under 'Climate
change resilience’ on page 30.

Our response:
    -   When facing potential catastrophes, we put safety and wellbeing at the heart of everything we do;
    -   We use a strong system of risk management in design, construction and operation phases, to analyse risks
        and design plans that prevent or limit business impacts;
    -   We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place with trigger action response scenarios.
        We’ve tested these to make sure we can respond rapidly to major events and safely restore our operations
        and protect the health of people and the communities in which we operate;
    -   We have governance functions independent of the operations that provide assurance against our own
        comprehensive internal standards including equipment integrity, tailings dams management and technical
        stewardship;
    -   We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks (this
        may not fully cover all financial losses); and
    -   We work with external experts, relevant industry bodies and technology suppliers, to provide additional
        assurance and input.


Key talent identification, attraction and retention
Strategic Risk: Our ability to identify, attract and retain key talent and develop capabilities is fundamental to delivering
our strategic priorities.

Opportunities: Defined talent management processes can help lift performance and better enable us to deliver on our
strategy.

Threats: Failure to manage talent and develop the right capabilities within our business can ultimately erode
shareholder value.

Our response:


                                                                                                                       4
    -   We focus on enhancing our offering to employees and potential employees to distinguish ourselves in the
        market through effective approaches to talent and recruitment management, remuneration, skills development
        and succession planning;
    -   We continually seek ways to better engage and empower our workforce, including leading flexibility policies
        and a focus on ensuring we maintain an inclusive workplace;
    -   Our dedication to ‘making a difference’ inspires our people;
    -   We identify key talent and provide them with experience and growth through time in critical roles;
    -   Our strategic planning process identifies capability requirements for the future;
    -   We work to strengthen our reputation and status in the community as an employer of choice through
        community engagement programs; and
    -   We continue to improve our long-term workforce planning and talent management program across the
        organisation.


Evolving culture of the organisation
Strategic Risk: We recognise the value of a strong culture as a critical enabler to how we deliver our purpose and
strategy.

Opportunities: Proactively and deliberately shaping our culture will help us to deliver on our purpose and strategy
while being guided by our values.

Threats: A misaligned culture can result in organisational underperformance, and financial and reputational damage.

Our response:
   -   We are working to better understand the gap between what our culture is and what we want it to be – and to
       have a clear approach to help us close any gaps;
    -   We continue to develop an inclusive and diverse workplace where our people reflect the countries and
        communities in which we operate;
    -   Our Board monitors and assesses culture through Operation visits; staff engagements; endorsement and
        tracking of inclusion and diversity metrics, employee engagement results, and Speak Up data;
    -   We are making sure our ways of working (systems, symbols and behaviours) are aligned to our aspired
        culture; and
    -   We identify and deploy effective levers to deliberately shape our culture in an ever-evolving world.


Predictable operational performance
Strategic Risk: Predictable operational performance improves our ability to keep our people safe, meet our regulatory
and social obligations, reliably provide quality products to our customers and deliver shareholder returns.

Opportunities: We mature our operating system to control the operations and processes that deliver value. We spend
capital annually to sustain our production capacity to create value and we invest in high-return projects and improve
the reliability of our production capability.

Threats: If we can’t safely achieve our production targets and mitigate rising unit costs, it will impact directly on our
profits and cash flow, as well as our ability to meet our commitments to our stakeholders.

Our response:

    -   We carry out rigorous quality assurance programs over our operations, marketing and logistics;
    -   We review our asset health and integrity on a regular basis;
    -   We reconcile the performance of our Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve quality against production on an
        annual basis;
    -   We carry out rigorous modelling and reviews of our geotechnical drilling data;
    -   We operate within target inventory operating windows and regularly review our internal scheduling and
        operational planning;
    -   We monitor raw material supply contracts and implement early detection procedures at load ports;
    -   We utilise long-term and short-term planning, scheduling and verification processes;
                                                                                                                       5
    -   We carry out operational resource planning and regularly review our productivity metrics;
    -   We apply structured work design processes for critical or high value tasks; and
    -   We apply verification systems to ensure we’re compliant with work standards.




Maintain competitiveness through innovation and technology
Strategic Risk: Technology and innovation are advancing at a rapid pace. Companies who are unable to effectively
leverage technology and innovation will find themselves falling behind in shareholder returns.

Opportunities: To stay competitive, we will position our organisation to effectively identify, adopt and sustain
technology and innovation that delivers shareholder returns.

Threats: Failure to keep pace with and leverage, advances in technology could result in reduced shareholder returns.
Cyber security incidents could pose multiple risks including disruption to operations, theft, disclosure or corruption of
information.

Our response:
    -   We are continuously improving our approach to innovation, improvement and technology;
    -   We are delivering specific programs focused on adoption and improvement of critical technology capabilities
        across multiple time horizons including cyber security, data science, automation and mobility;
    -   We have a clear, value-based, ‘portfolio’ approach to testing and scaling up innovation across the group;
    -   We have rigorous internal standards and processes (technology ‘ways of working’);
    -   We benchmark our digital operations’ performance against industry best practice and have organised the
        coordination and integration of technology advances into South32’s growth portfolio;
    -   We actively manage cyber security and data centre risks through our system of risk management and have
        increased our cyber security controls in response to COVID-19 and an increase in remote working;
    -   We monitor customer satisfaction and manage customer support; and
    -   We follow a rigorous assurance process for our approach to innovation, improvement and technology.


Security of supply of logistics chain and critical services
Strategic Risk: Together with our customers and suppliers we manage the inbound and outbound supply chains.
Critical categories include raw materials, energy, water, gas, heavy mobile equipment, tyres and logistics (which
includes road, rail, air and shipping).

Opportunities: By securing commercially competitive terms, we capitalise on market opportunities while supporting the
safe and reliable performance of our operations.

Threats: Failure to secure commercially acceptable terms could disrupt our operations, increase operating costs and
damage our reputation. Pandemic has potential to disrupt in and out bound supply chains. Climate change has
potential to increase frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events which may threaten our supply chain,
logistics and critical services. This is addressed under 'Climate change resilience’ on page 30.

Our response:
    -  We have a business continuity plan that ensures we optimise existing supply chains and identify alternate
       sources for critical supplies;
    -   We build strong strategic partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers on a long-term, mutually beneficial basis;
    -   We have a clearly defined transformation strategy and enterprise and supplier development program in South
        Africa aimed at building and growing small and medium enterprises; and
    -   We actively review and manage payment terms to support small and local businesses in all jurisdictions.


Maintain, realise or enhance the value of our resources and reserves
Strategic Risk: We exist to realise the potential of the resources and reserves we are entrusted to develop.



                                                                                                                    6
We work to continually optimise our operations through sound technical and economic understanding of our resources
and reserves.

Opportunities: We continue to enhance our understanding of our resources and reserves. We leverage this enhanced
understanding through the annual business planning cycle to investigate additional opportunities to add value to our
business.

Threats: If we fail to continually optimise our operations and projects, it will have a significant impact on shareholder
returns and ultimately, the sustainability of the company.

Our response:

    -   We report Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (including Coal Resources and Coal Reserves) in
        accordance with the JORC Code as required in Chapter 5 of the ASX Listing Rules;
    -   We apply an annual business planning standard and process, structured to maximise value throughout the life
        of our operations;
    -   Our capital prioritisation, capital allocation and planning processes prioritise the highest-value options across
        our portfolio;
    -   We apply a rigorous project development process that includes independent peer review of project risks and
        approval tollgates; and
    -   Our closure standard ensures that our full-life-of-operations value incorporates closure and rehabilitation
        liabilities.


Climate change resilience
Strategic Risk: South32 has been actively addressing risks associated with climate change for several years. By using
climate change scenarios, we can identify opportunities and threats to our portfolio and operations.

We assess these risks through a framework that includes policy, market and physical factors.

Opportunities: We regularly assess our customer and broader stakeholder preferences, as well as developments in
policy and competitive technologies, to ensure our products remain in demand and resilient. Our pipeline of
development options and exploration programs include commodities with a favourable outlook in a low carbon future,
with a bias to base metals.

Threats: Failure to build the resilience of our business to the physical impacts of climate change, reduce our
emissions and respond to changes in policy and technology could negatively impact our supply chain, business
continuity and access to key inputs (such as water), our communities, costs, legal exposure, demand for our products,
stakeholder confidence and ultimately shareholder returns. Refer to related risks of ‘Security of supply of logistics
chain and critical services’, ‘Unexpected major events or natural catastrophes’ and ‘Portfolio composition’.

Our response:
    -  We seek to understand our portfolio performance in a range of future climate scenarios, considering both
       opportunities and threats;
    -   We identify potential controls in the short, medium and long-term to improve the climate change resilience of
        our portfolio;
    -   We support the Paris Agreement objectives and are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by
        2050;
    -   We identify and implement greenhouse gas reduction projects and energy planning, with our emissions
        reduction targets linked to remuneration;
    -   We use climate modelling data to inform us of the level of risk to our operational plans;
    -   We prioritise our land management efforts to improve resilience, including minimising land disturbance and
        maximising rehabilitation efforts; and
    -   We’re transparent in our disclosure of climate change-related opportunities and threats in our annual
        reporting, which is aligned to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
        Disclosures. Further details on this risk and its management is detailed in our Sustainable Development
        Report.


Evolving stakeholder expectations
                                                                                                                      7
Strategic Risk: There are evolving expectations of mining and metals companies by employees, government,
investors, lenders, host communities and broader society. Our stakeholders may have divergent views and wants.

We actively engage our stakeholders to understand and respond to their views and identify ways we can create
social, environmental and economic value.

Opportunities: We undertake proactive, collaborative and transparent engagement with our stakeholders, to build
relationships based on trust and shared understanding. Our ongoing licence to operate will be supported through
recognition of our contribution to our stakeholders and broader society.

Threats: Failure to achieve stakeholder support could damage our reputation and negatively impact our licence to
operate, limiting our ability to grow our business in existing and new jurisdictions, and impacting our ability to access
funding for new or existing operations.

Our response:
    -    Our purpose and strategy expressly balance economic outcomes with social and environmental outcomes,
         now and into the future. In the decisions we take, we look to minimise impact and create enduring social,
        environmental and economic value for all our stakeholders;
     -   We undertake internal and external stakeholder analysis and engagement on a wide range of financial,
         environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Our approach is aligned with the ICMM Mining Principles
         and Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards;
     -   We recognise that mineral resources are managed by governments on behalf of their citizens. We proactively
         engage with governments to keep public policymakers informed and we advocate for our positions. We
         monitor policy and political developments;
     -   We always aim to build strong, honest and meaningful relationships with local communities, so that we’re
         ready to listen to their concerns. We regularly complete and review community perception surveys, social
         baseline studies and impact and opportunity assessments;
     -   We have a rigorous process to understand the expectations of our shareholders on a wide range of issues
         informed by regular engagement; and
     -   We transparently report on our risks, opportunities, regulatory obligations, commitments and areas where
         we’re working that are relevant to our stakeholders.

Corporate Update
-    We continue to prudently manage our balance sheet, taking action to maintain the financial strength of our business. Following
     our decision to suspend our on-market share buy-back program on 27 March, we did not purchase any shares during the
     quarter. Our US$1.43B capital management program remains 92% complete with US$121M of our suspended on-market
     share
     buy-back program remaining, ahead of its extension or expiry on 4 September 2020 (note 1).
-    We received net distributions (note 2) of US$313M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI)
     in FY20, including US$153M in the June 2020 quarter.
-    Subsequent to the end of the period, we extended the expiry date of our undrawn revolving credit facility by one year to
     February 2023, providing the Group with ongoing access to a further US$1.45B in liquidity in addition to our strong balance
     sheet.
-    We realised US$50M in annual functional cost savings in FY20, following the simplification of the Group’s support 
     structures. In addition, to prepare for a potentially extended period of volatility and lower commodity prices, we 
     initiated a further review of activity during the June 2020 quarter aimed at delivering a meaningful reduction in 
     controllable costs. We expect to provide an update on this work with our FY20 financial results.
-    We progressed the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited
     (Seriti Resources), acquiring the 8% interest previously owned by our Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)
     consortium partner and receiving approval for the transaction from the Richards Bay Coal Terminal Proprietary Limited during
     the June 2020 quarter. Subject to a number of material conditions (note 3) being satisfied, the transaction remains on track 
     to be completed in the December 2020 half year.
-    After consideration of its future economic viability we made the decision with our joint venture partner to place our South
     African manganese alloy smelter, Metalloys, on temporary care and maintenance. We also progressed the review of our
     Australian manganese alloy smelter, TEMCO, albeit the process has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying its
     expected completion.
-    In consideration of the future economic viability and continuing review of our Metalloys and TEMCO smelters, we expect to
     book pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of approximately US$109M (post-tax ~US$90M, South32 share) in our
     FY20 financial results. One-off, pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, at Metalloys of approximately US$7M
     (post tax ~US$5M, South32 share) are also anticipated. These charges will be recorded in the Group’s share of profit of 
      EAI and excluded from Underlying earnings in FY20.
-    Our geographical earnings mix will have a significant bearing on our effective tax rate (ETR) given differing country tax 
     rates(note 4), while the impact of intragroup agreements, exploration expenditure in foreign entities and other permanent
     differences will continue to be magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. Until 
     it is sold, South Africa Energy Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0%, with all tax assets de-recognised from 30 June 2019 and no
     benefit to be recorded for losses made prior to sale. Accordingly, our FY20 Group ETR is expected to be in a range between
     100% and 125% (excluding EAI).




Development and Exploration Update
Hermosa project
- We continue to review the impact of COVID-19 in Arizona and its influence on timelines for work being undertaken at
  Hermosa. Our exploration programs remain temporarily suspended and we now expect to complete the pre-feasibility study for
  the Taylor Deposit in the December 2020 quarter.
- Notwithstanding the above delay, we have updated the Mineral Resource estimate for the Taylor Deposit (note 5) with new
  information and geological modelling undertaken from additional resource definition drilling completed in support of the current
  pre-feasibility study. The Mineral Resource estimate (Table A) has increased by 12Mt to 167Mt, averaging 3.34% zinc, 3.84%
  lead and 71g/t silver. The deposit remains open at depth and laterally.
- We also reported a Mineral Resource estimate for the first time for the Clark Deposit. The Mineral Resource estimate was
  reported at 55Mt, averaging 2.31% zinc, 9.08% manganese and 78g/t silver (note 6). A scoping study to advance our
  understanding of the processing and new emerging end-market opportunities in battery technology for the Clark Deposit is
  underway.
- We directed US$19M (all capitalised) during FY20 to exploration programs at identified regional prospects and to advance our
  resource definition work. During the period we advanced our understanding of the broader land package potential, enabling an
  improved focus for future drilling programs beyond the known Mineral Resource estimates of the Taylor and Clark Deposits.

Other development and exploration options
- We completed the remaining coal quality drilling at Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal, with the interpretation of those results to
  support our on-going feasibility study work. We remain on-track to make a final investment decision by the end of this calendar
  year.
- Together with our joint venture partner, we made the decision to postpone our CY20 exploration program at
  Ambler Metals due to COVID-19 restrictions in Alaska and their impact on our ability to conduct the field season. The delay in
  this year’s program is not currently expected to impact delivery of the Arctic pre-feasibility study that was commenced by the
  joint venture partners in the March 2020 quarter.
- Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
  US$15M during FY20. Greenfield exploration activity continues to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of
  people and equipment which has limited the ability for some of our partners to access exploration areas in certain jurisdictions.
  We continue to review the evolving environment and work with our partners to plan our exploration programs for FY21.
- We directed US$49M towards exploration programs at our existing operations and development options in FY20 (US$34M
  capitalised), including US$3M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and US$19M at Hermosa as noted above (all capitalised).

COVID-19 Response
At South32 our focus is on keeping our people well, maintaining safe and reliable operations and supporting our communities
through the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the situation closely, deferring non-critical activity and ensuring our
operations run safely, adjusting to the changes we have put in place.

With the pandemic impacting our business differently, depending on our locations around the world as the pandemic spreads, we
have activated emergency management teams to identify, prevent and respond to risks as they arise. We have also implemented
site specific protocols including screening and testing programs for our workforce and made isolation facilities available at 
all of our operations. We have implemented additional cleaning and hygiene measures, awareness programs for our workforce, adjustments
to work routines to enable appropriate social distancing and the provision of transport to site which is regularly sanitised. We are
providing our workforce with the appropriate personal protective equipment and have implemented additional protective measures
at all of our sites and offices. At all of our locations we are following the local requirements and advice from health authorities 
and governments for operating during the pandemic.

We have established a South32 Global Community Investment Fund, committing US$7M to the areas that need it most. To date,
our support has included provision of water, essential hygiene and medical supplies, public health awareness and education
campaigns, building capacity in local health care systems and supporting those who are unable to access critical goods and
services.

-   Realised prices exclude third party products and services. We currently anticipate an underlying EBIT loss for third party
    products and services(note 16) of approximately US$17M in FY20 (FY19: US$5M). This predominantly reflects the
    procurement of lower cost third party volumes to replace higher cost equity production to fulfil contractual commitments at

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 91kt) to 3,886kt in FY20, as the refinery finished the year on a strong
note with an increase in calciner availability underpinning a 9% increase in production during the June 2020 quarter. The refinery
continues to benefit from improvement initiatives that are expected to support a sustainable increase in production to nameplate
capacity of 4.6Mt (100% basis). Sales increased by 20% during the June 2020 quarter as a result of higher production and a
slipped shipment from the prior quarter.

We realised a modest premium to the Platts Alumina Index(note 17) (PAX) on a volume weighted M-1 basis for alumina sales in
FY20, with price realisations in the June 2020 half year falling in-line with the market as a result of specific legacy supply 
contracts with our Mozal Aluminium smelter. Contracts with the smelter are linked to the LME aluminium price and alumina indices on an M-1
basis, with caps and floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. All other alumina sales were at
market based prices.

the strong operating performance, lower alumina prices and an increase in the use of higher cost third party bauxite is expected to
impactthe profitability of the operation in FY20. Our use of third party bauxite is expected to reduce in FY21, which together with a
reset in the cost of supply from Mineração Rio do Norte S.A (MRN), in accordance with its linkage to alumina and aluminium, is
expected to result in lower Operating unit costs for the refinery.

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 3kt to a record 718kt in FY20 as the smelter continued to test its maximum
technical capacity, despite the impact to production from increased load-shedding.

The smelter sources alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with prices linked to the PAX on an M-1 basis, while its power is
sourced from Eskom under separate contracts for its three potlines. We have been engaging with Eskom on a new pricing
arrangement that would cover power supplied to the smelter, agreeing an interim arrangement ahead of a new 10 year pricing
agreement being considered for approval by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). The interim arrangement and
the new long term agreement are important milestones to secure the future of the smelter beyond CY20, with the tariff being
South African Rand based with a rate of escalation linked to the South Africa Producer Price Index (PPI).

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased by 1kt to 268kt in FY20 as the smelter continued to test its maximum technical
capacity, despite the impact to production from increased load-shedding. In order to further improve the smelter’s cost
competitiveness we continue to execute the AP3XLE energy efficiency project during FY20. The project is expected to deliver a
circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in annual production by FY24 with no associated increase in power consumption.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 2.3Mt) to 22.7Mt in FY20 as contractors were demobilised in
the December 2019 half year to maximise margins, before COVID-19 restrictions impacted operations during the June 2020
quarter.

Export sales declined by 19% during the June 2020 quarter as a result of lower production volumes and the diversion of coal to
domestic customers, as export shipments were affected by COVID-19 lockdown impacts to our logistics chain and end market
demand. While production has now ramped-up following the easing of lockdown restrictions, we continue to respond to the evolving
environment and its potential to impact our operations and logistics chain in the future.

Notwithstanding production being at the top end of our revised guidance range, the recognition of one-off costs in the June 2020
half year are expected to result in FY20 Operating unit costs of approximately US$42/t (H1 FY20: US$43/t).

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 5% (or 359kt) to 7.0Mt in FY20 as the Dendrobium and Appin
longwalls continued to perform strongly across the year, with Dendrobium achieving record run of mine performance.
Notwithstanding challenging strata conditions, the operation’s return to a three longwall configuration in late April and the
completion of a longwall move at Dendrobium during the prior quarter underpinned a 44% increase in saleable production in the
June 2020 quarter.

While the return to a three longwall configuration marked an important milestone for the Appin restart plan, the continued strong
performance from a two longwall configuration supports our current study work to maximise long term value at the operation. We
expect to provide an update on the outcome of the review with our FY20 financial results.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 4% (or 121kwmt) to a record 3,470kwmt in FY20, with the operation
returning to full production following the removal of temporary roster changes in response to COVID-19 restrictions during the
June 2020 quarter. Manganese ore sales increased by 20% during the June 2020 quarter as we took advantage of favourable
market conditions and a shipment slipped from the prior quarter.

Our average realised price for external sales of Australian ore was a 7% discount to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore
index(note 19) in FY20 as we responded to market demand with increased volumes of Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) and other
secondary products. Our low cost PC02 circuit continued to operate above its design capacity, contributing 12% of total 
production in FY20 (FY19: 10%). Our PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both 
grade and product-type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Manganese alloy saleable
production decreased by 29% (or 44kt) to 110kt in FY20 as one of the four furnaces at TEMCO remained offline.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 14% (or 309kwmt) to 1,878kwmt in FY20 as we responded to
weaker market conditions in the December 2019 half year, reducing our use of higher cost trucking and undertaking an extended
maintenance shut at our underground Wessels mine. Further, both the open pit Mamatwan and underground Wessels mines were
placed on temporary care and maintenance during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in the June 2020 quarter, subsequently
returning to full capacity with lockdown restrictions lifted.

Sales decreased 34% during the June 2020 quarter as volumes were also impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions to our shared
logistics infrastructure. Notwithstanding the lifting of restrictions, we continue to respond to the evolving environment and its
potential to further impact our operations and logistics chain.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 23% (or 16kt) to 53kt in FY20. After consideration of the future economic
viability of Metalloys, we made the decision with our joint venture partner to place the smelter on temporary care and maintenance.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production decreased by 1% (or 0.5kt) to 40.6kt in FY20 as the operation achieved a higher rate of
plant utilisation and throughput, partially offsetting planned lower ore feed grades.

While our rate of production has been unaffected by the Colombian national lockdown in response to COVID-19, we continue to
monitor the impact of restrictions on the movement of people and equipment, which has resulted in the deferral of our planned
major furnace refurbishment. As previously reported, this work has been rescheduled to the December 2020 half year (previously
the June 2020 quarter) and consequently FY21 production guidance is now expected to be 33.5kt (previously 37.4kt).
Sales declined 2% during the June 2020 quarter. Our ferronickel product sells with reference to the LME Nickel index price on a
M or M+1 basis and attracts product discounts that have widened in the current market.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 9% (or 19.8kt) to 238.0kt in FY20 as planned higher zinc grades more
than offset lower silver and lead grades, and the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level following the
Queensland flood event in FY19. The draw down and further improvement in underground mine performance supported the
realisation of efficiencies in mill throughput, resulting in a 14% lift in ore processed during FY20.

Notes:

1.    As at 30 June 2020, US$1.0B has been allocated to the on-market share buy-back (477M shares at an average price of A$2.94 per
      share) and US$292M returned in the form of special dividends.
2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and should
      not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
3.    Refer to the market announcement “Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal” dated 6 November 2019.
4.    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group for FY20 include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 33%,
      Mozambique 0% and Brazil 34%. The Colombian corporate tax rate is 32% in CY20 and will decrease on an annual basis by a 
      percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues 
      instead of income tax.

5.    The information in this report that relates to Mineral Resources for the Taylor Deposit is presented on a 100% basis, represents 
      an estimate as at 31 May 2020, and is based on information compiled by Matthew Readford. Mr. Readford is a full-time employee of
      South32 and is a member and Chartered Professional of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr. Readford has 
      sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration, and to the activities 
      being undertaken, to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of
      Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves'. The Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of 
      the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.
6.    The information that relates to the Mineral Resources of the Clark Deposit was declared in the market announcement “Hermosa 
      Project – Mineral Resource Estimate Declaration” dated 12 May 2020 (www.south32.net) based on information compiled by Matthew 
      Hastings, Competent Person. South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the 
      information included in the original announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates
      in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. South32 confirms that the form and 
      context in which the Competent Person’s findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market 
      announcement.
7.    Production guidance for Hillside Aluminium and Mozal Aluminium did not assume any load-shedding impact on production.
8.    During the current period South32 acquired the 8% interest in South Africa Energy Coal previously owned by a Broad-Based 
      Black Economic Empowerment(B-BBEE) consortium. This transaction was undertaken ahead of the proposed sale of South Africa 
      Energy Coal to Seriti Resources, subject to a number of material conditions being satisfied.
9.    Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have 
      been reported at 60%. The Group’s financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa 
      Manganese ore.
10.   Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing 
      the total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver
      (US$14.4/oz) have been used for FY19, FY20 and FY20e.
11.   Realised prices are unaudited. Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken 
      independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume 
      unless otherwise stated.
12.   Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, 
      divided by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an 
      intracompany transaction.
13.   Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, 
      divided by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an 
      intracompany transaction. Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
14.   Realised nickel sales prices are unaudited and inclusive of by-products.
15.   Realised prices for Cannington are unaudited and net of treatment and refining charges.
16.   Underlying EBIT on third party products and services is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication
      of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
17.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Platts Alumina Index (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one 
      month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$283/t in FY20.
18.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
      Metallurgical Coal production.
19.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index 
      (CIF Tianjin, China) on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”)
      was US$5.04/dmtu in FY20.

                       Hermosa Project – Mineral Resource Estimate Declaration

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) is pleased to report for the first time
a Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark Deposit which forms part of its 100% owned Hermosa
project located in Arizona, USA (Appendix 1 – Figure 1). The Clark Mineral Resource estimate (Table
                                                         1
A) is reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012) at 55 million tonnes, averaging 2.31% zinc
(Zn), 9.08% manganese (Mn) and 78g/t silver (Ag).

The Clark Deposit is interpreted as the upper oxidised, manganese-rich portion of the mineralised
system that contains the previously reported Taylor Mineral Resource estimate. A scoping study to
advance our understanding of the processing and end-market opportunities for the Clark Deposit is
underway, while a pre-feasibility study for the separate development of the Taylor Deposit is due for
completion in the September quarter 2020.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said “The declaration of a Mineral Resource estimate
for the Clark Deposit marks another important milestone for the Hermosa project, following our initial
Mineral Resource estimate for the Taylor Deposit in June 2019.

“When completed, the Taylor Deposit pre-feasibility study is expected to further de-risk our investment
by demonstrating its ability to deliver strong shareholder returns over many decades. The Clark
Deposit provides an additional option to realise longer term value from within the broader land
package.

“With ongoing exploration programs testing possible extensions to the Taylor Deposit and newly
identified prospects in the regional land package, we expect this work to reaffirm our view that
Hermosa is one of the most exciting base metals projects in the industry.”

The Hermosa project is a polymetallic development option located in Santa Cruz county, Arizona and
is 100% owned by South32. It comprises the zinc-lead-silver Taylor Deposit, the zinc-manganese-
silver Clark Deposit and an extensive, highly prospective land package with potential for discovery of
zinc and copper mineralisation.

Notes:
1. Cut-off grade: NSR of US$175/t.
2. Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based on South32’s long term forecasts for zinc, manganese and silver pricing; haulage,
   treatment, shipping, handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions are consistent across geological domains and
   are approximately 62% for zinc, 80% for manganese and 81% for silver. All masses are reported as dry metric tonnes (dmt). All tonnes
   and grade information have been rounded to reflect relative uncertainty of the estimate, hence small differences may be present in the
   totals.



Estimate of Mineral Resource for the Clark Deposit

South32 confirms the first time reporting of the Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark Deposit as at
12 May 2020 (Table A).
The estimates of Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 (JORC Code) and the
Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules. This report summarises the information contained in the
JORC Code Table 1 which is included in Appendix 1 to this report. The breakdown of the total Mineral
Resource estimate into the categories specified in the JORC Code is contained in Table A.

Geology and geological interpretation

The Clark Deposit within the Hermosa project (Appendix 1 – Figure 2) is the oxidised portion of a
carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) style, massive sulphide deposit. It is hosted in Mesozoic
Hardshell volcanic rocks and underlying Permian carbonate rocks of the Pennsylvanian Naco Group
of south-eastern Arizona (Appendix 1 - Figure 3).

The zinc-manganese-silver oxide mineralisation of the Clark Deposit is interpreted to be an up-dip
extension of the zinc-lead-silver sulphide Taylor Deposit, although of different mineralogy and
geochemistry. Mineralisation primarily spans the contact between the Hardshell volcanic rocks and
the underlying Concha carbonate stratigraphy for approximately 1.3km from near surface down a
general northwest dip of 30° to where it abuts the Taylor sulphide mineralisation. The 800m lateral
extent of mineralisation at the Clark Deposit has not been closed off by drilling.

Drilling techniques

Initial drilling of the Clark Deposit conducted by ASARCO between 1950-1991 utilised three different
drilling methods of rotary air hammer (RH) (91 holes), diamond core (DDH) (22 holes), and reverse
circulation (RC) (one hole). Wildcat Silver, later becoming Arizona Minerals Inc (AMI), drilled 165 RC
and 267 DDH drill holes between 2007 to 2018. South32 drilling continued to extend the drill footprint
at both the Clark and Taylor deposits following the acquisition of AMI in August 2018, adding an
additional 31 DDH drill holes to the total drill hole database considered for this Mineral Resource
estimation.

Four AMI and three South32 DDH drill holes twinned ASARCO RH drilling to validate geology and
assay data.

The geological model is based on data from 579 drill holes of various styles including RH, RC, and
DDH of HQ (95.6mm) or NQ (75.3mm) diameter (Appendix 1 - Figure 4), all drilled from surface of
which 311 intersect the mineralisation at the Clark Deposit and were utilised in the Mineral Resource
estimation (Appendix 1 - Figure 5).

Sub-vertical drilling was undertaken until August 2018 and 259 of these holes were utilised in the
estimation. Since August 2018 all holes were angled between 60°and 85° to maximise the
mineralisation intersection angle. Core orientation was introduced from October 2018 to incorporate
structural measurements into geological modelling for stratigraphic and fault interpretation.
Sampling and sub-sampling techniques

Details of the sampling procedures are unknown for the ASARCO drilling campaigns of 1950-1991,
however sample lengths were predominantly 1.5m (5’), ranging between 6cm and 6m. AMI drill holes
were sampled at nominal 1.5m (5’) intervals or terminated at litho-structural boundaries for DDH,
producing a sample range between 15cm and 2m. Diamond drill core was sampled by hydraulic
splitting until 2013, from then onwards a core saw was used for sampling. RC holes were drilled wet
by AMI, with cleaning of the holes between 5’ sample intervals.

AMI and South32 samples were submitted for preparation at external certified laboratories in Tucson
(Skyline Laboratories and Australian Laboratory Services (ALS)) and Reno (Inspectorate
Laboratories). Preparation involved crushing of the sample, a rotary split portion for each sample, and
pulverisation to generate pulps for assay. Specific preparation methods vary between laboratories
and drilling campaigns. Since 2014, samples have been prepared by ALS Minerals Tucson and
involve drying, crushing the entire sample to more than 70% passing 2mm, rotary splitting to achieve
a 250g subsample and pulverizing to greater than 85% passing 75µm.

Sample analysis method

AMI re-analysed 4,272 ASARCO pulp samples at Skyline Laboratories in 2006 to validate the copper,
lead, zinc, and manganese assay results using inductively-coupled plasma and atomic absorption
spectrometry (ICP-AAS). Silver and gold fire assays of a second split from each pulp were undertaken
by Assayers Canada in Vancouver.

AMI drill samples taken between 2007-2012 were prepared at Skyline Labs and analysed by ICP for
copper, lead, zinc, and manganese. Silver assays of 250g duplicate pulps for all samples were sent to
Assayers Canada from 2006-2009 (fire assays) and Inspectorate Laboratories in Reno for 2010-2012
(fire assay with AAS finish).

Over 2013-2014, AMI identified a low bias for silver reported by fire assay through a quality control
program using in-house standards. A re-assay of 8,078 samples from 188 holes mostly from the Clark
Deposit was undertaken by ALS Minerals using a four-acid digest and ICP-AAS. These replaced the
original fire assay silver results in the database.

Since 2014, all samples have been prepared by ALS Tucson and analysed at ALS Vancouver using
four-acid digestion, ICP-AAS, and more recently inductively-coupled plasma and optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES). Quality control protocols introduced and maintained since this time comprise
certified reference material (CRM) inserted every 20 samples, field duplicates every 15m (50’), blank
material submitted at the start and end of every sample batch, coarse crush and pulp repeats every
40 samples, and third-party laboratory pulp repeats every 50 samples.

Efforts to validate ASARCO sampling over the project history comprise two campaigns of pulp re-
assay by AMI in 2006 (4,272 samples) and South32 in 2019 (3,070 samples). The findings for the
2019 re-assay program generally indicate excellent reproducibility in ICP results for zinc, manganese
and silver across grade ranges material to the Mineral Resource work. Gravimetric fire assay results
for silver at lower grades (less than 10g/t Ag) generally perform poorly against the modern ICP
results. The poor performance of these historical analytical techniques against modern results has
been well-documented in previous studies.

Minor element assays from the South32 re-assay program were also inserted into the drilling
database for historical samples where no previous analysis had been undertaken and to underpin the
estimation of these elements.
Estimation methodology

Resource estimation was conducted using ordinary kriging interpolation for three elements of
economic interest (zinc, manganese, silver) and seven elements for metallurgical or rock
characterisation (iron, lead, calcium, sulphur, magnesium, potassium, aluminium). Estimation search
criteria, nested as two passes, are consistent with geostatistical models developed for each
estimation domain according to the appropriate geological controls.

Sample selection criteria, block dimensions, and other parameters of the estimation were reviewed
against results of qualitative kriging neighbourhood analysis (QKNA). Validation includes statistical
analysis, swath plots and visual inspection.

Specific gravity measurements from drill cores were used as the basis for estimating dry bulk density
in tonnage calculations for both mineralised and non-mineralised material. Initial testing and
comparison of pre- and post-drying sample weights from a small 280 sample population within two
drill holes indicated a moisture content of 2.03%.

Mineral Resource classification

Mineral Resource classification criteria are based on the level of data informing both the geological
model and grade estimation. Grade estimation confidence is overlaid on the geological modelling
classification criteria whereby estimation parameters such as slope of regression are matched to
block estimation criteria that relates to the number and distance of data informing the estimate in
relation to semi-variogram models for each element. No Measured Mineral Resources have been
defined for the Clark Deposit due to uncertainty associated with historical drill hole data, local
variability illustrated by the South32 twin drilling program and considering the conceptual level of
process flow sheet development. Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated from at least five
samples in two drill holes with data spacing within approximately 100m and are not defined in the SE
areas of the Clark Deposit which is supported primarily by RC drilling. Inferred Mineral Resources are
constrained by the reporting of estimates to within demonstrated grade and geological continuity
ranges, and generally to the extents of the confined Mineral Resource domains.

Mining and metallurgical methods and parameters

Reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction have been determined through assessment
of mining, processing and financial aspects at a scoping level study on the Clark Mineral Resource
estimate. The assessment outcome informs the net smelter return (NSR) cut-off value used for
reporting the Mineral Resource estimate.

Cut-off grade

The Clark Deposit of the Hermosa project is a zinc-manganese-silver deposit which uses an
equivalent NSR value as a grade descriptor. Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based on
South32’s long term forecasts for zinc, manganese and silver pricing; haulage, treatment, shipping,
handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions are consistent across domains and
are approximately 62% for zinc, 80% for manganese, and 81% for silver.

A dollar equivalent cut-off of NSR US$175/dmt forms the basis of assessment for reasonable
prospects for eventual economic extraction, supported by inputs detailed to scoping study level.

Corporate Update
-   Net cash(Note 1) decreased by US$127M to US$150M during the March 2020 quarter with our interim and special fully
    franked dividend payments (US$107M) funded during the quarter, ahead of distribution to shareholders on 2 April. Our balance
    sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of US$1.2B, no term debt and an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit
    facility.
-   Our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) did not make net distributions(Note 2) to the Group in the March 2020
    quarter and we have seen additional cash build in our joint venture, despite paying royalties of US$76M (100% share) in
    respect of the prior six month period. Excess cash in the joint venture is expected to be distributed to partners in the June 2020
    quarter.
-   On 27 March, consistent with the prudent management of our strong balance sheet, we suspended our on-market share
    buy-back program. Following the allocation of a further US$77M to share purchases in the March 2020 quarter (53M shares at
    an average price of A$2.21 per share) and payment of a US$53M fully franked special dividend on 2 April, our US$1.43B
    capital management program was 92% complete with US$121M  of our now suspended on-market share buy-back program remaining 
    ahead of its extension or expiry on 4 September 2020(Note 3).
-   On 11 February, we formed a 50:50 Joint Venture with Trilogy Metals Inc. for the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwest
    Alaska (Ambler Metals JV). We subscribed for our 50% interest with a payment of US$145M to the Ambler Metals JV, of which
    US$57.5M has been loaned back to South32(Note 4).
-   We progressed the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited
    (Seriti Resources), submitting our filings for required regulatory and third party approvals. Subject to a number of material
    conditions(Note 5) being satisfied, the transaction remains on track to be completed in the December 2020 half year.
-   While we progressed the review of options for our manganese alloy smelters, the timeline to complete the review has been
    impacted by government restrictions in response to COVID-19. On 27 March we placed our South African Manganese manganese alloy 
    smelter, Metalloys, on temporary care and maintenance in response to the national lockdown.
-   As previously reported, we have initiated a Group wide review that is expected to deliver a reduction in controllable costs
    across our operations from FY21. Sustaining capital expenditure, including EAI, is now expected to decline to approximately
    US$500M in FY20, as we embed savings from reduced activity in response to market conditions and reflect updated
    assumptions for our average exchange rates to an AUD:USD of 0.67, USD:ZAR of 15.76 and USD:COP of 3,544.
-   Our geographical earnings mix will have a significant bearing on our ETR given differing country tax rates(Note 6), while the
    impact of intragroup agreements, exploration expenditure in foreign entities and other permanent differences will continue to
    be magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. Until it is sold, South Africa Energy
    Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0%, with all tax assets de-recognised from 30 June 2019 and no benefit to be recorded for
    losses made prior to sale. Whilst it is therefore difficult to predict our ETR (excluding EAI), we do expect it to remain elevated 
    in H2 FY20 (H1 FY20: 75.0%).


Development and Exploration Update
-   We progressed our pre-feasibility study for the Taylor deposit at the Hermosa project which we now expect to be completed in
    the September 2020 quarter. We also directed US$5M (all capitalised) to exploration programs at newly identified regional
    targets and resource definition drilling at the project. A Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark deposit in accordance with
    JORC Code guidelines is expected to be released in the June 2020 quarter(Note 7).
-   Subsequent to the end of the quarter we completed the remaining resource quality drilling at Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal,
    with the interpretation of those results to support on-going feasibility study work. On 27 March, we reported that given current
    market uncertainty, we are prioritising work with our joint venture partner to preserve the value of our investment beyond the
    final investment decision scheduled for the end of this calendar year.
-   Following the formation of the Ambler Metals JV in the March 2020 quarter, we released Mineral Resource estimates for the
    Arctic and Bornite deposits for the first time in accordance with JORC Code guidelines. During the June 2020 quarter, the joint
    venture partners will review the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on planned activities for the remainder of the calendar year.
    We anticipate a reduction in the approved exploration and study budget of US$22.8M due to reduced exploration activity.
-   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
    US$3M during the March 2020 quarter (US$13M in the nine months ended March 2020). Greenfield exploration activity has
    been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of people and equipment which limited the ability for some of our
    partners to access exploration areas in certain jurisdictions. Accordingly, FY20 greenfield exploration guidance has been
    reduced by US$10M to US$20M with these restrictions expected to continue for the remainder of the calendar year.
-   We directed US$12M towards exploration programs at our existing operations (US$10M capitalised), including US$5M at
    Hermosa as noted above (all capitalised).

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 3% (or 70kt) to 2,869kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the refinery
benefitted from improvement initiatives expected to support a sustainable increase in production to nameplate capacity of 4.6Mt
(100% basis).

Sales declined by 12% during the March 2020 quarter as scheduled calciner maintenance impacted production, and a shipment
slipped to the June 2020 quarter as a result of COVID-19 quarantine delays at port. Subject to existing or additional COVID-19

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 4kt) to a record 540kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the
smelter continued to test its maximum technical capacity, despite the impact to production from load-shedding.

Hillside Aluminium is considered an essential business in South Africa for the maintenance of power generation, given the role it
plays in the sustainability of Eskom’s generation network. As a result, the smelter continues to operate despite the nationwide
lockdown that is currently scheduled to expire on 30 April, having commenced at midnight on 26 March.

As previously reported, FY20 production guidance has been withdrawn due to the uncertain impact of measures or restrictions that
may be required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$11M (or 48%) to US$12M.

Mozal Aluminium saleable production was unchanged at 201kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the smelter continued to
test its maximum technical capacity, despite the impact to production from load-shedding. Subject to no impact from existing or                                                                                                                     
additional COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year, FY20 production guidance(Note 8) remains
unchanged at 273kt.

The smelter sources all of its alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a percentage of the
LME aluminium index under a legacy contract and the remainder linked to the Platts alumina index on an M-1 basis, with caps and
floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. As a result the smelter’s cost of alumina was a premium
to the index in the nine months ended March 2020.

the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$1M (or 8%) to US$11M.

South African Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 5% (or 825kt) to 17.4Mt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the
demobilisation of contractors in response to market conditions and heavy rainfall experienced in the March 2020 quarter, more than
offset a 12% increase in export sales volumes. Higher export sales volumes were achieved as a result of improved dragline
availability at Klipspruit and the diversion of lower calorific value coal to the export market to take advantage of favourable market
conditions.

The diversion of lower calorific value coal has an impact on the average price received for our export sales and accordingly we
realised a discount of approximately 20% to the API4 index(Note 12) in the nine months ended March 2020. Notwithstanding the
increased tonnages in the nine months ended March 2020, export sales declined 7% during the quarter, as the temporary closure
of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, caused by the national lockdown resulted in the deferral of shipments.
Our average realised price for domestic coal in the nine months ended March 2020 was US$24/t. In the June 2019 quarter, we
invoked a hardship clause in our contract to supply coal from the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex to the Duvha power station with
a view to securing a long term pricing tariff that supports the sustainability of the business. During the March 2020 quarter an
interim pricing arrangement has been agreed to ensure continuous supply while Eskom undertakes their review of the hardship
claim.

As previously reported, FY20 production guidance has been withdrawn following the nationwide lockdown in South Africa that is
currently scheduled to expire on 30 April, having commenced at midnight on 26 March. While our domestic operations are
considered essential in South Africa for the maintenance of power generation and are exempt from the lockdown, domestic
demand is expected to be impacted by lower total power generation during the June 2020 quarter. Our export operations were
placed on temporary care and maintenance at commencement of the lockdown. We subsequently requested and received
government approval to undertake limited activity during the lockdown period and have partially remobilised at a reduced rate.
Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$21M (or 32%) to US$44M.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 1% (or 15kwmt) to 2,616kwmt in the nine months ended March 2020
as lower primary circuit throughput, following heavy rain in late FY19, was partially offset by an increase in demand for our low cost
Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) product. We continued to operate the PC02 circuit above its design capacity, contributing 11% of
total production in the nine months ended March 2020 (10% in the prior corresponding period). Manganese ore sales declined 12%
during the March 2020 quarter due to lower production and a shipment that slipped to the June 2020 quarter as a result of
quarantine delays at port.

FY20 production guidance has been lowered by 5% to 3,375kwmt, reflecting lower year to date throughput and reduced
productivity expectations to finish the year following temporary roster changes made to respond to COVID-19. Guidance is subject
to no further impact from COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year. We also continue to
monitor the potential impact of the wet season and market conditions on our adjusted FY20 production guidance.
Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 29% (or 33kt) to 81kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as one of the four
furnaces remained offline.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 10% (or 16.4kt) to 174.5kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as
the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level and recorded a higher average zinc grade, that more than offset
lower silver and lead grades across the period.

Subject to no impact from existing or additional COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year, FY20
production guidance remains unchanged at 221.0kt payable zinc equivalent with a lower average zinc grade expected in the June
2020 quarter. Reduced sales in the March 2020 quarter reflect lower silver and lead production and a return to normalised
inventory levels following elevated sales in the prior quarter. Our lead and zinc sells with reference to the LME market on a M+2 or 
M+3 basis and our realised prices are disclosed net of treatment and refining charges that have widened in the current market.

Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$5M (or 9%) to US$50M.


Notes:

1.    Net Cash number is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of 
      profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and 
      should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance 
      or liquidity.
3.    Since inception, US$1.0B has been allocated to the on-market share buy-back (477M shares at an average price of A$2.94 
      per share).
4.    South32 subscription payment of US$145M to form the Ambler Metals JV. The JV has retained US$87.5M of the subscription 
      payment to fund its activities,exploration and a pre-feasibility study for the Arctic deposit, and loaned US$57.5M back 
      to South32. On a proportionally consolidated basis the net effect on South32’s net cash is US$(72.5)M.
5.    Refer to the market announcement “Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal” dated 6 November 2019.
6.    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group for FY20 include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, 
      Colombia 33%, Mozambique 0% and Brazil 34%. The Colombian corporate tax rate is 32% in CY20 and will decrease on an 
      annual basis by a percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject 
      to a royalty on revenues instead of income tax.
7.    Information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Clark Deposit (formally the Central Deposit) of 
      the Hermosa project are foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance with the JORC 
      Code. Reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement “South32 
      to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer” dated 18 June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. 
      South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts 
      on the reliability of the estimate or has the ability to verify the foreign estimate as a Mineral Resource in 
      accordance with the JORC Code. South32 confirms that the supporting information contained in the clarifying statement 
      in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. Competent 
      Persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. 
      It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported 
      as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. During FY20 we have undertaken a work program 
      aimed at increasing confidence in the resource to ensure that resources are reported in accordance with the JORC Code.
8.    Production guidance for Mozal Aluminium does not assume any load-shedding impact on production.
9.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests 
      owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions 
      attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, 
      South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
10.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales 
      have been reported at 60%. The Group’s financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa 
      Manganese ore.
11.   Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the 
      total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver (US$14.4/oz) 
      have been used for FY19, YTD FY20 and FY20e.
12.   The sales volume weighted average of the API4 index on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing 
      (Month minus one or “M-1”)was US$72/t in the nine months ended March quarter 2020.
13.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
      Metallurgical Coal production.

                              South32 Acts in Response to Market Conditions

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises several steps it is taking in response to
market conditions and the restrictions being implemented by governments aimed at containing the spread of COVID-
19.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said “As COVID-19 impacts people across the world including the
countries in which we operate, we remain focussed on keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable
operations, and supporting our communities. At the same time, we are taking action to maintain the financial strength
of our business in response to a rapidly evolving environment.

“Our business is well positioned to successfully navigate this period of uncertainty. The initiatives announced today
are aimed at delivering approximately US$160M in lower expenditure over the next 15 months to protect our financial
position. Our balance sheet remains strong, with reported net cash of US$277M at 31 December 2019, including cash
and cash equivalents of US$1.4B, no term debt and an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit facility.

“The prudent management of our strong balance sheet will continue through our disciplined allocation of capital
                                                                                                           1
consistent with our unchanged capital management framework. Since demerger, we have returned US$2.9B to our
shareholders by way of ordinary dividends and our capital management program. The disciplined approach we
continue to take to capital allocation and our simple capital management framework ensures our shareholders will be
rewarded as financial performance improves.”

Lower expenditure comprises an expected reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure (US$150M) and exploration
activity (US$10M). Sustaining capital expenditure savings will be realised by a reduction in spend of 10% in FY20 and
             2
18% in FY21 . In addition, to prepare for a potentially extended period of low prices, we are reviewing activity across
the Group aimed at delivering a meaningful reduction in controllable costs, building on our strong Operating unit cost
performance in H1 FY20. We expect to see the benefit of this work and lower producer currencies reflected in our
FY21 Operating unit cost guidance.

Further to these initiatives, we have suspended the remaining US$121M of our current on-market share buy-back with
the opportunity to review its extension ahead of its expiry on 4 September 2020.

We will continue to review the evolving environment, to understand the impact on timelines for our development
options and will take further action as required to prioritise long term value across the Group. In this regard, the pre-
feasibility study at Hermosa is now expected to be concluded in the September 2020 quarter. Separately, given the
current market uncertainty, we are working with our joint venture partner to preserve the value of our Eagle Downs
Metallurgical Coal investment beyond the investment decision scheduled for the end of this calendar year.




1
  Includes fully franked ordinary dividend (US$54M) and fully franked special dividend (US$54M) to be paid on 2 April 2020.
2
  FY20 Sustaining capital expenditure includes equity accounted investments and South Africa Energy Coal. FY21 Sustaining capital expenditure
reduction calculated using top end of current guidance range (US$450-550M) and excludes South Africa Energy Coal. FY20 and FY21 assumes
prior guidance currency assumptions (AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.69; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.58 and a USD:COP exchange rate of
3,364).

Mr Kerr said “Sustaining capital expenditure to maintain safe and reliable operations remains a priority, however the
flexibility of our programs across the Group means that some activity is able to be deferred to future years in response
to unexpected market conditions.

“Investing in exploration and our development options to create shareholder value also remains integral to the Group’s
strategy. Our financial priorities remain unchanged, and today’s actions, including the suspension of our on-market
share buy-back, are a prudent response to the current exceptional circumstances and consistent with our commitment
to maintain a strong financial position.”

Update to operations:

The Group previously reported the withdrawal of FY20 guidance for our South African operations as a result of the
government’s announcement of a 21 day nationwide lockdown, commencing midnight on Thursday 26 March 2020.

In response to the government’s announcement, our South Africa Manganese operations, along with our export coal
production from South Africa Energy Coal, have been placed on care and maintenance for a minimum of 21 days.

Our Hillside Aluminium smelter and domestic coal production from South Africa Energy Coal are considered
businesses essential for the maintenance of power generation, given the role they play in the sustainability of Eskom’s
generation network and will continue to operate during the lockdown.

In Colombia, because of the threat of COVID-19, the President announced a 19 day nationwide lockdown,
commencing midnight on Tuesday 24 March 2020. Our Cerro Matoso operation continues to operate with government
approval at a reduced rate. As a result of the uncertain impact of the restrictions to production volumes, which are
expected to be more than offset by a change in timing of our scheduled furnace refurbishment in the June 2020
quarter, we are withdrawing guidance and will update the market when further information becomes available.

To-date, we have not yet experienced production interruptions from COVID-19 at any other operations. We continue
to monitor the impact of restrictions placed on the movement of people and goods across the world and will continue
to update the market as appropriate.

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises the South African President has taken
action to enforce a nationwide lockdown aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19, commencing midnight on
Thursday 26 March 2020, for 21 days.

South32 understands that businesses essential for the maintenance of power generation in South Africa are exempt
from the lockdown. We will work with the government to determine the impact of this exemption on our South African
Energy Coal and South Africa Aluminium operations, given the role they play in the sustainability of Eskom’s
generation network.

We are seeking clarification from government that the lockdown will extend to South Africa Manganese and have
commenced planning for our manganese ore operations and the remaining furnace at our Metalloys alloy smelter to
be placed on care and maintenance.

As a result of the government’s announcement, we are withdrawing FY20 guidance for our South African operations
and will update the market when further information becomes available.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said “Our response to COVID-19 is built around three areas – keeping
our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and supporting our communities, all of which are
critical to the future of our business.

“We have implemented a range of measures at all our locations to ensure the health and wellbeing of our people and
communities, by reducing the risk of infection and the rate of spread, while maintaining day-to-day operations.

“To-date, we have not yet experienced production interruptions from COVID-19 at any other operations. We continue

  2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividends will be 26.81075 South African
     cents per ordinary share.

     South African dividends tax.

     13 February 2020.

Corporate Update

-   In November 2019 we entered into a binding conditional agreement for the sale of our shareholding in South
    Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited (Seriti Resources) and two trusts which will
    acquire and hold equity on behalf of employees and communities. As previously reported, subject to a number of material 
    conditions(note 1) being satisfied, the transaction is expected to close in the December 2020 half year.
-   We exercised our option to acquire a 50% interest in a joint venture (JV) with Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX: TMQ,
    Trilogy) that will own the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (UKMP) located in northwest Alaska. On formation of the
    JV, expected in the March 2020 quarter, Trilogy will contribute all of its assets associated with the UKMP and
    South32 will contribute US$145M to the JV.The JV will retain US$87.5M of the subscription payment to fund its activities and 
    exploration programs with the balance of US$57.5M loaned back to South32.
-   Our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) sold a legacy shareholding in an unlisted entity for US$93M
    (South32 share) during the quarter. With the majority of these funds returned immediately to the Group, we
    received net distributions(note 2) of US$160M (South32 share) from our manganese EAI during the December
    2019 half year.
-   We progressed the review of options for our manganese alloy smelters including their potential divestment,
    closure or suspension.
-   Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital management we paid our US$139M final dividend in respect of
    FY19 in October 2019 and purchased a further 106M shares for a cash consideration of US$192M during the
    December 2019 half year. To 31 December 2019 we had completed US$1.18B of our approved US$1.25B capital
    management program, including the purchase of 424M shares at an average price of A$3.03 per share
    (US$939M) and US$239M returned in the form of special dividends.
-   Our geographical earnings mix and the impact of permanent differences that are magnified when margins are
    compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions, continues to have a significant bearing on our ETR.
    Until it is sold, South Africa Energy Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0% with all tax assets de-recognised as at 30 June
    2019 and no benefit to be recorded for losses made prior to sale. Accordingly, in the December 2019 half year our
    Group ETR is expected to be in a range between 75% and 85% (excluding EAI) and is expected to remain elevated should South 
    Africa Energy Coal continue to be loss-making until its divestment.

    -   Realised prices exclude third party products and services. We currently anticipate an underlying EBIT loss for
        third party products and services(note 12) of approximately US$12M in the December 2019 half year (H1 FY19:
        US$28M). This predominantly reflects the procurement of lower cost third party volumes to replace higher cost
        equity production in order to fulfil contractual commitments at South Africa Energy Coal.

    Development and Exploration Update
    -   We completed the voluntary remediation program for historical tailings at Hermosa, establishing the initial tailings
        storage facility that is able to support the commencement of future production when production permits are
        received. Our pre-feasibility study remains on-track for completion in the June 2020 half year.
    -   We advanced feasibility study work at the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project ahead of a final investment
        decision scheduled for the December 2020 half year.
    -   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we
        invested US$10M during the December 2019 half year. We directed a further US$26M towards exploration
        programs at our existing operations (US$19M capitalised), including US$2M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and
        US$12M at Hermosa (all capitalised) to further increase our knowledge of the Taylor Deposit and the greater
        Hermosa land package.

    Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 1% (or 27kt) to 1,933kt in the December 2019 half year, despite an
    extended calciner shut, as the refinery continued to benefit from improved calciner availability and we opportunistically
    sold stockpiled hydrate. FY20 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,965kt with further calciner maintenance

    We realised a premium to the Platts Alumina Index(note 13) on a volume weighted M-1 basis for alumina sales in the

    Aluminium smelter that are linked to the Platts Alumina Index on an M-1 basis, with caps and floors embedded within
    specific contracts that reset every calendar year. All other alumina sales were at market based prices.

    Brazil Alumina saleable production increased by 10% (or 66kt) to a record 702kt in the December 2019 half year as
    the refinery benefitted from improved steam generation following the installation of package boilers in the June 2019
    quarter, enabling the benefits of the De-bottlenecking Phase One project to be realised. Notwithstanding the strong 
    operating performance, lower alumina prices and an increase in the use of higher cost third party bauxite is expected to 
    impact the profitability of the operation in the December 2019 half year. FY20 production guidance remains unchanged at 
    1,330kt with maintenance scheduled for the June 2020 quarter.

    Mozal Aluminium saleable production decreased by 1% (or 1kt) to 134kt in the December 2019 half year as the
    smelter's operating performance continued to be impacted by load-shedding events. Despite an increase in the
    frequency of disruptions, FY20 production guidance(note 3) remains unchanged at 273kt.
   
    The smelter sources all of its alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a
    percentage of the LME aluminium index under a legacy contract and the remainder linked to the Platts alumina index on an 
    M-1 basis,with caps and floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. As a result the smelter's 
    cost of alumina was a significant premium to the index in the December 2019 half year.

    South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 3% (or 386kt) to 11.8Mt in the December 2019 half year
    as the operation demobilised contractors in response to market conditions, more than offsetting a 15% increase in
    export sales volumes following improved dragline availability at Klipspruit.

    Notwithstanding the improvement in dragline performance, supporting a 46% increase in export sales during the
    December 2019 quarter, its ramp-up to full utilisation has been slower than anticipated as a result of wet weather.
    Combined with our near-term outlook for domestic demand and the demobilisation of contractors operating in
    unprofitable pits, we now expect FY20 production to be at the bottom end of our guidance range (26.0Mt). Operating
    unit costs are expected to be approximately 10% above the top end of our guidance range of US$40/t in the
    December 2019 half year, ahead of benefitting from an expected increase in volumes during the June 2020 half year
    and the realisation of cost saving initiatives which include contractor demobilisation.

    Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 2% (or 36kwmt) to 1,775kwmt in the December 2019 half

    Separately, with demand for our low cost Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) product remaining favourable, we
    continued to operate the circuit above its design capacity, contributing 11% of total production (H1 FY19: 9%). The
    PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and product-type
    discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index.

    Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 12% (or 12.7kt) to 120.1kt in the December 2019 half
    year as the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level and recorded a higher average zinc grade in
    the September 2019 quarter, that more than offset lower silver grades across the half year.
    
    Processed silver, lead and zinc grades met our expectations in the December 2019 half year and FY20 production
    guidance remains unchanged (silver 11,200koz, lead 104.0kt and zinc 59.0kt) with sequentially lower lead and silver
    grades expected in the June 2020 half year. Higher payable zinc sales in the December 2019 half year reflect timing 
    differences following significant floods in North Queensland in the March 2019 quarter that caused an extended outage of
    a third-party rail line connecting Cannington to the Townsville port.

                                                                                                                       8

     Notes:
     1.    Refer to the market announcement ""Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal"" dated 6 November 2019.
     2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and 
           should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial 
           performance or liquidity.
     3.    Production guidance for our Hillside Aluminium and Mozal Aluminium smelters does not assume any load-shedding impacts 
           on production.
     4.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests
           owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via 
           distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans 
           are repaid, South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
     5.    Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales
           have been reported at 60%. The Group's financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South 
           Africa Manganese ore.
     6.    Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing 
           the total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver 
           (US$14.4/oz) have been used for FY19, H1 FY20 and FY20e.
     7.    Realised prices are unaudited. Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken 
           independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume unless
           otherwise stated.
     8.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided 
           by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany 
           transaction.
     9.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided 
           by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany 
           transaction. Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
     10.   Realised nickel sales prices are unaudited and inclusive of by-products.
     11.   Realised prices for Cannington are unaudited and net of treatment and refining charges.
     12.   Underlying EBIT on third party products and services is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication of 
           or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
     13.   The average of the Platts Alumina Index (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month 
           minus one or ""M-1"")was US$299/t in the December 2019 half year.
     14.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
           Metallurgical Coal production.

PASSING OF DR XOLANI MKHWANAZI

 South32 is deeply saddened to announce the death of our Non-executive Director Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi on Saturday,
 4 January 2020, following a short illness.

 Xolani joined the Board of South32 Limited in July 2015, shortly after the Company's formation, following a
 distinguished executive career, including with BHP Billiton where he served as Chairman of BHP Billiton South Africa
 and as President and Chief Operating Officer of South Africa Aluminium.

 With significant experience in mining and metals and expertise in science, Xolani played a critical role in the
 establishment of South32 and made a valuable contribution to the Sustainability Committee based on his deep
 understanding of social and environmental issues.

 ""Xolani was greatly admired for his grace and his wisdom. He was a scientist and an esteemed business leader with a
 passion for South Africa, its people and the resources sector. His contribution was felt throughout the Company and
 we will miss him greatly"" said Chair Karen Wood.

 Prior to his executive roles at BHP Billiton, Xolani served as Chief Executive Officer at Bateman Africa and the
 National Energy Regulator. He previously held senior positions at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
 where he played a significant role in the formulation of the South African National Science and Technology Policy.

 Xolani held a PhD in Applied Physics from Lancaster University and was a strong supporter of increasing student
 participation in science, engineering and technology in South Africa. He received recognition for his contribution to the
 sciences, including an honorary degree awarded by Lancaster University in July 2019.

 South32's Board and management extend their deepest condolences to Xolani's family.

SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (""South32"") and Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX, NYSE
American: TMQ) (""Trilogy Metals"") announced today that South32 has exercised its option to acquire a 50%
interest in a joint venture company (""Joint Venture"") that will own the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (""UKMP"")
located                              in                            northwest                           Alaska.
Trilogy Metals will contribute all of its assets associated with the UKMP and South32 will contribute
US$145 million to the Joint Venture. Establishment of the Joint Venture is expected to occur in February 2020
and follows an initial exploration partnership between South32 and Trilogy Metals over three field seasons to
advance both parties' geological understanding of the UKMP.

Following formation, the Joint Venture will retain US$87.5 million of the US$145 million subscription payment to fund its
activities and exploration programs with the balance of US$57.5 million loaned back to South32. The loan will be repaid
in instalments, on notice by the Joint Venture as required to advance development studies, resource drilling and regional
exploration programs.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said ""Investing in exploration to create shareholder value is integral to
our Group's strategy. Forming the UKMP Joint Venture will be another important milestone as we reshape and improve
our portfolio, by adding high-quality copper and base metals development options. The decision to exercise the option
follows a successful exploration partnership with Trilogy Metals and is an exciting step forward.""

""We look forward to furthering our partnership with Trilogy Metals and NANA Regional Corporation, the Inupiat-owned
Alaska Native corporation in the region, as we work together to advance the Arctic and Bornite deposits and further test
the significant regional potential across the Ambler Mining District.""

Trilogy Metals Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, James Gowans said ""Having the support and partnership
from a senior mining company like South32 - both in terms of their financial support and technical expertise - is
tremendous for Trilogy Metals. The Ambler Mining District has great potential that we expect will finally be realised with
the formation of the Joint Venture and when the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Project, providing key
infrastructure access, is approved. We are very excited to advance this partnership.""

""This joint venture is an investment in the future - not only for the UKMP but for NANA shareholders and the people of
Alaska,"" said NANA Regional Corporation, Inc (""NANA"") president and CEO Wayne Westlake. ""Continued exploration
offers opportunities for economic growth, allowing NANA to further fulfill our mission to improve the quality of life for our
people.""

About UKMP

The UKMP is located in the Ambler Mining District in Alaska and includes the high grade, polymetallic Arctic deposit,
the Bornite copper deposit and a highly prospective regional exploration portfolio.

Figure 1 can be found within the National Storage Mechanism version of the release.



Arctic is a polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) style deposit that has a reported reserve and resource 1
in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). Current activities at Arctic are focused on advancing
development studies and permitting, following release of a pre-feasibility study by Trilogy Metals in April 2018. Bornite
is a carbonate hosted copper deposit that has a reported resource2 in accordance with NI 43-101. The 2020 field season
will include further exploration drilling at Bornite and regional activity across the highly prospective Ambler VMS and
carbonate hosted copper belts.

South32 expects to release initial JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimates for Arctic and Bornite in the
March quarter 2020 following establishment of the Joint Venture. South32 cautions that the NI 43-101 Mineral
Resources for Arctic and Bornite published by Trilogy Metals are foreign estimates and are not reported in accordance
with the JORC Code. A Competent Person has not done sufficient work to classify the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources
and Mineral Reserves as JORC Code Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves respectively in accordance with the JORC
Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources and
Mineral Reserves will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC
Code.

About NANA

NANA is a for-profit Alaska Native corporation formed as a result of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)
of 1971. NANA manages 2.3 million acres of land located in northwest Alaska, largely above the Arctic Circle, and is
owned by more than 14,500 Inupiat shareholders, or descendants, who live or have roots in the region. In October 2011,
Trilogy Metals and NANA entered into an agreement to consolidate their landholdings into the land package that hosts
the UKMP and established a framework for co-operative development of their respective interests by formation of a joint
venture or royalty payment mechanism.

About Trilogy

Trilogy Metals is a metals exploration and development company focused on exploring and developing the Ambler
mining district located in north-western Alaska. It is one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant
districts located in one of the safest geopolitical jurisdictions in the world. It hosts world-class polymetallic VMS deposits
that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits which have been found to host
high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler
mining district - the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within
the Company's land package that spans approximately 143,000 hectares. The Company has an agreement with NANA,
a Regional Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the
Ambler mining district in cooperation with local communities. Our vision is to develop the Ambler mining district into a
premier North American copper producer.

    SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE                            3
Forward-looking statements

This press release includes certain ""forward-looking information"" and ""forward-looking statements"" (collectively,
""forward-looking statements"") within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to,
statements regarding the completion of the transactions contemplated herein, the timing of the establishment of the
Joint Venture, the realisation of the value in the mining district related to the Joint Venture and the final structure thereof
and access road and the use of proceeds from the contribution payment by South32 and the timing of the release of the
JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimates. These forward-looking statements reflect expectations at the date of this
release; however, they are not guarantees or predictions of future performance. They involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. Readers are cautioned not to put undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable laws or regulations, neither Trilogy Metals nor
South32 undertakes to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information
or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Trilogy Metals' expectations include risks
related to the negotiation and settlement of definitive documentation and the satisfaction or waiver of conditions
precedent to the establishment of the Joint Venture and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in Trilogy Metals' Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018 filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities
and with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and in other Trilogy Metals reports and documents
filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities from time to time.

Mineral Resources and Reserves - clarifying statements

The estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for Arctic and Bornite are foreign estimates under the ASX
Listing Rules reported in accordance with NI 43-101 and filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on 6 April 2018 and 20 July
2018 respectively.

In accordance with NI 43-101, Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
There is no certainty that all or any part of mineral resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. Inferred Mineral
Resources are based on limited drilling which suggests the greatest uncertainty for a resource estimate and that
geological continuity is only implied. Additional drilling will be required to verify geological and mineralisation continuity
and there is no certainty that all of the Inferred Resources will be converted to Measured and Indicated Resources.
Quantity and grades are estimates and are rounded to reflect the fact that the resource estimate is an approximation.

The categories of Mineral Resource classification used are in accordance with NI 43-101. NI 43-101 is a  qualifying
foreign estimate' (Chapter 19, ASX Listing Rules) and has similar categories of resource classification as the JORC
Code (Appendix 5A, ASX Listing Rules).

Reliability of estimate: South32 has experience of managing similar operations to Arctic and Bornite. South32's key
technical and operational personnel have conducted site visits to Arctic and Bornite. Trilogy Metals provided information
used to estimate Mineral Resources to South32 for review.

The basis for the estimates as provided to South32 consists of a geological database incorporating geology, analytical
results and surface topography. Mining and processing recoveries are based on the NI 43-101 reports on Arctic (filed
6 April 2018) and Bornite (filed 20 July 2018) which are available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).

South32 believes that the information provided is the most recent publicly available.

Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the current requirements of the SEC, and information
on mineral deposits contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In
particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term ""resource"" does not equate to the term ""reserves"",
and the requirements for ""reserves"" under NI 43-101 are also not the same as those under SEC rules. Under U.S.
standards, mineralization may not be classified as a ""reserve"" unless the determination has been made that the
mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
The SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning ""measured mineral
resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" or ""inferred mineral resources"" or other descriptions of the amount of
mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute ""reserves"" by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC.
Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted
into reserves. U.S. investors should also understand that ""inferred mineral resources"" have a great amount of uncertainty
as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Accordingly, information concerning
     SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE                                       4
mineral deposits set forth in this press release may not be comparable with information made public by companies that
report in accordance with U.S. standards.

Competent persons' statement

In accordance with ASX listing rule 5.12, Tracy Fouet, a Competent Person, employee of South32 and a Chartered
Professional and Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, confirms the information in this market
announcement that relates to the Arctic and Bornite NI 43-101 foreign estimates filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on
6 April 2018 and 20 July 2018 are accurate representations of the available data and studies provided to South32 by
Trilogy Metals. Ms Fouet has sufficient relevant experience for the styles of mineralisation and types of deposits under
consideration to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for the Reporting
of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code). Ms Fouet consents to the inclusion in the
report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.

Qualified Persons

Andrew W. West, Certified Professional Geologist, Exploration Manager for Trilogy Metals, is a Qualified Person as
defined by National Instrument 43-101. Mr. West has reviewed the scientific and technical information in this news
release on behalf of Trilogy Metals and approves the disclosure contained herein.

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) Chair, Karen Wood, today announces the
appointment of an additional director to the South32 Board.

Guy Lansdown will join the South32 Board as an independent non-executive director. Guy's appointment follows an
extensive global search to identify a director with skills and leadership experience in mining and capital projects with
an emphasis on greenfield developments in the Americas. He will join the Board on 2 December 2019 and seek
election by shareholders at next year's Annual General Meeting.

Guy is a civil engineer with over 35 years' experience, including as an executive at Newmont Mining Corporation
where he was most recently Executive Vice President Discovery and Development. In that role he led Newmont's
exploration and major project development. Since leaving Newmont in 2014, he has continued in this field providing
consulting services in base and precious metals project development.

Karen Wood said ""Guy Lansdown's extensive experience in early and late stage greenfield and brownfield project
development and delivery, together with his strong technical background and strategic leadership abilities, will
enhance the Board's broad range of skills and experience. His appointment will support the Group's growing presence
in the Americas as we continue to advance our exploration and development projects in the region.''

Before joining Newmont, Guy was an Associate and Projects Manager at Knight Piesold in the USA and earlier a
Director of Projects at Group Five in South Africa. Guy has worked in North and South America, Asia, Australia and
Africa over his career.

Guy is the President and Director of two charities, Un Futuro Mejor Inc. and Fundacion Lansdown A.C., which provide
opportunities for disadvantaged youth in Mexico to reach their full potential. He currently lives in Mexico with his wife,
where they founded and oversee the operation of these projects.

Guy is also President and Director of his US consulting company Project Excellence Inc., which offers services

                                         AGREEMENT TO DIVEST SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) announces that we have entered into a binding
conditional agreement for the sale of our 91.835% shareholding in South32 SA Coal Holdings Proprietary Limited
(South Africa Energy Coal, SAEC) (the Transaction) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seriti Resources Holdings
Proprietary Limited (Seriti) and two trusts which will acquire and hold equity on behalf of employees and communities
(jointly referred to as the Purchasers).
The Transaction remains subject to a number of material conditions summarised below. Upon those conditions being
satisfied, Seriti (on behalf of the Purchasers) will make an up-front cash payment of approximately 100 million South
                                                        1
African Rand to acquire South32's shares in SAEC . The purchase price also includes a deferred consideration
component where South32 will receive 49% of the free cash flow generated by SAEC for a period commencing at the
date of completion to March 2024, with payment capped at a maximum of 1.5 billion South African Rand per annum.
South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said ""I am pleased to announce we have entered into an agreement
with Seriti, a black-owned and operated South African mining company. We ran an exhaustive and competitive
process and we believe Seriti as an established operator is ideally positioned to unlock the potential of South Africa
Energy Coal's existing domestic and export operations, including its significant untapped resource base.
""The sale of our interest in South Africa Energy Coal will enable the business to continue to operate safely and
sustainably into the future for the benefit of its employees, customers and local communities, consistent with
South Africa's transformation agenda.
""For South32, this marks an important milestone as we continue to reshape our portfolio. Completion of this
transaction will substantially reduce our capital intensity, strengthen our balance sheet and will improve the
Group's operating margin.""
Seriti Chief Executive Officer, Mike Teke said ""This acquisition is a significant milestone for Seriti in our ambition to
become a black-owned and controlled mining champion. The South Africa Energy Coal acquisition will enable us to
offer further secured, long term coal supply solutions to Eskom as a demonstrable commitment to sustainably support
South Africa's energy needs. The combination of our energy coal businesses will realise further operational and
technical efficiencies enabling us to better service our customers by offering competitive energy solutions.
""We remain fully committed to all of our stakeholders and welcome the participation of the South Africa Energy Coal
employees and communities in this acquisition.""

 The up-front cash payment of approximately 100 million South African Rand is based on an enterprise value of 1.25 billion South African Rand
adjusted for net debt and working capital.

The Purchasers
The Purchasers comprise Thabong Coal Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seriti, a community trust
and an employee trust, who will respectively acquire 81.835%, 5% and 5% of the shares in SAEC. The beneficiaries
of the community trust will be the communities in close proximity to SAEC's operations and employees will benefit
from the employee trust.
Seriti is a broad-based, 91% black-owned and controlled coal mining company. Seriti, through its operating subsidiary,
Seriti Coal Proprietary Limited, currently operates three large-scale, opencast and underground thermal coal mines in
South Africa namely, the New Vaal, New Denmark and Kriel collieries, and owns various resources with life extension
potential and closed collieries.
Seriti supplies approximately 24Mtpa of thermal coal to Eskom SOC Limited's Lethabo, Tutuka and Kriel power
stations. Seriti, together with its partners, also intends to develop the New Largo project into a large-scale, opencast
coal mine capable of providing up to 12Mtpa over a 50 year period for the base load fuel requirements of the Kusile
Power Station.
SAEC minority owners
The remaining 8.165% interest in SAEC is held by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)
consortium led by Phembani Group Proprietary Limited.
Accounting and tax
SAEC will continue to be reported in the Group's Underlying results. On completion of the Transaction South32's
shareholding in SAEC, including all associated assets and liabilities, will transfer to the Purchasers.
Given the current tax base of SAEC, South32 does not anticipate reporting a taxable profit on the Transaction from
either the upfront or deferred consideration.
Additional key transaction terms including material conditions
Completion is subject to a number of significant regulatory and third-party approvals, consents or confirmations being
obtained or waived. These include:
    *   approval from South African and certain foreign competition authorities;
    *   approval from the South African Minister of Minerals and Energy under Section 11 of the Mineral and
        Petroleum Resources Development Act (No. 28 of 2002);
    *   approval from Richards Bay Coal Terminal Proprietary Limited;
    *   consent from Eskom SOC Limited (Eskom) for the change of control of SAEC;
    *   agreement by Eskom to the Duvha Coal Supply Agreement between Eskom and SAEC being amended or
        restated on terms acceptable to Seriti and South32; and
    *   confirmation from the South African Department of Mineral Resources and Energy that it will accept the
        substitution of rehabilitation guarantees provided by South32 with rehabilitation guarantees provided by Seriti.
Subject to the conditions being satisfied, the Transaction would be expected to close in 9 to 12 months.
Advisers
Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Capital are acting as joint lead financial advisers and Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs
Inc. (ENSafrica) as legal adviser to South32.

Karen Wood, Chair

Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to South32's 2019 Annual General Meeting.


My name is Karen Wood and it is my pleasure to chair today's meeting.
---
I confirm that a quorum is present, and now formally declare the meeting open.


All members of the South32 Board are here today.


On my far left, Non-Executive Directors Frank Cooper, Xiaoling Liu, Keith Rumble and Futhi Mtoba.


Next to me on my left is Graham Kerr, our Chief Executive and Managing Director.


From my far right are non-executive directors Xolani Mkhwanazi and Wayne Osborn.


And Nicole Duncan our Company Secretary who also serves as the company's Chief People and Legal Officer.

During the past year our inaugural Chair David Crawford retired after many years of distinguished service to our
industry.


He was the first Chair of South32 and the importance of the role he played cannot be over-estimated.


He worked hard to ensure that South32 was set up for success from the beginning.


That included ensuring it started life with a robust balance sheet; which is critical to a cyclical business like ours.


He also worked hard with Graham and the Board to develop the company's purpose and strategy as well as its core
values of Care, Trust, Togetherness and Excellence.


I know I speak for many when I say that we are in his debt and on behalf of all shareholders and the thousands of
South32 people, I thank him for his service.


Our Lead Team are in attendance today and are seated in the front row.


We have with us our Chief Financial Officer, Katie Tovich, Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Finnimore, Chief
Commercial Officer elect, Brendan Harris, Chief Operating Officers, Mike Fraser and Paul Harvey, Chief Sustainability
                                                                                                                          2
Officer, Rowena Smith, Chief Technology Officer, Vanessa Torres and Chief Development Officer, Simon Collins.


All members of the Board, Lead Team and other members of South32 look forward to the opportunity to meet with you
after the formalities.


Also in attendance today is Denise McComish representing the Company's auditors KPMG.


This is Denise's last meeting as Auditor and I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her service.


Tim Heughan from Computershare will oversee the polling process.
---
During the year the Board visited several of our operations and offices around the world.


Those visits are an important part of our work. They help us see first-hand the issues that our operations face and
give us the opportunity to better understand the surrounding communities who play such an important part in our
success.


The visits also provide a means by which we can test the culture of South32. Our culture is reflected in the way we
work and these visits give us the opportunity to see this in practice, very often in locations far removed from our
offices.


One thing that is clear to me from those visits is that the values we have established are well understood and that our
people - wherever they are located - work hard each day to entrench them in everything they do.


This is particularly true of the focus on safety, which remains at the heart of all we do.


That work is never finished but I am proud to say that our year on year performance improved in 2019.


In our view the most important example of our value of Care is that everyone goes home safe and well.
---
The 2019 Financial Year was another busy and successful year for South32.


We continued to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders by maintaining financial discipline and
delivering on our strategy.


These things are not achieved without the continued dedication, hard work and support from our entire workforce and
I want to take the opportunity to thank each and every member.
---
We continued to reshape and improve our portfolio, and completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining during the year,
adding the Hermosa project.


This is one of the most exciting base metals projects in the industry.



                                                                                                                      3
We also acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project in Queensland and progressed
the divestment of South Africa Energy Coal.


Graham will talk more about our portfolio shortly.
---
The 2019 Financial Year was marked by strong overall operating performance. This delivered:


      -   Underlying earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of 2.2 billion US dollars;
      -   Free cash flow of 1 billion US dollars; and
      -   A net cash balance of 504 million US dollars.


We returned US938 million dollars to shareholders during the reporting period. This included US366 million dollars
which was returned to shareholders as part of our ongoing capital management program.


Of the capital returned, dividends in respect of the year totalled US9.6 cents per share (or 13.7 cents in Australian
dollar terms), including a fully franked final dividend of US2.8 cents per share and a special dividend of US1.7 cents
per share.

We also increased our capital management program by US250 million dollars to US1.25 billion dollars in total -
reflecting our disciplined approach to capital management and the positive outlook for our business.


These decisions were taken consistent with our capital management framework which is designed to:
      -   maintain safe and reliable operations and an investment grade credit rating;
      -   distribute a minimum of 40% of Underlying earnings as ordinary dividends; and
      -   assess competition for excess capital - such as investment in the business, acquisitions, greenfield
          exploration, share buy-backs, and special dividends.


Over the past four years, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 84 per cent, which has exceeded both the
sector index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International world index.
---
In January we were deeply saddened by the tailings dam failure at Brumadinho in Brazil, a site owned by resource
company Vale.


The result was a significant loss of life and immense environmental damage; consequences that have deeply
impacted all who work in this industry.


We are determined to play our part in making sure these tragic events don't happen again and to that end have
supported the work of the International Council on Mining and Metals to develop an international standard for safe
tailings management.


In June we released our Tailings Storage Facilities Management Report, in line with the Investor Mining and Tailings
Safety Initiative, that details our approach.
---


                                                                                                                    4
Our Purpose makes it clear that we aim to make a difference by developing natural resources and, as a result, make
people's lives better now and for generations to come.


We cannot do that unless we create value through social and environmental leadership at the same time as we deliver
returns to shareholders.


An example of this is the way in which we are addressing the impact of climate change including changing weather
patterns, increased regulation, shifts in technology and the growing expectation from the community at large and our
shareholders that we will play our part.


This is a journey we have been on for some time.


In September we published the third of our reports called Our Approach to Climate Change.


This report meets the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and outlines three
areas of focus.


The first, is the climate change opportunity - which outlines how we aim to manage our portfolio in a way that
ensures our products remain in demand and resilient, including by providing raw materials that support action on
climate change.


Many of our commodities will have an important role to play as we shift towards a low carbon economy.


Silver, for example, is used in solar panels, nickel in stainless steel, and aluminium is becoming an increasingly
popular choice for sustainable buildings.


The second, is how we work towards climate resilience for our communities and our operations, and the third, is how
we reduce emissions to support the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.


We have set targets and goals and we report against these annually. We also align remuneration outcomes to those
targets and goals.


Our decarbonisation plans are aligned with the Paris Agreement, and our long-term goal of net zero emissions from
our operations by 2050 reflects this commitment.


Overall, we remain on-track to achieve our 2021 Financial Year Scope 1 target to maintain emissions at or below our
baseline set in the 2015 Financial Year.


By working to avoid and manage climate change risks, as well as taking advantage of the opportunities we have, we
can meet our Purpose by creating a more prosperous future for our business, society and future generations.
---
These goals are not mutually exclusive. Beyond safe and financially successful operations we must also focus on the
lives of the people surrounding them, working together to create healthier, stronger and more resilient communities.


                                                                                                                     5
If we do this well it means not only meeting the aspirations in our Purpose but also creating a legacy for generations to
come.
---
I spoke earlier about the role that all our people play in our success.


As a global organisation we are working hard to build a diverse workforce that is representative of the countries and
communities we operate in.

Together we aspire to create an inclusive workplace where our people feel respected, safe and empowered to raise
concerns and perform to their full potential.


We've made a concerted effort to increase the percentage of women across all levels of our organisation, and black
people in our South African workforce.


Progress on all these critical issues depends on quality leadership and Graham will talk shortly about the investment
we have made in leadership development during the year.
---
We have initiated a review of our Executive Reward Framework, which will continue into 2020 and will include
consultation with our shareholders. As this work is ongoing, we have not made any material changes to our approach
to Executive reward in 2019.


Consistent with previous years, our approach is to align remuneration outcomes to the experience of shareholders.


Our short-term incentive outcomes for the 2019 Financial Year are below target, primarily because controllable costs
were short of target and the impact of lower production volumes at South Africa Energy Coal and Worsley Alumina
resulted in Adjusted Return on Invested Capital not being met.

The first South32 Long-Term Incentive award granted to our Executives, was tested for performance to 30 June 2019.
Our strong Total Shareholder Return performance over the four-year vesting period has meant that all equity from this
first grant vested in August. The 66 per cent growth in our share price over the same period has also contributed to a
substantial increase in the value of this award at vesting, resulting in a material uplift to year-on-year Actual Pay.
---
Looking to the future, we are confident we are building the foundations for long-term success.


We will focus on what matters most. This includes running our operations to their full potential and maximising return
on investment. We will continue to focus on improving return on invested capital and prioritising a strong balance
sheet to ensure we remain in control through economic cycles.


We will strive to make a difference to the communities where we operate, creating value through our environmental
and social leadership. We will use technology and innovation to lift our performance.


But most importantly, we will all work to ensure everyone goes home safe and well at the end of every shift.




                                                                                                                         6
On behalf of the Board and all shareholders, I want to thank Graham, his Lead Team and all of the people who make
up the South32 family for their individual and collective contributions. They are valued by us all.


And finally, to you, our shareholders, I want to thank you for your continuing support.


I'll now hand over to Graham.




Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

Thank you Karen. Good morning everyone. It's great to see you all here today.


Before I take you through our 2019 performance I would like to reflect on safety.

As Karen mentioned, our commitment to improving safety at our operations was reflected in a 12 per cent year-on-
year reduction in our total recordable injury frequency. Employee Occupational Illness rates also declined in the year.


We will continue to focus on creating an inclusive workplace where our people are supported to speak up and share
their concerns or ideas about safety.
---
Moving now to our operational performance and we saw some solid results for the year.


Our overall Group production increased by three per cent and we maintained a leadership position in alumina and
manganese.


Australia Manganese achieved record ore sales, while Hillside Aluminium delivered record production as the smelter
continued to test its maximum technical capacity.


Worsley Alumina finished the year well, with an increase in calciner availability contributing to a 12 per cent production
increase in the June quarter.


At Illawarra Metallurgical Coal production increased by 57 per cent, following work to improve longwall and
development performance.
---
In line with our growth agenda, we have created a pipeline of high-quality development opportunities in commodities
we believe will have strong fundamentals into the future.


In June, we reached an important milestone for our Hermosa project, declaring a Mineral Resource for the Taylor
Deposit in accordance with the JORC Code.


Work undertaken since the acquisition has significantly increased our confidence in the project and confirmed its
ability to deliver strong returns to shareholders.


We have also progressed study work for our Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project in Queensland's Bowen Basin,
and maintained our option with Trilogy Metals in Alaska for the third and final year.
                                                                                                                    7
We continue to invest in greenfield exploration and we have a pipeline of partnerships with junior companies as we
undertake exploration in Australia, Europe and the Americas.
---
As we look to improve our portfolio we have assessed our current operations against our view for the future. Divesting
South Africa Energy Coal is an important next step.


Our intention is that the business becomes black-owned and operated, consistent with the South African
government's transformation agenda.


In the 2018 and 2019 Financial Years we invested US377 million dollars of capital expenditure while we progressed
the divestment process.


This included US185 million dollars to advance the Klipspruit Extension project as part of the investment to extend the
life of the Klipspruit colliery by at least 20 years.


These investments set SAEC up to be a sustainable business over the long term.

Following a comprehensive and competitive process we have entered into exclusive negotiations with Seriti
Resources as we work to finalise the offer.

We also made the decision to review our manganese alloys smelters, TEMCO and Metalloys, as changes in the
market dynamics for manganese alloys have reduced the attractiveness of our exposure.


No decision on the path forward has been made, but our people, suppliers, customers and the local communities are
top of mind as we consider which path to take.
---
Moving to environmental management, where we work hard to be responsible stewards of the environment and treat
natural resources with care so that they are available for future generations.


We continued our progress towards our five-year emissions reduction target, advancing decarbonisation studies at
Worsley Alumina and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal.


We actively participate in a number of industry associations. Membership of these associations provides valuable
access to information, insight and industry influence, helping us make more informed decisions and positive
contributions to industry-wide issues in the areas we operate in.


We regularly monitor our memberships' positions on key issues such as climate change, and engage and collaborate
to facilitate alignment with South32's interests and positive industry outcomes.


Our first Water Stewardship Report was released this year and this details how we manage water consumption and
the steps we're taking to safeguard future water supply.

We also released our 2019 Tailings Storage Facilities Management Report and we remain committed to international
best practice in the management and disposal of tailings at our operations.
---
                                                                                                                  8
Our operations are just one part of a bigger picture. Wherever we operate, we understand the responsibility we have
to get behind our communities, and we are proud to do so.


You will see this take shape in a variety of ways - through support for community programs and infrastructure, and the
promotion of jobs and business opportunities.


In 2019 our total community spend was US17.3 million dollars and we will invest up to US125 million dollars over the
next five years.


To make a difference for those in need, we contributed US800,000 dollars in response to the floods in Townsville,
Australia, as well as US250,000 dollars to support the recovery from Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. We matched the
donations which our employees made to these causes.
---
Underpinning our success is the strength and diversity of our people.


We saw year on year increases in the representation of women on our Board, Senior Leadership Team and overall
workforce. There was also an improvement in the representation of Black People in management roles in our South
African operations.

Our leaders play a critical role in creating an inclusive and diverse culture, and we've invested more than 10 million
Australian dollars in leadership development over the past two years.
---
Looking ahead to 2020 and the outlook for South32 is positive.


We expect to see production increases across the group, with Illawarra Metallurgical Coal returning to a three-longwall
configuration and Worsley Alumina achieving nameplate capacity.


Weaker currencies, lower raw material costs and our efforts to mitigate inflation, particularly in energy, labour and
materials, should result in lower operating costs for most of our operations.


We will remain focused on sustainably improving our operational performance to capture higher margins, while
making disciplined capital allocation decisions and prioritising a strong balance sheet so we retain flexibility through
economic cycles.


Our portfolio will include high returning options with a bias to base metals and the potential to deliver meaningful
growth in shareholder value over the medium-term.

Our approach and strong financial position leaves us well positioned to maintain our momentum to reshape and
improve our portfolio further, and grow value per share.

At the same time, ensuring our workplace is safe and inclusive remains core to everything we do, and we will continue
our unwavering focus on ensuring all of our people go home safe and well.

Thank you for your ongoing support for South32. I'll now hand back to our Chair.
---
                                                                                                                       9
The Chairman then conducted the formal items of business.

Karen Wood, Chair

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance and attention.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank you for joining us today.


We look forward to your continued support in the coming year.


For those of you here in Perth, please join me and my fellow Directors and the Lead Team for light refreshments.

Quarterly Report September 2019



-   Net cash increased by US$163M to US$527M(Note 1) following the allocation of a further US$74M to our on-
    market share buy-back, as we benefitted from an unwind in working capital, despite an increase in finished
    goods inventory during the quarter.

-   Maintained FY20 production guidance for all operations.

-   Achieved record production at Brazil Alumina and another strong quarter at Worsley Alumina as we deliver
    initiatives to sustainably increase to nameplate capacity from FY20.

-   Continued to operate our aluminium smelters at their maximum technical capacity despite the impact of load-
    shedding.

-   Increased production at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal by 30% as the longwalls continued to perform strongly
    following the completion of two moves in the prior quarter.

-   Maintained higher rates of manganese ore production at our low-cost, flexible operations and commenced 
    exploration drilling in the Southern Areas target at GEMCO following the receipt of approvals.

-   Progressed exclusive negotiations with Seriti Resources in respect of its indicative offer to acquire our South
    Africa Energy Coal business and remain on track to provide a further update in the December 2019 quarter.

-   Invested US$17M in exploration at our early stage greenfield projects and existing operations, including at
    Hermosa to further increase our knowledge of the Taylor Deposit and greater land package.


""We have maintained annual production guidance for all of our operations with a strong start to the year at our
alumina refineries, a 30 per cent increase in production at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and a 10 per cent increase
in manganese ore production.

""With macro conditions creating headwinds for our key commodities, we remain focused on driving cost and
operating performance across our portfolio.

""Our disciplined approach to capital allocation has allowed us to return a further US$74 million with the
continuation of our US$1.25 billion capital management program, and following the end of the quarter pay our
US$139 million ordinary dividend in respect of the prior six months.

""We remain on track to finalise Seriti Resources' offer for our South Africa Energy Coal business in the coming
quarter, a significant milestone in the divestment process and a further step towards reshaping our portfolio.""

Corporate Update
-    We progressed exclusive negotiations with Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited (Seriti Resources)
     in respect of its indicative offer to acquire our South Africa Energy Coal business. The offer is subject to final
     negotiation and execution of a binding Sale and Purchase Agreement and we remain on track to provide a
     further update to the market in the December 2019 quarter.
-    We continued to review options for our manganese alloy smelters as changes in market dynamics have
     reduced the attractiveness of our exposure and we will update the market in the March 2020 quarter.
-    Net cash increased by US$163M to US$527M(Note 1) following the allocation of a further US$74M to our
     on-market share buy-back, as we benefitted from an unwind in working capital, despite an increase in
     finished goods inventory during the quarter. We bought back a further 41M shares during the September
     2019 quarter and have now completed US$1.06B of our US$1.25B capital management program, including
     the purchase of 359M shares at an average price of A$3.10 per share. On 10 October 2019 we also paid a
     fully-franked dividend of US$139M in respect of the June 2019 half year.
-    We have settled the insurance claim for the incident that led to an extended outage of the Klipspruit dragline
     at South Africa Energy Coal during FY19, receiving US$98M as full and final payment from our insurers
     during the September 2019 quarter.
-    We received net distributions(Note 2) of US$63M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted
     investments (EAI) in the September 2019 quarter following the payment of US$115M (100% share) in
     royalties at Australia Manganese in respect of the prior 6 month period.
-    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia
     33%(Note 3),Mozambique 0%(Note 3) and Brazil 34%. Our geographical earnings mix continues to have a
     significant bearing on our ETR given differing country tax rates, whilst the impact of permanent differences
     is magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. In the 2019
     financial year our ETR was 37.8% (excluding EAI) and the de-recognition of tax assets in South Africa
     Energy Coal will further increase the Group's ETR, should the operation make a loss in the FY20 financial
     year.

Development and Exploration Update
-   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration
    opportunities, we invested US$3M during the September 2019 quarter. We directed a further US$14M
    towards exploration programs at our existing operations (US$11M capitalised), including US$1M for our EAI
    (all capitalised) and US$6M at Hermosa (all capitalised) to further increase our knowledge of the Taylor
    Deposit(Note 8) and the greater Hermosa land package(Note 9).
-   We progressed our Hermosa project pre-feasibility study which we expect to complete in the June 2020 half
    year and advanced study work at the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project ahead of a final investment
    decision scheduled for the December 2020 half year.
-   We commenced exploration drilling in the Southern Areas at GEMCO during the September 2019 quarter
    following receipt of final regulatory approval. The initial program is designed to infill areas of known
    mineralisation and to test regional targets.

Worsley Alumina hydrate production increased by 4% (or 33kt) to 967kt in the September 2019 quarter as the
hydrate circuit operated at an annualised rate of 4.5mtpa (100% basis), whilst alumina saleable production
decreased by 4% (or 44kt) to 952kt as a scheduled calciner shut was completed. FY20 production guidance
remains unchanged at 3,965kt with the refinery to benefit from improved calciner availability and the drawdown of
excess hydrate stocks over the remainder of the year.

We realised a modest premium to the Platts Alumina Index(Note 10) on a volume weighted M-1 basis for alumina
sales in the September 2019 quarter. This mostly reflected the structure of specific legacy supply contracts with
our Mozal Aluminium smelter that are linked to the Platts Alumina Index on an M-1 basis, with caps and floors
embedded within specific contracts. All other alumina sales were at market based prices.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 6% (or 418kt) to 6.3Mt in the September 2019
quarter following elevated production in the prior quarter, with lower equipment availability at Klipspruit and
preparation for the upcoming wet season impacting volumes.

Domestic sales benefitted from additional volumes of a lower quality stockpiled product that had been directed to
the seaborne market in the prior quarter. Export sales declined by 37% as the lower production volumes, planned
rail network maintenance and weather related port congestion at Richards Bay Coal Terminal resulted in a build
in inventories.

We have settled the insurance claim for the incident that led to an extended outage of the Klipspruit dragline
during FY19, receiving US$98M as full and final payment from our insurers during the September 2019 quarter.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 30% (or 477kt) to 2.1Mt in the September 2019
quarter following the successful completion of two longwall moves in the June 2019 quarter. The Dendrobium

production guidance remains unchanged at 7.0Mt with longwall moves scheduled during the December 2019 and
March 2020 quarters. Achieving improved development rates at Appin to support the operation's return to a three
longwall configuration from the June 2020 quarter remains a focus.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 21% (or 150kwmt) to 868kwmt in the September
2019 quarter. Higher utilisation rates were achieved in the primary circuit as the impact of heavy rainfall in the
prior quarter subsided. The Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) circuit operated at approximately 120% of its
design capacity, as we continued to take advantage of favourable market conditions with our low cost PC02 fines
product contributing 11% of total production. While we continue to monitor market conditions and the potential
impact from the wet season across the remainder of the financial year, FY20 production guidance remains
unchanged at 3,560kwmt.

shipments normalised following the prior quarter's recovery from the impact of significant floods in February 2019
and an operational outage at a customer impacted the timing of some sales in the September 2019 quarter.

     production.                                                                                                                                              
5.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned 
     by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable
     to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32's interest in South 
     Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
6.   Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been 
     reported at 60%. The Group's financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
7.   Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the total 
     Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver (US$14.4/oz) have been 
     used for FY19, YTD FY20 and FY20e. Prior quarters have been restated to this baseline.
8.   The information that relates to the Mineral Resources of the Taylor Deposit was declared in the market announcement 
     ""Hermosa Project - Mineral Resource Declaration"" dated 17 June 2019 (www.south32.net) based on information compiled by Matthew 
     Readford, Competent Person. South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the 
     information included in the original announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates 
     in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. South32 confirms that the form and context 
     in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market announcement.
9.   Information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Clark Deposit (formally the Central Deposit) of the Hermosa 
     project are foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. Reference should be 
     made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement ""South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed 
     all cash offer"" dated 18 June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information 
     or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts on the reliability of the estimate or has the ability to verify 
     the foreign estimate as a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC Code. South32 confirms that the supporting information 
     contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. 
     Competent Persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC 
     Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported as 
     Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. During FY20 we will commence a work program to increase 
     confidence in the resource to ensure that resources are reported in accordance with the JORC Code.
10.  The quarterly average of the Platts Alumina Index (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month 
     minus one or ""M-1"") was US$314/t in the September 2019 quarter.
11.  Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra Metallurgical Coal 
     production.

The currency exchange rate is the volume weighted average price achieved on foreign exchange trades

The exchange rates applicable to the South32 dividend being paid in other currencies will be determined
over the period 2 September 2019 to 19 September 2019. Details of the currency exchange rates applicable
for the dividend will be announced to the relevant stock exchanges.

South32 shareholders registered on the South African branch register will not be able to dematerialise or

inclusive), nor will transfers to or from the South African branch register be permitted between 6 September
2019 and 13 September 2019 (both dates inclusive).

1. South African dividends tax of 8.40102 South African cents per ordinary share will be withheld from the
   amount of the gross final dividend of 42.00512 South African cents per ordinary share paid to
   shareholders on the South African branch register at the rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for
   an exemption.

2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be 33.60410 South African
   cents per ordinary share.

   22 August 2019.

       *          2019 Corporate Governance Statement

       *          Appendix 4G: Key to Disclosures - Corporate Governance Council Principles 
    -   We engage, develop and train our people to ensure our work is well designed;
    -   We continuously improve our work environment to make it safer and more productive for our people;
    -   We have comprehensive health and safety policies, systems and standards with associated performance
        requirements designed to prevent and mitigate exposure to health and safety risks;
    -   We investigate significant events, put preventive and corrective controls in place, and share our learnings
        across the organisation - so that everyone can benefit; and
    -   We have an independent assurance function that reviews our risk register and the associated controls, to test
        how effective they are.


Actions by governments, political events or tax authorities
Strategic Risk: When changes in legislation, regulation, and/ or policy impact our strategic goals and the way we
work, we aim to effectively manage this uncertainty.
This includes uncertainty surrounding direct and indirect taxes and royalties in the countries where we operate, as well
as around broader policy decisions and regulatory changes, relating to:
    -   Nationalisation of mineral resources;
    -   Renegotiation or nullification of contracts;
    -   Leases, permits or agreements; and
    -   Environmental performance.
Our response:
    -   We have the specialised knowledge we need in our functions and through consultants, including tax
        management capability, tax advice, and external relations advice;
    -   We monitor political activity in all jurisdictions we operate in;
    -   We engage with our key stakeholders, identifying them through active mapping and developing
        comprehensive engagement plans;
    -   We work through selected industry associations to influence how the industry is positioned;
    -   While we monitor policy, legislative and regulatory changes, we also engage with relevant authorities; and
    -   We produce an annual Tax Transparency and Payments to Governments Report, which shows how we meet
        our regulatory tax obligations.


Portfolio composition
Strategic Risk: Our aim is to outperform our peers by reshaping our portfolio. This will create exposure to high-quality
operations in commodities with a strong and sustainable outlook, as well as in jurisdictions where we believe we can
operate into the future - in line with our values.
We invest for value in our preferred commodity and jurisdictional exposures. We do this by progressing our internal
development options and by acquiring exploration opportunities, development projects or existing operations.
If we don't invest in a disciplined way, or divest non-preferred exposures, we could reduce TSR.
Our response:
    -   We keep our strategy front of mind - it informs our portfolio composition, including an annual review with
        Board and Lead Team together;
    -   We have a dedicated greenfields exploration team focused on delivering a flow of low-cost, high-quality
        resource development options;


                                                                                                                  2
    -   We apply a rigorously developed and independently verified Commodity Price Protocol (CPP) process, to
        develop long-term prices for our portfolio commodities;
    -   We maintain a strong life of operations planning process. By evaluating the embedded options in our
        operations, we can progress with organic options at the right time;
    -   We follow strong due diligence processes for acquisitions and new business ventures;
    -   We apply a standardised valuation methodology with consistent key macro-economic assumptions;
    -   We have a mature and independent peer review process, which we rigorously follow to make key investment
        decisions; and
    -   We actively manage portfolio change with dedicated specialists, to deliver integration and separation benefits.


Global economic uncertainty and liquidity
Strategic Risk: Our aim is to manage risks related to uncertain and changing macroeconomic conditions. We'll do the
same when it comes to the volatility in commodity, currency and debt capital markets - given how much they can
impact our earnings, balance sheet and growth goals.
Our response:
    -   Our diverse portfolio strengthens our resilience to the disruption of any one commodity, geography or
        operation - compared with single mine or commodity companies;
    -   We prioritise a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating, so that we remain in control
        through economic cycles;
    -   We test our financial strength across a range of scenarios, including a depressed demand and pricing
        environment. We also maintain a minimum liquidity buffer;
    -   Our commercial strategy is designed to ensure we stay resilient and take advantage of new opportunities;
    -   We carry out qualitative global economic scenario assessments, monitor meaningful leading indicators, and
        adjust our commercial approach accordingly;
    -   We maintain strong relationships with high-quality customers and suppliers from all around the world;
    -   We mostly sell our products with reference to floating, market-based prices, which are broadly correlated with
        floating global currency markets and the input costs we're exposed to; and
    -   We carry out an annual review of our CPP, which we use to inform our financial planning and how we operate.


Unexpected operational or natural catastrophes
Strategic Risk: Our operations and transport networks can be disrupted by events such as:
    -   Fire;
    -   Explosion;
    -   Flooding;
    -   Geotechnical failures;
    -   Tailings dam failures;
    -   Loss of power supply;
    -   Mechanical/electrical equipment failures; and
    -   Unexpected natural catastrophes.
Our response:
    -   When facing potential catastrophes, we put safety and wellbeing at the heart of everything we do;
    -   We use a strong system of risk management in design, construction and operation phases, to analyse risks
        and design plans that prevent or limit business impacts;
    -   We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place. We've tested these to make sure we can
        respond rapidly to major events and safely restore our operations;
    -   We have governance functions independent of the operations. These give us assurance against our own
        comprehensive internal standards for equipment integrity, tailings dams management and technical
        stewardship;
    -   We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. This
        may not fully cover all financial losses; and


                                                                                                                     3
    -   We work with external experts, relevant industry bodies and technology suppliers, to provide additional
        assurance and input.


Key talent identification, attraction and retention
Strategic Risk: Our ability to identify, attract and retain key talent and develop capabilities is fundamental to delivering
our strategic priorities.
Failure to ensure the right capabilities and talent within our business erodes shareholder value.
Our response:
    -   We focus on enhancing our offering to employees and potential employees to distinguish ourselves in the
        market;
    -   We continually seek ways to better engage and empower our workforce, including leading flexibility policies
        and a focus on ensuring we maintain an inclusive workplace;
    -   Our dedication to ""making a difference"" inspires our people;
    -   We identify key talent and provide them with experience and growth through time in critical roles;
    -   We have effective approaches to talent and recruitment management, remuneration, skills development and
        succession planning;
    -   Our strategic planning process identifies capability requirements for the future;
    -   We work to strengthen our reputation and status in the community as an employer of choice through
        community engagement programs; and
    -   We have developed and are implementing a long-term workforce planning and talent management program
        across the organisation.


Changing societal expectations and acceptance
Strategic Risk: There are growing expectations of shared value outcomes from mining and metals companies by
government, investors, employees, host communities and broader society.
By understanding and maintaining stakeholder acceptance, we can manage the effect of business impacts to achieve
shared value.
Our response:
    -   We embrace the concept of shared value - it's at the heart of our purpose;
    -   We maintain connection and understanding of stakeholder acceptance and needs through routine mapping
        and engagement on a wide range of environmental, social and governance issues;
    -   We work with appropriate industry associations and organisations who are shaping the dialogue between
        society and mining. This helps us enhance our understanding of social expectations across our portfolio;
    -   We have internal subject matter expertise, policies and governance processes to help us identify shared value
        opportunities, as well as integrate social expectations into our planning and decision-making - at all levels;
    -   Our organisational investment proposition and purpose is clear, to minimise any misalignment with our
        owners' expectations of us; and
    -   We manage and transparently report on regulatory obligations, commitments, and areas where we're working.
        This means we can optimise our value proposition to society and the communities we operate in.


Evolving culture of the organisation
Strategic Risk: We recognise the value of a strong culture. It's at the core of how we deliver our purpose and strategy.
As our organisation grows and matures, our culture must evolve with it. This will help us keep delivering on our
strategy, achieve our purpose and live our values.
Our response:
    -   We're working to better understand the gap between what our culture is and what we want it to be - and to
        have a clear approach to help us close it;
    -   We make sure our ways of working (systems, symbols and behaviours) are aligned to our aspired culture; and
    -   We identify effective levers to move our culture and use them deliberately to address any misalignment.


                                                                                                                      4
Predictable operational performance
Strategic Risk: Predictable operational performance improves our ability to keep our people safe, meet our regulatory
and social obligations, provide quality products to our customers and deliver TSR.
If we can't safely achieve our production targets and mitigate rising unit costs, it will impact directly on our profits and
cash flow, as well as our ability meet our commitments to our stakeholders.
Our response:
    -   We carry out rigorous quality assurance programs over our operations and marketing;
    -   We review our asset health and integrity on a regular basis;
    -   We reconcile the performance of our mineral resource and ore reserve quality against production on an
        annual basis;
    -   We carry out rigorous modelling and reviews of our geotechnical drilling data;
    -   We operate within target operating windows and regularly review our internal scheduling and operational
        planning;
    -   We monitor raw material supply contracts and implement early detection procedures at load port;
    -   We've developed and implemented long-term and short-term planning, scheduling and verification of
        developments;
    -   We carry out operational resource planning and regularly review our productivity metrics;
    -   We apply structured work design processes for critical or high value tasks; and
    -   We apply verification systems to ensure we're compliant with work standards.


Maintain competitiveness through innovation and technology
Strategic Risk: It's clear that technology and innovation are advancing at a rapid pace. And companies who don't
keep up find themselves falling behind in TSR.
To stay competitive, we'll organise our business in a way that means we can identify, adopt and maintain innovation
and technology that delivers shareholder return.

Security of supply of logistics chain and critical services
Strategic Risk: Our logistics chain includes road, rail and ports. Our critical services include gas, power (sourcing and
generating) and water.
By securing our supply at commercially acceptable terms, we can capitalise on market opportunities, run safe and
predictable operations, and deliver life of operations plans.
If we fail to do this, it could result in a disruption to our operations, increased operational costs and financial penalties.
Our response:
    -   We build strong strategic partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers of road, rail, port facilities, water, gas and power,
        on a long-term, mutually beneficial basis;
    -   We have a clearly defined B-BBEE (Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment) strategy in South Africa to
        support the secure supply of electricity to the smelters;
    -   We actively work to secure resources within our control to strengthen the resilience of our operations' logistics
        and critical services against supply disruption; and
                                                                                                                        5
    -   We explore opportunities to optimise existing sources, and identify alternate sources, for critical services.


Maintain, realise or enhance the value of our resources and reserves
Strategic Risk: We exist to realise the potential of the resources and reserves we are entrusted to develop.
We work to continually optimise our operations through our sound technical and economic understanding of our
resources and reserves.
If we fail to do this, it will have a significant impact on TSR and ultimately, the sustainability of the Company.
Our response:
    -   We report Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (including Coal Resources and Coal Reserves) in
        accordance with the JORC Code as required by Chapter 5 of the ASX Listing Rules;
    -   We apply an annual business planning standard and process, structured to get maximum value across the life
        of our operations;
    -   Our capital prioritisation, capital allocation 
    -   We apply a rigorous project development process that includes independent peer review of project risks and
        approval tollgates; and
    -   Our closure standard ensures that our full life of operations value incorporates closure and rehabilitation
        liabilities.


Climate change resilience
Strategic Risk: By using climate change scenarios, we can identify opportunities and threats to our portfolio and
operations.
We assess these risks through a framework that includes policy, market and physical factors.
Our response:
    -   We seek to understand our portfolio performance in a range of future climate scenarios, considering both
        opportunities and threats;
    -   We use the latest climate modelling data to inform us of the level of risk to our operational plans;
    -   We identify potential controls in the short, medium and long-term to improve the climate change resilience of
        our portfolio;
    -   We prioritise our land management efforts to improve resilience, including minimising land disturbance and
        maximising rehabilitation efforts;
    -   We support the Paris Agreement objectives and are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by
        2050;
    -   We identify and implement greenhouse gas reduction and energy efficiency projects, with our emission
        reduction targets linked to our remuneration; and
    -   We're transparent with our disclosure of climate change-related opportunities and threats in our annual Our
        Approach to Climate Change report, which is prepared with regard to the Recommendations of the Task

             SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL DIVESTMENT UPDATE AND IMPAIRMENT

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) announces that following a
comprehensive and competitive process we have entered into exclusive negotiations with Seriti
Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited (Seriti) in respect of its indicative offer (the Offer) to acquire
our South Africa Energy Coal business. Seriti's Offer includes a modest up-front cash payment with a
deferred payment mechanism whereby both companies will share commodity price upside for an
agreed period. The Offer is subject to final negotiation and execution of a binding Sale and Purchase
Agreement with a subsidiary of Seriti and entities holding equity on behalf of employees and
communities.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said ""When we announced our intention to broaden
the ownership of South Africa Energy Coal in November 2017, our vision was that it become a
sustainable, black-owned and operated business, consistent with South Africa's transformation
agenda.

                                                                                           1
""To improve South Africa Energy Coal's competitiveness we approved a 4.3B South African rand
investment to extend the life of the Klipspruit colliery by at least 20 years (KPSX project). Across
FY18 and FY19 we invested US$377M of capital expenditure, including US$185M to advance the
KPSX project, while we progressed the divestment process.

""Following this historical investment, our assessment of Seriti's current Offer and the market outlook
for thermal coal demand and prices, we have recognised a pre-tax, impairment charge of US$504M
within our 30 June 2019 Financial Results.

""Our announcement that we have entered into exclusive negotiations with Seriti is an important
milestone and we expect to provide a further update to the market in the December 2019 half year.""
Impairment summary
    -    Pre-tax, impairment charge of US$504M (US$578M post tax, including de-recognition of
         deferred tax assets);

Corporate Update
•    We received bids for South Africa Energy Coal during the June 2019 quarter. We are currently engaging with the bidders
     regarding finalisation of their offers that will form part of the Group's usual bi-annual assessment of carrying values for 
     our operations. Once an acceptable agreement is reached, a determination will be made regarding any reclassification of the
     operation as an asset held for sale on the balance sheet and a discontinued operation in the income statement. We expect to
     provide a further update to the market in the December 2019 half year.
•    One-off redundancy and restructuring charges of approximately US$30M (post-tax ~US$20M) are expected to be recorded in
     our FY19 financial results. These charges will be excluded from Underlying earnings and relate to redundancies associated
     with the simplification of the Group's functional structures and the voluntary redundancy program undertaken at Hillside
     Aluminium during the June 2019 quarter.
•    We bought back 114M shares for a cash consideration of US$281M during FY19. To 30 June 2019 we had completed
     US$986M of our approved US$1B capital management program, comprising the purchase of 318M shares at an average price
     of A$3.16 per share (US$747M), a US$154M special dividend which was paid on 5 April 2018 and a US$85M special dividend
     which was paid on 4 April 2019.
•    We received net distributions(note 1) of US$458M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI)
     in FY19, including US$132M in the June 2019 quarter.
•    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 33%(note 2),
     Mozambique 0%(note 2) and Brazil 34%. The disproportionate effect of intragroup agreements and other permanent
     differences can impact the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of the Group when margins are compressed, or losses are incurred in
     specific jurisdictions. In the December 2018 half year our ETR was 37.3% and we expect the FY19 ETR to remain elevated
     given continued compressed margins at our aluminium smelters, as profits have moved upstream to our refineries which are
     located in higher tax rate jurisdictions. Separately, the Group made tax payments totalling US$346M (excluding EAI) during
     FY19.

(a)   FY19 realised prices for Cannington reflect the Group's adoption of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with revenue
      recognised net of treatment and refining charges, which will no longer be treated as an expense item. These changes result in 
      lower realised prices and Operating unit costs, with no net impact to earnings. Prior period realised prices have not been

Development and Exploration Update
•     We reported a Mineral Resource estimate for the first time during the June 2019 quarter for the Taylor Deposit, which forms
      part of the Hermosa project(note 10). The Mineral Resource was reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012)
      guidelines at 155 million tonnes, averaging 3.39% zinc, 3.67% lead and 69 g/t silver with a contained 5.3 million tonnes of zinc,
      5.7 million tonnes of lead and 344 million ounces of silver(note 11). The Mineral Resource remains open at depth and laterally,
      with multiple targets to be tested as we advance our extensive surface drilling program in parallel with our pre-feasibility 
      study.
      We expect to conclude the pre-feasibility study before the end of FY20.
•     We continued our drilling program at the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project to further support the completion of the
      feasibility study ahead of a final investment decision scheduled for the December 2020 half year.
•     We invested US$34M in our early stage greenfield exploration projects during FY19. This included US$10M to maintain our
      option with Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX:TMQ) for the third and final year, retaining our right to earn a 50% interest in the Upper
      Kobuk Mineral projects in Alaska by committing approximately US$150M to a 50:50 joint venture by 31 January 2020.
•     We directed US$42M towards exploration programs at our existing operations in FY19 (US$30M capitalised). This included
      US$2M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and US$18M at the Hermosa project (all capitalised).

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 1% (or 31kt) to 3.8Mt in FY19, with the refinery finishing the year on a strong
note as an increase in calciner availability underpinned a 12% increase in production in the June 2019 quarter. Calcined alumina
production is expected to approach nameplate capacity of 4.6Mt (100% basis) in FY20 as we further benefit from initiatives that are
expected to sustainably improve calciner availability and the refinery processes excess hydrate stocks. Notwithstanding the strong
finish to FY19, lower than budgeted volumes, higher caustic soda consumption and additional maintenance costs are expected to
result in a modest increase in Operating unit costs from our prior guidance of US$227/t.
The average realised price for alumina sales in FY19 was a discount of approximately 5% to the Platts Alumina Index (PAX) (note
12) on a volume weighted M-1 basis. This discount narrowed to 1% in the June 2019 half year and reflects the structure of specific
legacy supply contracts with our Mozal Aluminium smelter that are linked to the LME aluminium price and the elevated alumina to
aluminium price ratio in the spot market during FY19. All alumina sales to other customers were at market based prices.

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 3kt to a record 715kt in FY19 as the smelter continued to test its maximum
technical capacity, despite an increase in the frequency of load-shedding events. Sales increased by 22% in the June 2019 quarter
reflecting the timing of shipments.
In order to ensure the smelter's ongoing sustainability and to improve its cost competitiveness, we completed a restructure of the
workforce during the June 2019 quarter. Notwithstanding the restructure, which is expected to deliver cost savings from FY20, and
the continued strong operating performance during the year, lower aluminium prices and elevated raw material input costs, are
expected to result in the smelter recording a loss in FY19.

Mozal Aluminium saleable production decreased by 1% (or 4kt) to 267kt in FY19 as the smelter's strong operating performance
was impacted by an increase in the frequency of load-shedding events.
Notwithstanding the smelter's continued strong operating performance during the year, lower aluminium prices and elevated power
and raw material input costs, are expected to result in the smelter recording a loss in FY19. In order to improve the smelter's cost
competitiveness we commenced relining pots with AP3XLE energy efficiency technology during FY19. The project is expected to
deliver a circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in annual production with no associated increase in power consumption. First incremental
production is anticipated in FY20, with the full benefit to be realised by FY24.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 8% (or 2,292kt) to 25.0Mt in FY19, as export sales volumes were
impacted by an extended outage of the Klipspruit dragline following an incident in August 2018.
Although domestic sales were largely unchanged in FY19, volumes declined by 16% in the June 2019 quarter following reduced
sales of lower quality stockpiled product. Export sales volumes improved by 23% in the June 2019 quarter following a ramp-up of
activity at Klipspruit after the dragline's return to service in the prior quarter.
The incident that caused the extended outage of the dragline has been confirmed as an insurable event, with an initial progress
payment for the volume and cost impact of the outage awarded in June. Notwithstanding the initial progress payment for the
insurance claim offsetting the impact of lower volumes, additional mining costs for concurrent rehabilitation work are expected to
contribute to a modest increase in Operating unit costs from our prior FY19 guidance of US$38/t.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 57% (or 2,403kt) to 6.6Mt in FY19 as the Dendrobium and Appin
longwalls continued to perform strongly following the successful completion of two longwall moves in the June 2019 quarter.
Development performance at Appin continued to improve in the June 2019 quarter and our focus remains on achieving a further
uplift in rates to support a sustainable return to a three longwall configuration at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal during the June 2020
quarter.
We submitted our Environmental Impact Statement to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment for the Dendrobium Next
Domain project during the June 2019 quarter. While still subject to necessary regulatory approvals, the project has the potential to
extend the mine life of Dendrobium to approximately FY36, with a financial investment decision anticipated in H2 FY21.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 1% (or 47kwmt) to 3,349kwmt in FY19 as production was impacted by
the annual wet season extending into the June 2019 quarter. We achieved record ore sales of 3,438kwmt in FY19, drawing down
inventory stockpiles in the June 2019 quarter and operating our PC02 circuit at approximately 120% of its design capacity to take
advantage of strong market conditions.
Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and product-type
discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Notwithstanding the PC02 circuit contributing 10%
of total production, our average realised price for external sales of Australian ore was in-line with the high grade 44% manganese
lump ore index(note 13) in FY19. Internal sales continue to occur on commercial terms.
Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 7% (or 11kt) to 154kt in FY19. We continue to review options for our
manganese alloy smelters as changes in market dynamics have reduced the attractiveness of our exposure and we will update the
market in due course.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 2% (or 42kwmt) to 2,187kwmt in FY19 as productivity improvements
at our high grade Wessels mine delivered an increase in premium material. Notwithstanding the impact of additional volumes, we
are expecting a modest increase in Operating unit costs from our prior FY19 guidance of US$2.56/dmtu as we continued to take
advantage of favourable market conditions by increasing workforce activity and utilising higher cost trucking as an alternative route
to market.
In FY19 our average realised price for external sales of South African ore reflects the medium grade 37% manganese lump ore
index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) (note 14) as increased production of higher quality premium material was offset by the
contribution of our lower quality fines product (6% FY19; 13% FY18). We continue to monitor market conditions and will optimise
our use of higher cost trucking and sales of lower quality fines product in response to market demand.
Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 13% (or 10kt) to 69kt in FY19. We continue to review options for our
manganese alloy smelters as changes in market dynamics have reduced the attractiveness of our exposure and we will update the

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 3% (or 6.4kt) to 193.6kt in FY19 as improved productivity underground
supported higher mill throughput and zinc grades improved in accordance with our expectations. Higher payable silver, lead and
zinc sales in the June 2019 quarter reflect timing differences following significant floods in North Queensland in the prior quarter
that caused an extended outage of a third-party rail line connecting Cannington to the Townsville Port.
Finalisation adjustments and the revaluation of provisionally priced sales of Cannington concentrates will decrease Underlying
EBIT by US$8.2M in FY19 (US$0.1M FY18; -US$9.8M H1 FY19). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 3Moz of silver, 29.2kt
of lead and 5.6kt of zinc) were revalued at 30 June 2019. The final price of these sales will be determined in the December 2019
half year.

      information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts on the reliability of the estimate or has the 
      ability to verify the foreign estimate as a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC Code. South32 confirms that the 
      supporting information contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and 
      has not materially changed. Competent Persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral 
      Resources in accordance with JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign 
      estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. South32 intends 
      to conduct a work program to increase confidence in the resource to ensure that resources are reported in accordance with 
      the JORC Code.
11.   The information that relates to the Mineral Resources of the Taylor Deposit was declared in the market announcement ""Hermosa 
      Project –  Mineral Resource Declaration"" dated 17 June 2019 (www.south32.net) based on information compiled by Matthew
      Readford, Competent Person. South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects 
      the information included in the original announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the 
      estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. South32 confirms that the 
      form and context in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original 
      market announcement.
12.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Platts Alumina Index (PAX) (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month lag 
      to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$443/t in FY19.
13.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on the 
      basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$6.74/dmtu in FY19.
14.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, 
      South Africa) on  the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$5.61/dmtu in FY19.
15.   Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustments. Underlying EBIT is reported net of 
      South32's share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments.
16.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: US$ million (US$M); US$ billion (US$B); grams per tonne 
      (g/t);  tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa); million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per annum

HERMOSA PROJECT – MINERAL RESOURCE DECLARATION

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) is pleased to report for the first time
a Mineral Resources estimate for the Taylor Deposit which forms part of its 100% owned Hermosa
Project located in Arizona, USA (Appendix 1 – Figure 1). The Mineral Resource (Table A) is reported
                                           1
in accordance with the JORC Code (2012) guidelines at 155 million tonnes, averaging 3.39% zinc,
3.67% lead and 69 g/t silver with a contained 5.3 million tonnes of zinc, 5.7 million tonnes of lead and
344 million ounces of silver. The Mineral Resource remains open at depth and laterally, with multiple
targets to be tested as we continue our extensive surface drilling program.

72% of the Mineral Resource is in the Measured and Indicated categories (Table A), including 21
million tonnes in the Measured category at 4.07% zinc, 3.61% lead and 51 g/t silver, providing a
compelling base from which to advance the Hermosa Project's pre-feasibility study and target
additional mineralisation. To demonstrate the deposit's optionality, a range of tonnages and grades
                                         2
for the Mineral Resource at different NSR cut-offs is included in Table B. The Mineral Resource
                                                                           3
estimate does not include the zinc-manganese-silver oxide Clark Deposit .

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said ""Our declaration of a Mineral Resource for the
Taylor Deposit for the first time in accordance with the JORC Code represents a key milestone as we
progress one of the most exciting base metals projects in the industry. The ongoing drilling program,
and the resampling and relogging activity undertaken since our acquisition of the Taylor Deposit has
significantly de-risked our investment, increased our confidence in the project and confirmed its ability
to deliver strong returns to our shareholders over many decades. We expect to conclude our pre-
feasibility study for the project before the end of the 2020 financial year.""

The Hermosa Project is a polymetallic development option located in Santa Cruz county, Arizona
which is 100% owned by South32. It comprises the zinc-lead-silver Taylor Deposit, the zinc-
manganese-silver oxide Clark Deposit and an extensive, highly prospective land package with
potential for discovery of polymetallic and copper mineralisation.

        Formerly known as the Central Deposit.
Information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Clark Deposit (Arizona Mining Inc)
are foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance with the JORC
Code. Reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market
announcement ""South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer"" dated 18 June 2018, in
accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information or data
relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts on the reliability of the estimates or has the
ability to verify foreign estimate as Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC Code. South32
confirms that the supporting information contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018
market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. Competent Persons have
not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with
JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign estimates
will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC
Code. South32 intends to conduct a work program to increase confidence in the resource to ensure
that resources are reported in accordance with the JORC Code.

Notes:
1. Cut-off grade: NSR of US90$/t for both UG Sulphide and UG Transition.
   Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based on South32's long term forecasts for zinc, lead and silver pricing; haulage,
   treatment, shipping, handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions differ for geological domains and vary from 85%
   to 92% for zinc, 90% to 94% for lead, and 75% to 83% for silver.
2. All masses are reported as dry metric tonnes (dmt). All tonnes and grade information have been rounded to reflect relative uncertainty
   of the estimate, hence small differences may be present in the totals.



Estimate of Mineral Resources for Hermosa

South32 confirms the first time reporting of the Mineral Resource estimate for the Taylor carbonate
replacement deposit (CRD) as at 31 May 2019 (Table A).

The estimates of Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 (JORC Code) and the
Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules. The breakdown of the total estimates of Mineral
Resources into the specific JORC Code categories is contained in Table A. This report summarises
the information contained in the JORC Code Table 1 which is included in Appendix 1 to this report.

Geology and geological interpretation

The Taylor Deposit within the Hermosa Project is a CRD style zinc-lead-silver massive sulphide
deposit. It is hosted in Permian carbonates of the Pennsylvanian Naco Group of south-eastern
Arizona (Appendix 1 - Figure 3).

The Taylor Deposit comprises the upper Taylor Sulphide and lower Taylor Deeps domains that have
                              0
a general northerly dip of 30 and are separated by a low angle thrust fault. Mineralisation within the
stacked profile of the thrusted host stratigraphy extends 1200m from near-surface and is open at
depth. Mineralisation is modelled for thirteen litho-structural domains for an approximate strike of
2500m and width of 1900m. (Appendix 1 - Figure 5).

Drilling techniques

The Mineral Resource estimate is based on data from 251 surface diamond drill holes of HQ
(95.6mm) or NQ (75.3mm) diameter (Appendix 1 - Figure 4). Vertical drilling was undertaken for 146
                                                                                                       0
of 251 holes used in this resource estimate. Since August 2018, holes have been drilled between 60
        0
and 75 dip to maximise the angle at which mineralisation is intersected. Oriented drilling was
introduced in October 2018 to incorporate structural measurements into geological modelling for
stratigraphy and fault interpretation.

Sampling and sub-sampling techniques

All 289,660m of drilling used for geology, geometallurgy and geotechnical purposes is diamond core.
The drill half cores were sampled at either 1.5m (5') intervals or terminated at litho-structural
boundaries. Samples were submitted for preparation at an external ISO-17025 certified laboratory,
Australian Laboratory Services (ALS), in Tucson. Preparation involved crushing to 2mm, a rotary split
to 250g and pulverisation to 85% passing 75µm from which a 25g pulp was measured for assay. The
mineralised intersections were verified by geologists throughout each drilling program and reviewed
independently against core photos by an alternate geologist prior to geological interpretation.

Sample analysis method

Samples of 1g taken from 25g pulp were processed at ALS in Vancouver where they were digested
using a four-acid leach method. This was followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Atomic Emission
Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) determination for 33 elements. A range of certified reference materials
(CRM) were routinely submitted to monitor assay accuracy, with low failure rates within expected
ranges for this deposit style, demonstrating reliable laboratory accuracy.

External third-party laboratory pulp duplicate and CRM checks indicate no significant bias was
determined for the primary assay laboratory. Results of routinely submitted field duplicates to monitor
sample representivity, coarse crush and laboratory pulp duplicates to quality control sample
preparation homogeneity, and certified blank submissions to detect cross-contamination were all
within an acceptable range for resource modelling.

Estimation methodology

Resource estimation was performed by ordinary kriging interpolation for four elements of economic
interest (Zn, Pb, Ag, Cu), two potentially deleterious elements (As, Mn) and four tonnage estimation
elements (Fe, Ca, S, Mg). Search estimation criteria are consistent with geostatistical models
developed for each estimation domain according to the appropriate geological controls. Validation
includes statistical analysis, swath plots and visual inspection.

Specific gravity measurements from drill cores were used as the basis for estimating dry bulk density
in tonnage calculations for both mineralised and non-mineralised material.

Mineral Resource classification

Mineral Resource classification criteria are based on the level of data informing both the geological
model and grade estimation. Grade estimation confidence is overlain on the geological modelling
classification criteria whereby kriging variance is matched to block estimation conditions - that relates
to the number and distance of data informing the estimate in relation to semivariogram models for Zn,
Pb and Ag. Measured Resources are interpolated from data within a range equivalent to a likely grade
control drill spacing of 30m to 50m. Indicated Resources are estimated from data spacing within
approximately 180m, 120m and 15m in the maximum, intermediate and short-range grade continuity
directions. Inferred Resources are constrained by the reporting of estimates to within demonstrated
grade and geological continuity ranges, and generally to a maximum of 400m beyond data.

Mining and metallurgical methods and parameters
Reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction have been determined through assessment
of the Mineral Resource at a scoping study level for processes, ranging from stope optimisation and
mine scheduling through to mineral processing and detailed financial modelling. Underground mining
factors and assumptions for longhole stoping on a sub- or full-level basis with subsequent paste
backfill are made based on industry benchmark mining production and project related studies,
calibrated against South32's Cannington zinc, lead and silver mine production.

Cut-off grade

The Taylor Deposit of the Hermosa Project is a polymetallic deposit which uses an equivalent net
smelter return (NSR) value as a grade descriptor. Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based
on South32's long term forecasts for zinc, lead and silver pricing; haulage, treatment, shipping,
handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions differ for geological domains and
vary from 85% to 92% for zinc, 90% to 94% for lead, and 75% to 83% for silver.

A dollar equivalent cut-off of NSR US$90/dmt forms the basis of assessment for reasonable
prospects for eventual economic extraction, supported by scoping level studies.

    Update on estimates of Coal Reserves for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal

    South32 confirms a reduction of 22Mt to its Coal Reserves estimate as at 31 May 2019 for Illawarra
    Metallurgical Coal. The decrease relates to the partial relinquishment of Consolidated Coal Lease 767
    from the Appin area of the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal project and modifications to the mine layout.
    The partial lease relinquishment was the result of a commercial arrangement with a land holder within
    the lease area.

    The Coal Resources and Coal Reserves estimates as at 31 May 2019, are presented in Appendix 1,
    Table 1 and Table 3. A comparison to previously published Coal Resources and Coal Reserves
    estimates (as at 30 June 2018) are presented in Appendix 1, Table 2 and Table 4.

    The estimates of Coal Resources and Coal Reserves have been reported in accordance with the
    Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012
    (JORC Code) and the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules.

    The breakdown of the total estimates into the specific JORC Code categories is contained in the
    Appendix 1 Tables. This report also summarises the information contained in the JORC Code Table
    1, which is included in Appendix 2 of this report.

    Estimate of Coal Reserves

    The declared Coal Reserve estimates are based on the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (IMC) Coal
    Resource estimates as at 31 May 2019.

    Material and economic assumptions

    IMC's Appin mine (Appin) has been operating since 1962. The run-of-mine (ROM) coal is processed
    onsite before being transported by truck to domestic customers and the Port Kembla Coal Terminal
    for export.

    Sufficient studies have been undertaken to enable the Coal Resource to be converted to Coal
    Reserve based on current operating methods and practices.

    Capital costs are based on the expected future development of the mine, processing and sustaining
    capital requirements. The costs have been accounted for in the operation's valuation models.
    Operating costs are estimated as part of South32's internal budgeting process, which also considers
    transport costs including current truck, conveyor and contractor rates. Other economic assumptions
    used for the valuation reflect South32's internal views of demand, supply, volume forecasts and
    competitor analysis and are commercially sensitive.




SOUTH32 COAL RESERVES UPDATE                                                                                2
    Coal Reserve classification

    Proved and Probable Coal Reserves are derived from the respective Coal Resource classifications in
    accordance with the JORC Code.

    The Reserve Life reported as of 31 May 2019 reflects the scheduled extraction period in years for the
    total Coal Reserve in the current approved life of operation plan.

    Mining method and assumptions

    The Appin mining operation is centred on existing surface accesses and infrastructure in the area
    around the Appin township.

    Underground longwall extraction methods have been utilised at Appin for over 50 years to efficiently
    extract coal from the Bulli seam. This mining method is used to model and report the 31 May 2019
    Coal Reserve estimate.

    The Coal Reserve is reported within mine layouts, generated using mine design assumptions,
    including limiting factors (i.e. geological features, predicted subsidence impacts, mining constraints
    etc.), which are applied to the reserve model.

    The dilution estimates are determined using historical ROM ash values recorded for comparable
    areas. Average dilution across IMC operations is 10% and typical coal loss is around 1.5%.

    Processing method and assumptions

    IMC produces washed and sized coal for delivery to customers. The processes utilised are industry
    standard flotation and gravity separation.

    Predicted recoveries at the processing plants are derived using a model based on historical data and
    simulated sample results over the life of the operation. The average recovery for the Bulli seam is
    84%.

    Cut-off parameters

    There was no seam thickness cut-off grade applied because the minimum thickness within the mine
    layout is economic.

    Estimation methodology

    The Coal Reserve as at 31 May 2019 was estimated using updated mine layouts, applying the current
    mining parameters, constraints, and exclusions, which were then confirmed in an economic mine
    schedule.

    Material modifying factors

    The reported Coal Reserve is within the mine layout, using current mining methods and practices.
    These are fully contained within South32 mining and exploration tenements. The Coal Reserve is
    scheduled to be extracted within the expiration date of current Development Consents.

    IMC is an operating asset which has all the required infrastructure and environmental approvals
    required to operate its existing mine sites. The requirement for future infrastructure and approvals has
    been considered in the mine schedule and assumes no outstanding or foreseeable issues with
    material legal agreements or regulatory approvals. Long-term marketing arrangements are in place.

Corporate Update

              
-   Net cash[Note 1] increased by US$48M to US$726M during the March 2019 quarter despite a rise in working capital and the
    continuation of our capital management program. We returned a further US$37M to shareholders during the quarter by way of
    our on-market share buy-back. To 31 March 2019 we have bought back 286M shares at an average price of A$3.13 per share.
    Subsequent to the end of the quarter we returned an additional US$85M in the form of a special dividend, bringing total returns
    under our approved US$1B capital management program to US$908M with the remainder of the program due for completion
    by 5 September 2019. We also paid a fully franked interim dividend of US$256M on 4 April 2019.
                                  
-   We received net distributions[Note 2] of US$64M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) during
    the quarter. The combination of strong operating performance and pricing has seen additional cash build in our manganese
    joint venture, despite Australia Manganese paying royalties of US$124M (100% share) in respect of the prior 6 month period.
    Excess cash in the joint venture is expected to be distributed to partners in the June 2019 quarter.

-   Our Operating unit costs are tracking to plan at all operations on the basis of previously disclosed exchange                                       
    rate and commodity price assumptions[Note 3] , albeit the cost profile of our aluminium smelters continues to be influenced by 
    still elevated raw material prices.

-   We remain on track to transform the ownership of South Africa Energy Coal with binding bids expected in the June 2019
    quarter. Once acceptable bids are received and evaluated, we expect to reclassify the operation as an asset held for sale on
    the balance sheet and a discontinued operation in the income statement.
                                                                                                                           
-   The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 33%[Note 4] ,
    Mozambique 0%[Note 4] and Brazil 34%. The disproportionate effect of intragroup agreements and other permanent differences can
    impact the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of the Group when margins are compressed, or losses are incurred in specific
    jurisdictions. In the December 2018 half year our ETR was 37.3% and we now expect the FY19 ETR to remain elevated given
    continued compressed margins at our aluminium smelters, as profits have moved upstream to our refineries which are located in 
    higher tax rate jurisdictions.

Development and Exploration Update
-   We invested US$25M in our early stage greenfield exploration projects during the nine months ended
    March 2019. This included US$10M to maintain our option with Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX:TMQ) for the third and final year,
    retaining our right to earn a 50% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral projects in Alaska by committing approximately US$150M
    to a 50:50 joint venture by 31 January 2020. Our guidance for FY19 greenfield exploration remains unchanged at US$41M.
-   We directed US$29M towards exploration programs at our existing operations in the nine months ended March 2019
    (US$18M capitalised). This included US$2M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and US$12M at the Hermosa project
    (all capitalised) to further increase our knowledge of this high grade resource. We remain on track to declare a Mineral
    Resource[Note 8] for Hermosa in accordance with the JORC Code during the June 2019 quarter.
-   We commenced a drilling program at the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project to further support the completion of the 
    feasibility study ahead of a final investment decision scheduled for the December 2020 half year.

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 1% (or 16kt) to 2.8Mt in the nine months ended March 2019, as further calciner
maintenance was undertaken and the refinery retained a substantial hydrate inventory position. We have commenced several
initiatives that are expected to improve calciner availability and support a sustainable increase in production to nameplate capacity
of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) from FY20. Given this focus, we now expect FY19 production of 3,795kt (versus prior guidance of 3,965kt).

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 3kt) to 536kt in the nine months ended March 2019 as the smelter
continued to test its maximum technical capacity, despite an increase in the frequency of load-shedding events. FY19 production
guidance remains unchanged at 720kt, but remains subject to load-shedding. Sales declined by 14% in the March 2019 quarter
reflecting the timing of shipments.

Notwithstanding the smelter's continued strong operating performance, its cost profile continues to be influenced by still elevated
raw material prices, including alumina sourced from Worsley Alumina. In order to ensure the smelter's ongoing sustainability and to
improve its competitiveness, we commenced a consultation process with our employees[Note 9] during the March 2019 quarter regarding
a proposed restructure of the business. We expect this process to conclude in the June 2019 quarter.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 1,895kt) to 18.3Mt in the nine months ended March 2019, albeit
production improved during the March 2019 quarter as domestic sales volumes benefitted from a contract to sell lower quality
stockpiled product.

Notwithstanding the improved performance, disruptions caused by community protests, a delay in the implementation of a new shift
pattern at Khutala and the slower than expected ramp-up of activity following the Klipspruit dragline's return to service resulted in
lower than planned volumes in the March 2019 quarter. The dragline incident at Klipspruit has been confirmed as an insurable
event and the volume and cost impact will be subject to an insurance claim. We now expect FY19 export production of 10.7Mt
(versus prior guidance of 11.5Mt) and a larger decline in lower margin domestic production to 15.5Mt (versus prior guidance of 17.5Mt).

We remain on track to transform the ownership of South Africa Energy Coal with binding bids expected in the June 2019 quarter.
Once acceptable bids are received and evaluated, we expect to reclassify South Africa Energy Coal as an asset held for sale on
the balance sheet and a discontinued operation in the income statement.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 68% (or 2,033kt) to 5.0Mt in the nine months ended March 2019 as
the Dendrobium and Appin longwalls performed strongly. We also successfully renegotiated a new Appin Trades and Operators
and West Cliff Coal Preparation Plant Enterprise Agreement during the March 2019 quarter, thereby concluding the renegotiation of
all major labour agreements at the operation.

FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 6.5Mt as we commence the extraction of new panels at both Appin and
Dendrobium in the June 2019 quarter, following the successful completion of two longwall moves. Our focus remains on achieving
a substantial uplift in development rates at Appin in order to sustain the operation of two longwalls in parallel from H2 FY20.

Australia Manganese achieved record ore performance in the nine months ended March 2019, increasing saleable ore production
by 4% (or 100kwmt) to 2,631kwmt. The primary circuit continued to achieve high utilisation rates despite the impact of the wet
season, while the Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) circuit operated at approximately 120% of its design capacity, contributing
10% of total production as we continued to take advantage of strong market conditions. Notwithstanding the potential impact from
the wet season across the remainder of the financial year, we now expect FY19 production of 3,500kwmt (versus prior guidance of
3,350kwmt).

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 3% (or 53kwmt) to 1,615kwmt in the nine months ended March
2019 as an increase in higher quality premium material was more than offset by a decline in fine grained secondary material. While
we will continue to monitor market conditions, we now expect FY19 production of 2,130kwmt (versus prior guidance of 2,050kwmt)
as we optimise our use of higher cost trucking in response to currently strong demand.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 9% (or 11.8kt) to 140.1kt in the nine months ended March 2019 as
silver and zinc grades improved in accordance with our expectations and mill throughput continued to track to plan. Lower payable
silver, lead and zinc sales in the March 2019 quarter reflect timing differences following significant floods in North Queensland that
caused an extended outage of a third-party rail line connecting Cannington to the Townsville Port. FY19 zinc equivalent[Note 7] 
production guidance remains unchanged at 188.1kt (silver 11,750koz, lead 98.0kt and zinc 51.0kt) with the disruption to rail 
successfully mitigated by temporary road haulage, at minimal incremental cost.

2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and should 
      not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
3.    FY19 Operating unit cost guidance includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and includes 
      various assumptions for FY19, including: an alumina price of US$443/t; an average blended coal price of US$173/t for Illawarra 
      Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$6.58/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$5.47/lb; a thermal 
      coal price of US$92/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$15.06/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,023/t 
      (gross of treatment and refining charges); a zinc price of US$2,587/t (gross of treatment and refining charges); an AUD:USD 
      exchange rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.02; a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,096; and a reference price for caustic 
      soda; all of which reflected forward markets as at January 2019 or our internal expectations.
4.    The Colombian corporate tax rate was 40% during CY17, 37% during CY18 and is 33% in CY19. The corporate tax rate will decrease 
      on an annual basis by a percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject to a 
      royalty on revenues instead of income tax.
5.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned 
      by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable 
      to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32's interest in 
      South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
6.    Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore and sales have been reported at 
      60%. 
      The Group's financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
7.    Payable Zinc Equivalent (kt) is calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the total 
      Revenue by the price of zinc. FY18 realised prices for zinc (US$3,185/t), lead (US$2,463/t) and silver (US$16.6/oz) have been 
      used for FY18 and FY19e.
8.    The information in this release that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa project are foreign estimates 
      under ASX Listing Rules and reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement 
      ‘South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer' dated18 June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. 
      South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts on the 
      reliability of the estimates. South32 confirms that the information contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 
      market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. The estimates of Mineral Resources are not reported 
      in accordance with the JORC Code. Competent Persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral 
      Resources in accordance with JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign 
      estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code.
9.    On 18 February 2019 South32 informed employees at its Hillside Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa, that it intends 
      to commence consultation with them in accordance with Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. The consultation is related to a

""Record production at Australia Manganese, strong operating performance more broadly and higher commodity prices 
delivered a 17 per cent increase in Profit after tax for the half year, while Underlying earnings per share grew by 
20 per cent as we continued to benefit from our on-market share buy-back program.  

""Our strong start to the year means that our production guidance is unchanged for all of our operations with the exception 
of Illawarra Metallurgical Coal where we have upgraded guidance by 7 per cent.  We have also lowered our unit cost guidance 
as we have maintained operating discipline and benefited from a stronger US dollar. 

""We continued to reshape our portfolio by acquiring the high-grade Hermosa resource and a 50% interest in and operatorship 
of the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project during the period.  We are also progressing our early stage exploration projects 
and remain on track to divest South Africa Energy Coal with binding bids expected by 30 June 2019. 

""We are well positioned for the second half of the year, with a net cash balance of US$678M and an improving outlook for production 
and costs. This strong position has allowed us to return US$511M to shareholders in respect of the period with today's declaration of
 a US$258M fully franked interim dividend and an US$86M fully franked special dividend.

""Having established a strong track record, we will continue to return any excess capital to shareholders in a timely and efficient 
manner by monitoring our financial position within the context of the prevailing macro-economic environment and our capital management 
framework. This will involve the continuation of our existing US$1B capital management program with the recommencement of our on-market 
share buy-back following release of our financial results.""

Safety
We are working hard to create a workplace where we can guarantee that everyone goes home safe and well at the end of every
shift. In order to make this breakthrough we are creating an inclusive workplace where all work is well-designed and we
continuously improve and learn. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF)(9)(10) declined from 5.1 to 4.8 per million hours
worked in H1 FY19.

Performance summary
The Group's statutory profit after tax increased by 17% to US$635M in H1 FY19, Underlying earnings increased by 18%
(or US$98M) to US$642M and basic Underlying earnings per share increased by 20% to US12.6 cents per share as we benefitted
from our on-market share buy-back program. This significant increase in profitability was driven by strong production, higher
commodity prices and disciplined cost control.

Following our strong start to the year and a favourable movement in currency markets, we have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost
guidance for the majority of operations, while production guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal has been increased by 7% to 6.5Mt.

We have also lowered Capital expenditure(11) guidance, including equity accounted investments (EAI), by 9% to US$762M to 
reflect the reclassification of US$20M of planned exploration expenditure at Hermosa to capitalised exploration, the appreciation
of the US dollar and a lower rate of spend in H1 FY19 (US$349M).

Specific highlights included:
 -  A 106% increase in production at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal as the Appin colliery continued to ramp-up towards historical
    rates;
 -  Record ore production at Australia Manganese as the primary circuit maintained high utilisation rates and the
    Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) circuit operated at 120% of design capacity;
 -  The commencement of several improvement initiatives at Worsley Alumina that are expected to support a sustainable increase
    in production to nameplate capacity of 4.6Mt (100% basis) ahead of future de-bottlenecking activities;
 -  Mineração Rio do Norte S.A (MRN) partner approval to undertake a pre-feasibility study for a project that has the potential to
    extend the life of the bauxite mine by more than 20 years(12) at a relatively low capital cost;
 -  The acquisition of the remaining 83% interest in Arizona Mining(13) for US$1.4B (including transaction costs), which adds the
 -  Hermosa project's high grade zinc-lead-silver resource(14) and a prospective land package to our portfolio; and
 -  The commencement of a feasibility study at Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal, following our acquisition of a 50% interest in the
    project and assumption of operating control for US$106M(15).

Subsequent to period end we also elected to maintain our option with Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX:TMQ) for the third and final year,
which retains our right to earn a 50% interest in the Upper Kobuk Mineral projects in Alaska by committing approximately US$150M
to a 50:50 joint venture by 31 January 2020.

We finished the period with a net cash balance of US$678M having generated free cash flow from operations, including
distributions from our manganese EAI, of US$718M. Our strong financial position and disciplined approach to capital management
has allowed us to return US$511M to shareholders in respect of the period, including:

 -  A US$258M fully franked interim dividend, which we have resolved to pay in April in accordance with our dividend policy
    which seeks to return a minimum 40% of Underlying earnings in each six month period;
 -  An US$86M fully franked special dividend, which we have also resolved to pay in April; and
 -  The continuation of our on-market share buy-back program whereby we purchased 68M shares at an average price of A$3.39
    per share for a cash consideration of US$167M.

With payment of this special dividend we will have completed 87% of our US$1B capital management program with the remaining
US$127M scheduled to be returned to shareholders by 10 April 2019, depending on market liquidity and value. Having
established a strong track record, we will continue to return any excess capital to shareholders in a timely and efficient manner by
monitoring our financial position within the context of the prevailing macroeconomic environment and our capital management
framework.

Earnings
The Group's statutory profit after tax increased by US$92M (or 17%) to US$635M in H1 FY19. Consistent with our accounting
policies, various items are excluded from the Group's statutory profit to derive Underlying earnings including: losses on fair value
movements of non-trading derivative instruments and other investments (US$28M pre-tax); exchange rate gains associated with
the Group's non US dollar denominated net debt (US$21M pre-tax); the tax expense for all pre-tax earnings adjustments and
exchange rate variations on tax balances (US$11M), and profit associated with earnings adjustments included in our EAI
(US$11M). Further information on these earnings adjustments is included further on.

On this basis, the Group generated Underlying EBITDA of US$1.3B for an operating margin of 38% as stronger volumes, primarily
at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, and higher average realised prices underpinned a US$300M increase in sales revenue, excluding
third party products. The Group's Operating unit costs also benefitted from weaker producer currencies, however total costs rose
with higher production and price-linked royalties, elevated raw material costs across our aluminium value chain and an increase in
maintenance costs at Worsley Alumina. Depreciation and amortisation also increased by a modest US$17M to US$380M, meaning
that Underlying EBIT increased by US$201M (or 28%) to US$925M. This higher level of profitability, a change in our geographic
earnings mix and permanent differences led to a US$103M (or 85%) increase in our Underlying income tax expense to US$224M.
As a result, Underlying earnings increased by US$98M (or 18%) to US$642M.

Net finance cost

The Group's Underlying net finance cost, excluding EAI, was US$59M in H1 FY19, which primarily reflects the unwinding of the
discount applied to our closure and rehabilitation provisions (US$52M), finance lease interest (US$25M) and interest on our net cash
balances (US$22M).

Tax expense
The Group's Underlying income tax expense, which excludes tax associated with EAI, was US$224M for an Underlying effective
tax rate(20) (ETR) of 37.3% in H1 FY19 (H1 FY18: 28.0%). The increase in ETR reflects the differing tax rates that our operations
are exposed to and the change in our geographic earnings mix, and the disproportionate effect of intragroup agreements and other
permanent differences when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. The primary corporate tax
rates applicable to the Group for H1 FY19 include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 37%(21), Mozambique 0%(21) and
Brazil 34%.

The Underlying income tax expense for our manganese EAI was US$172M, including royalty related taxation of US$42M at
GEMCO (Australia Manganese), for an Underlying ETR of 38.8% (H1 FY18: 36.2%).

Cash flow
The Group's free cash flow from operations, excluding EAI, was US$456M in H1 FY19. Working capital increased by US$93M as
we established inventories at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal ahead of two longwall moves in Q3 FY19 and the timing of shipments
impacted sales at Mozal Aluminium. Provisions and other liabilities also declined as we continued to invest in progressive
rehabilitation at South Africa Energy Coal. These impacts were partially offset by movements in receivables and payables, with no
change to our payment terms with customers or suppliers. Our debtor days remained broadly unchanged at 22.

Total capital expenditure(11), excluding EAI, increased by US$104M to US$306M in H1 FY19 as Major project activity ramped up at
the Klipspruit Life Extension (KPSX) project(22) and preliminary work was undertaken to progress the Hermosa project following the
acquisition of Arizona Mining in August 2018. Total capital expenditure included:

 -  Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping
    (including underground development) of US$206M (H1 FY18: US$195M); and
 -  Major project capital expenditure of US$90M (H1 FY18: US$4M) relating to the KPSX (US$55M), Hermosa (US$33M) and
    Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal (US$2M) projects.

The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation of exploration expenditure accounted for a further US$10M (H1 FY18: US$3M).

Total capital expenditure associated with EAI increased by US$24M to US$53M during H1 FY19 as we invested in additional
tailings storage capacity at Australia Manganese.

Total capital expenditure, including EAI, in H1 FY19 was US$359M (H1 FY18: US$231M).

Balance sheet, dividends and capital management

While the Group generated free cash flow from operations, including net distributions from EAI, of US$718M
(H1 FY18: US$290M), our net cash balance decreased by US$1.4B to US$678M at 31 December 2018 (30 June 2018: US$2.0B)
as we funded the Arizona Mining and Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal transactions out of our cash reserves for a combined
investment of US$1.5B. We also paid our final shareholder dividend in respect of FY18 of US$316M and directed US$167M
towards our on-market share buy-back program as we purchased 68M shares at an average price of A$3.39 per share.

Demonstrating the disciplined and flexible approach we are taking to our capital management program, our Board resolved to pay
a fully franked interim dividend of US$258M, representing 40% of Underlying earnings in H1 FY19, and a fully franked special
dividend of US$86M. With payment of this special dividend we will have completed 87% of our US$1B capital management
program with the remaining US$127M scheduled to be returned to shareholders by 10 April 2019, depending on market liquidity
and value.

Our capital management framework remains unchanged and we continue to believe that a combination of high operating leverage
and undue financial leverage delivers a sub-optimal outcome for shareholders. With the declaration of our interim and special
dividends, this approach will allow us to return US$2.4B to shareholders in respect of the last three year period, equivalent to 20%
of our market capitalisation(23). Having established this strong track record, we will continue to return any excess capital to
shareholders in a timely and efficient manner by monitoring our financial position within the context of the prevailing
macroeconomic environment and our capital management framework.

Consistent with our commitment to maintain an investment grade credit rating, Standard and Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed their
respective BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings for the Group.

      charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and refining charges included as a separate expense). These changes result in lower realised
      prices and Operating unit costs, with no net impact to earnings. FY19 prior guidance has been adjusted from US$147/t to US$131/t to reflect these changes.
      Prior periods have not been restated to reflect these changes.

Operating unit cost guidance

Updated FY19 Operating unit cost guidance primarily reflects revised currency and price assumptions as production guidance has
been maintained for the majority of our operations. Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is the exception as an improvement in longwall
performance has underpinned a 7% increase to prior production guidance. That being said, the relative skew in production to either
H1 FY19 or H2 FY19 for a number of operations will have a meaningful impact on half-on-half unit cost performance. Separately,
Operating unit costs at our refineries will benefit from lower raw material costs in H2 FY19 as higher priced material that was held in
inventory was consumed in H1 FY19.

      revenue recognised net of treatment and refining charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and refining charges included as a separate
      expense). These changes result in lower realised prices and Operating unit costs, with no net impact to earnings.

Other expenditure guidance

FY19 guidance for Group and unallocated costs, excluding greenfield exploration, is unchanged at US$80M (H1 FY19: US$40M).
While guidance for greenfield exploration expenditure to progress our early stage projects also remains unchanged at US$41M
(H1 FY19: US$8M), we do expect to capitalise US$20M (H1 FY19: US$7M) of exploration expenditure to increase our knowledge
of the Hermosa resource(14).

Depreciation and amortisation, and tax expense

Depreciation and amortisation guidance for FY19 is unchanged at approximately US$750M (H1 FY19: US$380M), excluding EAI,
and US$85M (H1 FY19: US$44M) for our EAI. From a taxation perspective, our geographic earnings mix will have a significant
bearing on our ETR given differing country tax rates, while the impact of intragroup agreements and other permanent differences
will continue to be magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. Whilst it is therefore
difficult to predict our ETR (excluding EAI), we do expect it to decline in H2 FY19, particularly if the alumina to aluminium price ratio
falls.

Capital expenditure guidance

We have lowered FY19 guidance for Sustaining capital expenditure, including EAI, by US$30M to US$545M. This adjustment primarily
reflects appreciation of the US dollar, the lower rate of underground development at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in H1 FY19 and
additional expenditure incurred to recover from and mitigate the impact of the Klipspruit dragline incident at South Africa Energy
Coal. This incident has been confirmed as an insurable event and we are working through the claim to assess the quantum and
timing of any recovery.

Major project capital expenditure guidance for FY19 has been lowered by US$48M to US$217M. This reduction primarily reflects
the reclassification of US$20M of expenditure to capitalised exploration at Hermosa, the timing of activity at South Africa Energy Coal's KPSX
project and appreciation of the US dollar. The modest reduction in underlying activity at Hermosa from Arizona Mining's preliminary
estimate is not expected to have a bearing on the development schedule as the deferral of activity to progress the twin exploration
declines does not impact the critical path. Capital expenditure required to progress the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project (US$7M) is
also included within guidance for the first time as the transaction was concluded in the period. Major project capital expenditure
guidance does not account for the potential progression of the Dendrobium next domain project at Illawarra Metallurgical into final
feasibility in H2 FY19.

Worsley Alumina (86% share)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 41kt)
in H1 FY19 to 1,906kt as the refinery benefitted from improved
calciner availability in Q2 FY19 and three shipments of
stockpiled hydrate were sold opportunistically at alumina
equivalent rates. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged
at 3,965kt with calciner maintenance scheduled for Q3 FY19.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 4% in H1 FY19 to US$233/t
as additional calciner maintenance was undertaken and the cost
of caustic soda increased as higher priced inventory was
consumed (H1 FY19: US$535/t, H1 FY18: US$516/t), which
more than offset the impact of a weaker Australian dollar.

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by US$3/t
to US$227/t with revised exchange rate and raw material price
assumptions partially offset by additional maintenance activity
that is designed to improve calciner performance and
sustainably achieve nameplate capacity. Conversely, caustic
soda costs are expected to decline in H2 FY19 as we benefit
from the recent reduction in market prices and a fall in
consumption rates as the contribution of West Marradong feed
rises. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating
unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 110% (or US$180M) in H1 FY19
to US$344M. A 29% rise in the average realised price of
alumina (+US$188M) and a weaker Australian dollar
(+US$23M) were partially offset by additional maintenance
costs (-US$10M) and an increase in the price of caustic soda 
(-US$4M).

The average realised price for alumina sales in H1 FY19
reflected a discount of 9% to the Platts Alumina Index (PAX) on
a volume weighted M-1 basis. This discount reflects the
structure of specific legacy supply contracts with our Mozal
Aluminium smelter that are linked to the LME aluminium price
and the elevated alumina to aluminium price ratio in the spot
market. All alumina sales to other customers were at market
based prices.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$3M in H1 FY19
to US$25M and is expected to increase to US$60M in FY19 as
we commence several improvement initiatives to support a
sustainable increase in production to nameplate capacity of
4.6Mt (100% basis) and continue to invest in additional bauxite
residue disposal capacity.

(a)   H1 FY18 reflects balance as at 30 June 2018.

Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable production decreased by 6% (or 40kt) in
H1 FY19 to 636kt as unplanned maintenance and power
outages impacted performance. FY19 production is expected to
approach guidance of 1,355kt with the addition of package
boilers designed to support the ramp-up of the De-bottlenecking
Phase One project.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 24% in H1 FY19 to US$291/t
as additional maintenance costs were incurred, higher priced
caustic soda inventory was consumed and the cost of bauxite
supplied by MRN increased as the price reset to reflect the
movement in alumina and aluminium prices on a trailing basis.

While specific Operating unit cost guidance is not provided as
we are not the operator of the refinery, we do expect some relief
from recent inflationary pressure in H2 FY19 given an expected
reduction in bauxite and caustic soda costs.

Financial performance

Alumina Underlying EBIT increased by 76% (or US$45M) in
H1 FY19 to US$104M as a 36% increase in the average
realised price of alumina (+US$84M) was partially offset by
lower sales volumes (-US$11M), additional maintenance 
(-US$4M) and higher bauxite (-US$12M) and caustic soda (-US$8M) costs.

Aluminium Underlying EBIT increased by US$5M in H1 FY19 to
a loss of US$7M as an indirect legacy tax obligation was settled
and our commitment to purchase electricity from Eletronorte
was fulfilled during the prior period following termination of the
contract in December 2015.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$6M in H1 FY19 to
US$16M and is expected to increase to US$32M in FY19 as we
invest in additional bauxite residue disposal capacity.

The partners of MRN also agreed to undertake a pre-feasibility
study for a project that has the potential to extend the life of
the mine by more than 20 years at a relatively low capital
cost. MRN has a substantial 503Mt(12) high grade bauxite
resource.

(a)   H1 FY18 reflects balance as at 30 June 2018.

Hillside Aluminium (100%)

Volumes

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 2kt)
in H1 FY19 to 360kt as the smelter continued to test its
maximum technical capacity, despite an increase in the
frequency of load-shedding events. FY19 production guidance remains
unchanged at 720kt, but remains subject to load-shedding.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 29% in H1 FY19 to
US$2,161/t as a significant rise in raw material costs created
inflationary pressure across the aluminium industry. Alumina,
coke, pitch and aluminium price-linked electricity accounted for
71% of the smelter's cost base in H1 FY19 (H1 FY18: 69%).
108 pots were also relined at a cost of US$233k per pot (H1
FY18: 44 pots at US$196k per pot), while 177 pots are
scheduled to be relined across FY19 as we reach a peak in the
relining cycle.

While Operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost
profile of Hillside Aluminium will continue to be heavily
influenced by the price of power and raw material inputs, given
its highly variable cost base. The smelter sources alumina from
our Worsley Alumina refinery with prices linked to the Platts
alumina index on an M-1 basis, while its power is sourced from
Eskom under long-term contracts. The price of electricity
supplied to potlines 1 and 2 is linked to the LME aluminium price
and the South African rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price
of electricity supplied to potline 3 is South African rand based.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 133% (or US$159M) in H1 FY19
to a loss of US$39M as stronger sales volumes (+US$35M) and
lower aluminium price-linked power costs (+US$5M) were more
than offset by higher raw material input costs (-US$136M), an
increase in pot relining costs (-US$16M) and an unfavourable
movement in inventory (-US$50M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure remained largely unchanged in
H1 FY19 at US$12M and is expected to increase to US$18M in
FY19.

Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium saleable production decreased by 1% (or 2kt)
in H1 FY19 to 135kt as the smelter's operating performance
was impacted by an increase in the frequency of load-shedding
events. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 269kt,
subject to load-shedding, whilst the shortfall in sales volumes in
H1 FY19 simply reflects timing differences.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 14% in H1 FY19 to
US$1,938/t as a significant rise in raw material input costs
created inflationary pressure across the aluminium industry.
Alumina, coke and pitch accounted for 53% of the smelter's cost
base in H1 FY19 (H1 FY18: 48%). 40(33) pots were also relined 
across H1 FY19 at a cost of US$219k per pot (H1 FY18: 34(33) pots 
at US$191k per pot), with 103(33) pots scheduled to be relined in 
FY19 as we reach a peak in the relining cycle.

While Operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost
profile of Mozal Aluminium will continue to be heavily influenced
by the price of power and raw material inputs, given its highly
variable cost base. The smelter sources alumina from our
Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a
percentage of the LME aluminium index under a legacy contract
and the remainder linked to the Platts alumina index on an M-1
basis, with caps and floors embedded within specific contracts.
Its electricity requirements are largely met by hydroelectric
power that is generated by Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa(HCB).

HCB delivers power into Eskom's South African grid and Mozal
Aluminium sources electricity via the Mozambique Transmission
Company (Motraco) under a long-term contract. The price of
electricity is South African rand based with the rate of escalation
linked to a South Africa domestic producer price index.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 78% (or US$47M) in H1 FY19 to
US$13M as lower sales volumes (-US$40M) and higher raw
material costs (-US$29M) were partially offset by a build in
finished goods (+US$28M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure was unchanged in
H1 FY19 at US$8M as the US$18M AP3XLE energy efficiency
project commenced the roll out of its pot relining program ahead
of schedule. The project is expected to deliver a circa 5%
(or 10kt pa) increase in annual production with no associated
increase in power consumption. First incremental production is
anticipated in FY20, with the full benefit to be realised by FY24.
Sustaining capital expenditure of US$20M is anticipated in
FY19.

South Africa Energy Coal (92% share(25))

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9%
(or 1,252kt) in H1 FY19 to 12.2Mt as export production was
impacted by the dragline incident at Klipspruit in August 2018.
Conversely, domestic production benefitted from the
commencement of a contract to sell lower quality stockpiled
product in Q1 FY19.

FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 29Mt
(17.5Mt domestic, 11.5Mt export), with the recommissioning of
the Klipspruit dragline in January 2019 underpinning an
increase in export volumes in H2 FY19. Domestic volumes are
also expected to benefit from a further increase in the sale of
lower quality stockpiled product and the implementation of a
new shift pattern at Khutala.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 6% in H1 FY19 to US$38/t as
the impact of the extended dragline outage more than offset a
weaker South African rand.

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by US$3/t
to US$38/t to reflect the dragline's return to service ahead of
schedule and revised exchange rate and price assumptions.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit
cost guidance are detailed in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 88% (or US$101M) in H1 FY19
to US$14M as lower sales volumes (-US$134M), a drawdown in
inventory associated with the extended dragline outage
(-US$10M), higher depreciation (-US$10M) and general inflation
(-US$24M) were only partially offset by higher average realised
prices (+US$39M), a volume related reduction in rail costs
(+US$22M) and a weaker South African rand (+US$18M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by US$20M in
H1 FY19 to US$48M. FY19 guidance has been increased by
US$34M to US$100M as additional expenditure has been
incurred to recover from and mitigate the impact of the
Klipspruit dragline incident. This incident has been 
confirmed as an insurable event and we are working through
the claim to assess the quantum and timing of any recovery.

We also invested US$55M in Major project capital expenditure
in H1 FY19 to progress the 4.3B(22) South African rand KPSX
project, which was approved by the Board in November 2017.
The 8Mt per annum brownfield project extends the life of the
colliery by more than 20 years(34). The project is approximately
33% complete and remains on schedule and budget, with first
production expected in H2 FY19. Major project expenditure of
US$140M is expected in FY19.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100% share)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by
106% (or 1,980kt) in H1 FY19 to 3.8Mt as the Dendrobium 
and Appin longwalls performed strongly. Metallurgical coal
stockpiles were also established during H1 FY19 in advance of
the two longwall moves scheduled in Q3 FY19. FY19 production
guidance has been increased by 7% to 6.5Mt to reflect the
strong start to the year.

We also reached agreement with employees covered by the
Dendrobium Coal Prep Plant Enterprise Agreement in January
2019, having previously reached agreement with the
Dendrobium mine's trades and operators, and Appin deputies
during H1 FY19. We continue to renegotiate the remaining
labour agreements at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 42% in H1 FY19 to US$87/t
as the operation benefitted from a substantial increase in sales
volumes.

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by US$8/t
to US$97/t to reflect the increase in production guidance and
revised exchange rate and price assumptions. Notwithstanding
this reduction in FY19 guidance, costs are expected to increase
in H2 FY19 as a result of the planned longwall moves.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit
cost guidance are detailed in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$279M in H1 FY19 to
US$195M as stronger sales volumes (+US$327M) and a
weaker Australian dollar (+US$20M) were partially offset by an
increase in price-linked royalties (-US$22M) and depreciation 
(-US$18M). The volume related impact on costs (-US$41M) was
tempered by the high fixed cost base of the operation.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$16M in H1
FY19 to US$56M as underground development progressively
recovered at Appin, albeit at a slower rate than planned.
A substantial uplift in development rates is required to sustain
the operation of two longwalls in parallel from H2 FY20.

Sustaining capital expenditure guidance for FY19 has been
reduced by US$42M to US$128M, including underground
development of US$75M (US$97M previously).

Australia Manganese (60% share)

Volumes

Australia Manganese achieved record ore performance in
H1 FY19, increasing saleable ore production by 6% (or
110kwmt) to 1,811kwmt. The primary circuit continued to
achieve high utilisation rates, while the PC02 circuit operated at
approximately 120% of its design capacity, contributing 9% of
total production. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged
at 3,350kwmt, with the wet season expected to impact
production across H2 FY19.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 7% (or 6kt)
in H1 FY19 to 76kt as a result of an unplanned outage at one of
the four furnaces during Q2 FY19. While the furnace has
subsequently returned to service, additional maintenance is
planned for H2 FY19.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs decreased by 3% in
H1 FY19 to US$1.51/dmtu as record performance mitigated a
further increase in strip ratio (H1 FY19: 4.1, H1 FY18: 3.6).

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by
US$0.06/dmtu to US$1.57/dmtu to reflect the continued
improvement in equipment productivity and revised exchange
rate and price assumptions. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are detailed
in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 18% (or US$53M) in H1 FY19 to
US$352M as higher realised ore prices (+US$45M), an
increase in ore sales volumes (+US$28M) and a weaker
Australian dollar (+US$9M) were only partially offset by lower
realised alloy prices (-US$9M) and a rise in raw material and
freight costs (-US$10M).

Our average realised price for external ore sales in
H1 FY19 reflected the high grade 44% manganese lump ore
index (CIF China) on a FOB adjusted, volume weighted
M-1 basis(37), despite the higher contribution of 40% grade
PC02 product to the sales mix.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$15M in H1
FY19 to US$36M as we invested in additional tailings capacity.
Sustaining capital expenditure of US$65M is anticipated in
FY19.

(a)   H1 FY18 reflects balance as at 30 June 2018.

South Africa Manganese (Ore 44.4% share, Alloy 60% share)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by
5% (or 54kwmt) in H1 FY19 to 1,075kwmt as an increase in
higher quality premium material was more than offset by a
decline in fine grained secondary products. While FY19
production guidance remains unchanged at 2,050kwmt, we will
continue to monitor market demand and optimise the use of
higher cost trucking.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 8% (or 3kt)
in H1 FY19 to 33kt as a planned furnace shutdown was
completed.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs increased by 14% in
H1 FY19 to US$2.63/dmtu as we continued to utilise higher cost
trucking as an additional route to market and the contribution of
premium ore from our underground Wessels mine increased.

FY19 Operating unit cost guidance is unchanged at
US$2.56/dmtu. Exchange rate and price assumptions for
FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 16% (or US$14M) in H1 FY19 to
US$100M as higher realised ore prices (+US$43M) and a
weaker South African rand (+US$6M) were partially offset by
lower realised alloy prices (-US$8M), a reduction in other
income (-US$11M) and general inflation (-US$5M).

Our lower quality fine grained material, which accounted for
10% of sales across H1 FY19 (15% H1 FY18; 13% FY18),
receives a product discount when referenced to index prices.
Notwithstanding the contribution of this secondary material to
our sales mix, our average realised price for external sales of
South African ore achieved the medium grade 37%
manganese lump ore index price (FOB Port Elizabeth, South
Africa) on a volume weighted M-1 basis(42).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$9M in H1 FY19
to US$17M and is expected to increase to US$30M in FY19.

Cerro Matoso (99.9% share)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production decreased by 3%
(or 0.7kt) in H1 FY19 to 21.1kt following a planned increase in
the contribution of lower grade stockpiled ore feed. FY19
production guidance remains unchanged at 40.5kt.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 19% in H1 FY19 to
US$4.05/lb, primarily as a result of higher price-linked royalties
and energy costs.

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by
US$0.09/lb to US$4.12/lb to primarily reflect the benefit of
revised exchange rate and price assumptions, which are
partially offset by costs arising from the Constitutional Court of
Colombia ruling(30). Exchange rate and price assumptions for
FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$31M in H1 FY19 to US$10M
as higher price-linked royalties (-US$8M), energy costs
(-US$8M), general inflation (-US$4M) and throughput
(-US$3M) were partially offset by a weaker Colombian peso
(+US$3M).

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Nickel
sales decreased Underlying EBIT by US$16M in H1 FY19
(+US$19M FY18; +US$5M H1 FY18). Outstanding Nickel sales
(3.3kt of nickel) were revalued at 31 December 2018. The final
price of these sales will be determined in H2 FY19.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased marginally to US$13M
in H1 FY19 and is expected to increase to US$37M in FY19 as we
prepare for the planned furnace refurbishment in FY20.

Cannington (100% share)

Volumes

Cannington payable zinc equivalent(26) production increased
by 11% (or 9.8kt) in H1 FY19 to 95.2kt as silver and zinc
grades improved and mill throughput tracked to plan. FY19
zinc equivalent production guidance is unchanged at 188.1kt
(silver 11,750koz, lead 98.0kt and zinc 51.0kt), but remains
subject to review pending our assessment of the impact to
logistics infrastructure resulting from the floods in North
Queensland.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 29% to US$120/t in H1 FY19
as the adoption of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers(19), which affects the accounting classification of
treatment and refining charges, reduced costs by US$21/t.
A temporary build in finished goods inventory and stronger
throughput rates provided a further benefit.

We have lowered FY19 Operating unit cost guidance by US$2/t
to US$129/t(a) to reflect the benefit of revised exchange rate and
price assumptions, which are partially offset by an increase in
mining and rehabilitation activity. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are detailed
in footnote 29.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 35% (or US$25M) in H1 FY19 to
US$47M as lower average realised prices (-US$61M)(b) were
partially offset by inventory movements (+US$13M), a weaker
Australian dollar (+US$10M) and higher sales volumes
(+US$8M).

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of
Cannington concentrates decreased Underlying EBIT by
US$9.8M in H1 FY19 (US$0.1M FY18; US$5.5M H1 FY18).
Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2Moz of silver,
25.3kt of lead and 6.2kt of zinc) were revalued at 31
December 2018. The final price of these sales will be
determined in H2 FY19.

(a)   FY19 Prior guidance has been adjusted from US$147/t to US$131/t to
      reflect the Group's adoption of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with
      Customers, with revenue recognised net of treatment and refining
      charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and
      refining charges included as a separate expense). These changes result
      in lower realised prices and Operating unit costs, with no net impact to
      earnings. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect the changes.
(b)   Excludes the impact of the change in accounting treatment for treatment
      and refining charges on revenue (-US$20M). This impact is equally
      offset by a reduction in costs (+US$20M).
(c)   H1 FY18 reflects balance as at 30 June 2018.

Notes

(1)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products and services.

(2)   H1 FY19 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY19 (5,079 million).
      H1 FY19 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY19.
      H1 FY18 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY18 (5,191 million).
      H1 FY18 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY18.

(3)   H1 FY19 ordinary dividends per share is calculated as H1 FY19 ordinary dividend announced (US$258M) divided by the number of shares on issue at
      31 December 2018 (5,051 million).

(4)   H1 FY19 special dividends per share is calculated as H1 FY19 special dividend announced (US$86M) divided by the number of shares on issue at
      31 December 2018 (5,051 million). Paragraph 16.26(i) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listing rules states that the requisite exchange control authority
      from the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is required to be provided to the JSE before the JSE can approve payment
      of special dividends to South African shareholders.

(5)   Underlying EBIT is profit before net finance costs, tax and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments. Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of
      South32's share of net finance costs and tax of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation.
      Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after tax and earnings adjustment items. Underlying earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to assess the performance
      of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the
      South32 operations and operational management are assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and
      Underlying EBITDA, the following items are adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:
     
       -   Exchange rate (gains)/losses on restatement of monetary items;
       -   Impairment losses/(reversals);
       -   Net (gains)/losses on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;
       -   Fair value (gains)/losses on non-trading derivative instruments and other investments;
       -   Major corporate restructures; and
       -   Earnings adjustments included in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments.
    
      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to
      determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.

(6)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(7)   Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(8)   Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as annualised Underlying EBIT
      less the discount on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), divided by the 
      sum of fixed assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and unproductive capital spent on Major projects) and inventories. Manganese is included 
      in the calculation on a proportional consolidation basis.

(9)   To ensure that incident classification definitions are applied uniformly across our workforce, we have adopted the United States Government Occupational Safety
      and Health Assessment (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses.

(10)  Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF): The sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases) x 1,000,000
      ÷ actual hours worked, for employees and contractors. Stated in units of per million hours worked.

(11)  Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure comprises
      Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB), Minor discretionary and
      Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.

(12)  The information in this report that relates to Mineral Resource estimates for MRN was declared as part of South32's Annual Resource and Reserve declaration in
      the Annual Report 2018 (www.south32.net) issued on 7 September 2018 and prepared by M A H Monteiro in accordance with the requirements of the JORC Code.
      South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original announcement. All material
      assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed.
      South32 confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market
      announcement.

(14)  The information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa Project are qualifying foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and reference
      should be had to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement 'South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer' dated 18
      June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially
      impacts on the reliability of the estimates. South32 confirms that the information contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement
      continues to apply and has not materially changed. The estimates of Mineral Resources are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. Competent persons
      have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and
      further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code.

(15)  Refer to media release on 14 September 2018 ""South32 completes acquisition of 50% interest in Eagle Downs and assumes operatorship"".

(16)  Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs variance reflects
      the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded consumables. Foreign exchange reflects
      the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance reflects the revenue impact of sales volume changes,
      based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the impact from changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost
      base, including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on expenditure, and period-on-period movements in inventories. The controllable cost
      variance excludes earnings adjustments including significant items.

(17)  Underlying net finance cost and Underlying income tax expense are actual H1 FY19 results, not half-on-half variances.

(18)  South32's ownership share of operations are presented as follows: Worsley Alumina (86% share), Hillside Aluminium (100%), Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share),
      Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share), South Africa Energy Coal (100% share until Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)
      vendor loans are repaid), Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100%), Australia Manganese (60% share), South Africa Manganese (60% share), Cerro Matoso (99.9%
      share), and Cannington (100%).

(19)  The H1 FY19 results reflect the Group's adoption of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with revenue recognised net of treatment and refining
      charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and refining charges included as a separate expense). These changes result in lower realised
      prices and Operating unit costs, with no net impact to earnings. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect these changes.

(20)  Underlying ETR is Underlying income tax expense, excluding royalty related tax, divided by Underlying profit before tax; both the numerator and denominator
      exclude equity accounted investments.

(21)  The Colombian corporate tax rate was 40% during CY17, 37% during CY18 and is 33% in CY19. The corporate tax rate will decrease on an annual basis by a
      percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues instead of income tax.

(22)  Refer to the market announcement ""South32 approves Klipspruit Life Extension Project"" dated 27 November 2017.

(23)  Market capitalisation as at 31 December 2018. Calculated as the number of shares on issue (5,051 million), the South32 closing share price A$3.35, and an
      AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.71.

(24)  Based on revenue equivalent sales or production (where applicable) which assumes average realised prices remain unchanged from FY18. Figures are converted
      to per share basis by dividing FY18 and FY19e revenue equivalent sales or production (where applicable) by the weighted average number of shares for
      FY18 (5,159 million) and H1 FY19 (5,079 million) respectively.

(25)  South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are repaid.

(26)  Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating revenues from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY18
      realised prices for zinc (US$3,185/t), lead (US$2,463/t) and silver (US$16.6/oz) have been used for FY18, FY19e and FY20e. Zinc equivalent is used to compare
      Cannington with the recently acquired Hermosa project which is currently reported in zinc equivalent terms.

(27)  Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, excluding third party sales, divided by sales volumes. Operating cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA
      excluding third party sales. Additional manganese disclosures are included in footnotes 39 and 44.

(28)  FY19 prior Operating unit cost guidance included royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and were predicated on various
      assumptions for FY19, including: an alumina price of US$411/t; an average blended coal price of US$149/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price
      of US$6.20/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$6.92/lb; a thermal coal price of US$93/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of
      US$17.58/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,406/t; a zinc price of US$3,066/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.76; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 13.43; a USD:COP
      exchange rate of 2,927; and a reference price for caustic soda; all of which reflected forward markets as at June 2018 or our internal expectations.

(29)  FY19 new Operating unit cost guidance includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and includes various assumptions for FY19,
      including: an alumina price of US$443/t; an average blended coal price of US$173/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$6.58/dmtu for
      44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$5.47/lb; a thermal coal price of US$92/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$15.06/troy oz; a
      lead price of US$2,023/t (gross of treatment and refining charges); a zinc price of US$2,587/t (gross of treatment and refining charges); an AUD:USD exchange
      rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.02; a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,096; and a reference price for caustic soda; all of which reflected forward
      markets as at January 2019 or our internal expectations.

(30)  On 24 September 2018, we announced that the Constitutional Court of Colombia had issued its final ruling on our application to annul its decision regarding the
      alleged health and environmental impacts of our Cerro Matoso operation on the surrounding communities. The Court annulled those orders requiring Cerro Matoso
      to pay direct financial compensatory damages to community members and establish an ethnic development fund. The orders requiring Cerro Matoso to provide
      ongoing health care to community members alleging health impacts, and to submit to a new consultative environmental licensing process, were not annulled.

(31)  Third party products and services sold comprise US$33M for aluminium, US$16M for alumina, US$241M for coal, US$129M for freight services, US$61M for
      aluminium raw materials and US$7M for manganese. Underlying EBIT on third party products comprise nil for aluminium, US$3M for alumina, US$27M for coal,
      (-US$3M) for freight services, US$1M for aluminium raw materials and nil for manganese.

(32)  Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales
      Revenue divided by sales volume.

(33)  Presented on a 100% basis.

(34)  The information in this report that relates to Coal Reserve estimates for Klipspruit was declared as part of South32's Annual Resource and Reserve declaration in
      the Annual Report 2018 (www.south32.net) issued on 7 September 2018 and prepared by P Mulder in accordance with the requirements of the JORC Code.
      South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original announcement. All material
      assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed.
      South32 confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market
      announcement.

(35)  South Africa Energy Coal Revenue includes domestic and export sales Revenue.

(36)  Illawarra Metallurgical Coal Revenue includes metallurgical coal and energy coal sales Revenue.

(37)  The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on the basis of a one month lag to
      published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$6.98/dmtu in H1 FY19.

(38)  Volumes and realised prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised ore prices are calculated
      as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by external sales volume. Realised alloy prices are calculated as sales Revenue, including
      sinter Revenue, divided by alloy sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction.

(39)  Manganese Australia H1 FY19 average manganese content of external ore sales was 45.8% on a dry basis (H1 FY18: 46.1%). 95% of H1 FY19 external
      manganese ore sales (H1 FY18: 94%) were completed on a CIF basis. H1 FY19 realised FOB ore prices and Operating unit costs have been adjusted for freight
      and marketing costs of US$25M (H1 FY18: US$21M), consistent with our FOB cost guidance.

(40)  FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit cost is Revenue
      less Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes and includes costs associated with sinter sold externally.

(41)  Revenues associated with sales from GEMCO to TEMCO are eliminated as part of the consolidation. Internal sales occur on a commercial basis.

(42)  The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on the basis of a one month
      lag to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$5.91/dmtu in H1 FY19.

(43)  Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised ore prices are calculated as
      external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by external sales volume. Realised alloy prices are calculated as sales Revenue, divided by 
      alloy sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction. Manganese ore sales are 
      grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.

(44)  Manganese South Africa H1 FY19 average manganese content of external ore sales was 40.3% on a dry basis (H1 FY18: 40.3%). 71% of H1 FY19 external
      manganese ore sales (H1 FY18: 68%) were completed on a CIF basis. H1 FY19 realised FOB ore prices and operating costs have been adjusted for freight and
      marketing costs of US$20M (H1 FY18: US$16M), consistent with our FOB cost guidance.

(45)  FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit cost is Revenue
      less Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes.

(46)  Revenues associated with sales from Hotazel Manganese Mines (HMM) to Metalloys are eliminated as part of the consolidation. Internal sales occur on a
      commercial basis.

(47)  Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%. South32 has a
      44.4% ownership interest in HMM. 26% of HMM is owned by a B-BBEE consortium comprising Ntsimbintle Mining (9%), NCAB Resources (7%), Iziko Mining (5%)
      and HMM Education Trust (5%). The interest owned by NCAB Resources, Iziko Mining and HMM Education Trust were acquired using vendor finance with the
      loans repayable via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in HMM. Until these loans are repaid, South32's interest in HMM is accounted
      at 54.6%.

(48)  Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Cerro Matoso realised nickel sales price is
      inclusive of by-products. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume.

(49)  Cannington Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact
      operating unit costs as related marketing costs may change.

Figures in Italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
The consolidated financial statements of South32 Limited (referred to as the Company) and its subsidiaries and joint arrangements
(collectively, the Group) for the half year ended 31 December 2018 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the
Directors on 14 February 2019.

1. Reporting entity
   South32 Limited is a for-profit company limited by shares incorporated in Australia with a primary listing on the Australian Securities
   Exchange (ASX), a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
   The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in note 4 Segment information.

2. Basis of preparation
   The half year consolidated financial statements are a general purpose condensed financial report which:

  -  Have been prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the
     Corporations Act
  -  Have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and
     liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value
  -  Are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the majority of the Group's operations, and all values are
     rounded to the nearest million dollars (US$M or US$ million) unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations
     Instrument 2016/191
  -  Present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current period's presentation
  -  Have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30
     June 2018 annual consolidated financial statements, except for the change in accounting standards set out in note 3 New
     standards and interpretations which became effective on 1 July 2018 without restatement of prior years
   
   In preparing these half year consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions
   that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
   results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting

3. New standards and interpretations
   New accounting standards and interpretations effective from 1 July 2018
   The Group has changed some of its accounting policies as a result of new or revised accounting standards which became effective
   for the annual reporting period commencing on 1 July 2018. New policies and standards are:
   
   AASB 9 Financial Instruments

   The Group has adopted AASB 9 Financial Instruments with a date of initial application of 1 July 2018. The nature and impact of the
   key changes to the Group's accounting policies resulting from the adoption of AASB 9 are summarised below.

   (i) Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities

   AASB 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through Other
   Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of a financial asset is based on
   the cash flow characteristics and the business model used for the management of the financial asset. AASB 9 eliminates the
   previous AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement financial asset classification of held to maturity, loans
   and receivables and available for sale.

   The adoption of AASB 9 has not had a significant impact on the Group's accounting policies for financial liabilities as
   AASB 9 largely retains the existing requirements in AASB 139 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.

   (ii) Impairment of financial assets

   AASB 9 replaces the 'incurred loss' model in AASB 139 with an expected credit loss model. The new impairment model applies to
   financial assets measured at amortised cost, contract assets and debt investments classified as FVOCI, but not to investments in
   equity instruments. Under AASB 9, credit losses are recognised earlier than under AASB 139.

   (iii) Transition

   For transition, the Group has elected to apply the limited exemption in AASB 9 relating to the classification, measurement and
   impairment requirements for financial assets and accordingly has not restated comparative periods. Any resulting adjustments to
   carrying values in the opening balance sheet have been recognised in opening retained earnings as at 1 July 2018.
   
   The following table summarises the impact, net of tax, of transition to AASB 9 on retained earnings at 1 July 2018.

   (1) Trade and other receivables and loans to equity accounted investments are reduced by the recognition of an impairment provision as a result of applying the
       expected credit loss model under AASB 9, US$1 million each. The impact was recognised in opening retained earnings at 1 July 2018 on transition to AASB 9.
   (2) Investments in equity instruments designated as FVOCI represent investments that the Group intends to hold for long-term strategic purposes. As permitted by
       AASB 9, on an instrument by instrument basis, the Group has elected to designate these investments as held at FVOCI at the date of initial application.
   (3) Other investments held at FVTPL which were previously classified as available for sale, are not equity instruments and are therefore unable to be designated as
       investments held at FVOCI.

   AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
   The Group adopted AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 July 2018 using the modified retrospective approach
   where transitional adjustments are recognised in retained earnings. Therefore, the comparative information has not been restated
   and continues to be reported under AASB 118 Revenue.
   
   The impact of the change in accounting policy did not have a material impact on the amount of revenue recognised as the transfer
   of risk and rewards under AASB 118 is equivalent with the fulfilment of the performance obligation to deliver commodities. Any
   differences arising from freight services for Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) contracts are immaterial in the current and
   comparative periods.
   
   Revenue will be recognised net of treatment and refining charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and
   refining charges included as a separate expense).

4. Segment information
   (a) Description of segments

   The operating segments (also referred to as operations), are organised and managed separately according to the nature of
   products produced.

   Certain members of the Lead Team (the chief operating decision makers) and the Board of Directors monitor the segment results
   regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The segment information for
   the manganese operations are presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the measure used by the Group's
   management to assess their performance.

   The principal activities of each operating segment as the Group is currently structured are summarised as follows:

   All operations are operated or jointly operated by the Group except Brazil Alumina, which is operated by Alcoa.

   (b) Segment results
   Segment performance is measured by Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBIT is profit before net finance cost,
   tax and other earnings adjustment items including impairments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and
   amortisation. A reconciliation of Underlying EBIT, Underlying EBITDA and the Group's consolidated profit after tax is set out on the
   following pages. Segment revenue is measured on the same basis as in the Consolidated Income Statement.

   The Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the significant difference in
   profit margin earned on these sales.

   It is the Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.

   Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group financing
   (including finance expense and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to
   operating segments.

   Total assets and liabilities for each operating segment represent operating assets and liabilities which predominantly exclude the
   carrying amount of equity accounted investments, cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances. The carrying amount of
   investments accounted for using the equity method represents the balance of the Group's investment in equity accounted
   investments, with no adjustment for cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances of the equity accounted investment.

   Revenue recognition policy applicable from 1 July 2018

   The Group has applied AASB 15 using the modified retrospective method. The impact of changes in accounting standards are
   disclosed in note 3 New standards and interpretations.

   Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on
   behalf of third parties. Revenue is not reduced for royalties and other taxes payable from group production.

   The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Group generates its revenue.

   Revenue from the sale of commodities
   The Group primarily sells the following commodities: alumina, aluminium, energy coal, metallurgical coal, manganese ore,
   manganese alloy, ferronickel, silver, lead and zinc. The sales of these commodities are considered to be performance obligations
   as they are the contractual promises by the Group, to transfer distinct goods to customers.

   The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognised as the performance obligation is satisfied. Satisfaction
   occurs when control of the promised commodity is transferred to the customer.

   For the sale of commodities, revenue is therefore recognised at a point in time, net of treatment and refining charges (where
   applicable). The majority of the Group's sales agreements specify that title passes on the bill of lading date, which is the date the
   commodity is delivered to the shipping agent, and the Group no longer has control over the commodity. For these sales, revenue is
   recognised on the bill of lading date. For certain sales (principally energy coal sales to adjoining power stations), title passes, and
   revenue is recognised when the goods have been delivered.

   For certain commodities, the sales price is determined on a provisional basis at the date of sale and adjustments to the sales price
   subsequently occur based on movements in quoted market or contractual prices up to the date of final pricing. The period between
   provisional invoicing and final pricing is up to 180 days. Revenue on provisionally priced sales is recognised based on the
   estimated fair value of the total consideration receivable. The revenue adjustment mechanism embedded within provisionally priced
   sales arrangements has the characteristics of a commodity derivative. Accordingly, the fair value of the final sales price adjustment
   is re-estimated continuously and changes in fair value are disclosed separately as 'Other' revenue. In all cases, fair value is
   estimated by reference to forward market prices.

   Revenue from the provision of freight services
   The Group sells most of its commodities on either Free On Board (FOB) or CIF Incoterms. In the case of CIF Incoterms, the Group
   is responsible for shipping services after the date at which control of the commodities passes to the customer at the port of loading.
   The provision of shipping services in these types of arrangements are a distinct service (and therefore a separate performance
   obligation) to which a portion of the transaction price should be allocated and recognised over time as the shipping services are
   provided. The Group also provides third party freight services which are recognised as the shipping service is provided.

   The Group does not disclose sales revenue from freight services separately as it does not consider this necessary in order to
   understand the impact of economic factors on the Group.

(1) The segment information reflects the Group's interest in the manganese operations and is presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the measure used by the Group's management to 
    assess their performance. The manganese operations are equity accounted in the half year consolidated financial statements. The statutory adjustment column reconciles the proportional consolidation
    to the equity accounting position.
(2) Revenue from customers is presented net of treatment and refining charges (previously recognised on a gross basis with treatment and refining charges included as a separate expense). 
    Refer to note 3 New standards and interpretations.
(3) Third party products and services sold comprise US$33 million for aluminium, US$16 million for alumina, US$241 million for coal, US$129 million for freight services and US$61 million for 
    aluminium raw materials. Underlying EBIT on third party products and services comprise nil for aluminium, US$3 million for alumina, US$27 million for coal, (US$3) million for freight services 
    and US$1 million for aluminium raw materials.
(4) Share of profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments includes the impact of earnings adjustments to Underlying EBIT.

(1) The segment information reflects the Group's interest in the manganese operations and is presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the measure used by the Group's management to assess 
    their performance. The manganese operations are equity accounted in the half year consolidated financial statements. The statutory adjustment column reconciles the proportional consolidation to the equity 
    accounting position.
(2) A portion of Group production may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised. For the half year ended 31 December 2017 there was no requirement under AASB 118 to separate out and disclose 
    provisional price movements. Presentation of revenue is gross of treatment and refining charges.
(3) Third party products and services sold comprise US$148 million for aluminium, US$48 million for alumina, US$128 million for coal, US$85 million for freight services and US$54 million for aluminium raw 
    materials. Underlying EBIT on third party products and services comprise US$6 million for aluminium, nil for alumina, nil for coal, (US$1) million for freight services and nil for aluminium raw materials.

   Basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are calculated based on profit attributable to equity holders of South32 Limited and the
   weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

   Dilutive EPS amounts are calculated based on profit attributable to equity holders of South32 Limited and the weighted average
   number of shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential shares.

Investments in equity instruments - designated as FVOCI
At 1 July 2018, on an instrument by instrument basis, the Group has elected under AASB 9 to designate investments in equity
instruments as FVOCI as they represent investments that the Group intends to hold for long-term strategic purposes. In FY18 these
investments were classified as available for sale (refer to note 3 New standards and interpretations).

Other investments - held at FVTPL
The investment in unit trusts held by the South32 South Africa Energy Coal Rehabilitation Trust Fund does not meet the definition
of an equity instrument under AASB 9. These investments are therefore classified as investments held at FVTPL (FY18: Available
for sale). On transition to AASB 9 (1 July 2018), a net gain of US$12 million was transferred from the financial asset reserve to
retained earnings.

Measurement of fair value
The following table shows the Group's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the nature of valuation
inputs used:

Level 1 Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.
Level 2 Valuation is based on inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are observable for the financial asset or
        liability, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 Valuation includes inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity analysis
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are calculated
using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity prices, foreign
exchange rates and inflation. The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in these models, based on
changes in the most significant inputs by 10 per cent while holding all other variables constant, is shown in the following table.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Half-year Financial State ents 

The Directors of the Company are responsible for:

-   the preparation of the Half-year Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
    Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
-   such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the Half-year 
    Financial Statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility for the review of the Half-year Financial Statements     

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Half-year Financial Statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a 
Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis 
of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the Half-year 
Financial Statements are not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true
fair view of the Group's financial position as at 31 December 2018 and its performance for the half-year 
ended on that date; and complying with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and 
the Corporations Regulations 2001. As auditor of South32 Limited, ASHE 2410 requires that we comply with the 
ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual Financial Report. 

A review of Half-year Financial Statements consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters 
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 

In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.

Corporate Update
•    The process to transform the ownership of South Africa Energy Coal progressed in the December 2018 quarter with binding
     bids expected in the June 2019 half year.
•    We received net distributions[note 1] of US$262M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI)
     during the December 2018 half year as achieved prices continued to reflect the respective ore indices[note 2].
•    In accordance with our disciplined capital management framework we paid our US$316M final dividend in respect of FY18 in
     October 2018 and purchased a further 68M shares for a cash consideration of US$167M during the December 2018 half year.
     To 31 December 2018, we had completed 79% of our US$1B capital management program, having paid a US$154M special
     dividend on 5 April 2018 and purchased 272M shares at a volume weighted average price of A$3.09 per share
     through our on-market share buy-back.
•    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 34%[note 3],
     Mozambique 0%[note 3] and Brazil 34%. The disproportionate effect of permanent differences can, however, impact the
     Effective Tax Rate (ETR) of the Group when margins are compressed, or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions given
     these differential tax rates and intragroup agreements. For this reason, we now expect the Group's ETR (excluding EAI) 
     for the   December 2018 half year to increase to between 35% and 40%. This rate is expected to decline in the June 2019 
     half year, particularly if the alumina to aluminium price ratio falls from its currently elevated level. Separately, 
     the Group made tax payments totalling US$207M (excluding EAI) during the December 2018 half year.

(a)   H1 FY19 realised prices for Cannington reflect the Group's adoption of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
      Customers, with revenue recognised net of treatment and refining charges, which will no longer be treated 
      as an expense item. These changes result in lower realised prices and Operating unit costs, with no
      net impact to earnings. Prior period realised prices have not been restated to reflect these changes.

Development and Exploration Update
•     We remain on track to declare a Mineral Resource [note 11] for the Hermosa project in accordance with the 
      JORC Code during the June 2019 half year.
•     We completed our review of the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project's development plan during the December 2018 quarter
      and commenced the feasibility study ahead of a final investment decision scheduled for H2 CY20.
•     We invested US$26.9M in exploration programs during the December 2018 half year, of which US$10.6M was capitalised
      (including US$0.9M for our EAI) and US$7.9M was directed to our portfolio of high quality, early stage greenfield

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 41kt) to 1,906kt in the December 2018 half year as the refinery
benefitted from improved calciner availability in the December 2018 quarter and three shipments of stockpiled hydrate were sold
opportunistically at alumina equivalent rates. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,965kt with calciner maintenance
scheduled for the March 2019 quarter.
The average realised price for alumina sales in the December 2018 half year was a discount of approximately 10% to the Platts
Alumina Index (PAX)[note 12] on a volume weighted M-1 basis. This discount reflects the structure of specific legacy supply
contracts with our Mozal Aluminium smelter that are linked to the LME aluminium price and the elevated alumina to aluminium price
ratio in the spot market. All alumina sales to other customers were at market based prices.

Mozal Aluminium saleable production decreased by 1% (or 2kt) to 135kt in the December 2018 half year as the smelter's operating
performance was impacted by an increase in the frequency of load-shedding events. Aluminium sales decreased by 12% with the
scheduling of shipments between periods resulting in a temporary build of finished goods inventory during the
December 2018 half year. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 269kt.

Notwithstanding the smelters strong operating performance, higher prices for alumina and still elevated prices for pitch and coke
continue to impact its cost base and erode operating margin. The smelter sources alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with
approximately 50% of its requirements priced as a percentage of the LME aluminium index, providing it with some relief during the
December 2018 half year.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 1,252kt) to 12.2Mt in the December 2018 half year. Export
production was impacted by the dragline incident at Klipspruit in August 2018, while domestic production benefitted from the
commencement of a contract to sell lower quality stockpiled product in the June 2018 quarter.

FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 29Mt (17.5Mt domestic, 11.5Mt Export), with the Klipspruit dragline expected to
return to service by the end of January, underpinning an increase in export volumes in the June 2019 half year. Domestic volumes
are also expected to benefit from a further increase in the sale of lower quality stockpiled product and implementation of a new 
shift pattern at Khutala.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 106% (or 1,980kt) to 3.8Mt in the December 2018 half year as the
Dendrobium and Appin longwalls continued to perform strongly. Metallurgical coal stockpiles were also established during the
period in advance of two longwall moves scheduled for the March 2019 quarter.

We reached agreement with employees covered by the Dendrobium Mine Trades and Operators Enterprise Agreement during the
December 2018 quarter, having previously reached agreement with the Dendrobium and Appin Deputies. We continue to
renegotiate the remaining labour agreements at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and this process is being closely managed.

FY19 production guidance has been increased by 7% to 6.5Mt, however a substantial uplift in development rates at Appin is
required to sustain the operation of two longwalls in parallel from H2 FY20. This uplift in production guidance is expected to 
result in a commensurate reduction in our FY19 Operating unit cost guidance, on the basis of constant currency and price 
assumptions.

Australia Manganese achieved record ore performance in the December 2018 half year, increasing saleable ore production by 6%
(or 110kwmt) to 1,811kwmt. The primary circuit continued to achieve high utilisation rates, while the Premium Concentrate Ore

guidance remains unchanged at 3,350kwmt, with the wet season expected to impact production across the remainder of the
financial year.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 7% (or 6kt) to 76kt in the December 2018 half year due to an unplanned

      at 60%. The Group's financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
6.    Payable Zinc Equivalent (kt) is calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the 
      total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY18 realised prices for zinc (US$3,185/t), lead (US$2,463/t) and silver (US$16.6/oz) 
      have been used for FY18 and FY19e. Zinc equivalent is used to compare Cannington with the recently acquired Hermosa 
      project which is currently reported in zinc equivalent terms.
7.    Realised prices are unaudited. Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken 
      independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume unless 
      otherwise stated.
8.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by 
      external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction.
9.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by 
      external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction. 
      Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
10.   Realised nickel sales prices are unaudited and inclusive of by-products.
11.   The information in this release that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa project are foreign estimates 
      under ASX Listing Rules and reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market 
      announcement ‘South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer' dated 18 June 2018, in accordance with ASX 
      Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that 
      materially impacts on the reliability of the estimates. South32 confirms that the information contained in the clarifying 
      statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. The estimates of 
      Mineral Resources are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. Competent Persons have not done sufficient work to 
      classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation 
      and further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in 
      accordance with the JORC Code.
12.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Platts Alumina Index (PAX) (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month 
      lag to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$501/t in the December 2018 half year.
13.   Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustments. Underlying EBIT is reported 
      net of South32's share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments.
14.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: US$ million (US$M); US$ billion (US$B); grams per 
      tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa); million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per 
      annum (Mtpa); ounces (oz); thousand ounces (koz); million ounces (Moz); thousand wet metric tonnes (kwmt); million wet

David Crawford AO, Chairman

Good morning everyone. My name is David Crawford, and I am the Chairman of South32.


Welcome to the 2018 Annual General Meeting of South32.
---
I confirm that a quorum is present, and now formally declare the meeting open.


The South32 Board joins us here today. They are, from my far right, non-executive directors Dr Xiaoling Liu, Keith
Rumble, Dr Futhi Mtoba and Company Secretary Nicole Duncan.


Next to me on my left is Graham Kerr, our Chief Executive Officer.


From my far left are Frank Cooper, Karen Wood, Xolani Mkhwanazi and Wayne Osborn.
---
Our Lead Team are also in attendance and are seated in the front row.


The Board and Lead Team will be available for questions during the lunch that follows the formal proceedings. We
encourage you to ask our leaders any questions you have.


Also in attendance is Denise McComish representing the Company’s auditors KPMG and, Tim Heughan,
from Computershare is here to oversee the polling process.
---
Before I provide an overview of the financial year I will address our safety performance.


Nothing is more important to South32 than ensuring our people go home safe and well at the end of every shift.
Tragically, during the year one of our colleagues, Agnes Masooa, was fatally injured at our Metalloys manganese
smelter in South Africa.


Any fatality is unacceptable. We remain uncompromising in our efforts to ensure a safe working environment.


While our total recordable injury frequency has improved year on year, it’s not good enough. Safety continues to be
core to our values and our long-term success. The Board is working closely with the Lead Team to improve
leadership capability, hazard identification and risk management.


Graham will share more on how we’ve engaged our people to learn from this tragedy.



                                                                                                                 2
---
In other areas, the 2018 financial year was successful and productive.


Our financial performance improved for the third consecutive year.


We made strong progress in optimising our portfolio by advancing multiple growth options.


Importantly we continued to align our people and operations to our purpose and values. We exist to develop natural
resources in a way that makes a positive difference to our people, communities, governments, partners and you, our
shareholders.


Creating an inclusive workplace is core to our purpose. We strive to have a workforce that is as diverse as the
communities where we operate - and I take this opportunity to thank our people, working across nine countries, for
contributing to another outstanding year.
---
Our 2018 financial performance has been influenced by stronger commodity prices, and our efforts to mitigate
inflationary pressure. This has resulted in:


      •   Revenue of 7.5 billion dollars;
      •   Underlying earnings of 1.3 billion dollars, up 16 per cent; and
      •   Statutory profit of 1.3 billion dollars, up 8 per cent.


This strong financial performance translated into free cash flow from operations, including equity accounted
investments, of 1.4 billion dollars and an increase in our net cash balance to finish the year at 2 billion dollars.


We also delivered a 13.5 per cent return on invested capital, and total shareholder returns of 53 per cent.
---
We remain committed to our investment grade credit rating and broader capital management framework. We
prioritise investment in our business, with excess capital returned to shareholders in the most efficient way.


Consistent with this, we returned 946 million dollars to shareholders during the reporting period.


We also increased our capital management program by 250 million dollars to 1 billion dollars.


We expect to return the 380 million dollar balance of this program to shareholders this financial year.
---
We are always working to advance the financial interests of our shareholders. Our business also depends on co-
existence with a wide range of neighbours and land users in the communities where we operate.


We aim to be a leader in social and environmental performance. We understand the importance of strong and trusted
community relationships. This year we invested over 20 million dollars in life-changing programs for our communities,
an increase of more than 6 million dollars on the previous year.



                                                                                                                       3
We also further reduced our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 4 percent.


During the year, we successfully appealed a matter concerning our Colombian operation in the Colombian
Constitutional Court. While the final decision was predominantly in our favour, the Court ordered Cerro Matoso to
provide ongoing health care to community members who alleged health impacts from our operations, and to submit to
a new environmental licensing process. South32 is clarifying the process to be applied with respect to those orders.


We are proud of the positive contribution we make to support social and economic growth within the local community
surrounding Cerro Matoso. We will continue to invest in projects to improve the quality of life for community members.
---
Public concern over climate change has made it critical to be open and transparent about related risks and
opportunities.


We continued to integrate the management of climate change into our business. During the year, we began assessing
our operations’ resilience to the physical impacts of an extreme climate change scenario.


To reflect this, we have expanded our climate change reporting. We have coupled detailed climate risk disclosures
with actions to reduce exposure. This is in line with the recommendations from the G20’s Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures.


We are leading the way in this reporting. We were pleased to be acknowledged by ""Market Forces"" as one of only
three ASX100 companies that was “getting it right” in terms of climate change reporting.
---
We take a structured and rigorous approach to Board succession. To determine suitable candidates our planning
process considers the current mix of skills, our Board evaluation process, emerging business and governance issues.


We seek directors that bring complementary skills and experience to ensure sustained delivery of value to
shareholders. We, as a Board, act in a manner that: is consistent with our values; supports our social licence to
operate; and protects the interests of shareholders.


With the election of Dr Xiaoling Liu and Ms Karen Wood, we have strengthened the long-term capability, diversity of
experience and industry knowledge of the Board. They have added significant value to our Board’s operation.
---
In the 2018 financial year, we didn’t increase Fixed Remuneration for any of our Non-Executive Directors or Executive
Key Management Personnel. We made no material change to our Executive Remuneration Strategy.


Consistent with previous years, our approach is to align remuneration outcomes to the experience of shareholders.


This is achieved by putting at risk a significant portion of remuneration, most of which is delivered in equity. We set
challenging Short-Term Incentive targets and ensure Long-Term Incentives encourage the delivery of value to our
shareholders.




                                                                                                                    4
Our short-term incentive outcomes were below target, primarily due to the fatality and lower than expected production
volumes.


As a result of the increase in our share price and strong total shareholder returns over the performance period, equity
vesting has been the most significant contributor to the increase in actual pay for Executives.
---
Looking to the future, we remain positive about global growth in the long term. We are optimising our portfolio to set
us up for this future.


Using the strength of our balance sheet, we recently completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining, owner of the silver,
lead, zinc Hermosa project in Arizona. We also acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal
project in Queensland.


Graham will talk about the importance of these investments shortly.


In addition, the decision to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business has allowed us to collapse
the regional model, consolidate support structures, and change the way we work.
---
There is a lot to be excited about at South32. We have a diverse, high quality commodities portfolio with very exciting
growth opportunities.


Our talented global workforce is united by our purpose to make a difference.


We are confident that we have set ourselves up to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, our people and the
communities where we operate.


On behalf of the Board and all shareholders, I thank Graham and his Lead Team, along with all our people, for their
role in South32’s success over the past three years.


Finally, thanks to you, our shareholders, for your support and we look forward to continuing this journey with you.


I’ll now hand over to Graham Kerr to provide the CEO Address.


Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, David, and good morning everyone.


I’d like to start out by reflecting on safety, and why this is fundamental to everything we do.


As David mentioned, tragically in April this year one of our colleagues, Agnes, was fatally injured while working at our
Metalloys manganese smelter in South Africa.


This loss has had a profound impact on Agnes’ family, friends and colleagues and I offer my sincere condolences to
everyone impacted.


                                                                                                                      5
We have deeply reflected on this incident, and continue to engage extensively with our people to ensure all work is
well designed and reliably delivers safe outcomes.


Learnings have been shared across our entire organisation, to ensure Agnes’ legacy lives on through improved safety
performance across our business.


We are also investing in our leaders to develop the right skills and capabilities to improve our safety performance,
while empowering our people to speak up and stop when work isn’t safe. We won’t be truly successful until everyone
returns home safe and well at the end of every shift.
---
Moving to people and capability. We genuinely believe that our people are the foundation of our success.


Throughout the year we focused on embedding our purpose and values to better connect our people to what we want
to achieve as an organisation.


We also introduced seven ‘breakthroughs’ which outline the strategic imperatives in the areas of safety, people,
operations, functional support, technology, environmental and social leadership, and optimising our portfolio.


These breakthroughs guide the way we plan activity in our business to ensure the entire organisation is united by and
working towards our purpose.
---
We continue to transform the composition of our business, and have made progress towards achieving our diversity
targets.


Overall representation of women in our workforce increased to 17 per cent, while the representation of women in our
Lead Team has increased to 33 per cent following the appointment of Vanessa Torres in the new financial year.


Pleasingly, the representation of Black People in our workforce in South Africa increased to 81 per cent.
---
Public acceptance is essential to our long-term success.


At South32 we know that our social licence to operate needs to be earned and maintained every day.


In addition to continually finding ways to reduce our carbon footprint, we aim to create enduring social, economic and
environmental value by working closely with our host communities.


We support life-changing community initiatives through our social investment programs, and constructively engage
with our host communities to ensure they share the economic and social benefits through local jobs and business
development.


As part of reducing our carbon footprint, we commenced construction of a six-hectare, three-megawatt solar farm at
Cannington, representing our first solar installation.



                                                                                                                   6
The solar farm will deliver reduced greenhouse gas emissions by offsetting gas consumption with solar energy.


Biodiversity stewardship is another important element of being a trusted partner of choice.


As part of our recent applications for a mining extension project in South Africa, we developed a comprehensive
wetland offset strategy.


The detailed design mitigates any wetland losses that could result from the project during the first five years of mining.


These are just some of the many examples of social and environmental leadership initiatives taking place at our
operations.
---
Moving to our financial and operational performance. We delivered our third consecutive year of strong financial
growth, while embedding a new way of working and taking real steps to reshape and strengthen our global portfolio of
assets.


Our overall financial performance benefited from stronger commodity prices and our efforts remained focused on
mitigating inflationary pressure.


We delivered record production at Australia Manganese and a 10 per cent increase in total manganese ore production
as we responded to favourable market conditions.


We also achieved another production record at Mozal Aluminium and increased production at Cerro Matoso by 20 per
cent as we benefitted from a full year of higher grade ore from La Esmeralda.


At the same time, we realised a significant lift in the operating margin of our aluminium value chain as a result of tight
markets and our long alumina position.


We’ve also delivered an improvement in equipment productivity at a number of our operations and have renegotiated
energy supply and logistics contracts to deliver additional value.


At Worsley Alumina, we’ve developed the low reactive silica West Marradong resource, which is allowing us to
optimise caustic soda consumption rates.


This disciplined approach has helped mitigate broader inflationary pressure, particularly in our downstream processing
facilities.


However, there is still work to do to overcome challenges at some of our operations.


At Illawarra Metallurgical Coal we are re-establishing minimum performance criteria and implementing work practices
to improve longwall and development performance.


We believe these initiatives will enable production rates to return to historical levels.


                                                                                                                     7
---
In parallel, we continue to review and re-shape our portfolio to ensure we are well positioned for the future.


In April 2018, we started managing South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business.


This fundamental redesign is expected to deliver 50 million dollars of annual cost savings for the Group from the 2020
financial year.


Consistent with our objective to transform South Africa Energy Coal, we also commenced a process to broaden its
ownership in September this year.
---
Our new way of working is also scalable, allowing us to expand our global footprint and invest in opportunities where
we believe we can create value.


As David mentioned, in August 2018, we completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining, adding the high-grade zinc,
lead and silver Hermosa project and a prospective land package to our portfolio.


Hermosa is one of the industry’s most exciting base metals options.


Our near-term priority is progressing the twin exploration decline that will allow us to start underground drilling.


This will increase our geological understanding of the resource and allow us to test for extensions.


In September 2018 we finalised the acquisition of a 50 per cent interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project
in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, and assumed operational control.


This embeds another attractive development option within our growing portfolio.


We are currently in the process of commencing the feasibility study to assess the optimised mine design and
development plan for this project.


Elsewhere we continue to see opportunities to create value via our greenfield exploration strategy that has now grown
to 18 active projects. This includes our partnership in Alaska with Trilogy Metals, where we exercised our second-
year option on the advanced exploration project at Bornite.
---
Looking ahead, we are well positioned for the future.


We anticipate some price volatility in global commodity markets, driven by rising trade tensions and a strengthening
US dollar.


However strong demand for higher quality raw materials is expected to continue as China implements policy initiatives
to meet environmental reforms.



                                                                                                                       8
Improved production from many of our operations, along with a continued focus on productivity gains and
procurement savings, will allow us to further mitigate industry wide inflationary pressure.


We are excited to be adding high quality development options to our portfolio and will continue to reshape our portfolio
as we seek to maximise total shareholder returns.


Creating a safe and inclusive workplace for our people, and making a positive difference to the communities where we
work, will continue to be fundamental to our success.


Thank you for your continued support of South32. I’ll now hand back to our Chairman.

The Chairman then conducted the formal items of business.

Corporate Update
                                                        
  - On 10 August we completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining[Note 1] and immediately commenced development of the Hermosa
    project’s twin exploration declines and a comprehensive review of their development plans. The twin exploration declines will
    allow us to increase our geological understanding of this high grade resource, while work is also being undertaken on the
    existing foreign estimate[Note 2] so that we can declare a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC Code in CY19.

  - On 14 September we completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project in       
    Queensland’s Bowen Basin[Note 3] and assumed operating control. We have since appointed a project director and commenced a
    review of the project’s development plan.
          
  - Our net cash[Note 4] balance decreased by US$1,362M to US$679M during the September 2018 quarter following completion of                              
    the Arizona Mining[Note 1] and Eagle Downs[Note 3] acquisitions for a combined US$1,457M, and the continuation of our US$1B 
    capital management program. To the end of the September 2018 quarter we had completed 65% of this program, having paid a
    US$154M special dividend on 5 April 2018 and purchased 216M shares at a volume weighted average price of
    A$3.03 per share. Subsequent to the end of the September 2018 quarter we also paid a US$316M fully-franked dividend in
    respect of the June 2018 half year.
                                
  - We received net distributions[Note 5] of US$24M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) during
    the September 2018 quarter. The combination of strong operating performance and pricing has seen additional cash build in
    our manganese joint venture, despite Australia Manganese paying US$134M (100% share) in royalties in respect of the prior
    6 month period. Any excess cash within the joint venture is expected to be distributed to partners in the December 2018
    half year.

  - The formal process to broaden and transform the ownership of South Africa Energy Coal commenced during the September
    2018 quarter and several expressions of interest have been received. Given the likely timeline for this process, we expect to
    continue to consolidate the operation in our financial results for the December 2018 half year.

  - We invested US$12.1M in exploration programs during the September 2018 quarter of which US$3.9M was capitalised
    (including US$0.1M for our EAI’s) and US$3.8M was directed to our 18 early stage greenfield exploration projects.

  - Our Underlying Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which excludes tax associated with our EAI, largely reflects the geographic
    distribution of the Group’s profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%,                            
    Colombia 37%[Note 6], Mozambique 0%[Note 6] and Brazil 34%. The Group’s ETR will rise should profits within our 
    aluminium value chain continue to transfer upstream to our refineries, which are located in higher tax paying jurisdictions.

Worsley Alumina hydrate production increased by 5% (or 48kt) to 959kt in the September 2018 quarter while calcined alumina
production decreased by 13% (or 127kt) to 854kt as further maintenance was undertaken and the refinery re-established a
substantial hydrate inventory position. We took advantage of current market dynamics and agreed multiple contracts, at alumina
equivalent rates, to sell opportunistic volumes of hydrate for shipment during the December 2018 quarter. Additional calciner
maintenance is scheduled for the March 2019 quarter and FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,965kt.

The average realised price for alumina sales in the September 2018 quarter is expected to reflect a moderate discount to the Platts            
Alumina Index (PAX)[Note 10] on a volume weighted M-1 basis. This discount reflects the elevated alumina to aluminium price ratio in the 
spot market and the structure of specific Mozal Aluminium supply contracts that are linked to the LME aluminium price, which in this
case reduces the price paid by our smelter.

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 1kt) to 180kt in the September 2018 quarter as the smelter continued
to test its maximum technical capacity. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 720kt. Notwithstanding the smelter’s
continued strong operating performance, higher prices for alumina and aluminium price-linked power, and still elevated prices for
pitch and coke continue to impact its cost base.

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 1kt) to 68kt in the September 2018 quarter as the smelter continued to
test its maximum technical capacity. The US$18M (South32 share) AP3XLE energy efficiency project commenced the roll out of its
pot relining program ahead of schedule during the September 2018 quarter. The project is expected to deliver a circa 5%
(or 10kt pa) increase in annual production for no associated increase in power consumption, with the full benefit expected to be
realised by FY24. FY19 production guidance remains unchanged at 269kt.

Notwithstanding the smelters continued strong operating performance, higher prices for alumina and still elevated prices for pitch
and coke continue to impact its cost base. The smelter sources alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50%
of its requirements priced as a percentage of the LME aluminium index, providing it with some cost relief at current alumina prices.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 13% (or 937kt) to 6.2Mt in the September 2018 quarter. Export
production was impacted by an incident that caused damage to the dragline at Klipspruit in August 2018, while domestic production
declined in response to lower demand, despite the commencement of a new contract to sell additional lower quality stockpiled
product in the June 2018 quarter.

The extended dragline outage at Klipspruit which will reduce export coal production by approximately 2Mt was already included 
in annual guidance of 29Mt (17.5Mt domestic, 11.5Mt Export). The incident has been confirmed as an insurable event and we expect
to recover certain losses. We are currently working with our insurers on a schedule for the dragline’s repair and
recommissioning.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 54% (or 670kt) to 1.9Mt in the September 2018 quarter as the Appin
and Dendrobium longwalls performed strongly following moves in the June 2018 quarter. Notwithstanding the improvement in
longwall productivity at Appin, an uplift in development rates is required to sustain the operation of two longwalls in parallel from
H2 FY20. We also reached agreement with the employees covered by the Appin Deputies Enterprise Agreement (EA), following
agreement of a new Dendrobium Deputies EA in the June 2018 quarter. We continue to renegotiate several other labour
agreements at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and this process is being closely managed.

Production guidance remains unchanged at 6.1Mt with development rates to become an even greater focus and two longwall
moves to be completed over the remainder of FY19.

On 24 September, we announced that the Constitutional Court of Colombia had issued its final ruling on our application to annul its
decision regarding the alleged health and environmental impacts of our Cerro Matoso operation on the surrounding communities.
The Court annulled those orders requiring Cerro Matoso to pay direct financial compensatory damages to community members and
establish an ethnic development fund. The orders requiring Cerro Matoso to provide ongoing health care to community members
alleging health impacts, and to submit to a new consultative environmental licensing process, were not annulled.

Production has not been impacted by the decision handed down by the Court and FY19 guidance remains unchanged at 40.5kt.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production decreased by 16% (or 9.2kt) to 49.7kt in the September 2018 quarter following the
extraction of a high grade sequence of stopes in the prior quarter. Processed silver, lead and zinc grades met our expectations and
guidance remains unchanged for FY19 at 186g/t, 5.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Mill throughput was largely unchanged with greater
predictability and stability achieved in the underground mine.
                                                                                                                                                                        
The decrease in quarterly sales reflects a change to the shipping schedule requested by a customer. FY19 zinc equivalent[Note 9]
production guidance of 188.1kt (silver 11,750koz, lead 98.0kt and zinc 51.0kt) remains unchanged.

Notes:
1.    Refer to exchange release on 13 August 2018 “South32 completes acquisition of Arizona Mining”.
2.    The information in this release that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa project are foreign 
      estimates under ASX Listing Rules and reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in 
      the market announcement ‘South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer’ dated  18 June 2018, in accordance 
      with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign 
      estimate that materially impacts on the reliability of the estimates. South32 confirms that the information contained 
      in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. 
      The estimates of Mineral Resources are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. Competent Persons 
      have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. 
      It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported 
      as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code.
3.    Refer to media release on 14 September 2018 “South32 completes acquisition of 50% interest in Eagle Downs and assumes 
      operatorship”.
4.    Net Cash number is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of
      profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
5.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and 
      should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance 
      or liquidity.
6.    The Colombian corporate tax rate was 40% until 31 December 2017. The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues 
      instead of income tax.
7.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests 
      owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions 
      attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s 
      interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
8.    Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have 
      been reported at 60%.The Group’s financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese 
      ore.
9.    Payable Zinc Equivalent (kt) is calculated by aggregating revenues from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the 
      total revenue by the price of zinc. FY18 realised prices for zinc (US$3,185/t), lead (US$2,463/t) and silver (US$16.6/oz)
      have been used for FY18 and FY19e. Zinc equivalent is used to compare Cannington with the recently acquired Hermosa 
      project which is currently reported in zinc equivalent terms.
10.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Platts Alumina Index (PAX) (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month
      lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$499/t in the September 2018 quarter.
11.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes
     (kt); thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa);  million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per annum (Mtpa); thousand ounces (koz); 
      million ounces (Moz); thousand wet metric tonnes (kwmt); million wet metric tonnes (Mwmt); million wet metric tonnes

CERRO MATOSO LITIGATION UPDATE

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises it is aware that the Constitutional Court of
Colombia has issued its final ruling on our application to annul its decision, regarding the alleged health and
environmental impacts of our Cerro Matoso operation on the surrounding communities.
We welcome the Court’s decision to annul those orders, which required Cerro Matoso to pay direct financial
compensatory damages to community members in relation to the above allegations and to establish an ethnic
development fund. The orders, which require Cerro Matoso to provide ongoing health care to community members
alleging health impacts, and to submit to a new consultative environmental licensing process were not annulled.
Whilst we disagree with the original Court in deciding, without evidential basis, that Cerro Matoso is causing the
alleged impacts, we will seek to co-operate with respect to the remaining orders, subject to the reservation of our
rights under applicable international investment treaties. Production has not been impacted by the decision handed
down by the Court, and we remain proud of the positive contribution we make to supporting social and economic
growth within the local community surrounding Cerro Matoso.

dividend of US 6.2 cents per share (fully franked) for the full year ended 30 June 2018. The dividend payment date is
11 October 2018. The US cent currency exchange rate applicable to the dividend payable in South African cents, to

The currency exchange rate is the volume weighted average price achieved on foreign exchange trades executed
over the period 4 September 2018 to 10 September 2018.

The exchange rates applicable to the South32 dividend being paid in other currencies will be determined over the
period 4 September 2018 to 20 September 2018. Details of the currency exchange rates applicable for the dividend
will be announced to the relevant stock exchanges.

South32 shareholders registered on the South African branch register will not be able to dematerialise or rematerialise
their shareholdings between 12 September 2018 and 14 September 2018 (both dates inclusive), nor will transfers to
or from the South African branch register be permitted between 7 September 2018 and 14 September 2018 (both
dates inclusive).

1. South African dividends tax of 18.86558 South African cents per ordinary share will be withheld from the amount of
   the gross final dividend of 94.32792 South African cents per ordinary share paid to shareholders on the South
   African branch register at the rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption.

2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be 75.46234 South African cents per
   ordinary share.

3. Australia is the country of source of income, the dividend is regarded as 'foreign' for the purposes of South African
   dividends tax.

4. South32 had a total of 5,119,913,775 ordinary shares on issue at the dividend determination date of 23 August
   2018.

5. The dividend will be paid out of retained earnings.

6. For the avoidance of doubt, South African dividends tax, and therefore the information provided in this
   announcement, is of only direct application to shareholders on the South African branch register.

1.         Principal risks and uncertainties

Risk management

We continuously develop and enhance our risk and control procedures to improve risk identification, assessment and
monitoring, and to embed risk management into our decision-making processes. Our effective management of risk
ensures the achievement of our strategic objectives, the realisation of opportunities and enhances our resilience to
change. We have a dedicated global risk function that assists in identifying and recording strategic risks facing the
Group, and monitors mitigating actions.

The Board is informed about the strategic risks facing the Company at each scheduled Board meeting. The
identification and assessment of these risks is informed, amongst other things, by an understanding of our business
model, significant trends in our operating environment and the relevant interests, expectations and concerns of key
stakeholders that are most likely to influence our ability to create sustainable shareholder value. Each risk will be
revisited in FY19 to consider emerging trends and new impacts from internal and external factors.

We have identified 15 strategic risks that have the potential to significantly impact the performance and sustainability
of our business, as listed below. Elements of those risks may be relevant across the entire Group, whilst others may
be specific to a commodity group or operation.



Registered Office Level 35 108 St Georges Terrace Perth WA 6000 Australia
ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia                                                                                                 1
Fluctuations in commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates and the global economy
Risk: Industry earnings, balance sheet and cash flows are affected by the volatility of commodity prices, currencies
and interest rates. Financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices are managed based on
floating indices. Prices are determined by the balance of supply and derived demand for commodities. Costs are
impacted by the local currencies of operations. Significant deterioration in commodity prices or unfavourable currency
movements have the potential to adversely impact the value of our operations and our ability to declare dividends.
Mitigation:
    •   Commitment to a strong balance sheet
    •   We maintain a diverse commodity portfolio and geographical spread to provide resilience against volatility
        relative to single commodity, single mine and single geography competitors
    •   We actively monitor the markets in which we operate
    •   We have a centralised marketing team
    •   We continually review our operating and capital expenditure plans


Actions by governments, political events or tax authorities
Risk: The value of our investments depends on long-term fiscal stability and may be affected by political, economic,
tax and legal changes beyond our control. The resources sector can often be subject to unpredictable, higher direct
and indirect taxes and royalties in our countries of operation that can negatively impact on cash flow. The decisions of
regulators relating, for example, to nationalisation of mineral resources, renegotiation or nullification of contracts,
leases, permits or agreements, may impact our business model.
Mitigation:
    •   We have specialist external relations teams
    •   We have a comprehensive stakeholder relations strategy in place in all our countries of operation
    •   We monitor policy, legislative and regulatory changes whilst actively engaging with relevant authorities, for
        example, through written submissions and International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) membership
    •   We have specialist tax management capability and seek expert tax advice as needed
    •   Our annual Tax Transparency and Payments to Governments Report demonstrates how we meet our
        regulatory obligations


Cost inflation and labour dispute impact on operating margins and expansion
Risk: Inflation of input and capital costs could adversely impact financial returns. Labour is a significant operating cost
that may vary depending on industrial action and scheduling delays. Our need to reduce operating costs may impact
negatively on previously communicated labour commitments.
Mitigation:
    •   Our strategy seeks to optimise our operations and sustainably lower operating costs and capital expenditure
    •   Our investment decisions are governed by a robust capital management framework
    •   All discretionary investments compete for capital, based on assessed risk and value
    •   We engage proactively with all trade unions and our people in line with local labour laws
    •   Enterprise bargaining agreements are in place and the internal and external environment is continually
        monitored to identify any possible industrial action




                                                                                                                     2
Access to water and energy
Risk: Water and energy are critical to our operations, however scarcity of supply, counterparties, change in
government policy and increasing cost of natural resources can impact our operations and supply chain.
Mitigation:
    •   We work closely with suppliers of water and power, on a long-term, mutually beneficial basis
    •   We actively work to secure water and energy resources within our control to strengthen our operations’
        resilience to water and power security risks
    •   We explore opportunities to secure alternate, reliable water and energy sources


Failure to maintain, realise or enhance value due to inadequate knowledge of our resources and reserves
Risk: We aim to maximise shareholder value by continually optimising our operations. Failure to maintain technical
and economic understanding of our Mineral/Coal Resources undermines our ability to identify the right opportunities to
optimise and enhance our operations. This will detrimentally impact on shareholder returns and, ultimately, the
sustainability of the Company.
Mitigation:
    •   Our resources and reserves are estimated by mineral industry professionals who have relevant experience to
        act as Competent Persons in accordance with the JORC Code. We strengthen this process by applying our
        governance framework using internal and external subject matter experts
    •   We seek to identify the opportunities that derive maximum value for each operation in our long-term planning
        process
    •   We have a capital prioritisation process that assesses our entire portfolio allowing us to invest in those
        opportunities that enable us to maintain balance sheet strength as well as maximise returns to shareholders
    •   Our short-term planning processes aim to translate these value opportunities into granular executable plans


Deterioration in liquidity and cash flow
Risk: External factors may adversely impact cash flows. If we compromise our balance sheet, liquidity and cash
reserves, interest rate costs on borrowed debt and future access to financial capital markets could be adversely
affected.
Mitigation:
    •   We are committed to a strong balance sheet, maintaining an investment grade credit rating and strong
        liquidity throughout economic cycles
    •   We manage our balance sheet and cash flow within strict financial criteria


Climate change impacts
Risk: Climate change may result in physical impacts and transition risks on our operational infrastructure, decreasing
natural resource availability and increased occurrence of extreme weather events that can cause disruption to our
operations, as well as increased operating and capital costs. Climate change driven by worsened greenhouse gas
emissions may force a change in government policy about carbon taxes and/or trading which will impact on our
operating costs.
Mitigation:
    •   We have established greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets
    •   We utilise the latest climate modelling data to inform us of the level of risk to our life of mine assets and
        disruption of operations
    •   We identify and implement greenhouse gas reduction and energy efficiency projects
    •   We prioritise our land management efforts to minimise land disturbance and maximise rehabilitation efforts
    •   We engage with stakeholders and decision-makers in the design of national carbon regulations
    •   We are transparent with our disclosure of climate change-related risks in our annual Climate-related Financial
        Disclosures




                                                                                                                3
Health and safety risks in respect of our operational activities
Risk: There are inherent health and safety risks across the mining operations value chain. Apart from physical harm to
our people and contractors, failure to maintain a high standard of safety may impact negatively on employee morale,
the achievement of production targets and our licence to operate.
Mitigation:
    •   The well-being of our people is at the forefront of all our considerations and is fundamental to everything we
        do
    •   We have established comprehensive health and safety policies and associated performance requirements
        that are designed to prevent and mitigate exposure to health and safety risks
    •   We focus on significant events and critical controls
    •   We engage, develop and align our people to ensure we have disciplined execution of well-designed work
    •   We continuously improve our work environment to make it safer and more productive for our people


Water, waste and environmental risks
Risk: We recognise that our operations have the potential to significantly impact biodiversity, air, land and water
resources. Advances in scientific understanding of these impacts, regulatory requirements and stakeholder
expectations may prevent or delay project approvals and result in increased mitigation costs, offset or compensatory
actions, weakening the overall sustainability of operations.
Mitigation:
    •   We have established policies and standards which are designed to prevent, monitor and limit the impact of
        our operations on the environment
    •   We actively address known contamination resulting from past activities
    •   We are committed to stewardship in water and waste water management
    •   We use water responsibly, taking into account natural supply variations


Unexpected operational or natural catastrophes
Risk: Our operations and transport networks can be disrupted by events such as fire, explosion, flooding,
geotechnical failures, loss of power supply, mechanical equipment failures and unexpected natural catastrophes. The
frequency and severity may be exacerbated due to climate change.
Mitigation:
    •   We use robust risk management tools to analyse risks and design plans that prevent or limit business
        disruption impacts
    •   We incorporate the latest climate impact parameters into our planning, risk and investment model
    •   We have established and tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans to facilitate rapid response to
        significant events and ensure the safe restoration of operations
    •   We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As
        such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential loses arising from such
        risks
    •   We provide transparent reporting in our Climate- related Financial Disclosures to provide stakeholder
        assurance


Commercial counterparties that we transact with may not meet their obligations
Risk: We contract with commercial, government and financial counterparties, including customers, suppliers and
financial institutions who may fail to perform against contracts and obligations, impacting cost or price performance.
Non-supply or changes to the quality of key inputs may impact costs and production at operations.
Mitigation:
    •   We proactively engage with our counterparties to manage instances of non-supply or quality control prior to
        occurrence
    •   We use counterparty credit ratings and level of exposure to set counterparty limits


                                                                                                                   4
•   Our insurance program mitigates the financial consequences of supply disruption, subject to availability and
    cost




                                                                                                          5
Fraud and corruption
Risk: We are exposed to the risks of fraud and corruption, both within and external to our company. Fraud and
corruption may lead to regulatory fines, financial loss, litigation, loss of operating licences or reputational damage.
Mitigation:
    •   We have a Code of Business Conduct which confirms our commitment to upholding a unified approach to
        ethical standards of behaviour
    •   We have “zero tolerance” for fraud and corruption, with clear tone set by the Board and Lead Team
    •   Our ethics and compliance framework incorporates policies, procedures, training, and guidelines that help
        ensure that activities are conducted ethically
    •   We perform risk assessments as a critical part of our anti-corruption compliance program
    •   We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate the risk of fraud and corruption
    •   We provide our people and third parties with mechanisms to safely report suspected fraud or corruption


Breaches of information technology security
Risk: Information technology systems may be subject to security breaches resulting in theft, disclosure or corruption of
information. Security breaches might also result in misappropriation of funds or disruption to operations.
Mitigation:
    •   We maintain network and physical control frameworks and deploy up-to-date anti-virus software to provide a
        level of protection
    •   We monitor our networks and undertake ethical hacking and data analysis to identify suspicious activity and
        potential exposures
    •   We have established business continuity plans, inclusive of IT disaster recovery plans


Failure to retain and attract key people
Risk: The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract, develop and retain talent could affect our operations, financial
position and growth.
Mitigation:
    •   We have designed an inclusive workplace and specific initiatives to engage and empower our workforce
    •   We focus on having the right people in the right roles, developing future leaders and maintaining a workforce
        with deep functional expertise
    •   We engage with our people at all levels to improve connectivity, support decisions and continuously improve
    •   We have policies and guidelines in place for talent and recruitment management, remuneration, skills
        development and succession planning


Support of our local communities
Risk: Our social licence to operate is dependent upon the engagement and support of the communities within which
we operate or seek to operate. Community dissatisfaction can result in failure to attract people and business partners,
operational delays and disruption and litigation, which can affect cost, production and, in extreme cases, the viability
of our operations.
Mitigation:
    •   We have established policies and procedures designed to identify and understand our stakeholders, informing
        our stakeholder engagement plans and community investment approach
    •   We maintain regular and open dialogue with our stakeholders
    •   We work closely with communities and government to identify and manage impacts, build shared value and
        align stakeholder expectations to current economic reality

Financial Results and Outlook
Year ended 30 June 2018

23 August 2018   ASX, LSE, JSE Share Code: S32 ADR: SOUHY

South32 produces strong financial results while reshaping its portfolio
""Stronger commodity prices and our efforts to mitigate inflationary pressure delivered a 16 per cent increase in
Underlying earnings to US$1.3B, free cash flow from operations of US$1.4B and a closing net cash balance of US$2.0B.

""We achieved record production at Australia Manganese and Mozal Aluminium, delivered a 10 per cent increase in total
manganese ore production and a 20 per cent increase in payable nickel production at Cerro Matoso. At the same time
our fully integrated aluminium supply chain benefitted from tight markets by virtue of our predominantly index-linked
3.2 million tonne long alumina position.

""The decision to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business has also allowed us to collapse our
regional model and simplify the Group, and is expected to deliver a US$50M annual cost saving from the 2020 financial
year. We will also commence a process to broaden South Africa Energy Coal's ownership in the September 2018
quarter.

This new way of working is not only lean but also scalable, allowing us to expand our global footprint and invest in
opportunities where we can create value. During the year, we entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 50 per
cent interest in the Eagle Downs project, exercised the second year of our Trilogy Metals option and have increased
our commitment to exploration with 18 partnerships for greenfield base metal projects now established. Subsequent to
year end, we also completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining, adding the high grade zinc-lead-silver Hermosa project
and a prospective land package to our portfolio.

""Our strong financial position allowed us to return US$946M to shareholders in respect of the period. This included
payment of a US$221M fully franked interim dividend and declaration of a US$317M fully franked final dividend in
accordance with our dividend policy. A further US$408M was returned to shareholders as part of our ongoing US$1B
capital management program with the remaining US$380M balance expected to be returned to shareholders in the 2019
financial year.

""Looking ahead, we are well positioned. Group production is expected to rise by 5 per cent in the 2019 financial year,
further productivity gains and functional cost savings are expected to mitigate industry wide inflationary pressure and
we have added high quality development options to our portfolio.""

2018 Financial Year Summary

Safety
The most important thing we can all do is to make sure that everyone goes home safe and well at the end of every shift. It is with
deep regret that one of our colleagues, was fatally injured whilst working at our Metalloys Manganese Smelter
in South Africa on 12 April 2018. A detailed investigation led by a member of our Lead Team was undertaken as we seek to understand 
and learn for this incident. The results were reviewed by the CEO, management team and Board.

We are committed to improving safety at our operations to avoid, mitigate and manage risk. We are doing this by creating an inclusive
workplace where all work is well-designed and we continuously improve and learn. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF)(9)(10)
was 5.1 per million hours worked, an improvement of 16% on last year's TRIF of 6.1(11) per million hours worked.

Performance summary
The Group's statutory profit after tax increased by 8% to US$1.3B in FY18, while Underlying earnings increased by 16%
(or US$181M) to US$1.3B. This significant increase in profitability was driven by stronger commodity prices, which were only partially
offset by a 7%(12) decrease in sales volumes and broader inflationary pressure, most notably in our aluminium supply chain. Free
cash flow from operations, including net distributions from equity accounted investments, of US$1.4B and an increase in our net cash
balance to US$2.0B allowed us to acquire Arizona Mining and announce the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Eagle Downs
metallurgical coal project with fully-funded cash offers amounting to US$1.4B.

The key factors that impacted financial performance included:
-   A US$349M increase in the contribution of our alumina refineries to Underlying EBITDA and a 10% increase in their combined
    Operating margin to 40% as we benefited from our long alumina position and our exposure to market prices for the vast majority
    of production;
-   A 10% increase in total manganese ore production, including record production at Australia Manganese, as we continued to
    respond to strong demand and pricing;
-   Record production at Mozal Aluminium, as the smelter continued to test its technical capacity;
-   A 20% increase in payable nickel production at Cerro Matoso as ore grades improved temporarily following the ramp up of
    La Esmeralda;
-   A 40% decrease in Illawarra Metallurgical Coal production as the Appin colliery was suspended for much of H1 FY18 as we
    sought to re-establish minimum performance criteria; and
-   Strong cost control as the majority of our upstream operations achieved Operating unit cost guidance, despite broader inflationary
    pressure.
Our strong financial position allowed us to return US$946M to shareholders in respect of the period. This included payment of a
US$221M fully franked interim dividend and declaration of a US$317M fully franked final dividend in accordance with our dividend
policy, which seeks to return a minimum 40% of Underlying earnings in each six month period. A further US$408M was returned to
shareholders as part of our ongoing capital management program, with US$254M allocated to our on-market share
buy-back program and US$154M returned in the form of a special dividend. Our capital management program was increased by
US$250M to US$1B during FY18 with the remaining US$380M balance expected to be returned to shareholders in FY19.

Reshaping our portfolio
In November 2017 we announced our intention to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business in order to improve
the operation's competitiveness and ensure its ongoing sustainability. We are well advanced in our implementation of this important
strategic initiative having appointed a separate leadership team with its own governance framework. We also approved a 4.3B(13)
South African rand investment to extend the life of the Klipspruit colliery by at least 20 years and will commence a process to broaden
South Africa Energy Coal's ownership in the September 2018 quarter, consistent with our commitment to further transform our South
African operations.

The decision to establish South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business has also allowed us to simplify the Group by collapsing
our regional operating model, consolidating our support structures and changing the way we work. This fundamental redesign of
South Africa Energy Coal and the Group's functions is expected to deliver an annual saving of US$50M from FY20, further mitigating
industry wide inflationary pressure.

This new way of working is not only lean but also scalable, allowing us to expand our global footprint and invest in opportunities
where we can create value. In FY18 we:
-   Entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 50% interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project in Queensland;
-   Exercised the second year of our Trilogy Metals (TSX:TMQ) option, to fully test the high grade copper extension at the Bornite
    deposit in Alaska; and
-   Increased our commitment to exploration with 18 partnerships for greenfield base metal projects now established in Australia,
    the Americas and Sweden.
Subsequent to year end, we also completed the acquisition of Arizona Mining, adding the Hermosa project's high grade
zinc-lead-silver resource(14) and a prospective land package to our portfolio.


Earnings
The Group's statutory profit after tax increased by US$101M (or 8%) to US$1.3B in FY18. Consistent with our accounting policies,
various items are excluded from the Group's statutory profit to derive Underlying earnings including: redundancy and restructuring
charges associated with the simplification of the Group's functional structures and the voluntary redundancy program undertaken at
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (US$58M pre-tax); exchange rate gains associated with the restatement of monetary items
 (US$15M pre-tax); losses on fair value movements of non-trading derivative instruments (US$73M pre-tax); exchange rate gains
associated with the Group's non US dollar denominated net debt (US$23M pre-tax); the tax expense for all pre-tax earnings
adjustments and exchange rate variations on tax balances (-US$37M); earnings adjustments included in the profit of our equity
accounted investments (-US$30M) and significant items (-US$31M pre-tax). Further information on these earnings adjustments is
included futher on.

On this basis, the Group generated Underlying EBITDA of US$2.5B for an operating margin of 37% as higher realised prices for the
majority of our commodities gave rise to a US$599M increase in sales revenue. The Group's cost base was primarily impacted by
external inflationary pressure, including stronger producer currencies and raw material input costs, that more than offset broader
equipment productivity and energy procurement initiatives that were embedded across our portfolio. Inflationary pressure was most
evident in our aluminium supply chain as caustic soda, energy, coke, pitch and alumina prices moved sharply higher with commodity
markets. Underlying EBIT increased by 8% to US$1.8B as depreciation and amortisation decreased with the reduction in production
volumes, while Underlying earnings increased by 16% to US$1.3B.

Mozambique 0%(19) and Brazil 34%.

Cash flow
The Group's free cash flow from operations, excluding equity accounted investments, was US$873M in FY18. Stronger prices for our
commodities and higher raw material input costs contributed to a US$392M build in working capital. Increasing profitability during
FY17 and FY18 also gave rise to a significant increase in income tax payments during the period (+US$179M to US$306M, excluding
tax paid within equity accounted investments).

Within working capital, Trade and other receivables increased by US$153M as average days debtor reverted to 21 days during
H2 FY18 (H1 FY18: 25, FY17: 18 days). With no change in customer payment terms, we expect average days debtors to remain
around this level, depending on timing differences at period end. The US$99M increase in the value of inventory primarily reflects
higher raw material input costs in our aluminium supply chain, while provisions and other liabilities decreased by US$118M as we continued to
invest in progressive rehabilitation at South Africa Energy Coal.

The ramp up of activity at the Klipspruit Life Extension (KPSX) project and prior weather related deferral of activity at South Africa
Energy Coal contributed to a US$117M increase in Total capital expenditure (20), excluding equity accounted investments,
to US$436M. This included:

-   Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping
    (including underground development) of US$368M; and
-   Major project capital expenditure of US$62M relating to the KPSX project.

The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation of exploration expenditure accounted for a further US$6M.

Total capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments increased by US$28M to US$65M during FY18 as we
invested in additional tailings storage capacity at Australia Manganese.

Total capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, was US$501M in FY18.

Our strong net cash position ensures we are well placed to invest in our existing portfolio, fund the initial US$106M(21) payment for a
50% interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project and complete the remaining US$380M of our approved capital
management program during FY19. The US$1.3B acquisition of Arizona Mining was completed in August 2018.

Our capital management framework remains unchanged and we continue to believe that a combination of high operating leverage
and undue financial leverage delivers a sub-optimal outcome for shareholders. Consistent with our commitment to maintain an
investment grade credit rating, Standard and Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed their respective BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings for the
Group following the announcement of the Arizona Mining transaction in June 2018.

Further demonstrating the strength of the Group's financial position, the Board resolved to pay a fully franked final dividend of
US 6.2 cents per share in respect of FY18 (US$317M), representing 40% of Underlying earnings in the H2 FY18.

Outlook
Production
The Group's production volumes are expected to rise by 5%(12) in FY19. Illawarra Metallurgical Coal continues to recover from the
extended outage at the Appin colliery in H1 FY18, with improved longwall and development performance expected to underpin 6.1Mt
of production in FY19 and an anticipated return to historical rates of more than 8Mt per annum from H2 FY20. Within our aluminium
supply chain, we expect another incremental improvement in production as we continue to test the maximum technical capacity of
our smelters, benefit from the completion of the De-bottlenecking Phase One project at Brazil Alumina and achieve a modest increase
in calciner availability at Worsley Alumina. At Cannington, zinc equivalent production(22) is expected to remain unchanged across
FY18 to FY20 as an increase in payable zinc production offsets lower silver and lead ore grades. Our manganese operations will
continue to manage production according to market demand. Payable nickel production guidance has been increased by 1.7kt to 40.5kt 
at Cerro Matoso given an expectation for higher throughput and utilisation rates, while production guidance has been lowered at 
South Africa Energy Coal as a result of an extended outage of the dragline at Klipspruit.

Costs and capital expenditure
An improvement in energy and equipment productivity enabled us to achieve FY18 Operating unit cost guidance at the majority of
our operations, despite broader inflationary pressure, most notably in our aluminium supply chain. Stronger production and additional
productivity gains are expected to further mitigate continued inflationary pressure, while a stronger US dollar and lower caustic soda
prices are forecast to provide some relief.

 (a)   FY19e Operating unit cost guidance includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and includes various assumptions for FY19,
       including: an alumina price of US$411/t; an average blended coal price of US$149/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$6.20/dmtu for
       44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$6.92/lb; a thermal coal price of US$93/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.58/troy oz; a
       lead price of US$2,406/t; a zinc price of US$3,066/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.76; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 13.43 and a USD:COP exchange rate of
       2,927; all of which reflected forward markets as at 15 June 2018 or our internal expectations.
 (b)   US dollar per tonne of ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact operating unit costs as related marketing costs and treatment
       and refining charges may change.


Other expenditure guidance
Following the simplification of the Group's functional structures in the June 2018 quarter, Group and unallocated costs of US$80M
are expected in FY19, excluding greenfield exploration. Greenfield exploration expenditure is expected to rise by US$20M to US$41M
as we progress 18 early stage greenfield projects.

Depreciation and amortisation, and tax expense
Depreciation and amortisation (excluding equity accounted investments) is expected to remain largely unchanged at approximately
US$750M. Depreciation and amortisation of US$85M is expected for our equity accounted investments. The Group's Underlying
ETR(18), which excludes tax associated with equity accounted investments, reflects the geographic distribution of the Group's profit.
The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 37% (19), Mozambique 0%(19)
and Brazil 34%. It should also be recognised that permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group's Underlying
ETR when commodity prices and profit margins are compressed.

Capital expenditure guidance
Sustaining capital expenditure, excluding equity accounted investments, is expected to increase by US$97M to US$465M in FY19 as we
increase underground development at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal by US$60M to facilitate the progressive ramp-up in production to historic
rates of more than 8Mt per annum. In addition, we are developing additional bauxite residue disposal areas at Worsley Alumina and
Brazil Alumina, water catchment capacity at Worsley Alumina, tailings storage capacity at Cannington, purchasing materials in
advance of the major furnace refurbishment project at Cerro Matoso in FY20 and advancing the AP3XLE energy efficiency project at
Mozal Aluminium. Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments is expected to increase by US$45M to US$110M
and includes the construction of additional tailings storage capacity at Australia Manganese.

approximately 20% complete and remains on schedule and budget. At Hermosa, we expect to invest approximately US$100M in
FY19 which will include the development of the twin exploration decline that will allow us to increase our geological understanding of
this high grade resource(14) and test for extensions. Capital expenditure guidance is not provided for Eagle Downs as the transaction

Worsley Alumina (86% share)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 3%
(or 128kt) in FY18 to 3.8Mt as additional calciner maintenance
was undertaken during the year. Production is expected to
approach 4.0Mt (4.6Mtpa 100% basis) in FY19 and FY20 as
we drawdown excess hydrate stock and achieve an increase
in calciner availability.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 16% in FY18 to US$235/t.
A significant rise in the price of caustic soda (FY18: US$582/t,
FY17: US$413/t) accounted for more than 50% of this increase,
while additional costs were incurred as contractors were utilised
to integrate the West Marradong mining area and its lower
reactive silica bauxite feed(26) during H2 FY18.

We expect the refinery's Operating unit costs to decrease by a
modest 2% in FY19 to US$230/t with both the caustic soda price
and consumption rate (-10% to 93kg/t) forecast to decline, with
the latter benefit linked to the ramp-up of West Marradong.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit
cost guidance are detailed earlier.
Financial performance
Underlying EBIT increased by 165% (or US$263M) in FY18 to
US$422M. A 36% rise in the average realised price of alumina
(+US$388M) was partially offset by an increase in the caustic
soda price (-US$66M), lower sales volumes (-US$21M),
a stronger Australian dollar (-US$13M) and higher contractor
costs (-US$12M).

Worsley Alumina's realised alumina price in FY18 was 95% of
the Platts alumina index on a volume weighted M-1 basis. While
the vast majority of sales are linked to the index or observable
market rates, the discount primarily related to the structure of
certain legacy Mozal Aluminium supply contracts that are linked
to the LME aluminium price.

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$9M in FY18 to
US$52M as we invested in additional bauxite residue disposal
capacity and boiler maintenance. The level of expenditure will
remain elevated in FY19 (US$56M) and FY20 as we continue to
invest in additional bauxite residue disposal and water
catchment capacity.

South Africa Aluminium (100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production decreased by 2kt
in FY18 to 712kt as the smelter progressively returned all pots
to service following an electric arc incident in the December
2017 quarter. Production is expected to increase to 720kt in
both FY19 and FY20 as the smelter continues to test its
technical capacity.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs increased by 26% in FY18 to US$1,826/t as
a significant rise in raw material input costs created inflationary
pressure across the aluminium value chain. Alumina, coke, pitch
and aluminium price-linked electricity accounted for 70% of the
smelter's cost base in FY18 (FY17: 65%). 122 pots were also
relined across FY18 at a cost of US$220k per pot (FY17: 75 pots
at US$234k per pot). 182 pots are scheduled to be relined in
FY19, reflecting a peak in the relining cycle.

While Operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost
profile of South Africa Aluminium will continue to be heavily
influenced by the price of power and raw material inputs, given its
highly variable cost base. The smelter sources alumina from our
Worsley Alumina refinery with prices linked to the Platts alumina
index on an M-1 basis, while its power is sourced from Eskom
under long-term contracts. The price of electricity supplied to
potlines 1 and 2 is linked to the LME aluminium price and the
South African rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price of
electricity supplied to potline 3 is South African rand based.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 3% (or US$6M) in FY18 to
US$213M as a 20% increase in the average realised price of
aluminium (+US$262M) was offset by higher alumina, pitch and
coke input costs (-US$199M), a rise in aluminium price-linked
electricity costs (-US$31M) and a stronger South African rand
(-US$19M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$13M in FY18 to
US$28M. A modest decrease in Sustaining capital expenditure
to US$24M is expected in FY19.

Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased to a record
271kt in FY18 as the smelter continued to test its maximum
technical capacity. Production is expected to decline
marginally to 269kt in FY19 as the smelter reaches a peak in
its pot relining cycle, before increasing to 273kt in FY20 as
incremental production is progressively delivered from the
AP3XLE energy efficiency project.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs increased by 21% in FY18 to US$1,810/t as
a significant rise in raw material input costs created inflationary
pressure across the aluminium value chain. Alumina, coke and
pitch accounted for 49% of the smelters cost base in FY18
(FY17: 45%). 60(30) pots were also relined across FY18 at a cost
of US$211k per pot (FY17: 94(30) pots at US$204k per pot).
126(30) pots are scheduled to be relined in FY19, reflecting a peak
in the relining cycle.

While Operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost
profile of Mozal Aluminium will continue to be heavily influenced
by the price of power and raw material inputs, given its highly
variable cost base. The smelter sources alumina from our
Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a
percentage of the LME aluminium index and the remainder linked
to the Platts alumina index on an M-1 basis, with caps and floors
embedded within specific contracts. Its electricity requirements
are largely met by hydroelectric power that is generated by
Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power into
Eskom's South African grid and Mozal Aluminium sources
electricity via the Mozambique Transmission Company (Motraco)
under a long term contract. The price of electricity is South African
rand based with the rate of escalation linked to a South Africa
domestic production price index plus margin.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased 30% (or US$23M) in FY18 to
US$99M as a 20% increase in the average realised price of
aluminium (+US$106M) was partially offset by higher alumina,
pitch and coke input costs (-US$47M), and a rise in South African
rand-linked electricity costs (-US$8M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$4M in FY18 to
US$10M and is expected to rise further to US$18M in FY19. The
US$18M AP3XLE energy efficiency project remains on schedule
with first incremental production anticipated in FY20 and the full
benefit to be realised by FY24. The project is expected to deliver
a circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in annual production with no
associated increase in power consumption.

Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable production decreased by 2% (or 25kt)
in FY18 to 1.30Mt as unplanned maintenance and power
outages impacted performance. Production is expected to
increase to 1.36Mt in FY19 and 1.37Mt in FY20 following
completion of the De-bottlenecking Phase One project.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs increased by 28% in FY18 to US$252/t as
the price of caustic soda increased by 41% and the cost of
bauxite from MRN was reset in accordance with its linkage to
aluminium and alumina. The caustic consumption rate also rose
temporarily as lower quality bauxite feed was required following
the impact of adverse weather in the Amazon Basin during the
September 2017 quarter.

Financial performance

Alumina Underlying EBIT increased by 128% (or US$88M) in
FY18 to US$157M as a 40% increase in the average realised
price of alumina (+US$159M) was partially offset by higher
caustic soda (-US$18M) and bauxite (-US$22M) costs.

Aluminium Underlying EBIT decreased by US$18M in FY18 to a
loss of US$21M as our obligation to purchase electricity from
Eletronorte was fulfilled during the period, following termination of
the contract in December 2015. The sale of surplus electricity
generated other income of US$36M in H1 FY18, although this
was more than offset by the utilisation of the associated onerous
contract provision and the recognition of a US$16M provision to
reflect transmission charges that will no longer be offset by
ongoing electricity purchases.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by US$8M in FY18 to
US$12M as the De-bottlenecking Phase One project was
completed in March 2018. Sustaining capital expenditure is
expected to increase by US$28M in FY19 to US$40M as we
invest in additional bauxite residue disposal capacity, boiler
maintenance and commence the De-bottlenecking Phase Two
project. This project is expected to increase our share of alumina
production to 1.43Mt from FY21.

South Africa Energy Coal (92% share)

Volumes
South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 6%
(or 1.6Mt) in FY18 to 27.3Mt as domestic demand remained
subdued and our product mix was reweighted towards the export
market. We have lowered our FY19 saleable coal production guidance 
to 29Mt with export volumes expected to decline to 11.5Mt due to 
an extended outage of the dragline at Klipspruit as structural 
damage was incurred in the process of swinging the boom on
17 August 2018. This guidance is preliminary in nature and
assumes that mobile fleet mitigates the impact across the
remainder of the year. Conversely, domestic volumes are
expected to rise as we sell additional lower quality stockpiled
product under the terms of a new contract. Production is
expected to increase in FY20 to approximately 30Mt.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 24% in FY18 to US$36/t as
general inflation and an unfavourable movement in exchange
rates impacted the largely South African rand cost base. Costs
were further impacted by additional washing and logistics
charges as we intentionally increased the proportion of higher
margin export sales to maximise margins and returns.

We expect Operating unit costs to increase to approximately
US$41/t in FY19 largely as a result of the extended dragline
outage at Klipspruit and an increase in material movement at the
WMC. The management of South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-
alone business from 30 April 2018 is expected to deliver a
reduction in the Group's functional costs and additional
procurement savings amounting to US$50M from FY20.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit
cost guidance are detailed above.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 30% (or US$64M) in FY18 to
US$276M as higher average realised prices (+US$228M) were
partially offset by general inflation (-US$43M), an increase in
activity and labour costs (-US$37M), a stronger South African
rand (-US$35M) and a drawdown of inventory (-US$54M).

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$46M in FY18 to
US$102M as we continued to invest in new mining areas at the
WMC. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to decrease by
US$36M in FY19 to US$66M as activity at the WMC returns to
typical levels. We also invested US$62M in FY18 to progress the
4.3B(13) South African rand KPSX project, which was approved
by the Board in November 2017. The 8Mt per annum brownfield
project extends the life of the colliery by more than 20 years. The
project is approximately 20% complete and remains on schedule
and budget, with the level of expenditure expected to rise to
US$165M in FY19. Guidance for capital expenditure does not
include any assessment of the cost of repairing the dragline at
Klipspruit.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100% share)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by
40% (or 2.8Mt) in FY18 to 4.2Mt as the Appin colliery recovered
from an extended outage and achieved an annualised mining
rate of more than 6Mt throughout the month of June. Saleable
coal production is expected to increase by 44% in FY19 to
6.1Mt, with a further 15% increase to 7.0Mt anticipated in
FY20 as the Appin colliery reverts to a two longwall operation.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs increased by 78% in FY18 to US$142/t. We
expect Operating unit costs to decrease by 26% in FY19 to
US$105/t as production ramps-up and a general improvement in
productivity is achieved across our supply chain. Exchange rate
and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are
detailed above.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$420M in FY18 to a loss of
US$62M as lower sales volumes (-US$525M) and one-off costs
associated with the Appin restart plan (-US$23M) more than
offset higher average realised coal prices (+US$78M), lower
selling and distribution costs (+US$30M), and lower price-linked
royalties (+US$30M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by US$15M in FY18 to
US$89M as underground development was impacted by the
extended outage. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to
increase by US$81M in FY19 to US$170M as we raise the level
of underground development to US$97M (FY18: US$37M) to
facilitate the progressive ramp-up in production to historic rates of
more than 8Mt per annum.

Australia Manganese (60% share)

Volumes

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by
13% (or 402kwmt) to a record 3.4Mwmt in FY18 as the PC02
circuit operated at approximately 107% of its design capacity
and contributed 9% of total production (6% FY17). Saleable
Manganese alloy production increased by 12% (or 18kt) to
165kt in FY18 as all four furnaces continued to operate.
Ore production guidance of 3.4Mwmt in FY19 currently
assumes we continue to operate the low cost PC02 circuit
above nameplate capacity. As this PC02 product attracts a
discount to our primary higher grade GEMCO ore, we will
continue to adjust its performance in response to market
demand.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs increased by 7% in
FY18 to US$1.63/dmtu as a stronger Australian dollar, a rise in
planned maintenance and higher price linked royalties more than
offset underlying productivity gains. We expect Operating unit
costs to remain unchanged at US$1.63/dmtu in FY19 as broader
productivity gains mitigate a further increase in strip ratio
(FY19: 4.2, FY18: 4.0) and a temporary decline in product yield.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19 Operating unit
cost guidance are detailed above.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 39% (or US$184M) in FY18 to
US$651M. Higher realised ore and alloys prices (+US$202M)
and an increase in sales volumes (+US$58M) were only partially
offset by a rise in raw material input prices (coke, energy, diesel)
(-US$16M) and additional freight and marketing costs
(-US$13M).

Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of
approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and product-
type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44%
manganese lump ore index. Notwithstanding the contribution
of the PC02 circuit to our sales profile, our average realised
price for external sales of Australian ore in FY18 reflects a
modest premium to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore
index on a volume weighted M-1 basis(34) in FY18.

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$20M in FY18 to
US$48M and is expected to rise to US$75M in FY19 as we
continue to invest in additional tailings storage capacity. Our
FY19 plan also includes investment within our alloys business of
US$8M.

South Africa Manganese (Ore 44.4% share, Alloy 60% share)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by
5% (or 107kwmt) in FY18 to 2.1Mwmt as we continued to take
advantage of favourable market conditions by selling lower
quality fines product and utilising higher cost trucking as an
additional route to market. Manganese alloy saleable
production increased by 8% (or 6kt) in FY18 to 79kt as we
continued to operate one of Metalloys' four furnaces.

Ore production is currently expected to remain largely
unchanged at 2.1Mwmt in FY19. This is premised upon an
underlying increase in production for our premium products
and a reduction in lower quality, fine grained material that has
historically attracted grade and product-type discounts.
Production will, however, continue to be adjusted in response
to market demand.

Operating costs

FOB manganese Operating unit costs increased by 21% to
US$2.53/dmtu in FY18 as a result of a stronger South African
rand, higher price-linked royalties and additional costs associated
with opportunistic trucking activity. We expect Operating unit
costs to remain largely unchanged at US$2.56/dmtu in FY19,
with a weaker South African rand and an improvement in
equipment utilisation expected to offset the impact of marginally
lower production. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19
Operating unit cost guidance are detailed above.  

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 69% (or US$76M) in FY18 to
US$186M as a significant improvement in ore and alloy prices
(+US$107M) was only partially offset by a stronger South African
rand (-US$14M), an increase in costs associated with
opportunistic trucking (-US$14M) and higher price-linked
royalties (-US$5M).

Our lower quality fine grained material, which accounted for
13% of sales across FY18 (9% FY17), receives a product
discount when referenced to index prices. As a result, our
average realised price for external sales of South African ore
reflected a 5% discount to the medium grade 37% manganese
lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on a
volume weighted M-1 basis(39).

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$8M in FY18 to
US$17M and is expected to rise to US$35M in FY19 as we invest
in mobile fleet and extract a boundary pillar at our Mamatwan
mine. Our FY19 plan also includes investment within our alloys
business of US$7M.

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production increased by 20%
(or 7.3kt) in FY18 to 43.8kt as ore grades temporarily
improved with the ramp up of La Esmeralda and the operation
continued to benefit from an improvement in plant utilisation
and throughput rates. We have increased payable nickel
production guidance by 4% to 40.5kt in FY19 as a further
improvement in plant utilisation and throughput rates is
expected to partially offset the impact of lower grades.
Production is expected to decrease again in FY20 to 35.6kt as
ore grades continue to decline and a major refurbishment of
the furnace is undertaken to broaden its operating window.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs decreased by 3% in FY18 to US$3.67/lb as
the increase in production more than offset a substantial increase
in price-linked royalties. We expect Operating unit costs to
increase by 15% in FY19 to US$4.21/lb as lower production and
higher price-linked royalties are expected to more than offset
additional productivity gains. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY19 Operating unit cost guidance are detailed
above.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$136M in FY18 to US$120M
as the higher average realised nickel price (+US$114M) and rise
in sale volumes (+US$68M) were partially offset by an increase
in price-linked royalties (-US$20M) and energy costs
(-US$9M), which were mitigated by our energy optimisation
strategy (+US$6M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$8M in FY18 to
US$22M as the higher grade La Esmeralda ore body was
connected to the broader operation with the completion of a
permanent access bridge. Sustaining capital expenditure is
expected to rise to US$41M in FY19 as we prepare for the
major furnace refurbishment in FY20.

Cannington (100% share)

Volumes
Cannington silver, lead and zinc payable production
decreased by 20%, 21% and 41%, respectively, in FY18 as
mining and processing rates were reset in order to deliver
greater predictability and stability in the underground mine.
Although grade variability is expected to persist over the
remaining life of the operation as the stope sequence is
optimised to maximise long term value, zinc equivalent
payable metal production(22) is expected to remain unchanged
in FY19 (11.8Moz for silver, 98.0kt for lead and 51.0kt for
zinc), and FY20 (10.9Moz for silver, 94.7kt for lead and 57.3kt
for zinc).

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 13% to US$150/t in FY18 as
geological complexity and lower throughput rates more than
offset a reduction in treatment and refining charges and the
benefit we achieved by further optimising energy supply and
logistics. We expect Operating unit costs to decrease marginally
to US$147/t in FY19 as mill throughput increases and we benefit
from lower power costs following the renegotiation of a supply
contract. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY19
Operating unit cost guidance are detailed above.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 41% (or US$125M) in FY18 to
US$183M as the decline in sales volumes (-US$221M) was
partially offset by higher average realised prices (+US$37M), a
reduction in negotiated treatment and refining charges
(+US$38M), and lower royalty (+US$10M) and logistics costs
(+US$10M). Finalisation adjustments and the provisional
pricing of Cannington concentrates increased Underlying
EBIT by US$0.1M in FY18 (FY17: US$4.1M, H1 FY18:
US$5.5M). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2.2Moz
of silver, 18.8kt of lead and 4.9kt of zinc) were revalued at 30
June 2018. The final price of these sales will be determined in
the December 2018 half year.

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$15M to US$51M
in FY18 as we commissioned a new underground crusher in the
March 2018 quarter and invested in additional underground
development that will create greater operating flexibility in the
mine. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to remain
largely unchanged at US$50M in FY19 as underground
development rates remain elevated and we invest in additional
tailings storage capacity.

Notes
(1)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products.
(2)   FY18 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY18 (5,159 million). FY18 basic
      Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY18.
      FY17 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY17 (5,307 million). FY17 basic
      Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY17.
(3)   FY18 ordinary dividend per share is calculated as H1 FY18 ordinary dividend announced (US$223M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 31 December
      2017 (5,181 million) plus H2 FY18 ordinary dividend announced (US$317M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 30 June 2018 (5,120 million).
(4)   H1 FY18 special dividend per share is calculated as H1 FY18 special dividend announced (US$155M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 31 December
      2017 (5,181 million).
(5)   Underlying EBIT is profit before net finance costs, tax and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments. Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of South32's
      share of net finance costs and tax of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings
      is Profit/(loss) after tax and earnings adjustment items. Underlying earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group,
      make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and
      operational management are assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following
      items are adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:
           -     Exchange rate (gains)/losses on restatement of monetary items;
           -     Impairment losses/(reversals);
           -     Net (gains)/losses on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;
           -     Fair value (gains)/losses on non-trading derivative instruments;
           -     Major corporate restructures; and
           -     Earnings adjustments included in profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments.
      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to determine
      Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.
(6)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(7)   Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(8)   Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as Underlying EBIT less the discount on
      rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), divided by the sum of fixed assets (excluding
      any rehabilitation asset and impairments) and inventories. Manganese is included in the calculation on a proportional consolidation basis.
(9)   To ensure that incident classification definitions are applied uniformly across our workforce, we have adopted the United States Government Occupational Safety
      and Health Assessment (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses.
(10) Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF): The sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases) x 1,000,000
     ÷ actual hours worked, for employees and contractors. Stated in units of per million hours worked.
(11) Figure has been restated since it was previously reported due to the reclassification of a recordable illness to a recordable injury.
(12) Based on revenue equivalent sales or production (where applicable) which assumes average realised prices remain unchanged from FY18.
(13) Refer to the market announcement ""South32 approves Klipspruit Life Extension Project"" dated 27 November 2017.
(14) The information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa Project are qualifying foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and reference
     should be had to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement 'South32 to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer' dated 18
     June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially
     impacts on the reliability of the estimates. South32 confirms that the information contained in the clarifying statement in the 18 June 2018 market announcement
     continues to apply and has not materially changed. The estimates of Mineral Resources are not reported in accordance with the JORC Code. Competent persons
     have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and
     further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code.
(15) Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs variance reflects
     the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded consumables. Foreign exchange reflects the
     impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance reflects the revenue impact of sales volume changes, based
     on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the impact from changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base,
     including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on expenditure, and period-on-period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance
     excludes earnings adjustments including significant items.
(16) Underlying net finance cost and Underlying tax expense are actual FY18 results, not year-on-year variances.
(17) South32's ownership share of operations are presented as follows: Worsley Alumina (86% share), South Africa Aluminium (100%), Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share),
     Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share), South Africa Energy Coal (92% share), Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100%), Australia Manganese (60%
     share), South Africa Manganese (60% share), Cerro Matoso (99.9% share), and Cannington (100%).
(18) Underlying ETR is Underlying income tax expense, excluding royalty related tax, divided by Underlying profit before tax; both the numerator and denominator exclude
     equity accounted investments.
(19) The Colombian corporate tax rate was 40% until 31 December 2017. The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues instead of income tax.
(20) Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure comprises
     Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB), Minor discretionary and
     Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.
(21) The Eagle Downs consideration also includes a deferred payment of US$27M due three years after completion and a coal price-linked production royalty which is
     capped at US$80M.
(22) Payable Zinc Equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating revenues from payable sliver, lead and zinc, and dividing the total revenue by price of zinc. FY18 realised
     prices for zinc (US$3,185/t), lead (US$2,463/t) and silver (US$16.6/oz) was used for FY18, FY19e and FY20e. Zinc equivalent is used to compare Cannington with
     recently acquired Hermosa project which is currently reported in zinc equivalent terms.
(23) South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are repaid.
(24) Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, excluding third party sales, divided by sales volumes. Operating cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA
     excluding third party sales. Additional manganese disclosures are included in footnotes 36 and 41.
(25) Third party products and services sold comprise US$206M for aluminium, US$49M for alumina, US$290M for coal, US$198M for freight services and US$124M for
     aluminium raw materials. Underlying EBIT on third party products comprise US$11M for aluminium, US$2M for alumina, US$12M for coal,
     (US$1)M for freight services and US$1M for aluminium raw materials.
(26) The information that relates to the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of Worsley Alumina was declared in the market announcement ""Worsley Alumina Ore
     Reserves Update"" dated 23 August 2018. South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the
     original announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and
     have not materially changed. South32 confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Persons' findings are presented have not been materially modified
     from the original market announcement.
(27) Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume.
(28) Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by sales volume.
(29) Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales
     Revenue divided by sales volume.
(30) Presented on a 100% basis.
(31) Alumina operating unit cost includes cost of acquiring bauxite mainly from MRN.
(32) South Africa Energy Coal Revenue includes domestic and export sales Revenue.
(33) Illawarra Metallurgical Coal Revenue includes metallurgical coal and energy coal sales Revenue.
(34) The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on the basis of a one month lag to published
     pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$6.45/dmtu in FY18.
(35) Volumes and realised prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised ore prices are calculated as
     external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by external sales volume. Realised alloy prices are calculated as sales Revenue, including sinter
     revenue, divided by alloy sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction.
(36) FY18 average manganese content of ore sales was 45.7% on a dry basis (FY17: 46.2%). 94% of FY18 external manganese ore sales (FY17: 95%) were completed
     on a CIF basis. FY18 realised FOB ore prices and operating unit costs have been adjusted for freight and marketing costs of US$43M (FY17: US$30M), consistent
     with our FOB cost guidance.
(37) FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit cost is revenue less
     Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes and includes costs associated with sinter sold externally.
(38) Revenues associated with sales from GEMCO to TEMCO are eliminated as part of the consolidation. Internal sales occur on a commercial basis.
(39) The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on the basis of a one month
     lag to published pricing (Month minus one or ""M-1"") was US$5.46/dmtu in FY18.
(40) Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised ore prices are calculated as external
     sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by external sales volume. Realised alloy prices are calculated as sales Revenue, divided by alloy sales
     volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction. Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60%
     accounting effective interest.
(41) FY18 average manganese content of ore sales was 39.9% on a dry basis (FY17: 40.1%). 70% of FY18 external manganese ore sales (FY17: 63%) were completed
     on a CIF basis. FY18 realised FOB ore prices and operating costs have been adjusted for freight and marketing costs of US$33M (FY17: US$24M), consistent with
     our FOB cost guidance.
(42) FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit cost is revenue less
     Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes.
(43) Revenues associated with sales from Hotazel Manganese Mines (HMM) to Metalloys are eliminated as part of the consolidation. Internal sales occur on a commercial
     basis.
(44) Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%. South32 has a
     44.4% ownership interest in HMM. 26% of HMM is owned by a B-BBEE consortium comprising Ntsimbintle Mining (9%), NCAB Resources (7%), Iziko Mining (5%)
     and HMM Education Trust (5%). The interests owned by NCAB Resources, Iziko Mining and HMM Education Trust were acquired using vendor finance with the
     loans repayable via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in HMM. Until these loans are repaid, South32's interest in HMM is accounted at
     54.6%.
(45) Cerro Matoso Realised nickel sales price is inclusive of by-products. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume.
(46) Cerro Matoso Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by Payable nickel sales volume.
(47) Cannington Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact
     operating unit costs as related marketing costs and treatment and refining charges may change.
Figures in Italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.

Segment Information
(a) Description of segments
The operating segments (also referred to as operations), are organised and managed separately according to the nature of
products produced. Certain members of the Lead Team (the chief operating decision makers) and the Board of Directors monitor
the segment results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The
segment information for the manganese operations are presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the measure used
by the Group's management to assess their performance.

The principal activities of each operating segment as the Group is currently structured are summarised as follows:
 Operating segment                        Principal activities
 Worsley Alumina                          Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia, Australia
 South Africa Aluminium                   Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa
 Mozal Aluminium                          Aluminium smelter in Mozambique
 Brazil Alumina                           Alumina refinery in Brazil
 South Africa Energy Coal                 Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South Africa
 Illawarra Metallurgical Coal             Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales, Australia
 Australia Manganese                      Integrated producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and manganese alloys in
                                          Tasmania, Australia                                         
 South Africa Manganese                   Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa
 Cerro Matoso                             Integrated laterite ferronickel mining and smelting complex in Colombia
 Cannington                               Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland, Australia

All operations are operated or jointly operated by the Group except Brazil Alumina, which is operated by Alcoa.

(b) Segment results
The Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the significant difference in
profit margin earned on these sales.
It is the Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.
Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group financing (including
finance expense and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.

Unwind of the investment in Dreamvision
The Group's investment in Dreamvision Investments 15 (RF) (Pty) Ltd (Dreamvision) originated in 2006 through the formation of a
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) transaction. The transaction contained a lock-in period which expired in
November 2016 and the process to unwind the investment was triggered. Consequently, the Group elected to receive shares in
Exxaro Resources Limited in exchange for its shareholding in Dreamvision. The net valuation gain on the available for sale investment
in Dreamvision has been transferred from the financial assets reserve and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Subsequent Events
On 23 August 2018, the Directors resolved to pay a fully franked final dividend of US 6.2 cents per share (US$317 million) in  
respect of the 2018 financial year. The dividend will be paid on 11 October 2018. The dividend has not been provided for in the
consolidated financial statements and will be recognised in the 2019 financial year.

On 10 August 2018, the Group completed its acquisition of the remaining 83 per cent of issued and outstanding shares of Arizona
Mining Inc. that it did not already own via a plan of arrangement.

The transaction was completed for a total consideration of US$1.3 billion via a fully funded, all cash offer at CAD 6.20 per share. With
the acquisition now complete, Arizona Mining's shares have ceased trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and were delisted
from the TSX on 10 August 2018. The acquisition will be treated as an acquisition of assets as it involves the acquisition of exploration
licences and some exploration surface facilities.

Update on estimates of Ore Reserves for Worsley Alumina

South32 confirms an addition of 43 Mt to its Ore Reserves estimate as at 30 June 2018 for Worsley Alumina. The
increase relates to the first time reporting of Ore Reserves from the Marradong West area of the Worsley Alumina
project.

The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates as at 30 June 2018, are presented in Appendix 1, Table 1
and Table 3. A comparison to previously published Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates (as at 30
June 2017) are presented in Appendix 1, Table 2 and Table 4.

The estimates of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves have been reported in accordance with the Australasian
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 (JORC Code) and the
Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules.

The breakdown of the total estimates of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves into the specific JORC Code
categories is contained in the Appendix 1 Tables. This report also summarises the information contained in the
JORC Code Table 1, which is included in Appendix 2 of this report.
Estimate of Ore Reserves
The declared Ore Reserves estimates are based on the Worsley Alumina Mineral Resource estimates as at 30
June 2018.

Material and economic assumptions
Worsley Alumina’s Boddington Bauxite Mine (BBM) has been operating since 1984. The run-of-mine (ROM) ore
is crushed onsite before being transported by conveyor to the Worsley Alumina Refinery near Collie, in Western
Australia.

Sufficient studies have been undertaken to enable the Mineral Resource to be converted to Ore Reserve on the
basis of current operating methods and practices.

The capital costs are based on the expected future development of the mine, refinery, tailings facilities and
sustaining capital requirements. The costs have been accounted for in the operation’s valuation models.
    •    Operating costs are estimated as part of the South32 internal budgeting process, which also considers
         transport costs including current truck, conveyor and contractor rates.
    •    Other economic assumptions used for the valuation reflect South32’s internal views of demand, supply,
         volume forecasts and competitor analysis, and are commercially sensitive.

Ore Reserve classification
Proved and Probable Ore Reserve are derived from the respective Mineral Resource classification in accordance
with the JORC Code other than as noted below.
Approximately 4 Mt of Measured Mineral Resource was converted to a Probable Ore Reserve. This ore is subject
to contractual co-operation arrangements with Newmont’s Boddington Gold Mine and is under or in close
proximity to existing key infrastructure. Internal and planned dilution within ore reserve pit shells represents
<10.8% of the total Ore Reserve by mass and are considered to have the same level of confidence as the
reported Mineral Resource.

The Reserve Life reported as of 30 June 2018 reflects the scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore
Reserves in the current approved life of operation plan.

Mining method and assumptions
The BBM mining operations are centred on existing crushing and conveying hubs in the Saddleback and
Marradong mining areas.

Shallow, multi-pit, open-cut mining techniques (drill, blast, load and haul) are used by BBM and have been
developed over the last thirty-four years to efficiently extract bauxite from the discrete pods. This mining method
is used to model and report the 30 June 2018 Ore Reserve estimate.

The Ore Reserve is reported within mine design shells, generated using mine design assumptions, including
limiting factors (i.e. heritage sites, protected areas, thickness and mining constraints etc.), which are applied to
the resource model.

Processing method and assumptions
The Worsley Alumina Refinery produces alumina from bauxite exclusively sourced from BBM utilising the Bayer
refining process. This refining process is the industry standard used to produce alumina from gibbsitic bauxite
ores.
     •    Predicted recoveries at the refinery are derived using a historic recovery model over the life of the
          operation.
     •    Metallurgical recovery is assumed at 94.1%.
     •    Allowances have been made for deleterious elements in the life of operation plan valuation.


Cut-off grade
A variable cut-off grade ranging from 22.5-25% for A.Al2O3 and <=3.5% R.SiO2 is considered in the pit design
shells used for reporting the Ore Reserves. The Marradong West area is mined under a third-party access
agreement, which specifies a cut-off grade for individual pits. This pit scale cut-off grade is applied directly when
reporting the Marradong West Ore Reserve.

Estimation methodology
The Ore Reserve as at 30 June 2018 was estimated using updated mine design shells for ore and waste,
applying the current mining parameters, constraints, and exclusions, which were then confirmed in an economic
mine schedule.

Material modifying factors
The reported Ore Reserve is within the mine design shells, using current mining methods and practices. These
are fully contained within South32 mining tenements. The Ore Reserve is scheduled to be extracted within the
expected expiration date of all mining leases.

Worsley Alumina is an operating asset which has all the required infrastructure and environmental approvals
required to operate its existing mine sites. The requirement for future infrastructure and its expected approvals
have been considered in the mine schedule which assumes no outstanding or foreseeable issues with material
legal agreements or regulatory approvals. Long-term marketing arrangements are in place.

SOUTH32 COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF ARIZONA MINING

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) is pleased to announce that it has completed the
acquisition of the remaining 83 per cent of issued and outstanding shares of Arizona Mining that it did not already own
via a plan of arrangement. Under the terms of the transaction, former shareholders of Arizona Mining were entitled to
C$6.20 in cash for each common share held. The transaction consideration of US$1.3 billion was funded from cash
on hand.

With the acquisition now complete, Arizona Mining was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on 10
August 2018. Arizona Mining will also cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said: “The acquisition of Arizona Mining adds to our portfolio one of the
most exciting base metal projects in the industry. Our deep understanding of the high-grade Hermosa project and
surrounding land package, together with our extensive experience at Cannington, positions us well to bring the project
to development and deliver significant value to our shareholders.”

Work to enhance the design and development of the Hermosa Project will begin in the coming weeks. This will include
optimising studies and the commencement of the exploration decline which will allow drilling to test for extensions and
                                                                     [1]
further enhance our understanding of the existing high-grade resource .

Corporate Update
•   We started managing South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business in the June 2018 quarter. This important milestone
    has allowed us to simplify the Group and will deliver a meaningful reduction in functional costs, further
    mitigating industry-wide cost inflation. We expect to be in a position to disclose the expected savings when we report
    our FY18 financial results, with the full run-rate to be achieved from FY20. The process to broaden and transform the ownership 
    of South Africa Energy Coal is expected to commence in the September 2018 quarter.
•   One-off redundancy and restructuring charges of approximately US$60M (post-tax ~US$40M) are expected to be recorded in our FY18 
    financial results. These charges will be excluded from Underlying earnings, and relate to redundancies associated with the 
    simplification of the Group’s functional structures and the voluntary redundancy program undertaken at Illawarra Metallurgical 
    Coal during the March 2018 quarter.
•   On 29 May we signed a conditional agreement to acquire a 50% interest in the Eagle Downs metallurgical coal project in the
    Bowen Basin, Queensland for an upfront payment of approximately US$106M (excluding transaction costs), a deferred                                                                                                                         
    payment of US$27M due three years after completion and a coal price linked production royalty which is capped at US$80M[Note 1].
•   On 18 June we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 83% of issued and outstanding shares of Arizona Mining                                                                                                                        
    Inc. that we don’t already own via a statutory plan of arrangement, representing a fully funded, all cash offer of US$1.3B[Note 2]
    (C$1.8B). The transaction is subject to a vote of Arizona Mining shareholders on 2 August and a limited number of conditions as
    disclosed in the transaction announcement.
•   We bought back a further 98M shares for a cash consideration of US$254M during FY18. To 30 June 2018 we had completed
    US$620M of our approved US$1B capital management program, comprising the purchase of 204M shares at an average price
    of A$2.99 per share (US$466M) and a US$154M special dividend which was paid on 5 April 2018.
•   We invested US$41.3M in exploration programs during FY18 (US$2.3M capitalised). This included US$1.2M for our Equity
    Accounted Investments (EAI, US$0.6M capitalised) and US$21.3M to expand our exploration footprint and progress 18 early
    stage greenfield partnerships.                 
•   We received net distributions[Note 3] of US$561M (South32 share) from our manganese EAI in FY18, including US$165M in the June
    2018 quarter.
•   Our Underlying Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which excludes tax associated with our EAI, largely reflects the geographic
    distribution of the Group’s profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%,

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 3% (or 128kt) to 3.8Mt in FY18. The refinery did, however, finish the year on a
strong note as an increase in calciner availability underpinned a 7% increase in production in the June 2018 quarter. Calcined
alumina production is expected to approach nameplate capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) in FY19 as the refinery processes excess
hydrate stocks that were established in FY18. Calciner maintenance is planned for the September 2018 and March 2019 quarters.
                                                                                                                          
The average realised price for alumina sales in FY18 is expected to reflect a modest discount to the Platts alumina index[Note 7] 
on a volume weighted M-1 basis. This discount reflects the temporary increase in the alumina to aluminium price ratio recorded in 
the spot market throughout H2 FY18 and the structure of specific Mozal Aluminium supply contracts that are linked to the LME
aluminium price, which in this case reduces the price paid by our smelter.

South Africa Aluminium saleable production decreased by 2kt to 712kt in FY18 as the smelter progressively returned all pots to
service following an electric arc incident in the December 2017 quarter. Notwithstanding the smelter’s continued strong operating
performance, higher prices for alumina and aluminium price-linked power, and still elevated prices for pitch and coke have

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased marginally to a record 271kt in FY18 as the smelter continued to test its maximum

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 6% (or 1,642kt) to 27.3Mt in FY18 as domestic demand remained
subdued and sales volumes were reweighted towards the export market. The Wolverkrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC) continued
to exceed expectations as it benefitted from the ongoing investment that is providing access to higher margin export tonnes.
Domestic sales decreased by 9% in FY18 as a result of lower demand from the Duvha power station. The commencement of a
long term contract to sell lower quality stockpiles to a domestic customer underpinned the 10% increase in domestic sales in the
June 2018 quarter.

The redirection of volumes towards export markets, whilst margin accretive, has added washing and logistics costs and is
expected to contribute to a modest increase in Operating unit costs from our prior FY18 guidance of US$34/t.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 13% (or 402kwmt) to a record 3.4Mwmt in FY18 as the Premium
Concentrate Ore (PC02) circuit operated at approximately 107% of its design capacity, contributing 9% of total production (6%
FY17).

Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and product-type
discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Notwithstanding the contribution of the PC02 circuit
to our sales profile, our average realised price for external sales of Australian ore will reflect a modest premium to the 
high grade 44% manganese lump ore index on a volume weighted M-1 basis[Note 9] in FY18. Internal sales continue to occur on commercial 
terms. 

Manganese alloy saleable production increased by 12% (or 18kt) to 165kt in FY18 as all four furnaces continued to operate. 
The increase in quarterly sales reflects a permanent change to the shipping schedule for a specific customer.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 5% (or 107kwmt) to 2.1Mwmt in FY18 as we continued to take
advantage of favourable market conditions by selling lower quality fines product and utilising higher cost trucking. Planned
major maintenance at the Wessels underground mine remains on track for completion in July 2018 with the impact on production in
the June 2018 quarter mitigated by a draw down of inventory established in advance of the outage.

Our fine grained Wessels concentrate product, which accounted for 13% of sales across FY18 (9% FY17), receives a product
discount when referenced to index prices. As a result, our average realised price for external sales of South African ore will reflect 
a modest discount to the medium grade 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on a volume weighted         
M-1 basis[Note 10]. Internal sales continue to occur on commercial terms.

Manganese alloy saleable production increased by 8% (or 6kt) to 79kt in FY18 as Metalloys continued to operate one of its four
furnaces.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production increased by 20% (or 7.3kt) to 43.8kt in FY18 as ore grades temporarily improved with the
ramp up of La Esmeralda and the operation continued to benefit from an improvement in plant utilisation and throughput rates.
The improvement in the nickel market during H2 FY18 has resulted in higher price-linked royalties being paid by our operation 
and is expected to contribute to a modest increase in Operating unit costs from our prior FY18 guidance of US$3.61/lb.

Cannington silver, lead and zinc payable production increased by 37%, 33% and 45%, respectively, in the June 2018 quarter to
marginally exceed revised FY18 guidance. This significant improvement in performance was achieved as the mine moved through
a higher grade stope sequence, as planned. Annual and quarterly grade variability is expected to persist over the remaining life of
the operation as the stope sequence is optimised to maximise long term value. Metal production declined in FY18 as mining and
processing rates were reset in order to deliver greater predictability and stability in the underground mine[Note 11] .
                                                                                                                
Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will increase Underlying EBIT[Note 12] by US$0.1M in
FY18 (US$4.1M: FY17, US$5.5M: H1 FY18). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2.2Moz of silver, 18.8kt of lead and 4.9kt
of zinc) were revalued at 30 June 2018. The final price of these sales will be determined in the December 2018 half year.

        SOUTH32 TO ACQUIRE ARIZONA MINING IN AGREED ALL CASH OFFER


18 June 2018

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) and Arizona Mining Inc.
(TSX:AZ) (Arizona Mining) announced today that they have entered into an agreement for
South32 to acquire the remaining 83 per cent of issued and outstanding shares of Arizona
Mining                                           via                                             a
                                                                                   1
plan of arrangement, representing a fully funded, all cash offer of US$1.3 billion (C$1.8 billion).
The offer price of C$6.20 per share represents a 50 per cent premium to the closing price on 15
                                                                                 1
June and implies a total equity value for Arizona Mining of US$1.6 billion (C$2.1 billion).
Directors and officers of Arizona Mining, who own 34 per cent of the common shares on issue,
have entered into voting support agreements and the directors of Arizona Mining entitled to vote,
have unanimously recommended to their shareholders that they vote in favour of the transaction.

Arizona Mining is the owner of the Hermosa Project, containing the high grade base metals
Taylor deposit, the Central zinc, manganese and silver oxide resource and an extensive, highly
prospective land package with potential for discovery of polymetallic and copper mineralisation.
The Taylor deposit is a greenfield development project that has a reported resource of 101
                  2,3
million short tons (Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources) at 10.4% zinc equivalent grade
and is open at depth and laterally. The project is located close to key infrastructure in an
attractive mining jurisdiction. A Preliminary Economic Assessment completed by Arizona Mining
in January 2018 indicated that this low cost, long life project has the potential to deliver a very
                                            2
high Internal Rate of Return on investment .

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said: “Our all cash offer for Arizona Mining will
allow us to optimise the design and development of one of the most exciting base metal projects
in the industry. We have been a major shareholder in Arizona Mining since May 2017 and an
active participant in the Hermosa Project with representation on the operations committee and a
nominee on the board of directors. Our deep understanding of this high grade resource and
surrounding tenement package, and extensive experience at Cannington, makes us the natural
owner of this project and ensures we are well positioned to bring it to development, delivering
significant value to our shareholders.”

Arizona Mining founder and Executive Chairman, Richard Warke said: “South32’s all cash offer
of C$6.20 per share represents a premium reflective of the truly world class nature of the
Hermosa Project and allows shareholders to realise immediate value. In addition, the transaction
is not contingent on financing, which significantly reduces transaction risk.

Our board of directors and a special committee of three independent members from the board of
directors evaluated this offer and determined that it represented the best outcome for all
shareholders. Importantly, South32 knows the asset well and understands the significance of the
strong relationships that we have built in Arizona with all of our stakeholders. I wish South32 all
the best in developing Hermosa and the Taylor deposit.”

Forward-looking statements

This release may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about currency
exchange rates, commodity prices, production forecasts, plans, development decisions,
exploration and capital expenditure. These forward-looking statements reflect expectations at
the date of this release; however, they are not guarantees or predictions of future performance.
They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in the statements contained in this release. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on
forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable laws or regulations, neither
South32 Limited nor Arizona Mining Inc. undertakes to publicly update or review any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.
Mineral Resources – clarifying statements

The estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa Project (Arizona Mining) are foreign
estimates under the ASX Listing Rules reported in accordance with the National Instrument 43-
101 (NI 43-101) and filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on 16 January 2018.

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101, Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not
have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of mineral
resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. Inferred Mineral Resources are based on
limited drilling which suggests the greatest uncertainty for a resource estimate and that
geological continuity is only implied. Additional drilling will be required to verify geological and
mineralisation continuity and there is no certainty that all of the Inferred Resources will be
converted to Measured and Indicated Resources. Quantity and grades are estimates and are
rounded to reflect the fact that the resource estimate is an approximation.

The categories of Mineral Resource classification used are in accordance with NI 43-101. NI 43-
101 is a ‘qualifying foreign estimate’ (Chapter 19, ASX Listing Rules) and has similar categories
of resource classification as the JORC Code (Appendix 5A, ASX Listing Rules).

South32 considers these estimates to be both relevant and material to South32 given that this
project has the potential to be a material project to South32.

Reliability of estimate: South32 has experience of managing similar operations to the Hermosa
Project. South32’s key technical and operational personnel conducted site visits as part of the
due diligence process. Arizona Mining provided information used to estimate Mineral Resources
to South32 for review. The estimates of Mineral Resources were reported in compliance with NI
43-101 using independent consultants, AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Ltd (AMC). The
Qualified Person (as required by Canadian securities regulatory authorities) for the Mineral
Resource estimate was Dinara Nussipakynova, P.Geo, an employee of AMC.

The basis for the estimate as provided to South32 consists of a geological database
incorporating geology, analytical results and surface topography. Mining and processing
recoveries are based on the PEA completed by Arizona Mining for the Hermosa Project (Taylor
and Central Deposit). The PEA dated 16 January 2018 is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).

South32 believes that the information provided is the most recent publicly available. Following
completion of the transaction it is South32’s intention to conduct a work program to increase
confidence in the resource to ensure that resources are reported in accordance with the JORC
Code. The work program will include additional exploration by means of drilling and is anticipated
to be completed within three years and will be funded using internal cash reserves.

Cautionary statement:

    •   The estimates of Mineral Resources for the Hermosa Project (Arizona Mining) are
        foreign estimates under the ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance with
        the JORC Code.
    •   Competent persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as
        Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC Code.
    •   It is uncertain, that following evaluation and further exploration, the foreign estimates will
        be able to be reported as Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC code.
Competent persons’ statement

In accordance with ASX listing rule 5.12, Matthew Readford, a Competent Person, employee of
South32 and Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, confirms the
information in this market announcement that relates to the Hermosa Project NI 43-101 foreign
estimate filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on 16 January 2018 is an accurate representation of
the available data and studies for Hermosa Project provided to South32 by Arizona Mining.
Matthew Readford has sufficient relevant experience for the type of deposit and method of
extraction to qualify as a competent person in accordance with the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The JORC Code). Mr
Readford consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on their information in the
form and context in which it appears.

SOUTH32 QUARTERLY REPORT MARCH 2018   2
                                                     
•   Net cash increased by US$477M to US$1.9B[1] during the March 2018 quarter as commodity prices remained
    elevated, the prior build in working capital partially unwound, and we received net distributions totaling US$158M[2]from 
    our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI)(South32 share)and US$44M (pre-tax) from the sale of a financial asset. 
    Our strong financial position allowed us to return a further US$85M to shareholders during the period with the continuation 
    of our on-market share buy-back.

•   To 31 March 2018 we had completed US$390M of our approved US$1B capital management program, having
    bought back 176M shares at an average price of A$2.89 per share. Subsequent to the end of the quarter we
    returned an additional US$154M in the form of a special dividend, bringing total returns under our approved US$1B
    capital management program to US$544M. We also paid a fully franked interim dividend of US$221M on 5 April
    2018.

•   As a result of lower volumes, Operating unit costs at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal are expected to remain elevated in
    FY18 at US$150/t (prior guidance US$135/t) before benefitting from stronger production as our ramp up plan gains
    momentum. While FY18 Operating unit cost guidance at all other operations remains unchanged, the potential for
    a greater proportion of higher margin export tonnes at South Africa Energy Coal may increase Operating unit costs
    by approximately 5%. Stronger alumina prices, of which we are a net beneficiary, will also impact the cost base of
    our aluminium smelters over the remainder of FY18.

•   Capital expenditure (including EAI) guidance of US$525M for FY18 is unchanged with the rate of spend expected to
    increase in the June 2018 quarter as long lead time items are purchased for the Klipspruit Life Extension project.

•   We remain on track to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business during the June 2018 quarter,
    having concluded our structural consultation processes with impacted employees. This will allow us to simplify our
    business, lower overhead costs and fundamentally change the way we work.

•   We invested US$32.5M in exploration programs during the nine months ended 31 March 2018 (US$1.4M
    capitalised). This included US$1.1M for our EAI (US$0.6M capitalised) and US$16.5M of expenditure across 13
    projects associated with our portfolio of early stage greenfield exploration opportunities.

•   Our Underlying Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which excludes tax associated with our EAI, largely reflects the geographic
    distribution of the Group’s profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa                                       
    28%, Colombia 37%[3] , Mozambique[3] 0% and Brazil 34%.

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 4% (or 121kt) to 2.8Mt in the nine months ended March 2018,
despite the performance of the input circuit remaining largely unchanged at an annualised rate of 4.5Mt (100% basis).
Further calciner maintenance was undertaken in the March 2018 quarter and the refinery has established a substantial
hydrate position. While FY18 production guidance remains unchanged, it is predicated on our ability to convert hydrate to
calcined alumina during the June 2018 quarter.

First ore from the West Marradong sublease was processed during the March 2018 quarter. West Marradong is expected

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 6% (or 1.336kt) to 20.2Mt in the nine months ended
March 2018. Export coal production continued to exceed expectations as the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC)
benefitted from ongoing investment that is providing access to higher margin tonnes. In contrast, domestic production
from the WMC was lower as demand from the Duvha power station remained subdued and scheduled maintenance was
undertaken. Export sales increased by 11% in the March 2018 quarter as the prior weather related supply chain
constraint at Richards Bay Coal Terminal was cleared.

Whilst FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 27.5Mt (11.5Mt export; 16.0Mt domestic) persistent weakness in
domestic demand may result in a reduction of loss making domestic volumes across the remainder of FY18 and FY19.
While any reduction in domestic sales volumes or a reweighting towards export markets would be margin accretive,
average Operating unit costs would be impacted by increased washing and logistics costs, and reduction in volumes.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production decreased by 44% (or 2,318kt) to 3.0Mt in the nine months ended
March 2018 as the Appin colliery continued to ramp-up production following an extended outage. Given a greater focus
on coal clearance and ground rehabilitation activities at the Appin colliery during the quarter, and with two longwall moves 
planned before the end of the financial year, we now expect Illawarra Metallurgical Coal to produce 4.1Mt of saleable coal in 
FY18 (versus prior guidance of 4.5Mt). As a result, Operating unit costs are expected to remain elevated in FY18 at 
US$150/t (prior guidance US$135/t) before benefitting from increased production in FY19 as our ramp up plan gains momentum. 
In this context, more productive longwall and development performance is expected to underpin a recovery in production to 
more than 6Mt in FY19 and an anticipated return to historical rates of production above 8Mtpa from H2 FY20.

Cannington silver, lead and zinc payable production decreased by 33%, 31% and 50%, respectively, in the nine months
ended March 2018 as the operation transitioned to its replacement underground crusher and the mine plan moved

2018 quarter ahead of schedule and payable silver production increased by 28% as the mine plan entered a higher
grade sequence of stopes. FY18 production guidance (silver 12,200koz, lead 102kt, zinc 39kt) remains unchanged with
ore grades expected to increase in the June 2018 quarter, consistent with the mine plan.

CERRO MATOSO LITIGATION UPDATE

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises that on 9 April 2018 our
Cerro Matoso operation accepted notification of the decision handed down by the Constitutional
Court of Colombia in relation to alleged health and environmental impacts on the community
surrounding our Cerro Matoso operation. We are in the process of appealing the decision.

At this stage it is not possible to fully assess any potential financial or operational impacts, as the
decision orders various compensatory and remedial activities which are not yet quantifiable. Our
work is continuing to understand the impact of the decision and we will advise of any material
developments.

South32 is committed to contributing positively to the communities where we operate and is
proud of the work we do to support social and economic growth within the local community
surrounding Cerro Matoso.

About South32
South32 is a globally diversified mining and metals company with high quality operations in
Australia, Southern Africa and South America. Our purpose is to make a difference by developing
natural resources, improving people’s lives now and for generations to come. We are trusted by
our owners and partners to realise the potential of their resources. We have a simple strategy to
maximise the potential of our assets and shareholder returns by optimising our existing operations,

2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividends will be 68.10468

Restructuring our portfolio and delivering strong shareholder returns

""After a challenging start to the 2018 financial year, production for the majority of our operations is tracking on or ahead
of schedule. We achieved record production at Australia Manganese and Mozal Aluminium, increased production
guidance at South Africa Manganese in response to favourable market conditions, and delivered a 23 per cent increase
in payable nickel production at Cerro Matoso as ore grades improved.

""We also announced a 4.3B South African rand investment in the Klipspruit colliery, which will extend its life by
approximately 20 years, and our decision to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business to sustainably
improve its financial performance. This major strategic initiative will also allow us to transform the ownership of South
Africa Energy Coal, consolidate our functions and further reduce duplication.

""We continue to deliver strong returns by maintaining a disciplined and flexible approach to capital management. We
resolved to pay US$378M in shareholder dividends, directed US$93M to our buy-back program and announced a further
US$250M increase to our capital management program to US$1B, leaving US$540M outstanding.

""With a net cash balance of US$1.4B, working capital expected to partially unwind and Group volumes expected to
increase marginally in the second half, we are well positioned despite a reduction in future Cannington processing rates and
metal production.""

DECEMBER 2017 HALF YEAR SUMMARY

SAFETY

Nothing is more important to us than creating an environment where everyone goes home safe and well every day.
Through our Care Strategy we are building an inclusive workplace with a strong culture of care and accountability, where
work is well-designed and we continuously improve and learn. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF(9)(10))
declined from 6.0 to 4.9 per million hours worked in H1 FY18.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

In H1 FY18 we delivered a statutory profit after tax of US$543M as stronger commodity prices more than offset lower
volumes and broader inflationary pressure, most notably in our aluminium supply chain. Production guidance is
unchanged for the majority of our operations and Group volumes are expected to increase marginally in H2 FY18. With a
net cash balance of US$1.4B and working capital expected to partially unwind, we are well positioned despite a
reduction in future Cannington processing rates and metal production.

Specific performance highlights included:

-   Delivering record ore production at Australia Manganese and increasing production guidance at South Africa
    Manganese in response to favourable market conditions;

-   Achieving another production record at Mozal Aluminium and a 23% increase in nickel production at Cerro Matoso;

-   Approving the 4.3B South African rand investment to extend the life of the Klipspruit colliery by at least 20 years and
    increasing our exposure to Arizona Mining (TSX:AZ) by way of a prepayment designed to take our interest up to
    19.9%;

-   Exercising the second year of our Trilogy Metals (TSX:TMQ) option, in order to fully test the high grade copper
    extension at Bornite in Alaska and further increasing our exploration expenditure on greenfield base metal
    opportunities in Australia and South America;

-   Resolving to pay a fully franked interim dividend of US$223M, representing 41% of Underlying earnings in the
    December 2017 half year;

-   Showing the discipline and flexibility of our capital management program by returning an additional US$248M to
    shareholders by way of a partially franked (to 81%) special dividend (US$155M) and through the continuation of our
    on-market share buy-back (US$93M); and

-   Increasing our approved capital management program by US$250M to US$1B, leaving US$540M to be returned
    before April 2019.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL SEPARATION UPDATE

On 27 November 2017, we announced that we would manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business in
order to sustainably improve its financial performance and that we would simplify the way we manage the remainder of
our global portfolio. We are well advanced in our planning of this important strategic initiative and propose to implement
this new way of working during H2 FY18, unlocking additional value for shareholders.

With the management of South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone entity, we propose to consolidate our functions
across the Group. Removing our regional structures will allow us to have more direct lines of communication, streamline
our processes and further reduce duplication.

This new way of working will also include:

-   Reallocation of Chief Operating Officer accountabilities enabling us to fully capture value across our supply chain;

-   Aggregation of supply and marketing under the Chief Marketing Officer enabling us to leverage commercial
    expertise and optimise working capital management; and

-   Retention of a centralised marketing team and low cost service delivery centre.

We are currently finalising plans and will be commencing consultation with employees and key stakeholders. A further
update will be provided during H2 FY18.

EARNINGS

The Group's statutory profit after tax decreased by US$77M (or 12%) to US$543M in H1 FY18. The corresponding
period's profit benefitted from the recognition of a fair value gain on non-trading derivative instruments of US$189M.

Consistent with our accounting policies, various items are excluded from the Group's statutory profit to derive Underlying
earnings including: exchange rate losses associated with the restatement of monetary items (US$17M pre-tax); fair value
losses on non-trading derivative instruments (US$65M pre-tax); exchange rate losses associated with the Group's non
US dollar denominated debt (US$11M pre-tax); the tax expense for all pre-tax earnings adjustments and exchange rate
variations on tax balances (-US$61M) and significant items (-US$31M). Further information on these earnings
adjustments is included further on.

Underlying EBITDA increased by US$23M (or 2%) to US$1.1B for an operating margin of 35.7% in H1 FY18
(H1 FY17: 36.7%). Higher realised prices for most of our commodities during the period gave rise to a US$273M
increase in sales revenue, despite a significant reduction in coal and metal production at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and
Cannington, respectively. The Group's cost base was primarily impacted by external inflationary pressures such as a
stronger Australian dollar and South African rand, higher price-linked royalties and rising raw material input costs. The
latter pressure was most notable in our aluminium supply chain as higher caustic soda, energy, coke, pitch and alumina
prices reflected more buoyant commodity markets. Our operating leverage and long alumina position ensures we are a
net beneficiary of this dynamic.

Underlying EBIT increased 5% to US$724M, benefitting from a reduction in depreciation and amortisation. Underlying
earnings increased 14% to US$544M.

Tax expense

The Group's Underlying income tax expense, which excludes tax associated with equity accounted investments, was
US$121M for an Underlying effective tax rate(14) (ETR) of 28.0%. The Group's Underlying ETR largely reflects the
geographic distribution of the Group's profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%,
South Africa 28%, Colombia 40%, Mozambique 0%(15) and Brazil 34%.

The tax expense for equity accounted investments was US$137M, including royalty related taxation of US$31M at
GEMCO, for an ETR of 36.2%.

CASH FLOW

The Group's free cash flow from operations, excluding equity accounted investments, was US$52M in H1 FY18.
Stronger prices for our commodities and higher raw material inputs contributed to a build in working capital (+US$421M),
while the lagged effect of higher profitability in FY17 fed through to a significant increase in income tax payments
(+US$142M to US$181M, net, excluding tax paid within equity accounted investments).

Trade and other receivables increased by US$223M as days debtors temporarily rose to 25 days at 31 December 2017
(18 days as at 30 June 2017). This receivables balance is expected to partially unwind with days debtors projected to
decline towards the typical 20 days as there has been no change to customer payment terms. The temporary increase in
days debtors at period end primarily related to high value aluminium sales being concluded at the end of December.

The US$172M increase in the value of inventory held (primarily aluminium and metallurgical coal) reflects higher raw
material input costs in our aluminium supply chain and a temporary increase in finished goods at some operations.

The prior weather related deferral of activity at South Africa Energy Coal contributed to a US$50M increase in total                  
capital expenditure(16), excluding equity accounted investments, to US$202M. This included:

-   Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping
    (including underground development) of US$195M; and
-   Major project capital expenditure of US$4M relating to the Klipspruit Life Extension (KPSX) project.

The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation of exploration accounted for a further US$3M of expenditure.

Total capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments increased by US$10M to US$29M during
H1 FY18 as we invested in additional tailings storage capacity at Australia Manganese.

Total capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, was US$231M in H1 FY18.

BALANCE SHEET, DIVIDENDS & CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

As at 31 December 2017, the Group's net cash balance was US$1.4B, following the payment of our US$333M final
dividend in respect of FY17 and the purchase of a further 37M shares for a cash consideration of US$93M during
H1 FY18.

With our focus on value rather than execution speed we slowed the rate of our on-market buy-back during H1 FY18.
To 31 December 2017 we have purchased 143M shares at an average price of A$2.80 per share for a cash
consideration of US$305M.

Demonstrating the disciplined and flexible approach we are taking with our capital management program and our
confidence in our financial position, our Board has resolved to pay a fully franked interim dividend of US$223M,
representing 41% of Underlying earnings in H1 FY18 and a partially franked (to 81%) special dividend of US$155M.

Notwithstanding this 97% increase in dividend distributions, we have also increased our approved capital management
program by a further US$250M to US$1B, leaving US$540M to be returned before the end of April 2019.

OUTLOOK

PRODUCTION

FY18 production guidance is unchanged for the majority of our operations with Group volumes expected to increase
marginally in H2 FY18. Production at South Africa Manganese is expected to be 8% higher than our initial estimate as
market conditions for manganese remain strong. At Cannington, the stress regime is evolving as the orebody is being
depleted and we are moving to more challenging areas within the mine plan. In order to deliver greater predictability and
stability in the underground mine as the level of activity increases (80 stopes to be extracted in FY19, average of 50:
FY12-16), we are lowering the mining rate to 2.45 Mt per annum which is expected to translate to mill throughput of
2.3Mt and 2.4Mt in FY18 and FY19, respectively. FY18 production guidance and our forward plan for Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal remains unchanged. We will run a single longwall at Appin for the remainder of FY18 as part of a
staged ramp-up of activities, before targeting a return to a twin longwall configuration in the December 2018 quarter. We
will provide FY19 production guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal with our FY18 results to reflect the completion of
our annual planning cycle.

COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Industry cost curves steepened during H1 FY18 as a result of US dollar weakness, rising commodity prices and the
environmental policy response in China. Despite a strong focus on controllable costs, all of our operations are being
affected by these external factors to some degree with the pressure being most notable in our smelters and refineries
(caustic soda, alumina, price-linked power, pitch and coke).

Other expenditure guidance
Corporate costs of US$105M are now expected in FY18, an increase of US$25M relative to prior guidance to reflect a
greater rate of investment in technology in support of our operations and a rise in greenfield exploration activity (+US$5M
to US$25M).

Depreciation and amortisation (excluding equity accounted investments) of US$730M is now expected in FY18. The
US$30M reduction in guidance primarily relates to Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, where extraction and development rates
have been reset as a result of the extended outage at the Appin mine. Depreciation and amortisation guidance for our
equity accounted investments of US$85M is unchanged.

Capital expenditure guidance

We have lowered FY18 guidance for Sustaining capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, by US$5M
to US$465M. This minor adjustment reflects a further reduction in expenditure at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (-US$15M
to US$105M) and incrementally lower expenditure across the portfolio, which is partially offset by a higher rate of
investment at South Africa Energy Coal (+US$20M to US$132M) and revised exchange rate assumptions. This guidance
excludes Major project capital expenditure for the 4.3B rand South Africa Energy Coal KPSX project, which was
approved in November 2017. Major project capital expenditure guidance for FY18 has been increased by US$10M to
US$60M to reflect the timing of a number of long lead time items and revised exchange rate assumptions.

WORSLEY ALUMINA
(86% SHARE)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina hydrate production was largely unchanged at 1.95Mt in H1 FY18 as the refinery's input circuit continued to operate at a rate of 4.5Mtpa
(100% basis). In contrast, calcined alumina production declined by 4% (or 75kt) to 1.87Mt in H1 FY18 as scheduled maintenance was undertaken and a 
substantial hydrate inventory position was established. 

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 4.0Mt with additional calciner maintenance scheduled for the March 2018 quarter.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 12% to US$224/t in H1 FY18 as the price of caustic soda increased, consumption rates rose temporarily and the 
Australian dollar strengthened. 

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$235/t to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions, and a 
significantly higher price of caustic soda, albeit caustic consumption is expected to decline in H2 FY18 with the introduction of bauxite feed from 
West Marradong. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 531% (or US$138M) in H1 FY18 to US$164M as a 37% rise in the average realised price of alumina (+US$184M) was partially 
offset by an increase in the price of caustic soda and caustic consumption rates (-US$39M), and a stronger Australian dollar (-US$8M).

Capital expenditure
Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$22M in H1 FY18. Expenditure in H2 FY18 will be primarily directed towards bauxite residue disposal 
capacity and  boiler maintenance.

SOUTH AFRICA ALUMINIUM 
(100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 2kt) to 358kt in H1 FY18 and remains on track to increase in 
FY18 despite an electric arc incident on 30 November 2017 which impacted 39 pots. These pots are being progressively returned to 
service during the March 2018 quarter. A temporary increase in finished goods inventory related to our shipping schedule is expected to 
unwind in H2 FY18. 

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 720kt.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 22% to US$1,680/t in H1 FY18 as higher raw material input costs for alumina, coke and pitch, and 
higher aluminium price-linked electricity costs for the smelter were absorbed. This rise in raw material costs and the stronger 
aluminium price contributed to a significant increase in the value of inventory. 

A total of 44 pots were relined across H1 FY18 at a cost of US$196k per pot (H1 FY17: 50 pots at US$211k per pot). 145 pots are 
scheduled to be relined in FY18. 

While operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost profile of the smelter will continue to be heavily influenced by
power and raw material inputs, given the operation's high variable cost base. Hillside sources power from Eskom under long-term 
contracts with the price of electricity supplied to potlines 1 and 2 linked to the LME aluminium price and the 
South African rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price of electricity supplied to potline 3 is South African rand based.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 33% (or US$30M) in H1 FY18 to US$120M as a 23% increase in the average
realised price of aluminium (+US$138M) was largely offset by an increase in raw material input costs (-US$81M) and
aluminium price-linked electricity costs (-US$18M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$13M in H1 FY18 following a deferral of activity in FY17.

MOZAL ALUMINIUM 
(47.1% SHARE)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 1kt) to a record 137kt in H1 FY18 as the smelter
continued to operate at its maximum technical capability. Aluminium sales increased by 10% as our inventory
position returned to more normal levels, however the timing of those sales fed through to our receivables
balance and an increase in average days debtors for the Group.

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 269kt.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 17% to US$1,694/t in H1 FY18 as the cost of raw material inputs (alumina, coke
and pitch) increased.
             
A total of 34(22) pots were relined in H1 FY18 at a cost of US$191k per pot (H1 FY17: 39(22) pots at US$193k per pot).  
82(22) pots are scheduled to be relined in FY18. 

While operating unit cost guidance is not provided, the cost profile of the smelter will continue to be heavily 
influenced by power and raw material inputs, given the operation's high variable cost base. Mozal Aluminium utilises 
hydroelectric power that is generated by Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power into the South African 
grid to Eskom and Mozal Aluminium sources electricity via the Mozambique Transmission Company (Motraco) under a long term 
contract. The price of electricity supplied is South African rand based with the rate of escalation linked to a South Africa 
domestic production price index plus margin.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 140% (or US$35M) in H1 FY18 to US$60M as a 25% increase in the average
realised price of aluminium (+US$65M) and higher sales volumes (+US$23M) were partially offset by higher alumina,
pitch and coke input costs (-US$20M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$8M in H1 FY18. The US$18M AP3XLE energy efficiency project,
which was approved in August 2017, remains on schedule with first incremental production anticipated in FY20 and the
full benefit to be realised by FY24. The project will deliver a circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in annual production with no
associated increase in power consumption.

BRAZIL ALUMINA
(ALUMINA 36% SHARE, ALUMINIUM 40% SHARE)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable production increased by 3kt to 676kt in H1 FY18 as the refinery continued to operate at capacity.

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 1.3Mt with Phase I of the refinery de-bottlenecking project nearing completion.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs at the non-operated refinery increased by 21% to US$234/t in H1 FY18 as the price of caustic soda
increased and consumption rates rose temporarily as lower quality bauxite feed was introduced following a weather
related disruption to supply from MRN.

Financial performance

Alumina Underlying EBIT increased by 392% (or US$47M) in H1 FY18 to US$59M as a 44% increase in the average
realised price of alumina (+US$73M) was partially offset by higher caustic soda (-US$9M) and fuel oil (-US$12M) costs.

Aluminium Underlying EBIT decreased by US$10M to a loss of US$12M as our obligation to purchase electricity from
Eletronorte was fulfilled during the period, following termination of the contract in December 2015. The sale of
surplus electricity generated other income of US$36M, although this was more than offset by the utilisation of the
associated onerous contract provision and the recognition of a US$12M provision to reflect transmission charges that will
no longer be offset by ongoing electricity purchases.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased to US$10M in H1 FY18 with the de-bottlenecking Phase I project nearing completion.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL
(92% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 1.4Mt) to 13.4Mt in H1 FY18. Export coal
production exceeded expectations as productivity lifted at both the Klipspruit mine and the export oriented areas of
the WMC. In contrast, domestic production was impacted by a reduction in demand from the Duvha power station
and scheduled maintenance in the domestically focused areas of the WMC. The continued build of inventory
across H1 FY18 reflects ongoing constraint in the supply chain and weather related delays at the 
Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 27.5Mt (11.5Mt export; 16.0Mt domestic).

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 38% to US$36/t in H1 FY18 as the South African rand strengthened, the
proportion of higher margin export tonnes (with associated washing and logistics costs) increased and an area of in-pit
inventory at the WMC was written down to net realisable value.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$34/t to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 10% (or US$13M) in H1 FY18 to US$115M. Higher average export (+US$77M)
and domestic (+US$28M) realised prices were more than offset by lower sales volumes (-US$30M), an increase in
planned maintenance and labour costs (-US$48M), inflation (-US$22M) and a stronger South African rand (-US$21M).
The operation's costs were also impacted by the net realisable value write-down of an area of in-pit inventory at
the WMC (-US$8M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$68M in H1 FY18 as activity previously deferred as a result of adverse
weather was completed. Sustaining capital expenditure will continue to be directed towards the WMC in H2 FY18 given
the requirement to open-up new mining areas. FY18 guidance for Sustaining capital expenditure has been
increased by US$20M to US$132M.

We also invested US$4M in H1 FY18 to progress the 4.3B South African rand KPSX project, which was approved by the
Board in November 2017. The 8Mtpa brownfield project will extend the life of the Klipspruit colliery by more than 20 years.

ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL
(100%)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by 50% (or 1.9Mt) to 1.9Mt in H1 FY18 as the Appin
colliery recovered from an extended outage and the Dendrobium longwall progressed through a faulted zone.

FY18 production guidance of 4.5Mt remains unchanged with a longwall move now scheduled for Dendrobium in
the June 2018 quarter.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 99% to US$149/t in H1 FY18, commensurate with the significant reduction in coal sales.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$135/t to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$193M in H1 FY18 to a loss of US$84M as lower sales volumes (-US$258M) more
than offset higher average realised coal prices (+US$36M), lower price-linked royalties (+US$15M) and a volume related
reduction in depreciation (+US$14M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 17% to US$40M in H1 FY18 as underground development was impacted by
the extended outage. FY18 guidance for Sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by a further US$15M to
US$105M to reflect a lower level of underground activity.

AUSTRALIA MANGANESE
(60% SHARE)

Volumes

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 13% (or 202kwmt) to a record 1.7Mwmt in H1 FY18.
Lower than expected rainfall in the December 2017 quarter underpinned higher throughput in the primary
circuit while favourable market conditions allowed the PC02 circuit to operate at full capacity. The PC02 circuit
contributed 8% of total manganese ore production in H1 FY18 (5% H1 FY17; 6% FY17).

Saleable Manganese alloy production increased by 5% (or 4kt) to 82kt in H1 FY18.

FY18 ore production guidance remains unchanged at 3.1Mwmt with the wet season expected to impact
production across H2 FY18.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs increased by 8% to US$1.55/dmtu in H1 FY18 as a result of a rise in planned
maintenance expenditure, a stronger Australian dollar and higher price-linked royalties.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$1.63/dmtu to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 44% (or US$92M) in H1 FY18 to US$299M. A significant improvement in average
realised ore and alloys prices (+US$106M) and an increase in sales volumes (+US$20M) were only partially offset by a
rise in planned maintenance expenditure (-US$8M), the impact of a stronger Australian dollar and higher price-linked
royalties (-US$7M).

Our average realised price for external ore sales in H1 FY18 reflected the high grade 44% manganese lump
ore index (CIF China) on a volume weighted M-1 basis(23), despite the higher contribution of 40% grade PC02
product to the sales mix.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$21M in H1 FY18 as we invested in additional tailings storage
capacity at GEMCO.

    externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction.
(b) H1 FY18 average manganese content of ore sales was 46.1% on a dry basis (H1 FY17: 46.4%). 94% of H1 FY18 external manganese ore
    sales (H1 FY17: 95%) were completed on a CIF basis. H1 FY18 realised FOB ore prices and operating unit costs have been adjusted for
    freight and marketing costs of US$21M (H1 FY17: US$13M), consistent
    with our FOB cost guidance.
(c) FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit
    cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes and includes costs associated with sinter sold externally.

SOUTH AFRICA MANGANESE
(ORE 44.4% SHARE, ALLOY 60% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese ore production increased by 21% (or 195kwmt) to 1.1Mwmt in H1 FY18 as the continuation
of higher cost trucking and the sale of lower quality fines products enabled us to take advantage of favourable
market conditions. FY18 ore production guidance has been increased by 8% to 2,040kwmt, but remains subject
to market demand.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 3% (or 1kt) to 36kt in H1 FY18 as Metalloys continued to
operate one of its four furnaces.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs increased by 18% to US$2.31/dmtu in H1 FY18 as a result of a stronger South
African rand and higher price-linked royalties. The drawdown of low cost Wessels concentrate and other fines material
stockpiles offset the cost of opportunistically trucking ore to port.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$2.41/dmtu to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions, and a
continuation of higher cost trucking activity. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are
detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by 87% (or US$40M) in H1 FY18 to US$86M as a significant improvement in ore and
alloy prices (+US$49M) was only partially offset by a stronger South African rand (-US$5M), higher price-linked royalties
(-US$4M) and an increase in trucking costs (-US$6M).

Our average realised price for external ore sales in H1 FY18 reflected the medium grade 37% manganese
lump ore index(24) on a volume weighted M-1 basis. Wessels concentrate and other fines products receive a
substantial discount when referenced to index prices. Favourable negotiated price outcomes for our primary
products and a temporary increase in the proportion of sales priced in the month of shipping (i.e. M, as opposed
to M-1) offset the impact of these discounts.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$8M in H1 FY18.

(a) Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken independently of equity production. Realised ore prices are
    calculated as external sales revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided by external sales volume. Realised alloy prices are calculated as
    sales revenue, divided by alloy sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany transaction.
    Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
(b) H1 FY18 average manganese content of ore sales was 40.3% on a dry basis (H1 FY17: 40.3%). 68% of H1 FY18 external manganese ore sales
    (H1 FY17: 61%) were completed on a CIF basis. H1 FY18 realised FOB ore prices and operating costs have been adjusted for freight and
    marketing costs of US$16M (H1 FY17: US$10M), consistent with our FOB cost guidance.
(c) FOB ore operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, freight and marketing costs, divided by ore sales volume. Alloy operating unit
    cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA divided by alloy sales volumes.

(a) Revenues associated with sales from Hotazel Manganese Mines (HMM) to Metalloys are eliminated as part of the consolidation. Internal sales
    occur on a commercial basis.
(b) Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported
    at 60%. South32 has a 44.4% ownership interest in HMM. 26% of HMM is owned by a B-BBEE consortium comprising Ntsimbintle Mining (9%),
    NCAB Resources (7%), Iziko Mining (5%) and HMM Education Trust (5%). The interests owned by NCAB Resources, Iziko Mining and HMM
    Education Trust were acquired using vendor finance with the loans repayable via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their
    share in HMM. Until these loans are repaid, South32's interest in HMM is accounted at 54.6%.

CERRO MATOSO
(99.9% SHARE)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production increased by 23% (or 4.1kt) to 21.8kt in H1 FY18 as ore grades
improved with the ramp-up of production at the higher grade La Esmeralda deposit.

FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 41.6kt with additional maintenance planned for the furnace in the
March 2018 quarter.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 10% to US$3.41/lb in H1 FY18 as the operation benefitted from a substantial
increase in sales volumes.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$3.61/lb to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions.
Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed in footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$45M in H1 FY18 to US$41M as the rise in sales volumes (+US$40M) and a
higher average realised nickel price (+US$16M) were partially offset by higher royalties (-US$5M) and an
increase in exploration activity (-US$3M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$11M in H1 FY18 as La Esmeralda was brought online and the
project's permanent access bridge was completed.

CANNINGTON
(100% SHARE)

Volumes

Cannington silver, lead and zinc payable production decreased by 41%, 33% and 52% respectively in H1 FY18
as lower ore grades and a reduction in mill throughput impacted performance.

The stress regime within the orebody is evolving with depletion and we are moving to more challenging
areas within the mine plan. In order to deliver greater predictability and stability in the underground mine as the
level of activity increases (80 stopes to be extracted in FY19, average of 50: FY12-16), we are lowering the
mining rate to 2.45 Mt per annum which is expected to translate to mill throughput of 2.3Mt and 2.4Mt in FY18
and FY19, respectively.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 30% to US$170/t in H1 FY18 as a result of the reduction in throughput and an
adverse movement in finished goods inventory.

We have updated FY18 unit cost guidance to US$159/t to reflect revised exchange rate and price assumptions. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed on page 25, footnote 20.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by 56% (or US$93M) in H1 FY18 to US$72M as lower sales volumes
(-US$148M) were partially offset by higher average realised prices (+US$32M) and lower treatment and
refining charges (+US$27M). The ramp-up of underground trucking activity successfully replaced shaft haulage in the
period for a modest US$2M increase in costs. Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington
concentrates increased Underlying EBIT by US$5.5M in H1 FY18 (US$4.1M FY17; US$0.5M H1 FY17).
Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 1.8Moz of silver, 21.1kt of lead and 3.9kt of zinc) were revalued at
31 December 2017. The final price of these sales will be determined in H2 FY18.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased to US$23M in H1 FY18. The underground crusher is now expected to be
commissioned in February 2018, ahead of schedule.

(a) H1 FY17 reflects balance as at 30 June 2017.

NOTES
(1)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products.
(2)   H1 FY18 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY18 (5,191
      million). H1 FY18 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for 
      H1 FY18.
      H1 FY17 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY17 (5,319
      million). H1 FY17 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for 
      H1 FY17.
(3)   H1 FY18 ordinary dividend per share is calculated as H1 FY18 interim dividend announced (US$223M) divided by the number of shares on issue at
      31 December 2017 (5,181 million).
(4)   H1 FY18 special dividend per share is calculated as H1 FY18 special dividend announced (US$155M) divided by the number of shares on issue at
      31 December 2017 (5,181 million).
(5)   Underlying EBIT is profit before net finance costs, tax and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments. Underlying EBIT is reported
      inclusive of South32's share of net finance costs and tax of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before
      depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after tax and earnings adjustment items. Underlying earnings is the key measure
      that South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess senior management's
      performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and operational management are assessed based on Underlying EBIT.
      In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following items are adjusted as applicable each period,
      irrespective of materiality:

      - Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;
      - Impairment losses/reversals;
      - Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;
      - Fair value gain/loss on non-trading derivative instruments;
      - Major corporate restructures; and
      - The income tax impact of the above items.

      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are 
      excluded to determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.
(6)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(7)   Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(8)   Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as annualised Underlying EBIT
      less the discount on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), 
      divided by the sum of fixed assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and impairments) and inventories. Manganese is included in the calculation 
      on a proportional consolidation basis.
(9)   To ensure that incident classification definitions are applied uniformly across our workforce, we have adopted the United States Government
      Occupational Safety and Health Assessment (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses.
(10)  Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF): The sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment cases) x 1,000,000
      ÷ actual hours worked, for employees and contractors. Stated in units of per million hours worked.
(11)  Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs
      variance reflects the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded
      consumables. Foreign exchange reflects the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance
      reflects the revenue impact of sales volume changes, based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the
      impact from changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base, including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on
      expenditure, and period-on-period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance excludes earnings adjustments including significant
      items.
(12)  Underlying net finance cost and Underlying tax expense are actual H1 FY18 results, not half-on-half variances.
(13)  South32's ownership share of operations are presented as follows: Worsley Alumina (86%), South Africa Aluminium (100%), Mozal Aluminium
      (47.1% share), Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share), South Africa Energy Coal (92% share), Illawarra Metallurgical Coal
      (100%), Australia Manganese (60% share), South Africa Manganese (60% share), Cerro Matoso (99.9% share), and Cannington (100%).
(14)  Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) is Underlying income tax expense, excluding royalty related tax, divided by Underlying profit before tax; both 
      the numerator and denominator exclude equity accounted investments.
(15)  The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues instead of income tax.
(16)  Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure
      comprises Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB),
      Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.
(17)  South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are
      repaid.
(18)  Operating unit cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA, excluding third party sales, divided by sales volumes. Operating cost is Revenue less
      Underlying EBITDA excluding third party sales. Additional manganese disclosures are included.
(19)  Prior FY18 Operating unit cost guidance included royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and were predicated
      on various assumptions for FY18, including: an alumina price of US$299/t; an average blended coal price of US$119/t for Illawarra Metallurgical 
      Coal; a manganese ore price of US$4.50/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$4.27/lb; a thermal coal price of US$72/t (API4) for 
      South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$16.82/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,135/t; a zinc price of US$2,555/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 
      0.74; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.17; a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,961; and a reference price for caustic soda; all of which reflected forward 
      markets as at May 2017 or our internal expectations.
(20)  New FY18 Operating unit cost guidance includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and includes various
      assumptions for FY18, including: an alumina price of US$388/t; an average blended coal price of US$168/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a
      manganese ore price of US$6.30/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$5.39/lb; a thermal coal price of US$90/t (API4) for South
      Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$16.96/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,475/t; a zinc price of US$3,246t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.78; a
      USD:ZAR exchange rate of 12.98; a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,920; and a 17% increase in the reference price for caustic soda relative to prior
      guidance; all of which reflected forward markets as at January 2018 or our internal expectations.
(21)  Third party products sold comprise US$148M for aluminium, US$48M for alumina, US$128M for coal, US$85M for freight services and US$54M for
      aluminium raw materials. Underlying EBIT on third party products comprise US$6M for aluminium, nil for alumina, nil for coal, (US$1)M for freight
      services and nil for aluminium raw materials.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - BASIS OF PREPARATION

The consolidated financial statements of South32 Limited (referred to as the Company) and its subsidiaries and joint
arrangements (collectively, the Group) for the half year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 15 February 2018.

1.   Reporting entity

South32 Limited is a for-profit company limited by shares incorporated in Australia with a primary listing on the Australian
Securities Exchange (ASX), a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in note 3
Segment information.

2.   Basis of preparation

The half year consolidated financial statements are a general purpose condensed financial report which:

- Have been prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
  and the Corporations Act
- Have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial
  assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value
- Are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the majority of the Group's operations, and all values
  are rounded to the nearest million dollars (US$M or US$ million) unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC
  Corporations Instrument 2016/191
- Present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current period's presentation
- Have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied
  in the 30 June 2017 annual consolidated financial statements

In preparing these half year consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in
applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that
applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017.

For a full understanding of the financial performance and financial position of the Group it is recommended that the half
year consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 30 June 2017. Consideration should also be given to any public announcements made by the Company in
accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the ASX Listing Rules.
The following exchange rates relative to the US dollar have been applied in the half year consolidated financial
statements.

3.   Segment information

(a) Description of segments

The operating segments (also referred to as operations), are organised and managed separately according to the nature
of products produced.

The members of the Lead Team (the chief operating decision makers) and the Board of Directors monitor the segment
results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The
segment information for the manganese operations are presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the
measure used by the Group's management to assess their performance.

The principal activities of each operating segment as the Group is currently structured are summarised as follows:

Operating segment              Principal activities
Worsley Alumina                Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia, Australia
South Africa Aluminium         Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa
Mozal Aluminium                Aluminium smelter in Mozambique
Brazil Alumina                 Alumina refinery in Brazil
South Africa Energy Coal       Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South Africa
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal   Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales, Australia
Australia Manganese            Integrated producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and manganese alloys in
                               Tasmania, Australia
South Africa Manganese         Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa
Cerro Matoso                   Integrated laterite ferronickel mining and smelting complex in Colombia
Cannington                     Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland, Australia

All operations are operated or jointly operated by the Group except Brazil Alumina, which is operated by Alcoa.

(b) Segment results

The Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the significant
difference in profit margin earned on these sales.
It is the Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.
Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group
financing (including finance expense and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not
allocated to operating segments.

(1) The segment information reflects the Group's interest in the manganese operations and is presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is 
    the measure used by the Group's management to assess their performance. The manganese operations are equity accounted in the half year consolidated 
    financial statements. The statutory adjustment column reconciles the proportional consolidation to the equity accounting position.

(1) The Group's investment in Dreamvision Investments 15 (RF) (Pty) Ltd (""Dreamvision"") originated in 2006 through the formation of a Broad-Based
    Black Economic Empowerment (""B-BBEE"") transaction. The transaction contained a lock-in period which expired in November 2016 and the process
    to unwind the investment was triggered. Consequently, the Group elected to receive shares in Exxaro Resources Limited in exchange for its
    shareholding in Dreamvision. The net valuation gain on the available for sale investment in Dreamvision has been transferred from the Financial
    assets reserve and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

(1) On 24 August 2017, the Directors resolved to pay a fully franked final dividend of US6.4 cents per share (US$334 million) in respect of the 2017
    financial year. The dividend was paid on 12 October 2017. The South32 Employee Incentive Plans Trust waived its right to receive dividends from
    South32 Limited, therefore reducing the dividends paid by US$1 million.


5.   Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts are calculated based on profit attributable to equity holders of South32 Limited
and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

Dilutive EPS amounts are calculated based on profit attributable to equity holders of South32 Limited and the weighted
average number of shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential shares.

(1) The basic EPS denominator is the aggregate of the weighted average number of shares after deduction of the weighted average number of Treasury
    shares outstanding and shares permanently cancelled through the on-market share buy-back during the period.
(2) Diluted EPS calculation excludes 6,932,916 (31 December 2016: 15,371,165) rights which are considered anti-dilutive and are subject to service and

Measurement of fair value

The following table shows the Group's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the nature of
valuation inputs used:

Level 1 - Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Valuation includes inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are observable for the financial
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity analysis

The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are
calculated using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity
prices, foreign exchange rates and inflation. The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in
these models, based on changes in the most significant inputs by 10 per cent while holding all other variables constant,
is shown in the following table.
                                                                                                             Other Comprehensive

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Half-year Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for:

- the preparation of the Half-year Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with
  Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
- such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the Half-year
  Financial Statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility for the review of the Half-year Financial Statements

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Half-year Financial Statements based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a
Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis of
the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the Half-year
Financial Statements are not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair
view of the Group's financial position as at 31 December 2017 and its performance for the half-year ended on
that date; and complying with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the
Corporations Regulations 2001. As auditor of South32 Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the
ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual Financial Report.

A review of Half-year Financial Statements consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.

QUARTERLY REPORT - DECEMBER 2017

“A record quarter of performance and supportive market dynamics have allowed us to increase FY18 production guidance at 
 South Africa Manganese by eight per cent, while production guidance for all other operations remains unchanged.

“At the Appin colliery, we successfully restarted one underground longwall on 13 October and remain committed to our 
 ramp-up plan as we seek to reset the operation’s culture and drive productivity to an acceptable level.

“We are also actively reshaping our portfolio with South Africa Energy Coal to be managed as a stand-alone business 
 from April 2018. This strategic initiative will significantly simplify our organisation and unlock additional value for 
 shareholders.

“In accordance with our disciplined capital management framework we distributed US$333M in shareholder dividends during 
 the December 2017 half year and purchased a further 37M shares for a cash consideration of US$93M.”

    record performance has underpinned an 8% increase to our prior estimate.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-   Industry cost curves steepened during the December 2017 half year as a result of US dollar weakness, rising
    commodity prices and the environmental policy response in China. As highlighted in our December 2017 strategy
    and business update, our unit costs are being affected by these external factors despite generally good cost control
    across our operations. This pressure is most notable in our smelters and refineries as a result of broad-based
    strength in commodity markets (price-linked power, alumina, pitch and coke), of which we are a net beneficiary.
    Updated unit cost guidance for FY18 will be provided with our December 2017 half year results.

-   Timing differences for receivables and rising commodity prices have also contributed to a further build in working
    capital from the US$284M increase reported for the four months to 31 October 2017 in our December 2017 strategy
    and business update. We expect the component related to timing differences to unwind in the March 2018 quarter.
                                                 
-   We received net distributions of US$238M[3] (South32 share) from our equity accounted investments in the December
    2017 half year and our strong balance sheet was recognised by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s when they
    reaffirmed their respective BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings.

-   In accordance with our disciplined capital management framework we paid our US$333M final dividend in respect of
    FY17 in October 2017 and purchased a further 37M shares for a cash consideration of US$93M during the December
    2017 half year. To 31 December 2017, we have purchased 143M shares at an average price of A$2.80 per share for a
    cash consideration of US$305M, representing 41% of our approved US$750M capital management program.

-   In the December 2017 half year we made tax payments totalling US$180M (net, excluding equity accounted
    investments) across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our Underlying Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which
    excludes tax associated with equity accounted investments, largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s
    profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group for the December 2017 half year include: Australia 30%, South
    Africa 28%, Colombia 40% and Brazil 34%. Permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s tax
    rate when profit margins are low.

-   We invested US$23.9M in brownfield and greenfield exploration programs during the December 2017 half year
    (US$1.1M capitalised). This included US$1.1M for our equity accounted investments (US$0.6M capitalised) and
    expenditure associated with our portfolio of high quality, early stage exploration opportunities.

As anticipated, South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 1.4Mt) to 13.4Mt in the December
2017 half year. Export coal production exceeded expectations as productivity lifted at both the Klipspruit mine and the
export oriented areas of the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC). In contrast, domestic production was impacted by
a reduction in demand from the Duvha power station and scheduled maintenance in the domestically focused areas of
the WMC. The continued build of inventory across the December 2017 half year reflects ongoing constraint in the supply
chain and weather related delays at Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT).
While the development of new mining areas at the WMC is progressing according to plan and FY18 production guidance
remains unchanged at 27.5Mt (11.5Mt export; 16.0Mt domestic), the potential for weaker demand to persist in the June
2018 half year does imply a degree of downside risk for loss making domestic volumes.                        
During the period, we also commenced the process to manage South Africa Energy Coal as a stand-alone business
from April 2018[1] and approved a 4.3 billion South African Rand (US$301M) investment to extend the life of the Klipspruit
colliery by at least 20 years[2].

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by 50% (or 1.9Mt) to 1.9Mt in the December 2017 half year
as the Appin colliery recovered from an extended outage and the Dendrobium longwall progressed through a faulted
zone. FY18 production guidance of 4.5Mt remains unchanged with a longwall move scheduled for Dendrobium in the
March 2018 quarter. The depreciation and amortisation charge for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is expected to decline by
approximately 15% from the prior period (H1 FY17: US$93M) as a result of the lower extraction rates.

Our average realised price in the December 2017 half year will reflect a modest premium to the low-volatile hard coking
coal index[6] on a volume weighted M-1 basis. The timing of shipments and a higher proportion of sales with pricing
linked to the month of shipment (i.e. M) combined to offset a temporary product quality discount associated with a higher
proportion of Dendrobium product in the sales mix. Sales volumes were impacted by the deferral of one shipment at the
end of the period.

Australia Manganese achieved record performance in the December 2017 quarter and half year as saleable ore
production increased to 893kwmt and 1,701kwmt, respectively. Lower than expected rainfall in the December 2017
quarter underpinned higher throughput in the primary circuit while favourable market conditions allowed the PC02 circuit
to operate at full capacity. The PC02 circuit contributed 8% of total manganese ore production in the December 2017 half
year (5% H1 FY17; 6% FY17). FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,125kwmt with the wet season expected to
impact production across the remainder of the financial year.

Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and
product-type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Given the contribution of the
PC02 circuit to our sales profile, our average realised price for external ore sales in the December 2017 half year will
reflect the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index[7] on a volume weighted M-1 basis. Internal sales continue to
occur on commercial terms.

Saleable Manganese alloy production increased by 5% (4kt) to 82kt in the December 2017 half year.

South Africa Manganese achieved record performance in the December 2017 quarter as saleable ore production
increased by 22% to 633kwmt. A continuation of higher cost trucking and the sale of lower quality fines products enabled
us to take advantage of favourable market conditions while the Wessels central block, which was successfully
commissioned in the March 2017 quarter, also operated at maximum capacity ahead of planned maintenance in the
June 2018 quarter. Given the record start to the year, we have increased FY18 ore production guidance by 8% to
2,040kwmt with this projection remaining subject to continued strong market demand. The increase in ore inventory in
the December 2017 quarter is also expected to unwind in the June 2018 half year.

The average realised price for external ore sales in the December 2017 half year is expected to reflect the medium grade
37% manganese lump ore index[8] on a volume weighted M-1 basis. Wessels concentrate and other fines products
receive a substantial discount when referenced to index prices and accounted for 17% of sales across the December
2017 half year (15% H1 FY17; 9% FY17). Favourable negotiated price outcomes for our primary products, as well as a
temporary increase in the proportion of sales priced in the month of shipping (i.e. M, as opposed to M-1) offset the impact
of these discounts. Internal sales continue to occur on commercial terms.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 3% (or 1kt) to 36kt in the December 2017 half year as Metalloys
continued to operate one of its four furnaces.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production increased by 23% (or 4.1kt) to 21.8kt in the December 2017 half year as ore
grades improved following the ramp-up of production at La Esmeralda. Production was 14% lower in the December 2017
quarter as planned maintenance was undertaken in the furnace. FY18 production guidance remains unchanged at
41.6kt with additional maintenance planned for the furnace in the March 2018 quarter.

As anticipated, Cannington silver, lead and zinc payable production decreased by 41%, 33% and 52% in the December
2017 half year, respectively, due to lower ore grades and a reduction in mill throughput. Mining rates remained
constrained in the December 2017 quarter as additional underground development was prioritised in preference to the
planned replenishment of above ground stocks. Throughput is expected to improve with the ramp-up of the replacement
underground crusher which is on schedule to be commissioned in March 2018. FY18 production guidance (silver
14,360koz, lead 115kt, zinc 45kt) remains unchanged and is predicated on a significant improvement in silver and lead
ore grades as determined by the sequence of stope extraction with production weighted towards the June 2018 quarter.
We remain focussed on the safe extraction of the remaining underground ore reserves at Cannington with the optimal
stope sequence designed to reduce geotechnical risk and maximise value. A significant increase in underground activity
and complexity will drive greater variability of mine performance as the underground mine progresses towards the end of
its life.
 
Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will increase Underlying EBIT[9] by
US$5.5M in the December 2017 half year (US$4.1M FY17; US$0.5M H1 FY17). Outstanding concentrate sales
(containing 1.8Moz of silver, 21.1kt of lead and 3.9kt of zinc) were revalued at 31 December 2017. The final price of
these sales will be determined in the June 2018 half year.

                 SOUTH32 STRATEGY AND BUSINESS UPDATE PRESENTATION


South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32, ADR: SOUHY) (South32) management will meet with
equity analysts and investors today in Perth, Australia to discuss its strategy and operational
performance.

Speaking at the event, Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said, “Our investor day provides
another opportunity to reiterate the core elements of our strategy, following on from our Annual
General meeting two weeks ago. I am pleased to reaffirm prior FY18 production guidance for our
operations and provide production and unit cost guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal for the
first time, having restarted one longwall at the Appin colliery in October 2017. I can also confirm
                                                      1
that Sustaining capital expenditure of US$470M is now expected in FY18 (versus prior
expectations of US$500M), with two thirds of the reduction associated with the deferral of
underground development at Appin.”

A copy of the presentation slides is available on our website www.south32.net and will be
submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and available for inspection at
www.hemscott.com/nsm.do.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal guidance update

Saleable production of 4.5Mt (3.35Mt metallurgical coal, 1.15Mt energy coal) is now projected for
                                                                            2
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in FY18 at an operating unit cost of US$130/t . Production will be
weighted to the second half of FY18 given the recent outage at the Appin colliery.

We expect to return the Appin colliery to its prior two longwall configuration in the December
2018 quarter, after which we intend to ramp-up Illawarra Metallurgical Coal production safely and
sustainably towards historical rates of more than 8Mtpa.

Sustaining capital expenditure for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is now expected to be US$120M in
                            1
FY18 (previously US$150M) .

         SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL TO BECOME A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32, ADR: SOUHY) (South32) announced today that it
will manage South Africa Energy Coal (SAEC) as a stand-alone business from April 2018
and invest 4.3 billion South African Rand (US$301M)[1] to extend the life of its Klipspruit
colliery by approximately 20 years[2] .

SAEC requires ongoing investment to sustain production and meet its take or pay rail and
domestic supply obligations. To sustainably improve its financial performance, we will
restructure SAEC and manage it separately from the rest of the Group with tailored
functional support, systems and governance processes. This change will also allow the
Group to further simplify the way it manages its global portfolio[3] .

Once SAEC has been established as a stand-alone business and consistent with our
objective to further transform our South African operations, we will commence a process to
broaden ownership of SAEC. This will present opportunities for Broad-Based Black
Economic Empowerment entities, employees and communities, and could lead to a listing of
SAEC on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                                            
SAEC will continue to be consolidated in the Group’s financial statements on a 100% basis[4]
until there is a change in control.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said “Establishing South Africa Energy Coal
as a stand-alone business will enable us to improve the operation’s competitiveness and
ensure its ongoing sustainability. This process will also allow us to further simplify our
organisation and unlock additional value for shareholders.”

“We will also seek to increase the local ownership of South Africa Energy Coal, consistent
with our commitment to South Africa’s economic transformation, and may ultimately list the
business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.”

Notes:
1.   The project’s costs are primarily South African Rand based and the capital expenditure conversion to USD is predicated on a
     USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.36 (average of daily spot rate from 13 to 17 November 2017 inclusive).
2.   Project execution is subject to South32 reaching satisfactory agreement on securing all land rights for infrastructure
     development.
3.   IRR is predicated on the commencement of production from KPSX in H2 FY19 and a long term thermal coal price of
     US$60.5/t (API4 equivalent) based on the average of 12 broker estimates (Barclays, BMO Capital, BoAML, Credit Suisse,
     Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Investec, Jefferies, Macquarie, Morgan Stanley, Renaissance Capital, UBS) and a spot USD:ZAR
     exchange rate of 14.36 (average of daily spot rate from 13 to 17 November 2017 inclusive).
4.   The Coal Resource is part of the total Coal Resources for Klipspruit and Weltevreden as at 30 June 2017 disclosed as part of
     South32's Annual Resource and Reserve declaration in the FY17 Annual Report on 14 September 2017 (www.south32.net).
     The breakdown of Coal Resources for Klipspruit South, Pit BD and Pit H is provided in Table 1 of this announcement.
5.   Saleable production target is based on 280Mt of Coal Resources from a Coal Resource base of 616Mt. There is a low level
     of geological confidence associated with 9.3Mt (3%) of Inferred Coal Resources and there is no certainty that further
     exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Coal Resources or that the production target itself will be
     realised.
6.   Weltevreden includes Pit BD comprising 163Mt of Measured (81%), 28Mt Indicated (14%) and 9.2 Mt Inferred Resources
     (5%); and Pit H comprising 8.8Mt of Measured (85%), 1.5Mt Indicated (14%) and 0.1Mt Inferred Resources (1%).
7.   Ratio of mining waste in bank cubic metres to the coal tonnes mined.
8.   Operating unit cost and strip ratio predicated on internal analysis undertaken for the project.
9.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The
     interests owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via
     distributions attributable to these parties’ pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid,
     South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted for at 100%.

                            Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer


David Crawford AO, Chairman

Good morning everyone. My name is David Crawford, and I am the Chairman of South32.

Thank you for joining us today for our Annual General Meeting and welcome to our shareholders
from around the world who have joined us via webcast.

….

I am informed that a quorum is present, so I declare the meeting open.

I will now introduce the Directors.

On my left:

     •   Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi
     •   Frank Cooper – Chair of the Risk and Audit Committee
     •   Karen Wood - welcome to your first meeting. And we look forward to hearing from you
         later
     •   Nicole Duncan - who I introduced earlier

And on my right:

     •   Keith Rumble – Chair of the Sustainability Committee
     •   Dr Xiaoling Liu – a special welcome to you at your first meeting and we will also hear
         from you a little later
     •   Futhi Mtoba
     •   Wayne Osborn – Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and
     •   Graham Kerr – Chief Executive Officer who is seated next to me.

The Lead Team are in attendance today and are sitting in the front row.

Also in attendance is Denise McComish representing the Company’s auditors KPMG, and Tim
Heughan from Computershare is here to oversee the polling process.

I will begin with a short review of our performance for the 2017 financial year. Our CEO, Graham
Kerr, will expand on some of those themes in his operational report.

We’ll then move to the formal business of the meeting and the resolutions.

And we will provide an opportunity for discussion, and any questions you might have, when we
deal with each of the formal agenda items.

…

The 2017 financial year has been one of success and strong financial results. We continued to
embed our strategy, focusing on long-term success and the sustainability of our business.
                                                                                                  
For that, we can thank our teams across seven countries – the diverse, talented and dedicated
people who are the basis of everything we achieve at South32.

…

Our greatest priority is the safety of our people, and ensuring we have a culture of care and
accountability that permeates every level of our organisation.

In some respects, we have done well. We reduced our Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate
across all regions in the 2017 financial year.

However, we still have a long way to go.

It deeply saddens me to report a fatality on site this year. A contractor was fatally injured at our
Metalloys Manganese Smelter in South Africa.

Any fatality is unacceptable, and only strengthens our resolve to further embed our culture of
care and accountability. The Board and Management team are committed to continuously
improving our safety performance, so that we can guarantee everyone goes home safe and well.
Graham will share more on what we are doing to achieve this.

…

While we put a great deal of effort and planning into implementing our strategy, we must also
consider the external factors that are beyond our control.

The price of most of our commodities increased during the 2017 financial year. Manganese led
the way, and metallurgical coal, energy coal, zinc, lead and alumina all rose during the year.

Although market conditions remain positive, public policy remains a challenge in several areas.

The proposed new mining charter governing the mining industry in South Africa is of particular
concern. While we are committed to the country’s transformation agenda, the proposed Mining
Charter Three has created uncertainty across the mining sector. The matter is before the courts
and we are monitoring developments closely. The best outcome would be a Charter which all
stakeholders in South Africa can support. While the developments around the mining charter
play out, we will continue to focus on operating our businesses in South Africa sustainably.

…

Before speaking to our financial results, I want to acknowledge the challenges we faced at
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in New South Wales.

I have met with the regulator to understand her concerns, and we have an action plan in place to
improve performance, and Graham will talk to this in more detail.

…

South32 delivered strong financial results in the 2017 financial year, with a significant increase in
profitability and shareholder returns.

Rising commodity prices underpinned a 20 per cent increase in revenue, to 6.95 billion US
dollars.



                                                                                                       
At the same time, we reduced controllable costs by 360 million US dollars.

As a result, basic underlying earnings per share rose from 2.6 to 21.6 US cents in the financial
year.

This is reflected in an increase in Underlying EBITDA, to just over 2.4 billion US dollars. Our net
cash position increased to over 1.6 billion US dollars at year end.

The return on invested capital for the year was 11.4 per cent – up from 1.7 per cent the previous
year.

…

The strong improvement in financial performance, and the disciplined application of our capital
management framework, allowed us to substantially increase returns to shareholders.

At the end of October this year, as part of our 750 million US dollar capital management
programme, we have purchased shares on market to the value of 282 million US dollars. Shares
were purchased at an average price of 2.77 Australian dollars per share.

In addition, we paid 526 million US dollars in dividends.

These results reflect the contribution made by our teams around the world.

…

As part of our culture of care and accountability, we pay particular attention to creating working
environments that are diverse and inclusive. This brings a vibrancy and energy to our operations.

In 2015, your Board approved a set of gender and ethnicity targets. I’m pleased to say that we
are making progress in meeting those objectives.

In the 2017 financial year, 1.8 million US dollars went towards closing the gender pay gap.

We have improved the representation of women in our workforce, and in our leadership.

We still have some work to do if we are to increase the representation of Black People. However,
in our South African workforce, particularly at the management level, we have initiatives in place
to achieve this.

…

This year we have not increased Fixed Remuneration for any of our Non-Executive Directors or
Key Management Personnel.

Our Short-Term Incentive is focussed on rewarding the key management personnel for
outcomes they can influence. This year the outcomes are generally lower than last year,
primarily due to lower than expected production volumes.

…

South32 recognises that acting on climate change is consistent with our goal of creating value for
shareholders.



                                                                                                   
Our business is vulnerable to changes in demand for commodities as the world responds to
climate change. Our climate change strategy focuses on finding and developing climate change
opportunities through the commodities we supply, building climate resilience and reducing
emissions. We are making good progress in all of these areas.

We support a smooth transition in which emissions fall to the levels needed to limit warming to
less than two degrees.

This year we completed a detailed assessment of the resilience of our portfolio under different
climate change scenarios. Pleasingly, our commodity exposure, the position of our operations
within their industries and our strong balance sheet, creates financial resilience.

Looking back across the 2017 financial year, we made significant progress. We have strong
foundations to create further value in 2018. We will maintain our financial discipline and remain
focused on optimising our portfolio. In doing so, we will deliver sector leading returns for
shareholders. We will continue to look for opportunities outside our existing portfolio to compete
for capital.

…

On behalf of the Board, Graham and his management team, it is my pleasure to thank all of our
people for their efforts during the past year. And to you, our shareholders, thank you for your
continued support.

I will now hand over to Graham.

Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

Thank you David, and welcome shareholders.

I will begin by reiterating David’s comments about our culture of care and accountability and the
absolute importance we place on creating a safe and healthy workplace.

The fatality at our Metalloys Manganese Smelter in South Africa in November last year is a stark
reminder to all of us that we need to do more to ensure our people go home safe and well at the
end of their shift.

If we’re to establish our desired culture of care and accountability, we need to have well
designed work, a way to continuously improve, and an inclusive workplace, where everyone
plays a part in making the business safer.

We’ve taken a number of steps to achieve this.

For example, at our operations in Africa we’ve held a series of catalyst workshops across our
leadership group to drive behavioural change. We’ve also undertaken a detailed capability
review of our senior leaders. We continue to invest the time and resources to drive the necessary
behavioural change required to create a culture of care and accountability.

At our operations in Australia, we’re in the process of undertaking the same capability review and
implementing a series of initiatives to ensure our leaders and teams are fully involved in making
our operations a safe place for our people.

…



                                                                                                    
Technology and innovation can change the way we do so much in our business, and we’ve
already introduced a range of technologies which are helping us to improve safety and
productivity. For example, we now use drones to conduct inspections and maintenance in difficult
to access or dangerous areas.

And this year we added the role of Chief Technology Officer to our Lead Team to help us build
momentum and identify new ways to improve safety and productivity.

…

Although not without challenges, this year we have had some real highlights across the business
as we continued to optimize our operations. For seven out of ten of our operations we performed
in line with guidance. The three where we didn’t, I will address shortly.

Every part of our aluminium business was strong.

Our bauxite mines, alumina refineries and smelters in Australia, South Africa and Brazil – earned
over 2.8 billion US dollars of the Group’s revenue. This contributed 35 percent to the overall
Group underlying EBITDA.

A particular highlight was our Mozal Aluminium smelter in Mozambique which produced a record
271 kilotons of aluminium.

Manganese was another bright spot as we used the flexibility built into our South African
operations to take advantage of higher prices and offset cost pressures.

As the market tightened, we increased volumes by 19 per cent and used our stockpiles to
counter the impact of a stronger rand, inflation and higher price-linked royalties.

…

Meanwhile, as we mentioned we faced challenges at some of our operations.

At the Appin metallurgical coal mine in Illawarra in New South Wales we had an unacceptable
year as we experienced a series of outages, which affected our production.

We have recently commenced a measured ramp-up of longwall mining activity at Appin that will
allow us to reset the operation’s culture, re-establish minimum performance criteria and increase
productivity towards a more acceptable level.

At Cannington in North West Queensland, lead, zinc and silver production were all down as ore
grades declined, consistent with the mine plan, and run-of-mine stocks were depleted following
an underground fire.

Following the decommissioning of the original underground crusher in September this year, we
successfully replaced shaft haulage with additional trucking capacity. We expect processing
rates to increase once we commission the new underground crusher in the March 2018 quarter.

South Africa Energy Coal recorded an overall drop in saleable production caused by heavy rain
and associated delays in the development of the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex. However, by
the June quarter of the 2017 financial year we saw an 11 per cent improvement in production as
we continued to open up new mining areas.

…

                                                                                                 
This year we also made significant progress as we sought to further unlock the potential of our
operations.

For example, we finalised an agreement with Alcoa to access the West Marradong mining area
at Worsley Alumina in Western Australia. This will allow us to defer spending capital on new
mining hubs into the future.

We delivered the first higher-grade ore from La Esmeralda deposit at Cerro Matoso in Colombia.

We started exploration at the Southern Areas of our Northern Territory GEMCO manganese
mine.

And in South Africa we have made good progress towards approving a project to extend the life
of the Klipspruit colliery.

…

We are also focused on identifying growth opportunities that increase the competition for capital
within the Group. We have been working with credible partners that provide access to greenfield
exploration opportunities in which we can use our technical abilities while minimising operating
risk.

We’ve reached agreements with:

AusQuest on base metals prospects in Peru and Australia.

Trilogy Metals to extend a high-grade copper resource at the Bornite deposit in Alaska.

And Arizona Mining on the Hermosa zinc, lead and silver project in Arizona.

…

Elsewhere in the business, our recruitment process increasingly reflects the importance we place
on creating a diverse, inclusive and effective work force.

Lead team appointments include new faces in marketing and sustainability, strengthening our
capacity in areas of growing importance.

It remains a priority for us to create a workforce that is as diverse as the communities where we
operate.

As David mentioned, we are improving workforce diversity with more women appointed to our
regional and operational lead teams.

We are committed to providing an inclusive and supportive workplace for our people. We have
commenced the introduction of a new family care policy, increasing paid parental leave for the
primary carer to 26 weeks’ full pay. On top of this, we will pay a lump sum superannuation
payment on return to work, and offer flexible working conditions.

It is important to me that we have a workplace where people feel safe asking for help when they
need it. In line with this, we’ve implemented a new policy focused on supporting staff who are
victims of domestic violence and offer a range of support options including paid leave, temporary
accommodation and payment towards legal advice.



                                                                                                    
We’ve also implemented a new harassment policy, reinforcing our zero-tolerance approach to all
forms of intimidation, harassment and discrimination.

…

In South Africa, we’re engaging with all areas of our business to support our transformation
strategy. In January this year, we awarded a three-year core mining contract to a Broad-Based
Black Economic Empowerment company, Modi Mining, at our Wolvekrans Middleburg Complex.
The award of this contract is particularly significant as it is our first core mining contract awarded
to a 100 per cent black owned company and marks a major step forward in our plans to deliver a
more inclusive supplier landscape.

…

In the past year, we’ve made good progress towards an inclusive and diverse workplace and will
continue to work hard in these areas.

…

Looking to the year ahead, we will continue to optimize our portfolio to deliver value to our
shareholders. We will seek more exposure to base metals and we’ve made a good start through
our exploration partnerships.

Across the industry, we expect rising raw material input costs. Should these external pressures
persist across the remainder of the year, we will not be immune to additional cost inflation.

…

To sum up, our financial results for the 2017 financial year, together with the strides we’ve made
towards our sustainability, diversity and safety targets give me confidence for the year ahead. I
look forward to updating you on our progress.

…

Thank you, I will now hand you back to our Chairman.

The Chairman then conducted the formal items of business.

David Crawford AO, Chairman

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance and attention.

This brings us to the end of the 2017 Annual General Meeting. On behalf of the Board, I would
like to thank you for joining us today. We look forward to your continued support in the coming
year.

For those of you here in Perth, please join me and my fellow Directors and executive
management for light refreshments.

I now declare this meeting CLOSED.

QUARTERLY REPORT

“Our key commodity markets continue to benefit from strong demand and a steepening of industry cost curves.
This supportive dynamic has further bolstered our net cash position despite the continuation of our capital
management program and the prepayment that will increase our interest in Arizona Mining.

“Annual production guidance is maintained for our operations following generally strong performance across
our supply chain. Mozal aluminium achieved another production record, payable nickel production rose sharply
at Cerro Matoso and we continued to optimise our manganese operations to benefit from elevated prices.

“We have also commenced a measured
ramp-up of longwall mining activity at the Appin mine that will allow us to reset the operation’s culture, re-
establish minimum performance criteria and drive productivity towards a more acceptable level.”

Graham Kerr, South32 CEO


-   Stronger commodity markets delivered a US$33M increase in our net cash position to US$1.7B despite an
    increase in working capital, the continuation of our capital management program and the prepayment that
    will increase our stake in Arizona Mining.
-   Maintained annual production guidance for our operations and confirmed that we will operate one longwall
    at the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal Appin mine across the remainder of FY18.
-   Achieved record quarterly production at Mozal Aluminium and robust performance at our alumina
    refineries despite bauxite supply being impacted by adverse weather in Western Australia and Brazil.
-   Increased payable nickel production at Cerro Matoso by 21% as scheduled maintenance was deferred
    and the average ore grade benefitted from the ramp-up of La Esmeralda.
-   Continued to take advantage of strong market conditions by maintaining South Africa Manganese ore
    sales at an annualised rate of 3.5Mwmt pa (100% basis).
-   Successfully replaced shaft haulage with additional trucking capacity following the decommissioning of the
    underground crusher at Cannington, with processing rates to increase as run-of-mine stocks are rebuilt
    and the new crusher chamber is commissioned in the March 2018 quarter.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-    Industry cost curves continue to steepen as a result of US dollar weakness, rising raw material input
     costs and the environmental policy response in China. While our unit costs are tracking to plan on the
     basis of previously disclosed exchange rate and commodity price assumptions1, we will experience
     additional cost inflation should these external pressures persist across the remainder of the year.
-    Exploration remains a key pillar of our strategy. We invested US$6.8M in greenfield and brownfield
     activity in the September 2017 quarter (US$0.5M capitalised), including US$0.5M in our equity
     accounted investments
-    (US$0.2M capitalised). Our exploration budget for FY18 remains unchanged at US$30M.
-    On 14 September, we entered into an over-the-counter equity forward contract to acquire up to an
     additional
-    15 million shares in Arizona Mining Incorporated (TSX: AZ) (Arizona Mining), equivalent to 4.9 per cent
     of the Common Shares on issue. South32 settled the contract in full before the program commenced2.
-    Our net cash balance increased by US$33M to US$1,673M in the September 2017 quarter despite a
     rise in working capital and the prepayment that will increase our interest in Arizona Mining. With the
     continuation of our capital management program, we also purchased 19M shares for a cash
     consideration of US$47M during the September 2017 quarter. To 30 September 2017, we had
     completed 35% of our approved US$750M capital management program at an average price of
     AUD$2.73 per share. On 12 October, we paid our first fully-franked dividend, with the US$333M
     distribution representing 50% of Underlying earnings in respect of the June 2017 half year.
-    While Australia Manganese paid US$99M (100% share) in royalties in respect of the prior 6 month
     period, strong prices allowed our manganese equity accounted investments to distribute a net US$85M3
     (South32 share) during the period.
-    Our Underlying Effective Tax Rate, which excludes tax associated with equity accounted investments,
     largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the
     Group include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 39% and Brazil 34%. A payment of
     approximately US$100M will be made to the Australian Taxation Office in December 2017 in respect of
     earnings generated in FY17.

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 5% (or 46kt) to 942kt in the September 2017 quarter as
calciner maintenance was undertaken and heavy rainfall temporarily affected bauxite supply from the Boddington

Brazil Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 5kt) in the September 2017 quarter as the refinery
continued to operate at its capacity. While severe drought conditions in the Porto Trombetas region of Brazil have
impacted bauxite supply from the MRN mine (14.8% South32 share), we have successfully mitigated the impact
across the remainder of the calendar year and our FY18 production guidance for the Alumar refinery remains
unchanged at 1.3Mt.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 10% (or 724kt) to 6,689kt in the September 2017
quarter as we completed planned dragline maintenance, relocated critical mobile equipment at the Wolvekrans-
Middelburg Complex (WMC) and continued to deplete existing pits. Following prior weather related delays, the
development of new mining areas at the WMC is proceeding according to plan and our FY18 production
guidance remains unchanged at 27.5Mt. Export sales were sequentially lower as congestion at the Richards Bay
Coal Terminal was not fully cleared in the September 2017 quarter. Final approval of the Klipspruit Life Extension
project is expected in the December 2017 quarter.

Total saleable production for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal decreased by 53% (or 927kt) as the Appin mine
remained suspended during the September 2017 quarter. While the Dendrobium mine continued to perform well
during the period, production was impacted by geological conditions, consistent with the mine plan. The
Dendrobium longwall is expected to pass through a fault zone in the December 2017 quarter and a longwall
move is scheduled to commence at Dendrobium in the March 2018 quarter.


Production recommenced at Longwall 707 on 13 October following the completion of the necessary remedial
action at the Appin mine. We will operate a single longwall at the Appin mine across the remainder of FY18 as
part of a staged ramp-up of activities, before returning to a two longwall configuration in the December 2018
quarter. Longwall 707 is expected to be completed in the June 2018 quarter, at which point we will commence
production at Longwall 902. FY18 production guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal will be provided in due
course and will be informed by the performance of Longwall 707 and other ramp-up activities at the Appin mine.

Notes:

1.   FY18e Operating unit cost guidance provided in our FY17 Results Announcement includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence
     of exchange rates, and was predicated on various assumptions for FY18, including: an alumina price of US$299/t; a manganese ore price
     of US$4.50/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$4.27/lb; a thermal coal price of US$72/t (API4) for South Africa Energy
     Coal; a silver price of US$16.82/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,135/t; a zinc price of US$2,555/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.74; a
     USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.17 and a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,961; all of which reflected forward markets as at May 2017 or our
     internal expectations.

2.   In May 2017, South32 acquired 45 million Common Shares, or approximately 15 per cent of Arizona Mining as part of a private placement
     and investor rights agreement. The investor rights agreement allows South32 to acquire up to, but no more than 19.9 per cent of Arizona
     Mining within an 18-month standstill period without the consent of Arizona Mining’s board of directors. Under the terms of the September
     2017 forward contract, a third-party financial institution will seek to purchase the additional shares in the market over a maximum period of
     12 months. Trading activity will occur at the financial institution’s sole discretion, subject to certain agreed trading parameters. South32
     settled the contract in full before the program commenced. The final cost will be determined on completion of the program and will be based
     on the daily volume weighted average price of the shares over the period.

3.   Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends.

4.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned by
     the
     B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable to these parties,
     pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted
     at 100%.
5.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported
     at 60%. The Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
6.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes
     per annum (ktpa); million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per annum (Mtpa); thousand ounces (koz); million ounces (Moz); thousand wet metric

                               ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL UPDATE

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) announced today that it has
concluded its review into Illawarra Metallurgical Coal’s operating systems and processes, and has
completed remedial action required to safely and sustainably recommence production at the Appin
mine following a staged ramp-up of activity through September.

Longwall 707 restarted production today and we plan to operate a single longwall at the Appin
mine consistent with the prescribed ramp-up conditions. This plan will be adopted across the
remainder of FY18, before returning to a two longwall configuration in the December 2018 quarter.
Longwall 707 is expected to be completed during the June 2018 quarter, at which point we will
commence production at Longwall 902.

South32 Chief Executive Officer Graham Kerr said: “We have completed a detailed review of
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal’s operating systems and processes to address the unacceptable levels
of performance that have been achieved as the Appin Area 9 project1 ramped-up to capacity.”

“Longwall utilisation rates of 30% to 40% are significantly below industry benchmark levels and an
opportunity exists for us to sustainably improve productivity in order to maximise the value of this
high quality, long life resource.”

“While unit operating costs and profitability will be significantly impacted by a lower rate of
production in FY18, a measured ramp-up of activity at the Appin mine will allow us to reset the
operation’s culture, re-establish minimum performance criteria and drive productivity towards a
more acceptable level.”

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal produced 819kt of coal during the September 2017 quarter (494kt
metallurgical coal, 325kt energy coal). A longwall move is scheduled for the Dendrobium mine in
the March 2018 quarter.

About South32

1. In June 2012, the BHP Billiton Board approved a US$845 million investment to sustain operations at Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal by establishing a replacement mining area at Appin mine (Appin Area 9 project). The project was
completed in the March 2016 quarter, at which point it replaced production from the West Cliff mine.

Additional information

The following information is extracted from the 2017 Annual Report (page references are to
pages in the Annual Report) and should be read in conjunction with South32’s Financial Results
and Outlook for the year ended 30 June 2017 announcement issued on 24 August 2017. Both
documents can be found at www.south32.net and together constitute the material required by
DTR 6.3.5 to be communicated to the media in unedited full text through a Regulatory
Information Service. This material is not a substitute for reading the 2017 Annual Report in full.

1. Principal risks and uncertainties

Risk management

Risk is inherent in our business. To maintain our social licence to operate, remain a valued
member of our communities and ensure our continued success, we actively manage our risks.
Our risk management framework sets out our overall approach to risk management including
how we identify, monitor and manage material risks associated with our activities. This
framework applies to all employees, Directors and contractors of South32 and its subsidiaries.

Strategic and External risks

Fluctuations in commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates and the global economy

Risk: Our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows are affected by the volatility of commodity
prices, exchange rates and interest rates. Significant deterioration in commodity prices or



Registered Office: Level 35, 108 St Georges Terrace, Perth Western Australia 6000, Australia
ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia
unfavourable currency movements have the potential to adversely impact the value of our
operations and our ability to declare dividends. Financing costs, currency, input costs and
commodity prices are managed based on floating indices. Prices are determined by the balance
of supply and demand for commodities. Costs are impacted by the local currencies of
operations.

Mitigation: We expect commodity prices and exchange rates to remain volatile. The quality of our
operations and commitment to a strong balance sheet mitigates against this volatility. In addition,
our diverse commodity and geographical exposure reduces the impact of volatility relative to a
single commodity, single geography producer. We also actively monitor the markets in which we
operate and continuously review our operating and capital expenditure plans.

Political events, actions by governments or tax authorities

Risk: New regulations, such as changes to taxation policy or controls on imports, exports and
prices have the potential to adversely impact our business. We make long-term investments that
depend on long-term fiscal and regulatory stability. Risks of nationalisation, renegotiation or
nullification of contracts, leases, permits or agreements vary by jurisdiction.

Mitigation: We are committed to creating shared value. Whilst regulatory complexity and
associated costs of compliance are increasing, we regularly engage with regulators in a
transparent way to ensure potential changes are identified, understood and incorporated into our
risk management approach. We publish an annual Tax Transparency and Payments to
Governments report which outlines our approach to tax governance and details our tax
payments to governments on a country-by-country and project by project basis.

Cost inflation and labour disputes could impact operating margins and expansion opportunities

Risk: Price inflation of key inputs has the potential to negatively impact operating margins.
Labour is a significant operating cost and varies depending on the underlying demand for
people. An increase in capital costs or scheduling delays could also impact financial returns on
capital investments.

Mitigation: Our people are our most valuable resource. We aspire to have constructive
relationships with our employees and trade unions across our business. We monitor the markets
in which we operate to understand cost inflation impacts. Investment decisions are governed by
our capital management framework and all discretionary investments compete, based on the
assessed risk and key financial criteria.

Climate change

Risk: Climate change can impact a business’ revenue and expenditure in several ways. This
could result in exposure to carbon pricing, litigation, changes in technology, changing demand
and supply conditions, reputational impacts and physical impacts from climate change,
depending on how we and broader society respond.

Mitigation: To mitigate or adapt to climate change risks, take advantage of opportunities and
support global action, our Climate Change Strategy focuses on:
     • Climate change opportunity
     • Climate resilience
     • Emissions reduction
We also undertake climate change scenario analysis, which supports our business strategy and
capital allocation decisions. Our operations carry out exploration as well as research and
development necessary to support these activities. We support climate action and the transition
to a lower carbon future. We have also chosen not to develop any new greenfield energy coal
basins and there is no material risk to the book value of our current assets. More information
can be found in Our Approach to Climate Change report, which is on our website.

Failure to maintain, realise or enhance existing reserves
Risk: Mineral/Coal Resource and Ore/Coal Reserve estimates are based on our knowledge of
deposits using generally accepted industry practice through appropriate data collection,
analytical assessment and studies. Our value is limited to the known resource and reserve
position. Failure to take the right opportunities to optimise and enhance our resource and
reserve position could detrimentally impact long-term shareholder returns. Our understanding of
the resource and reserve position also impacts how we value and report our operations and our
decision making on investment opportunities.

Mitigation: We have a number of initiatives in place to optimise our operations, unlock their
potential and identify new options that may compete for capital. Our capital management
framework and capital prioritisation process is designed to maximise total shareholder returns.
We report Mineral/Coal Resources and Ore/Coal Reserves as required by the ASX Listing Rules
and rely on Competent Persons with sufficient relevant experience to provide these estimates.
We apply a comprehensive program of review and audit aimed at providing assurance in respect
of Mineral/Coal Resources and Ore/Coal Reserves estimates.

Deterioration in liquidity and cash flow

Risk: External factors may adversely impact cash flows, liquidity and cash reserves. As a result,
interest rate costs on borrowed debt and future access to financial capital markets could be
adversely affected.

Mitigation: We have committed to maintain an investment grade credit rating and strong liquidity
throughout economic cycles. We manage our balance sheet and cash flow within strict financial
criteria and will not combine undue financial and commodity price leverage.

Operational Risks

Health and safety risks in respect of our activities

Risk: Health and safety events that have the potential to adversely impact our people and
operations are covered in detail within the Sustainability sections of the Annual Reporting Suite,
which is published on our website.

Mitigation: The health and safety of our employees is paramount and underpins everything we
do. Our operations have comprehensive health and safety policies with associated performance
requirements that are designed to prevent and mitigate exposures. Our Care Strategy is focused
on reducing the exposure of our people to health and safety risk through creating an inclusive
workplace, where work is well-designed and we continuously learn and improve to deliver safe
outcomes.

Access to water and power

Risk: Water and power are critical to our operations. Continued access to water and power to
support our existing activities on current terms is not guaranteed. Underlying factors can change,
such as the climate, counterparties, contractual arrangements or government policy.

Mitigation: We work closely with suppliers of water and power, engaging on a long-term,
mutually beneficial basis. We also work to secure energy and water resources within our control,
noting that the risk of access to power in Africa has decreased, while the risk of access to water
for our operations has increased, subject to seasonal variations. Where appropriate, we are
diversifying our energy supply sources and investing in desalination facilities.

Water and waste water management, and environmental risks

Risk: Our operations have the potential to impact biodiversity, land, water and related
ecosystems. Scrutiny in this area is increasing and regulatory requirements or stakeholder
expectations may prevent or delay project approvals and result in increased mitigation costs or
compensatory actions. The sustainability of operations may also be impacted.
Mitigation: We are committed to excellence in water and waste water management and use
water responsibly, taking into account natural supply variations. Whilst regulatory complexity and
the associated costs of compliance are increasing, our policies and standards are designed to
prevent, monitor and reduce the impact of our operations on the environment.

Unexpected operational or natural catastrophes

Risk: Our operations and transport networks can be exposed to incidents such as fire, explosion,
flooding, geotechnical failures, loss of power supply, mechanical equipment failures and
unexpected natural catastrophes. The frequency and severity of these incidents may be
exacerbated by climate change.

Mitigation: Our operations use tools to analyse risks and design plans that prevent or limit
impacts. This includes incorporating the most up-to-date climate parameters into our planning,
risk and valuation models. Contingency, business continuity and disaster recovery plans
facilitate rapid response to significant events and ensure the safe restoration of operations.
Where available and cost effective, we purchase insurance to mitigate financial consequences.

Counterparties that we transact with may not meet their obligations

Risk: We contract with commercial, government and financial counterparties, including
customers, suppliers and financial institutions who may fail to perform against contracts and
obligations, impacting cost or price performance. Non-supply or changes to the quality of key
inputs may impact both production volumes and costs at our operations.

Mitigation: We proactively engage with all counterparties to manage instances of non-supply or
quality control prior to occurrence. Our operations use counterparty credit ratings and manage
within set counterparty limits. Our insurance program mitigates the financial consequences of
supply disruption, subject to availability and cost.

Risks of fraud and corruption

Risk: We are exposed to the risks of fraud and corruption, both within and external to our
organisation. Fraud and corruption may lead to regulatory fines, financial loss, litigation, loss of
operating licences or reputational damage.

Mitigation: Our people are trained to assess potentially fraudulent or corrupt activities. Our Code
of Business Conduct, policies and procedures mandate expectations aligned with legislative and
regulatory requirements. We provide our employees and third parties with mechanisms to safely
report suspected fraud or corruption.

Breaches of information technology security

Risk: Our information technology systems could be subject to security breaches resulting in theft,
disclosure or corruption of information. Security breaches could also result in misappropriation of
funds or disruption to operations. Cyber security risk is increasing due to the continued
deployment of technology in our industry and operations as well as the number and
sophistication of cyberattacks.

Mitigation: Cyber security risk is managed by our network and physical control frameworks,
together with anti-virus software. Monitoring of networks, ethical hacking and data analysis is
undertaken to identify suspicious activity and potential exposures. The Risk and Audit
Committee reviews the management of cyber security risk twice a year.

Failure to retain and attract key employees

Risk: The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract, train and retain sufficiently qualified
employees could affect our operations, financial position and growth.

Mitigation: The attraction and retention of key personnel is a priority and fundamental to our
long-term success. Our people approach guides how we attract, employ, develop, engage and
retain talented people. We focus on having an inclusive workplace, developing future leaders
and investing in our people.

The currency exchange rate is the volume weighted average price achieved on foreign exchange
trades executed over the period 4 September 2017 to 8 September 2017.

The exchange rates applicable to the South32 dividend being paid in other currencies will be
determined over the period 8 September 2017 to 20 September 2017. Details of the currency
exchange rates applicable for the dividend will be announced to the relevant stock exchanges.

South32 shareholders registered on the South African branch register will not be able to
dematerialise or rematerialise their shareholdings between 13 September 2017 and
15 September 2017 (both dates inclusive), nor will transfers to or from the South African branch
register be permitted between 8 September 2017 and 15 September 2017 (both dates inclusive).

1. South African dividends tax of 16.49504 South African cents per ordinary share will be
   withheld from the amount of the gross final dividend of 82.47520 South African cents per
   ordinary share paid to shareholders on the South African branch register at the rate of 20%,
   unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption.

2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividend will be 65.98016
   South African cents per ordinary share.

3. Australia is the country of source of income, the dividend is regarded as 'foreign' for the
   purposes of South African dividends tax.

   date of 24 August 2017.

   African branch register.

Shareholders on the South African branch register should direct any questions regarding the
application of the South African dividends tax to Computershare Investor Services online at

Update on estimates of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves

South32 confirms a 42% increase in the total estimated open cut Mineral Resource at Cannington to
29 Mt, compared to the previously published 30 June 2016 estimate (see Appendix 1 Table 1 and Table 2). 
The increase is due to a revision of the 'reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction' criteria 
for open cut mining. The open cut Mineral Resource preserves the potential development option until a decision 
is required, beyond 2020.

A 24% increase in the total estimated Measured Mineral Resource (to 80 Mt) reflects a change in
classification approach of this Mineral Resource, that considers confidence in both geological and grade
estimation continuity.

A 20% reduction (15.6 Mt) in the previously reported underground Mineral Resource is attributable
to its reclassification to the open cut Mineral Resource; mining depletion and sterilisation of the
underground Mineral Resource; and an increase in reporting net smelter return (NSR) cut-off.

South32 confirms a 9% increase (2Mt) in total estimated underground Ore Reserves at Cannington
compared to the previously published 30 June 2016 estimate. The increase is due to additional drilling,
and an updated resource model and mine plans. Changes include a 31% increase (5.4Mt) in the
Proved Ore Reserve reflecting changes to the Mineral Resource classification approach.

The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates as at 30 June 2017 are presented in Appendix 1 Table 1 
and Table 3 and a comparison to the previously published Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves
estimates (as at 30 June 2016) are presented in Table 2 and Table 4.

The estimates of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are reported in accordance with the Australasian
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 (JORC Code) and
the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules. The breakdown of the total estimates of Mineral
Resources and Ore Reserves into the specific JORC Code categories is contained in the Appendix 1 tables. 
This report summarises the information contained in the JORC Code Table 1 which is included in
Appendix 2 to this report.

Estimate of Mineral Resources

Geology and geological interpretation

Cannington is a Broken Hill Type (BHT) silver-lead-zinc massive sulphide deposit hosted by Proterozoic
age high-grade metamorphic lithologies of the Soldiers Cap Group, located in the Eastern Succession of
the Mount Isa Block.

Mineralisation is stratiform bound along the limbs of a tight isoclinal recumbent synform with an easterly
dip and a southerly plunge. The core of the synform is composed of amphibolite with encompassing silver-
lead-zinc sulphide mineralisation. The mineralisation has been divided into nine types based on textural,
mineralogical and geochemical characteristics which assist in defining metallurgical performance.

Drilling techniques

Out of a total of 6,884 drill holes considered for this resource update, 6,803 are diamond core and 81 are
surface percussion/reverse circulation drill holes. 89% of the diamond core holes were drilled from
underground using a fan drilling pattern.

Sampling and sub-sampling techniques

All diamond core samples were halved and samples were collected on one metre (m) intervals through the
mineralised zone, including a visually identifiable buffer of at least six metres into the non-mineralised core.
The samples were submitted for preparation and analysis at the Cannington on-site laboratory. The
mineralised intersections are verified by mine geologists throughout each drilling programme and field
duplicates are within an acceptable range for resource modelling.

Sample analysis method

Samples are crushed to a nominal 2mm from which a 300g sub-sample is pulverized to 90% passing 75 microns, 
subjected to a three acid digest, and analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission
Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Coarse crushed duplicates and laboratory pulp duplicates were undertaken at a
submission rate of one in ten samples and one in 100 samples were sent to an external laboratory for
analysis.

Laboratory quality assurance and quality control measures at the Cannington laboratory include eight
geological standards made of homogenised Cannington ore representing the range of Mineral Resource
grades.

Cut-off grade

Cannington is a polymetallic deposit and a NSR dollar value is used for representing the minimum block
value required for potential economic extraction, determined as follows:

- Underground Mineral Resource cut-off of A$130/t (Dry Metric Tonnes); and
- Open cut Mineral Resource cut-off of A$58/t.

Mining and metallurgical methods and parameters

Cannington has been operating as an underground long hole open stope mine for 20 years and uses
periodically updated performance data to establish its modifying factors. This includes geological
interpretations with defined mineralisation and waste lithology as well as metallurgical recovery
assumptions which are reconciled annually.

Estimation methodology

Resource estimation is performed by ordinary kriging interpolation for silver (Ag), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and
for minor elements: iron (Fe), arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi), magnesium oxide (MgO) and silica oxide (SiO2).
Search estimation criteria are consistent with geostatistical models developed for each estimation domain
according to the appropriate geological controls. Validation includes statistical analysis, swath plots and
visual inspection.

Specific gravity measurements from drill cores are used as the basis for estimating dry bulk density in
tonnage calculations for both mineralised and non-mineralised material.

Mineral Resource classification

Mineral Resources are classified based on the level of data informing both the geological model and grade
estimation. Infill underground drill spacing to approximately 12.5mN x 15mE x 15mRL in the majority of
modelled areas provides a high confidence basis for geological modelling. Grade estimation confidence is
overlain on the geological modelling classification criteria. The kriging variance is matched to block
estimation conditions that relate to the number and distance of data, informing the estimate in relation to
semi-variogram models for Ag, Pb and Zn.

Estimate of Ore Reserves

The declared Ore Reserves are based on the Mineral Resource estimate as at 30 June 2017.

Material and economic assumptions

Cannington is an operating underground mine which has been in continuous operation since 1997.
Sufficient studies have been undertaken to enable Mineral Resources to be converted to Ore Reserves on
the basis of current operating methods and practices. The run-of-mine (ROM) ore is beneficiated on site
before being transported by road to the rail load-out facility (Yurbi) for transport to Townsville.

Capital costs are based on the expected future development of the mine, tailings facilities and sustaining
capital requirements. The costs are accounted for in the operation's valuation models. Operating costs are
estimated as part of the internal budgeting process. Transport charges are based on current truck, rail and
shipping contracts and are estimated as part of the internal budgeting process. Other economic
assumptions used for valuation reflect South32's view on demand, supply, volume forecasts and competitor
analysis and are commercially sensitive.

Ore Reserve classification

Proved and Probable Ore Reserves are derived from the respective Mineral Resource classification.
Internal dilution within the Ore Reserve stope boundaries represents <4% of the Ore Reserve by mass and
is considered to have the same level of confidence as the reported Mineral Resource.

The Mineral Resource inside each stope is considered for Ore Reserve should it have <30% of its total
mass as Inferred Mineral Resource and have a weighted average NSR value greater than or equal to
A$130 per dry metric tonne. Stopes within the life of operation plan that are considered to have either a
high level of geotechnical/operational risk, potential for sterilisation, marginal economics, or where there is
uncertainty in the modifying factors, are excluded from consideration as an Ore Reserve.

The Reserve Life reported in FY17 reflects the scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore
Reserves in the current approved life of operation plan. In FY16, Reserve Life was reported as the Ore
Reserves divided by the FY16 nominated production rate.

Mining method and assumptions

The underground mine is accessed via a single surface portal with a decline extending to a depth of 645m
below surface. Stope production is conducted using the Long Hole Open Stoping (LHOS) with backfill
mining method. The primary backfill method is paste fill with a supplementary use of ROM waste and ROM
paste rock. Mining extraction factors for tonnage and grade are updated annually and are applied to
individual mining blocks based on their individual characteristics. Extraction factors are derived from actual
mining performance/reconciliation data. Average stope dilution across the mine is 11% with mining
recovery at 91%.

Processing method and assumptions

The Cannington process plant has a demonstrated throughput capacity of 3.4Mtpa (million tonnes per
annum). The existing metallurgical process is appropriate to the style of mineralisation. Predicted metal
recoveries are derived using historic recovery regression models; over the life of the operation, average
recoveries for silver, lead and zinc are 85%, 87% and 80%, respectively. Regression models include
multiple input variables such as ROM grade, metal ratios, enrichment ratios, mill throughput and
concentrate grade. These models are revised annually using actual operating data.

There are no allowances made for deleterious elements in the life of operation plan valuation, with these
expected to remain non-material.

Cut-off grade

Cannington is a polymetallic deposit which uses an equivalent NSR value as a grade descriptor. NSR
considers the remaining gross value of the in-situ revenue generating elements once processing
recoveries, royalties, concentrate transport, refining costs and other deductions have been considered.
The cut-off strategy employed at Cannington is to optimise the net present value (NPV) of the operation. 
A dollar equivalent cut-off NSR of A$130 per dry metric tonne forms the basis of mine design and FY17 Ore
Reserve reporting. The chosen cut-off grade is supported by a cut-off grade optimisation study conducted
in FY16.

Estimation methodology

Ore Reserves are estimated from the current life of operation plan, revised in FY17 with updated modifying
factors, mine designs, geotechnical parameters, capacity constraints and mining sequences. The plan
provides the optimised long-term direction of the operation and provides the mining physicals from which
the Ore Reserves are scheduled and evaluated.

Material modifying factors

The reported Ore Reserves are those that are mined from underground using current mining methods and
practices and are fully contained within South32 mining tenements. The Ore Reserves are scheduled to
be extracted within the expiration date of all mining leases.

Cannington is an operating asset with all infrastructure required to execute the mine plan in place and
assumes no outstanding or foreseeable issues with material legal agreements. Long-term marketing
arrangements are in place with smelter supply contracts in various geopolitical regions.

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017      

South32 produces strong financial results and increases returns to shareholders

""The combination of our high operating leverage and stronger commodity prices delivered a substantial increase in financial
performance. Free cash flow more than tripled to US$1.9B and we finished the year with a net cash balance of US$1.6B.

""We announced a fully franked final dividend of US$334M, representing 50% of Underlying earnings in the second half and
increased our capital management program to US$750M, which is 6% of our market capitalisation.

""Our aluminium smelters and refineries operated at their maximum technical capability and Mozal achieved record
production. We adjusted production in our manganese business to take advantage of higher prices, consistent with our
focus on value over volume. A review of our operating systems and practices at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is continuing
and we are working towards a staged and controlled ramp-up of operations at our Appin colliery, commencing in
September.

""Looking to the year ahead, we will continue to unlock value within our existing operations, embed future options where
we see value and stretch performance in a sustainable way.""

2017 FINANCIAL YEAR SUMMARY

SAFETY

It is deeply regrettable that we lost one of our colleagues during the year in a work-related incident. In November 2016, a
contractor was fatally injured during relining activities at the Oxygen Blown Converter at our Metalloys Manganese Smelter
in South Africa. Our immediate response was to ensure that family and colleagues were offered our full support. We
conducted a detailed investigation led by a member of our Executive Committee, which was reviewed by the Sustainability
Committee of the Board, the CEO, and the management team to ensure we learned from what happened.

Nothing is more important to us than creating an environment where everyone goes home safe and well every day. Through
our Care Strategy we are building an inclusive workplace with a strong culture of care and accountability, where work is
well-designed and we continuously improve and learn. This focus has delivered an improvement in our Total Recordable
Injury Frequency (TRIF) to 6.0 per million hours worked (FY16: 7.7).


PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

A broad recovery in commodity prices and our portfolio’s operating leverage combined to deliver a significant increase in return 
on invested capital to 11.4% and a US$1.3B increase in free cash flow to US$1.9B, including equity accounted investments. 
This strong improvement in financial performance and the disciplined application of our capital management framework allowed us 
to invest in our operations, create future options and substantially increase returns to shareholders.
Specific performance highlights included:

-   Strong performance across our aluminium supply chain, including record production at Mozal Aluminium;
-   A 19% increase in South Africa Manganese ore production as we responded to favourable market conditions;
-   A US$360M reduction in controllable costs for a cumulative saving of approximately US$700M over two years;
-   The unlocking of additional value with first ore delivered from the higher grade La Esmeralda deposit at Cerro Matoso,
    conclusion of the access agreement for the West Marradong bauxite mining area at Worsley Alumina and completion
    of the US$265M Klipspruit Life Extension (KPSX) project feasibility study;
-   A US$81M investment in Arizona Mining (TSX:AZ), owner of the high grade zinc, lead and silver Taylor deposit;
-   The creation of options beyond our portfolio with finalisation of the Trilogy Metals (TSX:TMQ) and AusQuest
    (ASX:AQD) greenfield exploration agreements, targeting base metals;
-   A US$1.3B increase in our period end net cash balance to US$1.6B;
-   A US$250M increase in our approved capital management program to US$750M, equating to 6% of our current market
    capitalisation(8); and
-   A fully franked final dividend of US$334M, representing 50% of Underlying earnings in the June 2017 half year.

EARNINGS

The Group's statutory profit after tax was US$1.2B in FY17. The corresponding period's loss of US$1.6B was impacted by
the recognition of impairment charges totalling US$1.7B (post-tax US$1.7B).

Consistent with our accounting policy, various items are excluded from the Group's statutory profit to derive Underlying
earnings including: exchange rate losses associated with the restatement of monetary items (US$37M pre-tax); fair value
gains on derivative instruments (US$194M pre-tax); exchange rate losses associated with the Group's non US dollar
denominated net debt (US$35M pre-tax); the tax expense for all pre-tax earnings adjustments (US$27M) and significant
items (nil). Further information on these earnings adjustments is included.

The Group generated Underlying EBITDA of US$2.4B in FY17. Higher prices for the majority of our commodities gave rise
to a US$1.1B increase in sales revenue, despite lower volumes, for an operating margin of 39%(5). Underlying EBIT
increased by US$1.3B (or 363%) to US$1.6B, further benefitting from a reduction in depreciation and amortisation following
the recognition of non-cash impairment charges in FY16. Underlying earnings subsequently increased by US$1.0B to
US$1.1B.

CASH FLOW

A broad recovery in commodity prices and our portfolio's operating leverage combined to deliver a US$888M increase in
free cash flow from operations, excluding equity accounted investments, to US$1.5B. The deferral of activity at South Africa
Energy Coal and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, following the impact of adverse weather and operational outages, contributed
to a US$67M reduction in capital expenditure to US$316M, excluding equity accounted investments. This included:

-   Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including
    underground development) of US$300M; and
-   Major project capital expenditure of US$16M.

The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation of exploration accounted for a further US$3M of expenditure.

The KPSX project feasibility study is complete and a final investment decision is expected in H1 FY18 pending completion
of our internal approvals processes. With the associated deferral of land purchases, expenditure on Major projects was
lower than planned.

Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of US$37M included the second phase of the Central
Block development project at the Wessels underground mine (South Africa Manganese). The successful commissioning
of this project in the March 2017 quarter enables mining activity to relocate closer to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing
cycle times.

Total capital expenditure(13), including equity accounted investments, was US$356M in FY17.

A US$63M reduction in provisions predominantly relating to our closure and rehabilitation obligations in South Africa and 
a US$60M increase in inventory contributed to a build in working capital of US$105M. While a component of working capital 
is expected to unwind in H1 FY18, this will be more than offset by the payment of shareholder dividends, taxes and our
ongoing capital management program.

A further US$15M in dividends were received from other investments, including Mineração Rio do Norte S.A.

BALANCE SHEET & CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's net cash balance appreciated considerably during the year to finish the period at US$1.6B. The increase in
cash and cash equivalents to US$2.7B also reflects the cash management activities that the Group undertakes on behalf
of the manganese joint venture which are offset by a commensurate increase in other interest bearing liabilities. The US$11M
increase in finance leases is primarily associated with the stronger Australian dollar at the end of FY17.

Standard and Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed the Group's BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings respectively, following their annual
reviews in FY17.

We continue to believe that a combination of high operating leverage and undue financial leverage delivers a sub-optimal
outcome for shareholders. Our simple capital management framework reflects this core principle whereby we prioritise
investment in our business to maintain the integrity of our operations and an investment grade credit rating. Our dividend
policy then intends to distribute a minimum 40% of Underlying earnings to shareholders in each six month period, franking
dividends to the maximum extent practicable. Once these core objectives are met, we consider how best to allocate any
excess capital to maximise shareholder value.

Our analysis indicates that a net debt position of approximately US$500M is our optimal capital structure, although we do
intend to hold additional cash on the balance sheet in the current environment, as it affords even greater flexibility. Having
exceeded our thresholds during H2 FY17, we announced a US$500M capital management program and commenced an
on-market share buy-back as it was determined to be the most efficient mechanism available to return cash to shareholders
at that time. This program has subsequently been increased to US$750M, with 105.8M shares purchased to date for a
cash consideration of US$211M (A$2.66 per share).

DIVIDENDS

Given the strength of the Group's net cash position and available franking credits, the Board resolved to pay a fully franked
final dividend of US 6.4 cents per share in respect of FY17, equating to 50% of Underlying earnings in the June 2017 half
year. The decision to temporarily increase the pay-out ratio distributes available franking credits in a timely manner.

OUTLOOK

PRODUCTION

The Group's production guidance for FY18 is largely unchanged for the majority of our operations. Production at
Cannington and South Africa Energy Coal is, however, expected to decline in FY18 in accordance with prior market
disclosure. Following regulator intervention at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal we are reviewing our operating systems and
practices, with a specific emphasis on gas drainage and ventilation at the Appin colliery. A staged ramp-up of the Appin
707 longwall is expected to commence in early September. The reliability and predictability of its performance, and our
associated gas management activities, will inform our future plans and ability to ramp-up to historical rates of production.
We will provide a further update when we release our September quarterly results on 19 October 2017.

COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Despite the impact of lower volumes and the appreciation of foreign exchange rates, we achieved FY17 unit cost guidance
at the majority of our operations and will seek to mitigate inflationary pressure again in FY18. Operating unit cost guidance
for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal will be provided when we have finalised our operating plans for FY18.

Corporate costs of US$80M are projected for FY18, with the US$10M increase largely accounted for by greenfield
exploration activity, which is expected to rise to by US$7M to US$20M. This investment will be directed towards base metals
exploration in North and South America, and Australia.

Depreciation and amortisation (excluding equity accounted investments) is expected to remain largely unchanged at
approximately US$760M. Depreciation and amortisation of US$85M is expected for our equity accounted investments.

The Group's Underlying ETR, which excludes tax associated with equity accounted investments, largely reflects the
geographic distribution of the Group's profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%, South
Africa 28%, Colombia 39% and Brazil 34%. It should also be recognised that permanent differences have a
disproportionate effect on the Group's Underlying ETR when commodity prices and profit margins are compressed, while
the higher level of profitability in FY17 will feed through to higher tax payments in FY18.

(a)   FY18e Operating unit cost guidance includes royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and is predicated on various
      assumptions for FY18, including: an alumina price of US$299/t; a manganese ore price of US$4.50/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price
      of US$4.27/lb; a thermal coal price of US$72/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$16.82/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,135/t; a
      zinc price of US$2,555/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.74; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.17 and a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,961; all of

(c)   US dollar per tonne of ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact operating unit costs as related marketing costs
      and treatment and refining charges may change.

Capital expenditure guidance

The deferral of approximately US$50M of expenditure at South Africa Energy Coal and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal from
FY17 into FY18 and a marginally higher rate of investment in our business is expected to result in Sustaining capital
expenditure, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$430M in FY18. Major project capital expenditure is expected
to rise to US$50M. This reflects planned investment in the South Africa Energy Coal KPSX project, pending its approval
in H1 FY18. Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments is also expected to increase to US$70M
and includes the construction of additional tailings storage capacity at Australia Manganese (GEMCO).

The higher rate of Sustaining capital expenditure includes: the construction of new mining areas at South Africa Energy
Coal's Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC); additional underground development at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal to
access two new longwall panels at Dendrobium; the continuing development of the higher grade La Esmeralda deposit at
Cerro Matoso; and the commencement of the US$38M(16) AP3XLE energy efficiency project at Mozal Aluminium.

WORSLEY ALUMINA
(86% SHARE)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 2%
(or 69kt) to 3.9Mt in FY17 as performance was impacted by
unplanned calciner maintenance in the March 2017 quarter.
The refinery finished the year on a strong note, operating at
its expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) in the June
2017 quarter.

Production of approximately 4.0Mt is expected in each of
FY18 and FY19, with the refinery expected to sustain
record rates of production.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 3% to US$203/t in FY17 as
we optimised the refinery's energy mix and achieved greater
energy efficiency. We also reduced maintenance expenditure
and contractor costs, offsetting the impact of a stronger
Australian dollar and higher caustic soda prices.

The refinery's Operating unit cost is expected to rise marginally
to US$211/t in FY18 as a result of an assumed 25% year-on-
year increase in caustic soda prices. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed on page
12, footnote a.

Financial performance

The US$117M improvement in Underlying EBIT to US$159M
was primarily attributable to a 10% increase in average
realised alumina prices (+US$104M) and a significant
reduction in controllable costs (+US$97M). These benefits
were partially offset by higher caustic soda prices (-US$23M)
and a strengthening Australian dollar (-US$19M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure of US$43M remained largely
unchanged in FY17 as we continued to invest in water
infrastructure. Our investment in bauxite residue disposal
capacity and boiler maintenance will result in a modest
increase in capital expenditure in FY18 to US$48M.

SOUTH AFRICA ALUMINIUM
(100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production increased by
2% (or 17kt) to 714kt in FY17 as the smelter continued to
achieve benchmark levels of current efficiency and pot line
performance, 22 pots were brought back online in the
December 2016 quarter and there were fewer
load-shedding events. Production is expected to increase
to a record 720kt in FY18 and FY19.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs were largely unchanged in FY17 at
US$1,454/t as higher electricity costs linked to the LME
aluminium price and the impact of a stronger South African
rand were largely offset by a reduction in pot relining costs. A
total of 75 pots were relined in FY17 at a cost of approximately
US$234k per pot (FY16: 183 pots at US$191k per pot). 139
pots are scheduled to be relined in FY18.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the cost
profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by power
and raw material inputs, given the operation's high variable
cost base. Hillside sources power from Eskom under long-term
contracts. The price of electricity supplied to potlines 1 and 2
is linked to the LME aluminium price and the South African
rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price of electricity supplied
to potline 3 is South African rand based and linked to South
African and United States producer price indices.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$137M in FY17 to
US$219M. The significant improvement in profitability was
underpinned by a 13% increase in the average realised price
of aluminium (+US$158M) and stronger sales volumes
(+US$6M). Higher LME aluminium price-linked electricity
costs reduced Underlying EBIT by US$21M.

Capital expenditure

MOZAL ALUMINIUM
(47.1% SHARE)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium achieved record performance in FY17,
increasing production by 2% (or 5kt) to 271kt as the smelter
maintained benchmark levels of current efficiency and pot
line performance, while benefitting from fewer
load-shedding events. Production is expected to remain
largely unchanged at 269kt in FY18 and FY19.

Operating costs
Operating unit costs decreased by 4% to US$1,495/t in FY17
as the benefit of stronger sales volumes was partially offset by
higher electricity input costs. A total of 94(16) pots were relined
in FY17 at a cost of approximately US$204k per pot (FY16:
109(16) pots at US$207k per pot). 82(16) pots are scheduled to
be relined in FY18.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the cost
profile of the smelter is heavily influenced by power and raw
material inputs, given the operation's high variable cost base.
Mozal Aluminium utilises hydroelectric power under a long-
term contract that is generated by Hidroeléctrica de Cahora
Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power into the South African grid
to Eskom and Mozal Aluminium sources the power via the
Mozambique Transmission Company (Motraco).

Financial performance

Mozal Aluminium became profitable in FY17 as Underlying
EBIT increased to US$76M. Strong sales volumes
(+US$32M) and a 12% increase in the average realised price
of aluminium (+US$58M) were partially offset by higher
alumina costs (-US$12M).

Capital expenditure
While Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 14% to
US$6M in FY17, the pending approval of the US$38M(16)
AP3XLE energy efficiency project is expected to result in a
modest increase in expenditure in FY18. This project is
expected to deliver a strong rate of return on incremental
investment by delivering a circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in
annual production with no associated increase in power
consumption. First production is anticipated in FY20, with the
full benefit realised in FY24.

BRAZIL ALUMINA
(ALUMINA 36% SHARE, ALUMINIUM
40% SHARE)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable production of 1.3Mt in FY17
remained largely unchanged from the record rate achieved
in the prior period. Production is expected to increase to
1.35Mt in FY18 with the De-bottlenecking Phase One
project scheduled to ramp up during the December 2017
quarter.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs at the non-operated refinery increased by
4% to US$197/t in FY17 as a stronger Brazilian real and higher
caustic soda prices were partially offset by lower bauxite costs.

Financial performance

Alumina Underlying EBIT increased by US$33M in FY17 to
US$69M. A 15% increase in the average realised price of
alumina (+US$54M) was partially offset by general inflation
(-US$8M), a rise in caustic soda prices (-US$5M) and a
stronger Brazilian real (-US$16M). Aluminium Underlying
EBIT decreased by US$45M to a loss of US$3M as the
contribution of power sales declined.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure at the refinery increased by
67% to US$20M in FY17 as we invested in additional bauxite
residue disposal capacity. Sustaining capital expenditure of
US$18M in FY18 will reflect a continuation of this activity and
the completion of the De-bottlenecking Phase One project.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL
(92% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased
by 9% (or 2.8Mt) to 28.9Mt in FY17, despite an 11%
improvement in performance in the June 2017 quarter as
throughput increased at the WMC export plant. Despite the
improving trend, a 5% reduction in total coal production to
27.5Mt is anticipated in FY18 as the prior delay in
development activity at the WMC and depletion of the North
dump continue to weigh on performance. A 7%
improvement in total coal production is anticipated in FY19
to 29.3Mt with ongoing development.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 12% in FY17 to US$29/t as
the operation's high fixed cost base was absorbed by lower
sales volumes and the South African rand appreciated.

We expect Operating unit costs to increase to US$32/t in FY18
as a result of the further decline in production and general
inflation. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18 unit
cost guidance are detailed on page 12, footnote a.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$117M in FY17 to US$212M
as a higher average realised coal price (+US$230M) and a
favourable movement in working capital (+US$78M) more
than offset the impact of lower sales volumes (-US$158M) and
general inflation (-US$48M).

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased marginally to
US$56M in FY17. This was US$19M lower than planned as
adverse weather impacted the development schedule in the
WMC. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to rise to
US$112M in FY18 as the rate of investment in the WMC
accelerates.

Major project capital expenditure is expected to increase to
US$50M in FY18. This reflects planned investment in the
KPSX project with a final investment decision expected in
H1 FY18, pending our internal approvals processes.

ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL
(100%)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production
decreased by 15% (or 1.3Mt) to 7.1Mt in FY17, despite
record run-of-mine performance at Dendrobium, as
challenging ground conditions in the new Appin Area 901
longwall panel and two extended outages at the Appin
colliery significantly impacted performance. Metallurgical
coal sales were 4% (or 255kt) higher than production in
FY17.

We are continuing to review our operating systems and
practices at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, with a specific
emphasis on gas drainage and ventilation at the Appin
colliery. A staged ramp-up of the Appin 707 longwall is
expected to commence in early September. The reliability
and predictability of its performance, and our associated
gas management activities, will inform our future plans and
ability to ramp-up to historical rates of production. We will
provide a further update when we release our September
quarterly results on 19 October 2017.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs increased by 31% to US$80/t in FY17 as
lower production significantly impacted productivity. Additional
cost pressure stemmed from higher price-linked royalties and
a stronger Australian dollar.

Operating unit cost guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical
Coal will be provided when we have finalised our operating
plans for FY18.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$419M to US$358M in FY17
as the benefit of higher average realised coal prices
(+US$576M) outweighed the impact of lower sales volumes 
(-US$85M), higher royalties (-US$32M) and a stronger
Australian dollar (-US$16M). Our average realised price for
FY17 reflected a modest discount to the premium low-volatile
hard coking coal index on a volume weighted M-1 basis(19) as
our shipping schedule was affected by our prior declaration of
force majeure and the drawdown of finished goods inventory
in the second half.

Capital expenditure

Total capital expenditure decreased by 39% in FY17 to
US$112M, including underground development of
approximately US$63M.

Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to increase by
US$46M in FY18 to US$150M. This includes underground
development of US$80M, part of which will provide access to
two new longwall panels at Dendrobium.

AUSTRALIA MANGANESE
(60% SHARE)

Volumes

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by
3% (or 77kwmt) to 3.0Mwmt in FY17 as performance was
impacted by heavy rainfall and Tropical Cyclone Alfred in
the March 2017 quarter. The PC02 circuit operated at
approximately 90% of its 500kwmt (100% share) capacity
in the June 2017 quarter, contributing 6% of total production
across FY17 (FY16: 1%). Saleable manganese alloy
production increased by 11% (or 14kt) to 147kt in FY17 as
third party power supply to TEMCO was restored and all
four furnaces ramped-up to full capacity in the June 2017
quarter.

Ore production is expected to increase to 3.1Mwmt in FY18.
This assumes the low cost PC02 circuit operates at
nameplate capacity. Production in FY19 will be adjusted in response 
to market demand, consistent with our focus on value over volume, 
albeit we are positioned to deliver an increase in primary 
concentrated availability.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs increased by 8% to
US$1.52/dmtu in FY17 as a result of a stronger Australian
dollar and higher price-linked royalties.

Operating unit costs are expected to decline to US$1.50/dmtu
in FY18 as the PC02 circuit operates at capacity and a general
improvement in productivity is achieved. Exchange rate and
price assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed on
page 12, footnote a.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$402M in FY17 to
US$467M. A significant improvement in average ore and alloy
prices (+US$392M), and a reduction in depreciation and
amortisation (+US$35M) were only partially offset by higher
royalties (-US$8M) and a stronger Australian dollar (-US$8M).
Our average realised price for external sales of Australian
ore in FY17 reflected the high grade 44% manganese lump
ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on a volume weighted M-1
basis(20), despite the contribution of 40% grade PC02
product to the sales mix.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 59% to US$28M
in FY17 following the completion of the PC02 project, while
exploration drilling at GEMCO's Southern Areas commenced
in the December 2016 quarter. Sustaining capital expenditure
will rise to US$47M in FY18 as we invest in additional tailings
storage capacity at GEMCO. Our FY18 plan also includes
investment within our alloys business of US$5M.

SOUTH AFRICA MANGANESE
(ORE 44.4% SHARE, ALLOY 60% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased
by 19% (or 327kwmt) to 2.0Mwmt in FY17 as we continued
to take advantage of stronger demand and pricing by
utilising higher cost trucking activity and opportunistically
selling fine grained Wessels concentrate. This low cost
product, which accounted for 9% of sales across FY17
(FY16: 4%), receives a substantial product discount when
referenced to index prices. Manganese alloy saleable
production decreased by 20% (or 18kt) to 73kt in FY17 as
a result of furnace instability. Metalloys continues to
operate one of its four furnaces.

In H1 FY16 we reconfigured the Hotazel mines to operate
at a rate of 2.9Mwmt pa, but with greater flexibility.
Production of 3.1Mwmt(16) is expected in FY18. Production 
in FY19 will be adjusted in response to market demand, 
consistent with our focus on value over volume.

Operating costs

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs increased by 9% to
US$2.09/dmtu in FY17 as a result of a stronger South African
rand, general inflation and higher price-linked royalties. The
drawdown of low cost Wessels concentrate stockpiles largely offsets
higher costs associated with opportunistic trucking activity.

FOB manganese ore Operating unit costs are expected to
remain largely unchanged at US$2.06/dmtu in FY18, despite
a reduction in sales volumes, as the ramp-up of the Wessels
Central Block is expected to reduce cycle times and improve
productivity. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18
unit cost guidance are detailed on page 12, footnote a.

Financial performance
Underlying EBIT increased by US$157M in FY17 to US$110M
as a significant improvement in average ore and alloy prices
(+US$171M) and stronger ore sales volumes (+US$10M)
were only partially offset by higher royalties (-US$15M) and an
increase in trucking activity (-US$5M). Our average realised
manganese ore price for external sales reflected a 12%
discount to the medium grade 37% manganese lump ore
index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on a volume
weighted M-1 basis(21) as a result of the larger discount
received for Wessels concentrate.

Capital expenditure
While Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 18% to
US$9M in FY17, it is expected to rise to US$23M in FY18,
including US$4M for alloys. This rise in investment primarily
reflects a general increase in mine and equipment
maintenance.

CERRO MATOSO
(99.9% SHARE)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production remained largely
unchanged in FY17 as a reduction in furnace availability
was offset by the delivery of first ore from the higher grade
La Esmeralda deposit in March 2017. Payable nickel
production is expected to increase by 14% in FY18 to 41.6kt
as a higher proportion of ore feed is sourced from
La Esmeralda.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 8% in FY17 to US$3.77/lb
as contractor activity was curtailed and higher grades and
lower throughput led to a modest reduction in variable costs.

The forecast 6% reduction in Operating unit costs to
US$3.53/lb in FY18 reflects the increasing contribution of
higher grade La Esmeralda ore and the associated increase in
payable nickel production. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for FY18 unit cost guidance are detailed on page
12, footnote a.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$72M in FY17 to a loss of
US$16M as the average realised price of nickel increased
by 14% (+US$45M) and cost efficiencies delivered a (+US$32M) 
benefit.

Capital expenditure

In FY17, additional sustaining capital expenditure was
directed towards the accelerated development of
La Esmeralda. The rate of expenditure at Cerro Matoso will
rise to US$20M in FY18 as the permanent bridge that
connects La Esmeralda to our processing facilities is
completed.

CANNINGTON        
(100% SHARE)

Volumes

Cannington silver, lead and zinc saleable production
decreased by 27%, 24% and 11%, respectively, in FY17 as
high grade stope 60L was only partially extracted and
run-of-mine stocks were consumed to support processing
rates following an underground fire in April 2017.

The existing crusher chamber is now expected to become
inoperable in September 2017. Commissioning of the
replacement crusher is anticipated in March 2018 with shaft
haulage to be replaced by additional trucking in the
intervening period. The stope sequence within the mine is
also being adjusted to re-establish above ground stocks.
Mill throughput for FY18 has been revised to 2.6Mt, with
payable metal production to decline accordingly. An
increase in payable metal production is expected in FY19
as crushing capacity is restored and mill throughput rises to
3.0Mt.

Operating costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 8% in FY17 to US$133/t as
treatment and refining charges declined. Operating unit costs
are expected to increase by 7% in FY18 to US$142/t as a
result of a temporary rise in trucking activity and lower mill
throughput. Exchange rate and price assumptions for FY18
unit cost guidance are detailed on page 12, footnote a.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$34M in FY17 to
US$308M. Higher average realised prices (+US$158M),
lower treatment and refining charges (+US$43M), and a
reduction in labour costs (+US$11M) were partially offset
by the reduction in sales volumes (-US$175M). Finalisation
adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington
concentrates increased Underlying EBIT by US$4.1M in
FY17 (-US$11M: FY16, US$0.5M: H1 FY17). Outstanding
concentrate sales (containing 2.4Moz of silver, 26.2kt of
lead and 4.6kt of zinc) were revalued at 30 June 2017. The
final price of these sales will be determined in H1 FY18.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by US$9M in FY17
to US$36M. Ongoing development of the underground
crusher will result in a further rise in expenditure in FY18 to
US$42M.

NOTES
(1)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products.

(2)   FY17 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY17 (5,307 million). FY17
      basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY17. FY16 basic
      earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after tax divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY16 (5,324 million). FY16 basic
      Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares for FY16.

(3)   FY17 dividend per share is calculated as H1 FY17 total dividend announced (US$192M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 31 December 2016
      (5,324 million) plus H2 FY17 total dividend announced (US$334M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 30 June 2017 (5,218 million).

(4)   Underlying EBIT is profit before net finance costs, tax and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments. Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive
      of South32's share of net finance costs and tax of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and
      amortisation. Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after tax and earnings adjustment items. Underlying earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to
      assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess senior management's performance. In
      addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and operational management are assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate
      Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following items are adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:
           -     Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;
           -     Impairment losses/reversals;
           -     Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;
           -     Fair value gain/loss on derivative instruments;
           -     Major corporate restructures; and
           -     The income tax impact of the above items.
      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to
      determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.

(5)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(6)   Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(7)   Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as Underlying EBIT less the discount
      on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), divided by the sum of fixed
      assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and impairments) and inventories. Manganese is included in the calculation on a proportional consolidation
      basis.

(8)   Market capitalisation as at 18 August 2017. Calculated as the number of shares on issue (5,218 million) and the South32 closing share price (A$2.95).

(9)   Sales revenue reflects statutory numbers.

(10) Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs
     variance reflects the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded consumables.
     Foreign exchange reflects the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance reflects the
     revenue impact of sales volume changes, based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the impact from
     changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base, including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on expenditure, and
     period-on-period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance excludes earnings adjustments including significant items.

(11) Underlying net finance cost and Underlying tax expense are actual FY17 results, not year-on-year variances.

(12) Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) is Underlying income tax expense, excluding royalty related tax, divided by Underlying profit before tax; both the
     numerator and denominator exclude equity accounted investments.

(13) Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure
     comprises Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB),
     Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

(a) Description of segments

The operating segments (also referred to as ""operations"") are organised and managed separately according to the nature
of products produced. The members of the executive management team (the ""chief operating decision maker"") and the
Board of Directors monitor the segment results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation
and performance assessment. The segment information for the manganese operations are presented on a proportional
consolidation basis, which is the measure used by the Group's management to assess their performance.

The principal activities of each operating segment as the Group is currently structured are summarised as follows:

Operating segment              Principal activities

Worsley Alumina                Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia, Australia.

South Africa Aluminium         Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay, South Africa.
Brazil Alumina                 Alumina refinery in Brazil.

Mozal Aluminium                Aluminium smelter in Mozambique.
                             
South Africa Energy Coal       Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South
                               Africa.
                               
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal   Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales, Australia.
                           
Australia Manganese            Integrated producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and manganese alloys in

                               Tasmania, Australia.

South Africa Manganese         Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa.
Cerro Matoso                   Integrated laterite ferronickel mining and smelting complex in Colombia.
Cannington                     Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland, Australia.

All operations are operated, or jointly operated, by the Group except Alumar (which forms part of Brazil Alumina), which is
operated by Alcoa.

(b) Segment results

Segment performance is measured on Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBIT is profit before net
finance cost, tax and other earnings adjustment items including impairments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT,
before depreciation and amortisation. A reconciliation of Underlying EBIT, Underlying EBITDA and the Group's
consolidated profit after tax from operations is set out below. Segment revenue is measured on the same basis as in the
Consolidated Income Statement.

Revenue is not reduced for royalties and other taxes payable from group production.

The Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the significant
difference in profit margin earned on these sales.

It is the Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.

Group and unallocated items/elimination represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group financing
(including finance expense and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated
to operating segments.

Total assets and liabilities for each operating segment represent operating assets and liabilities which predominantly
exclude the carrying amount of equity accounted investments, cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances. The
carrying amount of investments accounted for using the equity method represents the balance of the Group's investment
in equity accounted investments, with no adjustment for cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances of the equity
accounted investment.

(a) Recognised in expenses excluding net finance cost in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(b) Recognised in net finance cost in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Set-up costs

Set-up costs related to the ongoing establishment of the Group's corporate and regional offices following the demerger.
The costs primarily relate to transitionary contractor and consultant support, information technology infrastructure and
system support. The amount recognised is inclusive of US$30 million paid to BHP under an agreement for information
technology services. Those costs related to all operating segments. All remaining set-up costs relate to group and
unallocated items.

Adjustment to Australian tax balances post-demerger including reset of tax assets

The tax basis of the Group's wholly owned Australian operations was reset on demerger from BHP. The net
increase/(decrease) to tax assets is charged/(credited) to income tax expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Derecognition of deferred tax assets

As a result of the significant and continued weakening of commodity markets, certain deferred tax assets associated with
provisions for closure and rehabilitation were derecognised as utilisation is no longer probable.

Brazil Aluminium Smelter impairment

The Group recognised an impairment of assets of US$97 million to reflect the probability of restarting its Brazil Aluminium
Smelter. US$32 million of this is considered a significant item as it related to smelter consumables and indirect taxes.

Brazil Alumina tax accounting adjustments

The Group's cash and profit repatriation practices result in a probable expectation that tax deferrals will ultimately unwind.
This has resulted in the recognition of associated deferred tax balances at a rate closely aligned to the country statutory
rate and the reassessment of future tax losses as a result of revised interpretation of the applicability of local tax laws.

Closure and rehabilitation provisions and Change in discount rate

Following a review of cash flow assumptions and discount rates, the Group recognised a net decrease in closure and
rehabilitation provisions of US$59 million. Where this related to closed sites, US$68 million was recognised as a benefit in
expenses and US$9 million as a charge in net finance cost in the Consolidated Income Statement. The benefit recognised
in expenses included US$18 million related to South Africa Energy Coal and US$50 million related to the closed Bayside
operation, formerly part of South Africa Aluminium.

QUARTERLY REPORT JUNE 2017

-   Record performance at Mozal Aluminium underpinned a 2% increase in total aluminium production in FY17 as our smelters continued 
    to operate at their maximum technical capability.
 
-   Refined alumina production was largely unchanged in FY17 as Worsley Alumina operated at its expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa 
    (100% basis) in the June quarter.

-   Manganese ore production increased by 5% in FY17 as South Africa Manganese continued to take advantage of stronger demand and 
    pricing by maintaining an operating rate of 3.6Mwmt pa (100% basis) in the June quarter.

-   Cannington recorded a significant decrease in ore grades and metal production in FY17 as high grade stope 60L was only
    partially extracted in the June quarter and run-of-mine stocks were consumed to support processing rates following a 
    fire in  April.

-   Challenging ground conditions in the new Appin Area 9 longwall block and two extended outages at the Appin colliery led to a 
    15% decrease in Illawarra Metallurgical Coal production in FY17, despite record run-of-mine performance at Dendrobium.

-   Adverse weather and an associated delay in the development of new mining areas at the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC)
    led to a 9% decrease in South Africa Energy Coal production in FY17, despite a sequential improvement in performance in the 
    June quarter.

-   While the publication of South Africa’s Mining Charter III has created additional uncertainty, its implementation 
    has been suspended pending a judicial review. We remain committed to the country’s transformation agenda, with Broad-Based Black 
    Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) entities having a 26% [Note 1] equity interest in our South Africa Manganese mines and an 8% 
    [Note 2] equity interest in our South Africa Energy Coal mines, which increases significantly when historic asset transactions 
    are taken into account.

“We delivered record annual production at Mozal Aluminium and stronger aluminium volumes overall as both of our smelters continued to 
operate at their maximum technical capability. While we didn’t achieve the level of consistency that we expect from our broader 
portfolio, our alumina, nickel and manganese operations finished the year on a strong note.”

“Production at the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal Appin colliery remains suspended as a comprehensive review of the operation’s systems 
and processes is undertaken. This in depth review has been designed to ensure the operation restarts safely and reliably.”

“We will continue to invest in high quality opportunities where we see value, having acquired a 15% interest in Arizona Mining for 
US$81M during the quarter. We also allocated US$211M towards our share buy-back program as our balance sheet continued to 
strengthen.”

CORPORATE UPDATE

-      Our metallurgical coal and manganese (ore) products continued to be priced with reference to market indices in
       FY17, with no meaningful change in product quality differentials. For metallurgical coal, a minor discount to the                                                                                  
       premium low-volatile hard coking coal index was achieved on a volume weighted M-1 basis [Note 4], while manganese
       ore of Australian origin achieved the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on a volume
       weighted M-1 basis [Note 5]. For manganese ore of South African origin, a discount of approximately 10% to the medium
       grade 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) was achieved on a volume weighted
       M-1 basis [Note 6] as stronger demand and pricing created a market opportunity for fine grained Wessels concentrate.

-      Consistent with prior guidance, we invested US$28.8M in exploration (US$2.6M capitalised) in FY17, including
       US$15.4M at our existing operations and US$13.4M on greenfield opportunities (all expensed). Brownfield
       exploration focused on metallurgical coal, manganese, bauxite and silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia, with
       US$2.0M directed towards our equity accounted investments (US$1.1M capitalised). Our greenfield spend was
       largely accounted for by our decision to inject US$10M into Trilogy Metals (TSX.TMQ) to
       pre-fund drilling at its Bornite deposit. This drilling program commenced on 12 June.

-      Our Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) for FY17 will reflect the geographical distribution of the Group’s pre-tax
       profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 39%;
       and Brazil 34%. The ETR calculation excludes the contribution from our equity accounted investments as they are
       recorded on an after tax basis.

-      Distributions totalling US$446M (South32 share) were received from our equity accounted investments in FY17,
       including shareholder dividends and loan repayments.

-      On 16 May, we acquired a 15% interest in Arizona Mining Inc. (TSX:AZ) for US$81M. Arizona Mining’s Hermosa
       Project, located in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, includes the high grade (zinc, lead and silver) Taylor Deposit.

-      On 27 March, we announced our intention to return an additional US$500M of capital to shareholders. Consistent
       with this commitment, we commenced an on-market share buy-back program on 19 April and to 30 June had

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 2% (or 69kt) to 3.9Mt in FY17 as performance was impacted by
unplanned calciner maintenance in the March quarter. The refinery finished the year on a strong note, operating at its
expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) in the June quarter. Alumina sales were 7% lower than production in the
June quarter as adverse weather led to the deferral of one shipment.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production decreased by 15% (or 1.3Mt) to 7.1Mt in FY17, despite record
run-of-mine performance at Dendrobium, as challenging ground conditions in the new Appin Area 9 longwall block and
two extended outages at the Appin colliery significantly impacted performance. Metallurgical Coal sales were 4%
(or 255kt) higher than production in FY17. Our average realised price will reflect a minor discount to the premium                                             
low-volatile hard coking coal index on a volume weighted M-1 basis [Note 4] as our shipping schedule was affected by our 
prior declaration of force majeure and the drawdown of finished goods inventory in the second half.

Production at the Appin colliery, which accounted for 49% of total coal production in FY17, remains suspended as a
comprehensive review of the operation’s systems and processes is undertaken. This in-depth review has been designed
to ensure the operation restarts safely and reliably following an extended outage. Upon recommencing underground
activity we will be relocating the Appin Area 9 longwall to panel 902. Revised production guidance will be provided when
we report our FY17 results to reflect the completion of our annual budget cycle.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 3% (or 77kwmt) to 3.0Mwmt in FY17, despite an 8%
improvement in performance in the June quarter as the operation recovered from the impact of heavy rainfall and
Tropical Cyclone Alfred. The Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) circuit operated at approximately 90% of its 500kwmt
(100% share) capacity in the June quarter, contributing 6% of total production across FY17 (FY16: 1%).

Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and
product-type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Given the contribution of the
PC02 circuit to our sales profile, our average realised price for external sales of Australian ore in FY17 will reflect the

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 19% (or 327kwmt) to 2.0Mwmt in FY17 as we continued
to take advantage of stronger demand and pricing by maintaining an operating rate of 3.6Mwmt pa (100% basis) in the June
quarter. This strong rate of production was supported by the sale of Wessels concentrate and the recommencement of
trucking activity.

Our fine grained Wessels concentrate product, which accounted for 9% of sales across FY17 (FY16: 4%), receives a
substantial product discount when referenced to index prices. As a result, our average realised price for external sales of
South African ore will reflect a discount of approximately 10% to the medium grade 37% manganese lump ore index                                                                
(FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) on a volume weighted M-1 basis [Note 6]. Internal sales continue to occur on commercial
terms.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 20% (or 18kt) to 73kt in FY17 as a result of furnace instability.
Metalloys continues to operate one of its four furnaces.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production remained largely unchanged in FY17 as a reduction in furnace availability was
offset by the delivery of first ore from the adjacent, higher grade La Esmeralda deposit in March. Payable nickel
production is expected to increase in FY18 as La Esmeralda ramps up and contributes across the full year.

Cannington silver, lead and zinc saleable production decreased by 27%, 24% and 11%, respectively, in FY17 as feed
grades did not recover to the extent expected in the June quarter as high grade stope 60L was only partially extracted
and run-of-mine stocks were consumed to support processing rates following an underground fire in April.

As previously indicated, the rate of deformation within the existing crusher chamber has increased and it is now expected
to become inoperable in the September quarter. Commissioning of the replacement crusher chamber is anticipated in the
March quarter, with approximately 90% of FY17 mining rates [Note 7] to be maintained in the intervening period as shaft haulage
is replaced with additional trucking via the decline. The stope sequence within the mine is also being adjusted to
re-establish above ground stocks and manage geotechnical conditions. While our plans for FY18 are currently being
finalised, average silver and lead feed grades are expected to remain largely unchanged, while the average zinc feed
grade is expected to decline. Revised production guidance will be provided when we report our FY17 results to reflect
the completion of our annual budget cycle.
                                                                                                                    
Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will increase Underlying EBIT [Note 8] by
US$4.1M in FY17 (-US$11M: FY16, US$0.5M: H1 FY17). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2.4Moz of silver, 26.2kt of lead 
and 4.6kt of zinc) were revalued at 30 June 2017. The final price of these sales will be determined in H1 FY18.

Notes:

1.   26% of Hotazel Manganese Mines (HMM) is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium comprising 
     Ntsimbintle Mining (9%), NCAB Resources (7%), Iziko Mining (5%) and HMM Education Trust (5%). The interests owned by NCAB 
     Resources, Iziko Mining and HMM Education Trust were acquired using vendor finance with the loans repayable via distributions 
     attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in HMM. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in HMM is 
     accounted at 54.6%.
2.   South32 has undertaken a number of historic asset transactions where it has transferred South Africa Energy Coal resources to
     historically disadvantaged entities which resulted in additional ownership credits. These transactions were completed in 
     consultation with the Department of Mineral Resources to ensure consistency with the requirements of the Mining Charter. 8% of 
     South Africa Energy Coal is owned by Phembani Holdings. The interests owned by Phembani were acquired using vendor finance, with 
     the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy 
     Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
3.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been 
     reported  at 60%. The Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
4.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the premium low-volatile hard coking coal Platts index (FOB Australia) on the 
     basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$179/t in the 2017 financial year.
5.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index (CIF Tianjin, China) on the basis 
     of a  one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$5.54/dmtu in the 2017 financial year.
6.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 37% manganese lump ore index (FOB Port Elizabeth, South Africa) 
     on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$4.54/dmtu in the 2017 financial year.
7.   Mining rates refer to ore mined on a wet basis (moisture ~3%), whereas mill throughput is reported on a dry basis.
8.   Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustments. Underlying EBIT is reported net of 
     South32’s share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments.
9.   Figures in Italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.
10.  The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); 
     thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa); million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per annum (Mtpa); thousand ounces (koz); million ounces

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises that underground
operations at the Appin colliery, which forms part of its broader Illawarra Metallurgical Coal
operation, remain suspended. A review of the operation’s systems and operating practices is
currently being undertaken to ensure its ongoing safety and reliability. Given the scope of this
review, an extended outage is now anticipated before production at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal
can be restored to historic levels. The Dendrobium mine continues to operate.

 South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises that on 28 June 2017
 we withdrew the Appin workforce from the mine as a precautionary measure. We subsequently
 confirmed that there was no gas exceedance or breach of gas limits. We notified the New South
 Wales Department of Planning and Environment (the Regulator) of the details of the withdrawal.
 The Regulator then issued a prohibition notice and expressed broader concern regarding the
 recent gas exceedance events and the operating practices of the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal
 operation. Safety is a core value and we are working, together with the Regulator, to address
 these issues.

 Separately, we confirm that the Dendrobium mine remains in operation and that production
 guidance for FY17 remains on track with Illawarra Metallurgical Coal having produced 7.05Mt
 (sales 7.32Mt) to 28 June 2017. Consistent with past practice, we will provide production
 guidance for FY18 when we report our financial results on 24 August 2017.

                                 ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL UPDATE


 South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises today that production
 at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in FY17 is expected to be at least 10 per cent below prior
 guidance of 7.9Mt.

 On 7 May 2017 elevated gas concentrations were recorded at Appin Area 7. All personnel were
 safely evacuated. We have informed the New South Wales Department of Planning and
 Environment (Resources Regulator) of the incident and a prohibition notice has been issued.

 Production at the Area 7 and Area 9 longwalls, which form part of the broader Illawarra
 Metallurgical Coal operation, has been suspended until our investigation into the incident is
 completed. A revised production forecast for FY17 will be provided in due course, with the
 decrease expected to translate directly to sales given low inventory levels. A commensurate
 increase in unit costs is also anticipated.

QUARTERLY REPORT - March 2017

“Despite several operational challenges during the quarter, we increased our net cash balance by US$645M to US$1.5B.

“Having achieved the right balance of strength and flexibility, we announced a US$500M capital management program and 
 subsequently commenced an on-market share buy-back in April.

“Consistent with our strategy to identify new opportunities through the drill bit, we entered into a strategic alliance
 with AusQuest. Under this agreement, we will pursue five early stage base metal opportunities in  Australia and Peru. 
 We have also entered into an option agreement with Trilogy covering the more advanced Upper Kobuk Mineral projects in 
 Alaska and will initially test the extent of their high grade Bornite copper resource""

Graham Kerr, South32 CEO

-  Increased net cash by US$645M to US$1.5B at 31 March 2017.
-  Announced a US$500M capital management program in line with our commitment to return excess cash to
   shareholders.
-  Maintained strong performance at our aluminium smelters and achieved an alumina hydrate production rate
   in excess of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) at Worsley Alumina.
-  Increased ore production at South Africa Manganese to an annualised rate of 3.8Mwmt pa (100% basis) in
   response to favourable market conditions.
-  Delivered first ore from the higher grade La Esmeralda deposit at Cerro Matoso.
-  Maintained FY17 production guidance at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal following the completion of an extended 
   longwall move at Dendrobium.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-  Our net cash[1] balance increased by US$645M to US$1.5B in the quarter as working capital unwound and we received
   US$108M (South32 share) in distributions from our equity accounted investments. On 27 March 2017, we announced a
   US$500M capital management program and subsequently commenced an on-market share buy-back on 19 April 2017.

-  Following an underground fire and subsequent downgrade to FY17 production guidance, Cannington’s Operating unit
   cost[2], including Sustaining capital expenditure, is now expected to increase to US$155/t (previously US$141/t). 
   Unit cost guidance for all other operations in FY17 remains unchanged and will require strong performance in the 
   June 2017 quarter.

-  Capital expenditure of approximately US$420M (previously US$450M) is now expected in FY17, although the rate of
   spend is expected to increase in the June 2017 quarter as land is purchased in preparation for the Klipspruit Life
   Extension project.

-  We invested US$13.0M in exploration in the nine months ended March 2017 (US$2.1M capitalised). This includes US$1.7M
   at our equity accounted investments (US$1.0M capitalised). We explored for metallurgical coal, manganese and silver 
   in Australia and nickel in Colombia.

-  Beyond our current portfolio, we are pursuing base metals opportunities in four countries, having entered into new
   agreements with AusQuest Limited and Trilogy Metals Inc. in March and April, respectively. Under the terms of the latter
   agreement, we will provide US$30M over three years to test the extent of the high-grade copper resource at Trilogy’s
   Bornite deposit in the Ambler Mining District, Alaska. This funding will be paid in tranches of US$10M per annum, with the
   decision to proceed to year two and three subject to exploration results. Our exploration spend is now expected to be
   approximately US$30M in FY17.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 11% (or 2.6Mt) to 21.5Mt in the nine months ended March 2017. Export
sales and pit development at the WMC were impacted by heavy rainfall in the March 2017 quarter and FY17 production guidance has 
been revised accordingly to 30.0Mt (domestic coal 17.5Mt, export coal 12.5Mt). The depletion of existing pits and the delayed 
development of new mining areas at the WMC is expected to result in a further 2.5Mt reduction in production in FY18 to approximately 
27.5Mt (domestic coal 16.0Mt, export coal 11.5Mt). While our budgeting process for FY18 is currently underway, we do anticipate
a significant increase in Operating unit cost, including Sustaining capital expenditure, as a result of the temporary reduction
in production and rise in sustaining capital expenditure at the WMC.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production decreased by 9% (or 509kt) to 5.3Mt in the nine months ended March 2017
as challenging ground conditions were encountered at Appin Area 9 and mining rates were moderated at Appin Area 7 to ensure gas
concentrations were maintained at safe levels. Production in the March 2017 quarter was impacted by a longwall move at Dendrobium
that was extended by four days and was slow to ramp-up as a result of challenging roof conditions. FY17 production guidance 
remains unchanged at 7.9Mt and requires a strong finish to the year. A longwall move at Appin Area 9 is scheduled for June. 
A drawdown of inventory ensured sales in the nine months ended March 2017 exceeded production by 258kt. Sales in the March 2017
quarter also included a carry-over shipment from the December 2016 half year, as anticipated.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 5% (or 114kwmt) to 2.2Mwmt in the nine months ended March 2017.Heavy
rainfall and Tropical Cyclone Alfred led to lower production in the primary high grade circuit in the March 2017 quarter, 
although this was partially offset by strong performance within the Premium Concentrate ore (PC02) circui which continued to 
operate at its annualised capacity of 500kwmt (100% basis). Our low cost PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 
40% which leads to both grade and product-type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. FY17 
production guidance of 3.1Mwmt remains unchanged. Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 5% (or 5kt) to 106kt in the
nine months ended March 2017 as an electrode upgrade was undertaken in January. The impact of the shutdown was offset by a drawdown
of inventory, resulting in an increase of alloy sales in the March 2017 quarter. All four furnaces are expected to ramp-up to full 
capacity in the June 2017 quarter.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 23% (or 281kwmt) to 1.5Mwmt in the nine months ended March 2017 as
we responded to favourable market conditions by opportunistically increasing ore production. This included an annualised production
rate of 3.8Mwmt pa (100% basis) in the March 2017 quarter as we continued to sell Wessels concentrate and use higher cost trucking
to access export opportunities. We ceased trucking activity at the end of the March 2017 quarter as we responded to a change in 
market conditions. The Wessels Central Block project was commissioned in the March 2017 quarter, as planned. The project will enable
mining to relocate closer to critical infrastructure and lower production costs in the underground mine.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 18% (or 12kt) to 56kt in the nine months ended March 2017
despite an improvement in furnace stability in the quarter. Metalloys continues to operate one of its four furnaces.
Alloy sales in the March 2017 quarter were affected by the timing of shipments.

Cannington silver, lead and zinc saleable production decreased by 25%, 22% and 5%, respectively, in the nine months ended 
March 2017 due to lower feed grades, consistent with the mine plan.

Remediation work to repair load-out and shaft haulage infrastructure damaged by an underground fire in April is continuing.FY17
production guidance was previously revised to 16.5Moz of silver, 135kt of lead and 70kt of zinc as mill throughput will remain
constrained while this work is undertaken and the extraction of the higher grade (silver/lead) 60L stope is delayed. An Operating 
unit cost, including Sustaining capital expenditure, of US$155/t (previously US$141/t) is now expected in FY17 given the operation’s
high fixed cost base.

The development of the replacement underground crusher remains on schedule for commissioning in the March 2018 quarter. As previously 
indicated, the rate of deformation in the existing crusher chamber has increased and it may become inoperable earlier than planned.
As such, the rate of ore extraction and metal production may become temporarily constrained by trucking capacity within the decline. 
We continue to monitor the rate of deformation and will provide updated production guidance when we report our FY17 financial results.


Notes:
1.   Provisional unaudited net cash balance as at 31 March 2017.
2.   FY17 Operating unit cost guidance, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and Sustaining capital expenditure guidance, include royalties
     (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and are predicated on various assumptions for H2 FY17, including: an alumina price of
     US$316/t; an average blended coal price of US$146/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$6.79/dmtu for 44% manganese product;
     a nickel price of US$4.65/lb; a thermal coal price of US$84/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.04/troy oz; a lead price of
     US$2,267/t; a zinc price of US$2,746/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.75; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.20; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,943; 
     all of which reflected forward markets as at January 2017 or our internal expectations.
3.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned by
     the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable to these parties, pro
     rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
4.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%. The 
     Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
5.   Figures in Italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.
6.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa);

           ACQUISITION OF THE METROPOLITAN COLLIERY WILL NOT PROCEED

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) announces that the proposed
acquisition of the Metropolitan Colliery and associated 16.67% interest in the Port Kembla Coal
Terminal from an Australian subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation will not proceed.

On 23 February 2017, the ACCC issued a Statement of Issues, concerned that the proposed
acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the supply of metallurgical coal to Australian
steelmakers.

South32 has always maintained that metallurgical coal is a globally traded commodity. Given
this, South32 is not prepared to make significant concessions in favour of Australian steelmakers
that would likely be required to mitigate the competition concerns. To do so would be contrary to
the global market in which metallurgical coal producers compete and would adversely affect the
value proposition of the acquisition.

South32 Chief Executive Officer Graham Kerr said: “Our approach to acquisitions is always
opportunistic and seen through the lens of creating value for our shareholders.

“To proceed with the acquisition, in light of the anticipated concessions, would have
compromised the merits of the transaction and this is not something we are prepared to do.”

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises that mining extraction
at Cannington has been temporarily impacted by an underground fire that damaged the load-out
and shaft haulage infrastructure. Remediation work will be undertaken over a four week period
and extraction of the higher grade (silver/lead) stope 60L will be delayed.

Based upon our initial assessment, payable silver, lead and zinc production of 16.5Moz, 135kt
and 70kt, respectively, is now anticipated in FY17 with revised mill throughput of approximately
3.1Mt (previously 3.3Mt). An update, including revised unit cost (including Sustaining capital
expenditure) guidance, will be provided in our March 2017 Quarterly Report.

As noted in our December 2016 half year results announcement, production guidance at

SOUTH32 TO RETURN AN ADDITIONAL US$500M TO SHAREHOLDERS

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) today announced that it
intends to return an additional US$500M to shareholders, equating to 4.5% of the Group’s
current market capitalization [1]. This capital management program, which complements the
Group’s dividend policy, will initially take the form of an on-market share buy-back in Australia.

South32 Chairman, David Crawford said: “The combination of our operating leverage, strong
balance sheet and simple capital management framework is designed to maximise returns and
reward shareholders as financial performance improves. Today’s announcement further
demonstrates our disciplined approach to capital management and our confidence in the Group’s
cash generating capacity.”

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said: “Our net cash balance continues to build
giving us the financial strength and flexibility to invest in our existing operations, pursue
opportunities where we can create value and return excess capital to shareholders. This
US$500M capital management program meaningfully increases shareholder returns and follows
the recent announcement of our US$192M interim dividend.”

The timing and number of shares purchased under the on-market share buy-back will be
contingent upon the prevailing share price and market conditions. The on-market share buy-back
is not subject to shareholder approval and will be funded from existing cash reserves. The
Announcement of Buy-back (Appendix 3C) lodged on the Australian Securities Exchange and
voluntarily disclosed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange has
been submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at:
http://www.hemscott.com/nsm.do.

The US$500M capital management program is expected to be completed over a 12 month
period and all alternatives will continue to be assessed to ensure this capital is returned in an
efficient manner.

South32 delivers strong financial results and announces first interim dividend

""The disciplined application of our strategy and stronger commodity prices underpinned a significant improvement in
financial performance. We generated free cash flow of US$626M for a net cash position of US$859M as we further
optimised our operations and benefitted from our operating leverage.

""We continue to unlock value through the accelerated development of La Esmeralda, the progression of the Klipspruit Life
Extension project towards a final investment decision, the completion of the West Marradong mining access agreement
and the commencement of exploration in the Southern Areas at GEMCO.

""The proposed US$200M acquisition of the Metropolitan Colliery is expected to create additional value and realise unique
synergies with Illawarra Metallurgical Coal.

""Our strong balance sheet and simple capital management framework is designed to reward shareholders as financial
performance improves. We have declared our first interim dividend of US$192M and will continue to manage our financial
position to ensure we retain the right balance of flexibility and efficiency.""

energy and leadership to make a sustainable and lasting change to our safety performance. Through the implementation
of our Care Strategy, we are building an inclusive workplace with a strong culture of care and accountability, where work
is well-designed and we continuously improve and learn. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) declined from 7.9
to 5.3 per million hours worked in the period.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

The disciplined application of our strategy and stronger commodity prices underpinned a significant improvement in
financial performance. Specific highlights included:

-   Our response to favourable market conditions as we restarted 22 pots at South Africa Aluminium and opportunistically
    increased manganese ore production;
-   A substantial 197% improvement in free cash flow to US$626M, including distributions from equity accounted
    investments, as we continued to optimise our operations and benefit from our operating leverage;
-   The further strengthening of our Balance Sheet with an increase in our net cash position to US$859M, despite a
    temporary build in working capital;
-   The unlocking of additional value with the accelerated development of La Esmeralda (Cerro Matoso), the progression
    of the Klipspruit Life Extension project towards a final investment decision, the completion of the access agreement
    for the West Marradong mining area (Worsley Alumina), and the commencement of exploration for high grade
    manganese ore in the Southern Areas at GEMCO and Cu-Ni-PGE mineralisation at Huckleberry in Canada;
-   The creation of value beyond our existing portfolio with the proposed acquisition of the Metropolitan Colliery(8) and
    potential realisation of unique synergies with Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; and
-   Our first interim dividend of US 3.6 cents per share to shareholders (US$192M).

Production guidance for FY17 is unchanged for all operations and is predicated on a strong finish to the financial year. We
continue to pursue our cost saving targets, which have been revised to reflect changes in foreign exchange
rates and price-linked royalties.

EARNINGS

The Group's statutory profit was US$620M in H1 FY17. The corresponding period's loss was impacted by the recognition
of impairment charges totalling US$1.7B (post-tax US$1.7B).

Consistent with our accounting policy, various items are excluded from the Group's statutory profit result to derive
Underlying earnings including: exchange rate losses associated with the restatement of monetary items (US$20M pre-
tax); fair value gains on derivative instruments (US$189M pre-tax); exchange rate gains associated with the Group's non
US dollar denominated net debt (US$11M pre-tax); exchange rate gains on tax balances (US$13M) and the tax expense
for all pre-tax earnings adjustments (US$49M). Further information on these earnings adjustments is included.

Underlying EBITDA increased by US$522M to US$1.1B in H1 FY17 as higher prices for the majority of our commodities
offset lower volumes, giving rise to an increase in sales revenue of US$240M. This, combined with our continued focus on
costs, resulted in an increase in our operating margin from 20% to 37%.

Underlying EBIT increased by US$550M to US$691M, benefitting from a reduction in depreciation and amortisation
following the recognition of non-cash impairment charges in H1 FY16. The half year run-rate for depreciation and
amortisation did, however, exceed annual guidance which is revised on page 11. Detailed earnings analysis is included.

CASH FLOW
An increase in the average realised price of our commodities and the continued optimisation of our operations generated
a 155% increase in free cash flow from operations, excluding equity accounted investments, to US$489M. The significant
increase in free cash flow was achieved despite a temporary build in working capital as a number of shipments rolled into
January and trade and other receivables increased as a result of rising commodity prices.

Capital expenditure, excluding equity accounted investments, declined by 37% to US$150M and included:

-   Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including
    underground development) of US$142M; and
-   Major project capital expenditure of US$8M.

Major project capital expenditure includes study costs associated with the Klipspruit Life Extension project, which remains
subject to approval and is currently the Group's only major capital project. The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation
of exploration accounted for a further US$2M of expenditure.

Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of US$19M included the second phase of the Central
Block development project at the Wessels underground mine (South Africa Manganese). This will enable mining activity
to relocate closer to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing cycle times. Commissioning is expected in the March 2017
quarter. A further US$1M in capitalised exploration expenditure was spent in H1 FY17 in equity accounted investments
(GEMCO).

Total capital expenditure(9), including equity accounted investments, was US$172M in H1 FY17.

In addition to free cash flow of US$489M, distributions totalling US$137M were received from equity accounted investments
during H1 FY17, comprising US$41M in dividends and US$96M from the repayment of a shareholder loan.

BALANCE SHEET

As at 31 December 2016, the Group's net cash position was US$859M, an increase of US$547M from 30 June 2016. The
further strengthening of our financial position ensures we are well placed to fund the proposed acquisition of the
Metropolitan Colliery for US$200M and the payment of our interim dividend (US$192M). While these commitments will
consume a significant proportion of the free cash flow generated in H1 FY17, a release of working capital and additional
distributions from our equity accounted investments are expected in the March 2017 quarter. We will continue to manage
our financial position to ensure we retain the right balance of flexibility and efficiency.

The increase in interest bearing liabilities recorded in H1 FY17 is a result of the cash management activities that the Group
undertakes on behalf of the manganese joint venture and is offset by a commensurate increase in cash and cash
equivalents. The US$21M reduction in finance leases is primarily associated with the weaker Australian dollar at the end
of H1 FY17.

Standard and Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed the Group's BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings respectively, following their annual
reviews in H1 FY17.

DIVIDENDS

The Board has resolved to pay an interim dividend of US 3.6 cents per share in respect of H1 FY17. While it is our
intention to distribute dividends with the maximum practicable franking credits for the purposes of the Australian dividend
imputation system, this dividend will not be franked for Australian taxation purposes as South32 Limited did not generate
franking credits during the period as it paid no Australian income tax.

This dividend is paid in line with our policy to distribute a minimum 40% of Underlying earnings as dividends to its
shareholders following each six-month reporting period, having regard to our first two priorities for cash flow, being a
commitment to maintain safe and reliable operations and an investment grade credit rating through the cycle.

OUTLOOK

PRODUCTION

Production guidance for FY17 is unchanged for our upstream operations.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production guidance was revised in December 2016 to 7.9Mt as a result of challenging
ground conditions at Appin Area 9 and a moderation of mining rates at Appin Area 7 to ensure gas concentrations were
maintained at safe levels. With the completion of the 901 panel and associated release of ground stresses, longwall
availability and cutting rates are anticipated to improve in FY18. The lower production rate in FY17 has, however, impacted
the timing of longwall panel extraction and production guidance for FY18 has been revised accordingly.

Worsley Alumina saleable alumina production guidance is unchanged with the refinery expected to produce at its
nameplate capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) across FY17 and FY18. Similarly, Brazil Alumina saleable production
guidance for FY17 is unchanged at 1.32Mt with a small increase in production anticipated in FY18.

At South Africa Energy Coal, total coal production guidance for FY17 and FY18 is unchanged and will benefit from
additional capital investment at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex to open up new mining areas.

Payable nickel production guidance for Cerro Matoso remains unchanged at approximately 36kt for FY17 before the accelerated
development of the higher grade La Esmeralda Mineral Resource increases production by 16% in FY18 to approximately 42kt.
Production from La Esmeralda is now expected to commence in the June 2017 quarter.

Production guidance for Australia Manganese of 3.1Mwmt in FY17 and FY18 remains unchanged, albeit with a greater proportion
of Premium Concentrate ore (PC02) product. Guidance is not provided for South Africa Manganese as our plans will continue to
be adjusted to reflect market demand given our focus on value over volume.

The optimised longer term mine plan at Cannington seeks to maximise total silver, lead and zinc extraction across the
remaining years of the underground operation and reduce geotechnical risk by sequencing stope design. FY17 production
guidance (silver 19.05Moz, lead 163kt, zinc 80kt) remains predicated on the extraction of the higher grade (silver/lead)
60L stope that is in close proximity to the existing underground crusher, while the development of the replacement
underground crusher is expected to be commissioned in the March 2018 quarter. Guidance will be revised should
geotechnical conditions dictate a change to the current stope sequence and the extraction of the 60L stope be deferred,
albeit with no net loss of metal production in the forward plan.

Our African aluminium smelters continue to operate at benchmark levels of current efficiency and are experiencing fewer
load-shedding events. During H1 FY17, we restarted production in the 22 pots (equivalent to 3% of total production) that
were taken offline at South Africa Aluminium in September 2015.

At Metalloys (South Africa Manganese), we continue to operate one of four furnaces, whereas all four furnaces at TEMCO
(Australia Manganese) are expected to return to full capacity once scheduled maintenance is completed in the March 2017
quarter.

COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
When compared with H1 FY16, we reduced controllable costs by US$239M and capital expenditure by US$116M.

Cost targets
In FY16, we announced major restructuring initiatives at our operations and we continue to pursue our cost
saving targets. New guidance primarily reflects the movement of foreign exchange rates and price-linked royalties.

(a) Adjusted H1 FY17 Operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, are restated to reflect price and 
    foreign exchange rate assumptions used for prior FY17 guidance.
(b) Prior FY17 Operating unit cost targets, including Sustaining capital expenditure, were predicated on commodity price 
    and foreign exchange rate assumptions (refer to footnote 13). Prior guidance for South Africa Manganese 
    reflected the previously expected H2 FY17 run-rate as activity was reprioritised following a fatality at the Wessels 
    underground mine in June 2016.
(c) New FY17 Operating unit cost targets, including Sustaining capital expenditure, are predicated on commodity price and 
    foreign exchange rate forward curves or our internal expectations for H2 FY17, as at January 2017 
    (refer to footnote 14 on page 27). New guidance for South Africa Manganese reflects the expected FY17 run-rate.
(d) US dollar per tonne of ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact operating unit costs 
    as related marketing costs and treatment and refining charges may change.

Capital expenditure

Guidance for FY17 capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, remains unchanged at approximately
US$450M(15) as the spend profile is skewed to H2 FY17 for a number of projects. This guidance includes capital
expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of US$50M and major project expenditure of US$35M. Major
project capital expenditure primarily reflects study costs and the acquisition of land in preparation for our Klipspruit Life
Extension project. A final investment decision for the Klipspruit Life Extension project is scheduled for the June 2017
quarter.

Exploration expenditure

Exploration expenditure of approximately US$16M is expected within our existing footprint, including US$4M for our equity
accounted investments following the commencement of exploration within the Southern Areas of Groote Eylandt for high
grade manganese ore. As part of our agreement with Northern Shield Resources, we will fund US$1M of exploration for
Cu-Ni-PGE mineralisation at Huckleberry, in the Labrador Trough, Canada in FY17. We continue to actively pursue
additional greenfield exploration opportunities which could lead to an increase in expenditure.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION

Depreciation and amortisation, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$760M is now expected in FY17. The
US$40M increase in guidance primarily results from an adjustment to the useful life of specific assets, the accelerated
depreciation of the Group's information technology systems and the appreciation of the South African rand given its impact
on the depreciation profile of projects scheduled for completion in FY17. Depreciation and amortisation for equity
accounted investments is also expected to increase by US$10M to US$80M in FY17.

TAX EXPENSE

The Group's Underlying effective tax rate (Underlying ETR), which excludes taxation associated with equity accounted
investments, largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group's profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the
Group include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 40%; and Brazil 34%. It should also be recognised that
permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group's Underlying ETR(16) when commodity prices and profit
margins are compressed.

While South32 Limited currently maintains a zero franking credit balance, the Group is expected to generate a positive
franking credit balance in FY17, based on current projections. South32 Limited did not generate franking credits during the
period as it paid no Australian income tax.

Prices, foreign exchange and inflation

An increase in average realised prices for our commodities increased revenue by US$661M. Metallurgical and energy
coal, and manganese ore and alloy were the main contributors, increasing revenue by US$313M and US$230M
respectively. Higher averaged realised silver, lead and zinc prices increased sales revenue by a further US$93M.
Conversely, lower average realised prices for alumina reduced revenue by US$39M.

Despite the increase in commodity prices, price-linked costs decreased by US$47M, attributable to lower raw material
prices at our alumina and aluminium operations and a reduction in treatment and refining charges for Cannington
concentrates. This was offset by general inflation which increased costs by US$51M. The inflationary impact was most
pronounced at our African operations which accounted for 65% of the total variance.

The cumulative impact of changes in foreign exchange rate markets reduced Underlying EBIT by a net US$12M as a
stronger Australian dollar was partially offset by a weaker South African rand.

Volume

The US$243M volume related impact in revenue reflects a decline in processed ore grades and metal production at
Cannington (US$104M) and lower production at South Africa Energy Coal (US$103M) following the suspension of the
North Plant at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex, scheduled maintenance and the repositioning of draglines. The
revenue impact of lower production volumes at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (US$20M) was mitigated by a net reduction in
inventory.

Controllable cost reduction

Controllable costs were US$239M lower than the corresponding period as we continued to benefit from the major
restructuring initiatives undertaken in H2 FY16. An increase in controllable costs is anticipated in H2 FY17 as working
capital unwinds.

Group and Unallocated costs of US$70M are expected in FY17, as planned.

Other items

Other items reduced Underlying EBIT by US$19M in H1 FY17. Depreciation and amortisation, including equity accounted
investments, declined by US$72M as a result of impairments recorded in H1 FY16. Conversely, the net effect of a reduction
in power sales in Brazil (US$57M) and the prior US$29M reversal of a rehabilitation provision that benefitted South Africa
Energy Coal in H1 FY16 reduced Underlying EBIT by a combined US$86M.

Interest and tax associated with equity accounted investments

The Group's manganese operations are jointly controlled by South32 (60% share) and Anglo American (40% share). The
Underlying interest and taxation expense associated with these equity accounted investments increased by US$72M to
US$91M in H1 FY17 as higher prices led to a significant increase in profitability.

Net finance costs

The Group's Underlying net finance costs, excluding equity accounted investments, were US$71M in H1 FY17 and largely
reflect the unwinding of the discount applied to our restoration and rehabilitation provisions (US$48M) and finance lease
charges (US$26M), primarily at Worsley Alumina.

Taxation expense
The Group's underlying income tax expense, which excludes taxation associated with equity accounted investments, was
US$141M for an Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) of 30.7%. The tax expense for equity accounted investments was
US$76M, including royalty related taxation. The recognition of the GEMCO (Australia Manganese) Northern Territory
royalty as a profits-based tax gives rise to a royalty related taxation expense of US$14M in equity accounted investments.

WORSLEY ALUMINA
(86% SHARE)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production decreased by 3% (or
53kt) to 1.9Mt in H1 FY17. Hydrate production remained at
an annualised rate of 4.5Mt (100% basis) and FY17
saleable alumina production guidance remains unchanged
at 4.0Mt.

FY18 saleable alumina production guidance is unchanged
with the refinery expected to produce at its nameplate capacity
of 4.6Mt (100% basis).

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 12% to US$200/t in
H1 FY17 despite a stronger Australian dollar. Reduced
employee and contractor numbers and procurement savings,
including lower energy costs and contractor rates, contributed
to the improvement in unit costs.

We have restated FY17 Operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance to US$218/t in FY17
(FY16: US$221/t) to reflect updated exchange rate and price-
linked royalty assumptions and a minor increase in costs. This
includes Sustaining capital expenditure of US$59M as
additional investment is directed towards water infrastructure
in H2 FY17. Revised exchange rate and price assumptions for
our FY17 unit cost targets are detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$7M in H1 FY17 to US$26M.
Lower average realised alumina prices (-US$32M, net of price-
linked costs), a stronger Australian dollar (-US$10M) and a
US$44M reduction in controllable costs had the most
significant influence on financial performance.
Capital expenditure decreased by 14% to US$19M in
H1 FY17.

SOUTH AFRICA ALUMINIUM
(100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production increased by
1% (or 4kt) to 356kt in H1 FY17 as the smelter continued to
operate at benchmark levels of current efficiency, with
fewer load-shedding events. Strong performance also
reflected the recommencement of production in the 22 pots
that were suspended in the September 2015 quarter.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 8% to US$1,380/t in
H1 FY17. The combination of lower raw material prices and a
weaker South African rand offset higher aluminium price-
linked power costs and the impact of lower sales. A total of 50
pots were relined across H1 FY17 at a cost of approximately
US$211k per pot (H1 FY16: 66 pots at US$204k per pot).
72 pots are scheduled to be relined in FY17.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the cost
profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by power
and raw material inputs, given the operation's high variable
cost base. Hillside sources power from Eskom under long-term
contracts. The price of electricity supplied to potlines 1 and 2
is linked to the LME aluminium price and the South African
rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price of electricity supplied
to potline 3 is South African rand based and linked to South
African and United States producer price indices.


Financial performance
Underlying EBIT increased by US$69M in H1 FY17 to
US$90M. The combination of higher average realised
aluminium prices and premia and lower raw material costs
increased Underlying EBIT by US$80M, net of other price-
linked costs. The impact of lower sales volumes (-US$28M)
was offset by inventory movements that contributed to a total
controllable cost reduction of US$19M.

Capital expenditure decreased by 25% to US$6M in
H1 FY17.

MOZAL ALUMINIUM
(47.1% SHARE)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased by 2% (or
3kt) to 136kt in H1 FY17 as current efficiency continued to
improve and the operation experienced fewer load-
shedding events. The 11% increase in sales reflects the
timing of shipments between periods.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 12% to US$1,448/t in
H1 FY17 reflecting stronger sales and lower raw materials
prices. A total of 39 pots were relined across H1 FY17 at a
cost of approximately US$193k per pot (H1 FY16: 69 pots at
US$212k per pot). 106 pots are now scheduled to be relined
in FY17.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the cost
profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by power
and raw material inputs, given the operation's high variable
cost base. Mozal Aluminium utilises hydroelectric power under
a long-term contract that is generated by Hidroeléctrica de
Cahora Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power into the South
African grid to Eskom and Mozal Aluminium sources the power
via the Mozambique Transmission Company (Motraco).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$35M in H1 FY17 to
US$25M. The combination of higher average realised
aluminium prices and premia and lower raw material costs
increased Underlying EBIT by US$23M, net of other price-
linked costs. The benefit of higher sales volumes (+US$21M)
was partially offset by an unfavourable year-on-year movement in
inventory that contributed to a net controllable cost increase of
US$12M. A favourable exchange rate impact (+US$8M) was
offset by inflation (-US$6M).

Capital expenditure decreased by 40% to US$3M in
H1 FY17.

BRAZIL ALUMINA
(ALUMINA 36% SHARE, ALUMINIUM
40% SHARE)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable production remained unchanged in
H1 FY17 at 673kt as planned maintenance at the refinery and
port in the September 2016 quarter was offset by record
production in the December 2016 quarter. FY17 saleable
alumina production guidance remains unchanged at 1.32Mt,
with a small increase in production anticipated in FY18.

Costs

Alumina operating unit costs at the non-operated refinery
increased by 5% to US$194/t in H1 FY17 as the Brazilian real
strengthened and sales volumes declined.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$64M in H1 FY17 to
US$10M as the contribution of power sales declined by
US$57M in the period.

In H1 FY16 we terminated the power supply contract with
Eletronorte and in H2 FY16 recorded an onerous contract
provision to reflect anticipated future losses associated with
the remaining power supply commitments across FY17 and FY18.

Within the alumina supply chain, Underlying EBIT decreased
by US$24M to US$12M. Lower average realised alumina
prices (-US$7M, net of price-linked costs), weaker sales
volumes (-US$6M) and the stronger Brazilian real (-US$6M)
led to the decline in profitability.

Capital expenditure at the refinery increased by 44% to
US$13M in H1 FY17.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL
(92% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased
by 9% (or 1.6Mt) to 14.8Mt in H1 FY17. The decline in
production reflects the prior suspension of the North Plant
at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex (WMC), scheduled
maintenance and the repositioning of draglines. Export
sales were also impacted by Transnet's annual rail
maintenance cycle.

Total coal production guidance for FY17 and FY18 is
unchanged and will benefit from additional capital
investment at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex that will
open up new mining areas. FY17 saleable coal production
guidance is 30.9Mt (domestic coal 17.0Mt, export coal
13.9Mt).

Costs

Operating unit costs increased by 4% to US$26/t in H1 FY17
largely as a result of lower sales volumes for both domestic
and export coal. This impact was partially offset by a
favourable movement in inventory and a weaker South African
rand.

We have restated FY17 Operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance to US$30/t in FY17
(FY16: US$27/t) to reflect updated exchange rate and price-
linked royalty assumptions. This includes Sustaining capital
expenditure of US$75M as additional investment is directed

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$82M in H1 FY17 to
US$128M. Higher average realised coal prices increased
Underlying EBIT by US$100M, net of price-linked costs, but
were partially offset by lower sales volumes (net -US$73M).
Non-cash charges declined by US$46M as depreciation and
amortisation was rebased following the prior recognition of
impairments.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 40% to US$25M
in H1 FY17 following the purchase of mobile equipment in the
prior period. We expect Major project capital expenditure of
approximately US$30M in FY17 to fund study costs and the
acquisition of land in preparation for our Klipspruit Life
Extension project. A final investment decision is scheduled for
the June 2017 quarter. Major project capital expenditure is
excluded from our unit cost guidance.

ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL
(100%)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased
by 6% (or 243kt) to 3.7Mt in H1 FY17. The decline in
production primarily reflected challenging ground
conditions at Appin Area 9 and a moderation of mining rates
at Appin Area 7 that ensured gas concentrations were
maintained at safe levels. These impacts were partially
offset by strong operating performance at Dendrobium.
Consistent with our recent update, Illawarra Metallurgical
Coal sales of 8.1Mt are expected in FY17 as Appin Area 7
has returned to full capacity and Appin Area 9 has
recommenced production, as planned.

With the completion of the 901 panel and associated
release of ground stresses, longwall availability and cutting
rates are anticipated to improve in subsequent longwall
panels. The lower production rate in FY17 has, however,
impacted the timing of longwall panel extraction and
production guidance for FY18 has been revised
accordingly.

Restated FY17 production guidance incorporates a longwall
move for each of the March and June 2017 quarters.

Costs

Operating unit costs increased by 19% to US$75/t in H1 FY17
as a result of lower sales and the operation's high proportion
of fixed costs. Additional cost pressure stemmed from a
stronger Australian dollar, inflation and higher price-linked
royalties.

We have restated Operating unit costs, including Sustaining
capital expenditure guidance to US$90/t (FY16: US$80/t) to
reflect updated exchange rate and price-linked royalty
assumptions. This includes Sustaining capital expenditure of
US$129M, encompassing underground mine development of
US$69M. Revised exchange rate and price assumptions for
our FY17 unit cost targets are detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$146M in H1 FY17 to
US$109M. The benefit of higher average realised coal prices
(+US$193M, net of price-linked costs) was partially offset by a
decline in sales volumes (-US$20M) and a stronger Australian
dollar (-US$10M). Our average realised price for H1 FY17 was
impacted by a carry over shipment in December 2016 that was
associated with our prior declaration of force majeure. Another
carry over shipment is scheduled for H2 FY17.

Capital expenditure decreased by 51% to US$54M in
H1 FY17 following the completion of the Appin Area 9 project
in the March 2016 quarter. Capital expenditure included
underground development of approximately US$29M.

AUSTRALIA MANGANESE
(60% SHARE)

Volumes

Australia Manganese saleable ore production in H1 FY17
decreased by 6% (or 90kwmt) from the prior period's record
rate to 1.5Mwmt as lower yields and reduced plant
availability resulted in lower production from the primary
high grade circuit. This impact was partially offset by the
opportunistic ramp-up of the Premium Concentrate ore
(PC02) circuit to its annualised capacity of 500kwmt in the
December 2016 quarter.

FY17 production guidance of 3.1Mwmt remains
unchanged, albeit with a greater proportion of PC02
product. The share of PC02 product in H1 FY17 production
was 5% (H1 FY16: Nil). Our PC02 fines product has a
manganese content of approximately 40% which leads to
both grade and product-type discounts when referenced to
the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 8% (or
7kt) to 78kt in H1 FY17 as furnace instability impacted
performance. All four furnaces are expected to operate at
full capacity once scheduled maintenance is completed in
the March 2017 quarter.

Costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs increased by 10% to
US$1.44/dmtu in H1 FY17 as a result of a stronger Australian
dollar and higher price-linked royalties.

We have restated FY17 Operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance to US$1.72/dmtu
(FY16: US$1.88/dmtu FOB) to reflect updated exchange rate
and price-linked royalty assumptions and the greater
proportion of lower cost PC02 product. The strip ratio is now
expected to increase to 3.5 from 3.3 in FY16. Cost guidance
includes Sustaining capital expenditure of US$31M. Revised
exchange rate and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost
targets are detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$197M in H1 FY17 to
US$207M. Higher average realised manganese ore and alloy
prices increased Underlying EBIT by US$159M, net of price-
linked costs. The impacts of a stronger Australian dollar and
inflation decreased Underlying EBIT by US$6M. Non-cash
charges declined by US$36M as depreciation and
amortisation was rebased following the prior recognition of
impairments. Our average realised price for external ore sales
reflected a modest premium to the high grade 44%
manganese lump ore index on an M-1 basis, despite the
greater proportion of PC02 product.

Capital expenditure decreased by US$26M to US$15M in
H1 FY17 following the completion of the PC02 project.
Exploration drilling at GEMCO's Southern Areas commenced
in the December 2016 quarter.

SOUTH AFRICA MANGANESE
(ORE 44.4% SHARE, ALLOY 60% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased
by 23% (or 177kwmt) to 934kwmt in H1 FY17 as market
conditions supported a drawdown of Wessels concentrate
stockpiles and the use of higher cost trucking to access
export opportunities. Wessels concentrate accounted for
15% of H1 FY17 external sales (H1 FY16: 4%). South
Africa Manganese ore production will remain configured for
an optimised rate of 2.9Mwmt pa (100% basis), although
we will continue to act opportunistically when market
fundamentals are supportive.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 20%
(or 9kt) to 37kt in H1 FY17 as a result of furnace instability.
Metalloys continues to operate one of its four furnaces.

Costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs decreased by 13%
to US$1.96/dmtu in H1 FY17. The benefit of a weaker South
African rand was partially offset by higher price-linked royalties
and the impact of inflation. The drawdown of low cost Wessels
concentrate stockpiles offset the costs absorbed to
opportunistically increase trucking of ore to port.

We have restated FOB Operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance to US$2.20/dmtu in
FY17 (FY16: US$2.01/dmtu FOB) to reflect updated exchange
rate and price-linked royalty assumptions. This includes
Sustaining capital expenditure of US$9M. Revised exchange
rate and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are
detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$97M in H1 FY17 to
US$46M as higher average realised manganese ore and alloy
prices increased Underlying EBIT by US$66M, net of price-
linked costs. Our average realised price for external sales
reflects a 12% discount to the medium grade 37% manganese
lump ore index on an M-1 basis as our Wessels concentrate is
a fine grained product. Non-cash charges declined by US$8M
as depreciation and amortisation was rebased following the
prior recognition of impairments.

Capital expenditure decreased to US$4M in H1 FY17. The
Wessels Central Block project remains on track to be
completed in the March 2017 quarter.

CERRO MATOSO
(99.9% SHARE)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production remained largely
unchanged at 17.7kt in H1 FY17 as plant performance was
further optimised and higher recoveries were achieved.

Payable nickel production guidance for Cerro Matoso
remains unchanged at approximately 36kt for FY17.
Accelerated development of the higher grade La Esmeralda
Mineral Resource will increase production by 16% in FY18
to approximately 42kt. Production from La Esmeralda is
now expected to commence in the June 2017 quarter.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 14% to US$3.81/lb in
H1 FY17. Modest inflationary pressure was more than offset
by lower electricity costs, a reduction in contract services and
lower raw material consumption rates.

We have restated FY17 Operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance to US$3.98/lb
(FY16: US$4.30/lb) to reflect updated exchange rate and
price-linked royalty assumptions. This includes Sustaining
capital expenditure of US$16M. Revised exchange rate and
price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are 
detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$44M in H1 FY17 to a loss
of US$4M as higher average realised prices (+US$21M, net of
price-linked costs) and embedded cost saving initiatives
(+US$22M) underpinned an improvement in financial
performance.

Capital expenditure of US$4M was 67% lower than the prior period.

CANNINGTON
(100% SHARE)

Volumes

Payable zinc production increased by 1% (or 0.3kt) to
42.1kt in H1 FY17, while payable silver and lead production
decreased by 27% and 24%, respectively. Lower silver and
lead ore grades were the primary contributors to the
reduction in metal production.

The optimised longer term mine plan at Cannington seeks
to maximise total silver, lead and zinc extraction across the
remaining years of the underground operation and reduce
geotechnical risk. FY17 production guidance (silver
19.05Moz, lead 163kt, zinc 80kt) remains predicated on the
extraction of the higher grade (silver/lead) 60L stope that is
in close proximity to the existing underground crusher
chamber, while the development of the replacement
underground crusher is expected to be commissioned in
the March 2018 quarter. Guidance will be revised should
geotechnical conditions dictate a change to the current
stope sequence and the extraction of the 60L stope be
deferred, albeit with no net loss of metal production in the
forward plan.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 10% to US$131/t of ore
processed in H1 FY17 as the impact of a stronger Australian
dollar was more than offset by lower labour and contractor
costs and a decline in haulage rates.

We have restated Operating unit costs, including Sustaining
capital expenditure guidance to US$141/t of ore processed
(FY16: US$153/t) to reflect updated exchange rate and price-
linked royalty assumptions and incremental cost savings. This
includes Sustaining capital expenditure of US$39M. Revised
exchange rate and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost
targets are detailed (footnote 14).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$12M in H1 FY17 to
US$165M. Higher average realised prices increased
Underlying EBIT by US$105M, net of price-linked costs,
although this impact was offset by a US$104M reduction in
sales volumes, as lower grades impacted payable metal
production. Controllable cost savings (+US$26M), which
benefitted from a favourable movement in inventory, more
than offset the impact of a stronger Australian dollar (-US$6M).

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of
Cannington concentrates increased Underlying EBIT by
US$0.5M in H1 FY17 (-US$11M in FY16; -US$19M in H1
FY16). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2Moz of
silver, 25kt of lead and 12kt of zinc) were revalued at 
31 December 2016. The final price of these sales will be
determined in H2 FY17.

Capital expenditure of US$18M was 20% higher than the prior
period.

NOTES

(1)  Revenue includes revenue from third party products.

(2)  H1 FY17 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations divided by the weighted average number of
     shares for H1 FY17 (5,319 million). H1 FY17 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average
     number of shares for H1 FY17. H1 FY16 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations divided by the
     weighted average number of shares for H1 FY16 (5,324 million). H1 FY16 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings
     divided by the weighted average number of shares for H1 FY16.

(3)  H1 FY17 dividend per share is calculated as total dividend (US$192M) divided by the number of shares on issue at 31 December 2016 
     (5,324 million).

(4)  Underlying EBIT is profit from continuing operations before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments.
     Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of South32's share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA
     is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after taxation and earnings adjustment items.
     Underlying earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of
     resources and assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and operational management are 
     assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following items are adjusted as
     applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:

     -     Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;

     -     Impairment losses/reversals;

     -     Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;

     -     Fair value gain/loss on derivative instruments;

     -     Major corporate restructures; and

     -     The income tax impact of the above items.

     In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to
     determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.

(5)  Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(6)  Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(7)  Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as annualised Underlying EBIT less
     the discount on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), divided by the sum
     of fixed assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and impairments) and inventories. Manganese is included in the calculation on a proportional
     consolidation basis.

(8)  Refer to exchange release dated 3 November 2016.

(9)  Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure
     comprises Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB),
     Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.

(10) South32's ownership share of operations are as follows: Worsley Alumina (86%), South Africa Aluminium (100%), Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share),
     Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share), South Africa Energy Coal (92% share), Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100%), Australia
     Manganese (60% share), South Africa Manganese (60% share), Cerro Matoso (99.9% share), and Cannington (100%).

(11) South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are repaid.

(12) Operating unit cost, including Sustaining capital expenditure is operating cost plus Sustaining capital expenditure (excludes Major Project capital
     expenditure) divided by sales. Operating cost is Revenue less Underlying EBITDA. Additional manganese disclosures are included.

(13) Prior FY17 Operating unit cost guidance, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and Sustaining capital expenditure guidance, include royalties (where
     appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and were predicated on: an alumina price of US$259/t; an average blended coal price of
     US$83/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$3.23/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$3.95/lb; a thermal
     coal price of US$54/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.50/troy oz; a lead price of US$1,723/t; a zinc price of US$1,907/t; an
     AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 16.57; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,025; all of which reflected forward markets
     as at May 2016 or our internal expectations.

(14) New FY17 Operating unit cost guidance, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and Sustaining capital expenditure guidance, include royalties (where
     appropriate) and the influence of exchange rates, and are predicated on various assumptions for H2 FY17, including: an alumina price of US$316/t; an
     average blended coal price of US$146/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$6.79/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel
     price of US$4.65/lb; a thermal coal price of US$84/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.04/troy oz; a lead price of US$2,267/t;
     a zinc price of US$2,746/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.75; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.20; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,943; all of
     which reflected forward markets as at January 2017 or our internal expectations.

(15) FY17 Capital expenditure guidance is predicated on forward markets as at January 2017, or our internal expectations, for H2 FY17, including: an
     AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.75; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.20; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 2,943.

(16) Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) is Underlying income tax expense excluding royalty related taxation divided by Underlying profit before tax; both the
     numerator and denominator exclude equity accounted investments.

(17) Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs
     variance reflects the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded consumables.
     Foreign exchange reflects the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance reflects the
     revenue impact of sales volume changes, based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the impact from
     changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base, including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on expenditure, and
     period on period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance excludes earnings adjustments including significant items.

(18) Underlying net finance cost and Underlying taxation expense are actual H1 FY17 results, not year-on-year variances.

(19) Third party products sold comprise US$135 million for aluminium, US$56 million for alumina, US$73 million for coal, US$47 million for freight services
     and US$37 million for aluminium raw materials. Underlying EBIT on third party products comprise US$6 million for aluminium, (US$4) million for alumina,
     US$9 million for coal, nil for freight services and nil for aluminium raw materials.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - BASIS OF PREPARATION

The consolidated financial statements of South32 Limited referred to as the ""Company"" and its subsidiaries and joint
arrangements (collectively, the ""South32 Group"") for the half year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 16 February 2017.

1. Reporting entity

South32 Limited is a for-profit company limited by shares incorporated in Australia with a primary listing on the Australian
Securities Exchange, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the South32 Group are described in note 3 Segment
information.

2. Basis of preparation

The half year financial statements are a general purpose condensed financial report which:

-    Have been prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
     and the Corporations Act 2001;
-    Have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial
     assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value;
-    Are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the majority of the Group's operations, and all values
     are rounded to the nearest million dollars (US$M or US$ million) unless otherwise stated, in accordance with Australian 
     Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial / Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191;
-    Present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current period's presentation;
     and
-    Have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in
     the 30 June 2016 annual financial statements

In preparing these half year financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016.

For a full understanding of the financial performance and financial position of the South32 Group it is recommended that
the half year financial statements be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June
2016. Consideration should also be given to any public announcements made by the Company during the half year ended
31 December 2016 in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the ASX Listing Rules.

The following exchange rates relative to the US dollar have been applied in the financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD

3. Segment information

(i) Description of segments

The operating segments (also referred to as ""operations"") are organised and managed separately according to the nature
of products produced.

The members of the executive management team (the ""chief operating decision maker"") and the Board of Directors monitor
the segment results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

The segment information for the manganese operations are presented on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the
measure used by South32's management to assess their performance.

The principal activities of each reporting segment, as the South32 Group is currently structured, are summarised as follows:

Operating segment              Principal activities
Worsley Alumina                Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia
South Africa Aluminium         Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay
Brazil Alumina                 Alumina refinery in Brazil
Mozal Aluminium                Aluminium smelter in Mozambique
South Africa Energy Coal       Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South Africa
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal   Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales
Australia Manganese            Integrated producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and alloys in Tasmania
South Africa Manganese         Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa

Cannington                     Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland

All operations are operated or jointly operated by the South32 Group except Alumar (which forms part of Brazil Alumina),
which is operated by Alcoa.

The South32 Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the
significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.

It is the South32 Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on commercial terms.

Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group
financing (including finance cost and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a South32 Group basis and are
not allocated to operating segments.

Measurement of fair value

The following table shows the South32 Group's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the
nature of valuation inputs used:

Level 1 - Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.

Level 2 - Valuation is based on inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are observable for the financial
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 - Valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity analysis

The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are
calculated using valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with significant inputs as listed below. The
potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in these models, based on a change in the most
significant inputs by 10 per cent while holding all other variables constant, is shown in the following table.

8. Subsequent events

On 3 November 2016 the South32 Group announced that it had entered into a binding agreement to acquire the
Metropolitan Colliery and its associated 16.67% interest in the Port Kembla Coal Terminal from an Australian subsidiary
of Peabody Energy Corporation. The offer includes a cash consideration of US$200 million plus a contingent consideration
whereby both companies share commodity price upside in the first year of production or on a minimum of 1.3Mt, should
metallurgical coal prices exceed an agreed forward curve. The agreement is subject to approval by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission.

On 16 February 2017, the Directors resolved to pay an unfranked interim dividend of US 3.6 cents per share (US$192
million) in respect of the 2017 half year. The dividend will be paid on 6 April 2017. The dividend has not been provided
for in the half year financial statements and will be recognised in the financial statements for the 2017 financial year.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Half-year Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for:

-   the preparation of the Half-year Financial Statements that gives a true and fair view in accordance with
    Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001; and

-   for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the Half-year
    Financial Statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility for the review of the Half-year Financial Statements

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Half-year Financial Statements based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a
Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis of
the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the Half-year
Financial Statements are not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view
of the Group's financial position as at 31 December 2016 and its performance for the half-year ended on that
date; and complying with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the
Corporations Regulations 2001. As auditor of South32 Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the
ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.

A review of half-year financial statements consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Independence

In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.

SOUTH32 QUARTERLY REPORT DECEMBER 2016

                                                                           1

 “While stronger commodity prices and our significant operating leverage have enabled us to further strengthen our
 financial position, we continue to focus on the basics; the safety of our people and the optimisation of our operations.

 “At Illawarra Metallurgical Coal we have addressed a number of operational challenges during the quarter and our
 remediation activities are tracking to plan.

 “We have demonstrated the flexibility of our manganese business to respond to favourable market conditions by
 opportunistically increasing ore production.

 “We entered into a binding agreement to purchase the Metropolitan Colliery, consistent with our strategy to invest in
 high quality mining operations where we can create value.”

 -   Remain on track to achieve production guidance for the majority of our operations, despite a generally
     challenging quarter.

 -   Achieved record production at Brazil Alumina in the December 2016 quarter, while our African aluminium
     smelters continue to operate at benchmark levels of current efficiency.

 -   Increased manganese ore production by drawing down Wessels concentrate stockpiles in South Africa and
     ramping up PC02 ore production at GEMCO to full capacity.

 -   Lower production at South Africa Energy Coal reflects the prior closure of the North Plant at the Wolvekrans-
     Middelburg Complex, scheduled maintenance and the repositioning of draglines.

 -   Production guidance at Cannington remains unchanged and is predicated on the extraction of a high grade
     stope towards the end of FY17 following significantly weaker metal production in the December 2016 half year.

 -   Revised sales guidance for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal of 8.1Mt remains unchanged as Appin Area 7 has
     returned to full capacity and remediation work at Appin Area 9 is continuing as planned.
 
Entered into an agreement to acquire Peabody’s Metropolitan Colliery and associated 16.67% interest in the Port
Kembla Coal Terminal for US$200M.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-     Our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating remain a priority. During the period, Standard &
      Poor’s and Moody’s reaffirmed their respective BBB+ and Baa1 credit ratings following their annual reviews. Our
      net cash position further benefitted from gross distributions totalling US$137M (South32 share) from equity accounted
      investments in the December 2016 half year.
-     In the December 2016 half year, we invested US$8.2M in exploration of which US$1.5M was capitalised. This
      includes an investment of US$1.4M in exploration in our equity accounted investments of which US$0.9M was
      capitalised. Within the footprint of our existing operations, we focussed on metallurgical coal, manganese and
      silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia. Consistent with the terms of the option agreement signed with Northern
      Shield Resources, we will fund C$1.3M of exploration in CY17 for Cu-Ni-PGE mineralisation at Huckleberry in the
      Labrador Trough, Canada. Completion of this funding will secure the right to acquire a 50% interest in the
      Huckleberry property.
-     Our Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)[1], which excludes taxation associated with equity accounted
      investments, largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to
      South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 40%; and Brazil 34%. Permanent differences have
      a disproportionate effect on the Group’s tax rate when the Group’s profit margins are compressed.
-     In the December 2016 quarter, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire Peabody’s Metropolitan Colliery
      and associated 16.67% interest in the Port Kembla Coal Terminal for a consideration of US$200M[2]. Subject to
      approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, completion is expected in the March 2017
      quarter.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 1.6Mt) to 14.8Mt in the December 2016 half year.
The decline in production reflects the prior closure of the North Plant at the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex (WMC),
scheduled maintenance and the repositioning of draglines. Export sales were also impacted by Transnet’s annual rail
maintenance cycle. FY17 saleable coal production guidance remains unchanged at 30.9Mt (domestic coal 17.0Mt, export
coal 13.9Mt).

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by 6% (or 243kt) to 3.7Mt in the December 2016 half year.
The decline in production primarily reflected challenging ground conditions at Appin Area 9 and a moderation in mining
rates at Appin Area 7 that ensured gas concentrations were maintained at safe levels. These impacts were partially
offset by strong operating performance at Dendrobium. Consistent with our recent update, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal
sales of 8.1Mt are expected in FY17 as Appin Area 7 has returned to full capacity and remediation work at Appin Area 9
is continuing as planned.

As a result of a carry-over shipment in December 2016 associated with the production challenges at Appin and our
declaration of force majeure, our average realised price for metallurgical coal in the December 2016 half year will reflect
a modest discount to the premium low-volatile hard coking coal index on a volume weighted M-1 basis [5]. Another carry-
over shipment will occur in the June 2017 half year.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production in the December 2016 half year decreased by 6% (or 90kwmt) from the
prior period’s record rate to 1.5Mwmt as lower yields and reduced plant availability resulted in lower production from the
primary high grade circuit. This impact was partially offset by the opportunistic ramp-up of the Premium Concentrate ore
(PC02) circuit to its annualised capacity of 500kwmt in the December 2016 quarter.

FY17 production guidance of 3.1Mwmt remains unchanged, albeit with an increased proportion of PC02 in the product
mix. The share of PC02 product in H1 FY17 production was 5% (H1 FY16: Nil). Our PC02 fines product has a
manganese content of approximately 40% which leads to both grade and product-type discounts when referenced to the
high grade 44% manganese lump ore index.

Despite the greater contribution of the PC02 circuit in the December 2016 half year, our volume weighted average
realised price for external sales will reflect a modest premium to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index on an
M-1 basis [6]. Internal sales continue to occur on a commercial basis.

Exploration drilling at GEMCO’s Southern Areas commenced in the December 2016 quarter.
Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 8% (or 7kt) to 78kt in the December 2016 half year as furnace
instability impacted performance during the period. All four furnaces are expected to operate at full capacity once
scheduled maintenance is completed in the March 2017 quarter.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 23% (or 177kwmt) to 934kwmt in the December 2016 half
year as market conditions supported a drawdown of Wessels concentrate stockpiles and the use of higher cost trucking
to access export opportunities. South Africa Manganese ore production will remain configured for an optimised
rate of 2.9Mwmt pa (100% basis), although we will continue to act opportunistically when market
fundamentals are supportive. The Wessels Central Block project remains on track to be completed in the March 2017
quarter.

Our Wessels concentrate product is fine grained, resulting in a substantial product discount when referenced to index
prices. Our volume weighted average realised price for external sales will therefore reflect a discount of approximately 10% to the
medium grade 37% manganese lump ore index on an M-1 basis [7] as a result of the opportunistic drawdown of Wessels
concentrate stockpiles. Wessels concentrate accounted for 15% of
December 2016 half year external sales,(H1 FY16: 4%). Internal sales continue to
occur on a commercial basis.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 20% (or 9kt) to 37kt in the December 2016 half year as a result of
furnace instability. Metalloys continues to operate one of its four furnaces.

Payable zinc production increased by 1% (or 0.3kt) to 42.1kt in the December 2016 half year, while payable silver and lead
production decreased by 27% and 24%, respectively. Lower silver and lead ore grades were the primary contributors to
the reduction in metal production.

Silver and lead grades are expected to increase significantly in the June 2017 half year as a higher grade stope in close
proximity to the existing underground crusher chamber is scheduled to be extracted towards the end of FY17. The ability
to achieve FY17 production guidance (Silver 19.05Moz, Lead 163kt, Zinc 80kt) is therefore predicated on the timing of
stope extraction, while the development of the replacement underground crusher remains on schedule for commissioning
in the December 2017 quarter.

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will increase Underlying EBIT [8] by
US$0.5M in the December 2016 half year (-US$11M June 2016 financial year; -US$19M December 2015 half
year). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 2Moz of silver, 25kt of lead and 12kt of zinc) were revalued at
31 December 2016. The final price of these sales will be determined in the June 2017 half year.


Notes:
1.   The ETR calculation excludes equity accounted investments as they are recorded on an after tax basis.

2.   Agreed offer includes fully funded, cash consideration of US$200M (subject to customary working capital adjustments) and a mechanism whereby
     both companies will share commodity price upside in the first year of production, or on a minimum 1.3Mt, should metallurgical coal prices exceed an
     agreed forward curve. Should 1.3Mt of volume not be achieved in the 12 months post completion, this Contingent Value mechanism shall continue until
     1.3Mt is achieved. In any event, the Contingent Value mechanism will cease by 31 December 2018.

3.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned by the
     B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata
     to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.

4.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%.
     The Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.

                                                     ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL UPDATE

                     South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32) (South32) advises that saleable coal production of 7.9Mt
                     is anticipated at its Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operation in FY17, including 3.6Mt in
                     H1 FY17. While ground conditions at the Appin Area 9 longwall have stabilised, additional work
                     is being undertaken to recondition the maingate roadway to ensure the safe extraction of the
                     901 panel. At Appin Area 7, production continues to be progressively ramped-up to ensure safe
                     levels of gas are maintained.

                     As a result, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales of 8.1Mt are now anticipated in FY17, while our
                     average realised hard coking coal sales price will continue to reflect the premium low volatile
                     index on a Month -1 (prior month) basis.

                     On the basis of unchanged assumptions for foreign exchange rates and coal prices, an average
                     Operating unit cost (including Sustaining capital expenditure)1 of approximately US$86/t is now
                     anticipated for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in H1 FY17 (previously US$75/t). This cost is forecast
                     to decline towards US$80/t in H2 FY17 (previously US$71/t) for an average Operating unit cost
                     (including Sustaining capital expenditure) of US$83/t in FY17.

                       expenditure (US$/t)1

                     With the completion of the 901 panel and the associated release of ground stresses, a strong
                     improvement in longwall availability and cutting rates is anticipated in FY18 with total saleable
                     production forecast to exceed 9.0Mt. Consequently, Operating unit costs (including Sustaining
                     capital expenditure)1 are forecast to decline towards approximately US$77/t given the operation’s
                     high fixed cost base.

                     Restated FY17 production guidance incorporates a longwall move for each of the March and
                     June 2017 quarters. To allow comparison to prior guidance, the various unit cost estimates do
                     not take account of currently elevated coal prices, which increase royalty rates, and changes in
                     the Australian dollar to US dollar rate, which has remained persistently above 0.72. FY17


Operating unit cost, including Sustaining capital expenditure, guidance for our upstream
operations will be updated when we report H1 FY17 financial results and will incorporate revised
foreign exchange rate and price assumptions.


Notes:
1.   Operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, include royalties and the influence of exchange rate
     assumptions, and are based on: an average blended coal price of US$83/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; and an
     AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72.

David Crawford AO, Chairman

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is David Crawford and I am the Chairman of
the South32 Board of Directors.

Thank you for joining us today for our Annual General Meeting and welcome to those

Nicole Duncan, our Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary, will now take us through the

….

                                                                                                2
I will commence proceedings with an overview of the key achievements for the 2016 year.

Your CEO, Graham Kerr, will then present an operations report before we move to the formal
business of the meeting and the resolutions.

We will provide an opportunity for discussion and any questions you might have when we deal
with each of the formal agenda items.

…

2016 has been a busy year for everyone at South32, and our success is due to our talented and
motivated people who have worked hard to deliver on our commitments.

It was not an easy 12 months for the industry as a whole, as we faced weak economies and
volatile commodity prices.

However, while the outlook still remains unclear, our hard work is beginning to pay off as we
build an even stronger company.

Before I touch on some of our achievements, we recognise that our safety performance was not
acceptable.

We lost four of our colleagues in Africa during the year, which had an enormous impact on everyone
across our business.

Nothing is more important than everyone going home safe and well at the end of every shift.

The Board and Management are committed to turning this safety performance around.

Graham will share more on Our Care Strategy shortly.

Our first full year reporting period delivered strong operating performance.

We generated revenue of US 5.8 billion dollars, and Underlying earnings before interest, tax, and
depreciation of US 1.1 billion dollars.

The Group’s statutory loss was US 1.6 billion dollars, largely brought about by non-cash impairments
resulting from decisions made at the time of our demerger.

We significantly reduced controllable costs and capital expenditure.

We maintained a strong balance sheet, reducing net debt by US 714 million dollars, resulting in a net
cash position of US 312 million dollars at year end.

By maintaining our financial discipline and continuing to optimise our portfolio, we have retained our
positive, investment grade credit rating.

This is a key component of our simple capital management framework.

We declared a 1 cent dividend, consistent with our policy to distribute a minimum of 40 per cent of
Underlying earnings as dividends, following each six month reporting period.

The Board and management team are committed to developing a workplace culture that reflects
our four values of Care, Trust, Togetherness and Excellence.


                                                                                                 3
We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the broadest sense, both in the composition of the
board and leadership roles, and across our workforce.

One of the strengths of our Board comes from the fact that we are represented by a range of
nationalities and backgrounds which leads to diversity of thought in the Boardroom.

Ideas and perspectives are freely shared.

The Board’s relationship with Graham and senior management is transparent, supportive and
aligned around our organisational priorities.

Over the past year your Directors have spent time with the broader management teams.

Our Board meeting program involved a number of site visits to our operations across the globe.

This enabled us to get to know our employees and have a deeper understanding of the
business, at, for example, Khutala, Hillside and Mozal in Africa, Worsley and Cannington in
Australia, and Marketing in Singapore.

We also spent time in the local communities, to appreciate the environment in which our
employees live and work and to understand what is important to them.

As well as developing and instilling a positive culture we have focused on our governance
framework, embedding systems, processes and policies appropriate for our business.

One new policy endorsed by the Board during the year was our Climate Change Strategy. This
allows us to proactively manage our greenhouse gas emissions profile. We focus on emission
reduction, climate resilience and climate change opportunity.

We have the right framework, the right people and the right strategy, to build a stronger company
and stretch the performance of our operations, in a sustainable way.

On behalf of the Board, Graham and his broader management team, I acknowledge all of our
employees and contractors for their hard work over the past year.

And to you, our shareholders, thank you for your continued support.

I will now hand over to Graham.

Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

I’m pleased to say FY16 operating performance was strong.

We set annual production records at:

Australia Manganese, Worsley Alumina, Brazil Alumina, Mozal Aluminium and Cannington, for
payable zinc, and we achieved guidance for the majority of our other operations.

We implemented our Regional Model, and restructured our operations, which I will discuss in more
detail shortly.

While our operating performance was strong, as David mentioned, our safety performance in the
past year has been unacceptable.

We tragically lost four of our colleagues at our African operations, which was devastating for not
only their loved ones, but for all of us at South32.

                                                                                                 4
We need a complete step-change in our approach and behaviour.

We are committed to investing time, energy and leadership to make a meaningful and
sustainable change, to get this right.

We have implemented Our Care Strategy, and we are developing a culture of care and
accountability by building an inclusive workplace where everyone feels comfortable to bring their
whole self to work, where work is well-designed and we continuously improve and learn.

Our systems need to be simple, well understood and reliable, delivering safe outcomes for our
people.

Throughout FY16, we stayed true to our strategy, to optimise our operations, unlock their potential
by converting our high quality resources into reserves, and identify and pursue investment
opportunities beyond our current portfolio.

We spent the majority of our time optimising our operations.

We transitioned to a Regional Model, and implemented a number of restructuring initiatives
across the business.

By optimising our operations and maintaining a focus on value over volume we generated
controllable cost savings of US386 million dollars and reduced capital expenditure by US306
million dollars.

We also continued to unlock the potential of our operations.

At GEMCO in the Northern Territory, Australia, we reached a landmark agreement to mine the
Eastern Leases and explore the highly prospective Southern Areas, which have the potential to
substantially extend the life of one of the world’s largest and lowest cost manganese mines.

At Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, the US 565 million dollar Appin Area 9 project, which was
delivered three months ahead of schedule and 33 per cent below budget, increases production
capacity at the operation.

This solid foundation positions us well to unlock the resource potential of our existing operations,
the majority of which have significant reserve lives that underpin a stable production outlook.

In FY16, we made our first investment in an opportunity beyond our current portfolio, signing an
option agreement with Northern Shield Resources at the Huckleberry property in Canada.

This agreement represents a low-cost entry into the Labrador Trough, a province identified as
being highly prospective for copper, nickel and platinum group elements.

Just last month, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Metropolitan Colliery and its
interest in the Port Kembla Coal Terminal from Peabody Energy Corporation.

Metropolitan is adjacent to our Illawarra operation in New South Wales, so it is a natural fit for
our portfolio, and will enable us to unlock unique blending and resource synergies, whilst adding
up to two million tonnes per annum of metallurgical coal to our portfolio.

Consistent with our strategy, we will continue to identify and evaluate new and exciting
opportunities outside our current portfolio, where we see value.

But we won’t compromise our balance sheet.

South32 has achieved a lot in the first 12 months and performed well in a challenging
environment.



                                                                                                   5
We are committed to deliver on the intent of Our Care Strategy, and our key priorities, to build an
even stronger company in FY17.

I look forward to updating you in the months ahead.

Thank you, and I now hand you back to our Chairman.

The Chairman then conducted the formal items of business.

David Crawford AO, Chairman

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your attendance and attention.

This brings us to the end of the 2016 Annual General Meeting. On behalf of the Board, thank
you for your participation. We look forward to your continued support in the coming year.

Please join me and my fellow Directors and executive management for light refreshments
outside this room.

I now declare this meeting CLOSED.

In FY17, saleable coal production of 1.3Mt is anticipated as two longwall moves are scheduled
across the year and additional underground development activities will reduce longwall availability
and utilisation rates. FY18 saleable production is expected to increase to 1.7Mt as longwall
performance increases towards historical rates. The lower production rate and expenditure on
underground development and exploration activities across FY17 and FY18 will temporarily
increase unit costs. Updated production and unit cost guidance for the expanded Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal operation will be provided with our December 2016 half year financial results.

Coal Reserve – clarifying statements

The estimates of Coal Reserves for the Metropolitan Colliery mine are foreign estimates under the
ASX Listing Rules reported in accordance with the US SEC Industry Guide 7, Peabody Energy
Corp. 10-K filing with the US SEC, 16 March 2016.

The categories of Coal Reserve classification used are in accordance with the US SEC Industry
Guide 7. The Coal Reserve reported in accordance with Appendix 5A of ASX Listing rules (The
JORC Code) requires reporting of Marketable Coal Reserves in conjunction with Coal Reserves
including basis of the predicted yield. US SEC Industry Guide 7 only requires to report Recoverable
Coal Reserves. In this case, the Recoverable Reserves may be read as Marketable Coal
Reserves.

South32 considers these estimates to be both relevant and material to South32 given that this
transaction has the potential to increase the production capacity of the existing South32 Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal operation (a material project to South32) by greater than 10%.

Reliability of estimate:
South32 has experience operating within the same coalfield. South32’s key technical and
operational personnel, including the Coal Reserves Competent Person, conducted site visits as
part of the due diligence process. Key modifying and operating cost factors are based on
operational experience and have been benchmarked to South32’s existing operations. All
infrastructure is in place to operate the mine at the stated capacity. Environmental factors have
been considered and relevant approvals are in place to enable the extraction of the stated
reserves. Peabody Energy reported Coal Reserves in compliance with US SEC Industry Guide 7
following an independent audit carried out by Palaris Australia Pty. Ltd.

The basis for the estimate as provided to South32 consists of a geological database incorporating
seam intersections, coal quality, surface topography and roof and floor lithology derived from
exploration boreholes, in seam strip samples, seismic data and other relevant points of
observation. Mining and processing recoveries are based on current and historical operational
experience.

South32 believes that the information provided is the most recent available.

Following completion of the transaction it is South32’s intention to conduct a work program to
increase confidence in the resource and reserve and to ensure that resources and reserves are
reported in accordance with the JORC Code. The work program will include additional exploration
by means of drilling and seismic surveys and is anticipated to be completed within three years and
will be funded using internal cash reserves.

                   ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL PRODUCTION UPDATE

South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32) (South32) announces that production at its Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal operation will be affected by the temporary suspension of its Appin Area 9
longwall and lower rates of production at the Appin Area 7 longwall. A saleable production loss of
approximately 500kt is currently anticipated and will translate directly to sales given low inventory
levels.

The Appin mine received a prohibition notice from the New South Wales Department of Industry,
Resources and Energy on 26 October 2016, having reported elevated gas concentrations at
Appin Area 7. Longwalls 7 and 9 were subsequently suspended to enable an investigation to be
completed. The elevated gas concentrations resulted from the failure of a ventilation fan which
was promptly rectified.

Having restarted the longwall at Area 9, it became apparent that the outage exacerbated
challenging ground conditions and production has now been suspended to complete remedial
work. These works are expected to be completed within four weeks and this outage accounts for
the majority of lost production. In addition, the Appin Area 7 longwall will run at a reduced rate
before ramping up to full capacity once the necessary tests confirm that we can maintain
methane gas concentrations at a safe level.

 QUARTERLY REPORT SEPTEMBER 2016

 “Stronger commodity prices and cost saving initiatives delivered a further US$239M increase in our net cash position
 to US$551M, despite the impact of annual payments that followed year end and the typical lag in commodity pricing.

 “We entered into an agreement with Alcoa to access bauxite in close proximity to our Worsley Alumina mining
 infrastructure. While subject to government and regulatory approvals, this agreement has the potential to defer capital
 expenditure required to develop new mining areas.

 “The combination of a strong balance sheet and operating leverage ensures we are well positioned to deliver superior
 performance as we optimise our operations, unlock their potential and identify opportunities beyond our current
 portfolio.”

 Graham Kerr, South32 CEO


 -   Net cash position increased by US$239M in the September 2016 quarter to US$551M.

 -   Production and unit cost guidance remains unchanged for the majority of operations.

 -   Strong domestic demand underpinned a 2% increase in South Africa Energy Coal production, while an
     expected decline in ore grades and scheduled maintenance led to a 9%, 7% and 5% reduction in nickel, silver
     and zinc production, respectively.

 -   Restarted production in 22 pots at South Africa Aluminium as power availability continued to improve and the
     operation maintained leading rates of current efficiency.

 -   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales of 9.3Mt now expected in FY17 as the operation has recovered from
     challenging ground conditions at Appin and inventory has been reduced by 300kt.

 -   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal’s unit cost guidance of US$71/t (including sustaining capital expenditure) now
     expected to be achieved in the June 2017 half year, with costs to be US$4/t higher in the December 2016 half
     year given the operation’s high fixed cost base.

 -   South Africa Manganese mines now operating at the optimised 2.9Mwmt pa rate (100% basis) following the
     decision to stop work at the Wessels underground mine in June 2016.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-     Net cash [1] increased by US$239M to US$551M in the September 2016 quarter, despite the impact of annual
      payments that followed year end, the typical lag in commodity pricing and a foreign exchange related increase in
      finance lease liabilities, which rose to US$615M (US$601M 30 June 2016).

-     We remain on track to achieve unit cost guidance [2] for the majority of our upstream operations in FY17 should
      stated exchange rate assumptions and commodity prices prevail. The temporary disruption to production at Appin
      and the operation’s high fixed cost base does, however, mean that Illawarra Metallurgical Coal unit cost guidance
      of US$71/t (including sustaining capital) [2] will not be achieved until the June 2017 half year, with costs to be
      US$4/t higher in the December 2016 half year.

-     Guidance for capital expenditure [3] of US$450M in FY17 is predicated on several assumptions including an
      average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72 and an average USD:ZAR exchange rate of 16.57. The rate of
      expenditure expressed in US dollars therefore remains contingent on directional changes in US dollar cross rates.

-     We have entered into an agreement with Alcoa of Australia Ltd. (Alcoa) to access ground directly to the west of
      our existing Marradong mining area at Worsley Alumina. This agreement, which is subject to government and
      regulatory approvals, has the potential to unlock value by deferring capital expenditure required to develop new
      mining areas. A final development decision remains subject to the delineation of a Mineral Resource with the
      characteristics of the refinery’s existing feed.

-     In the September 2016 quarter, we invested US$2.5M in exploration of which US$0.3M was capitalised.
      Exploration drilling for Cu-Ni-PGE mineralisation commenced at Huckleberry in the Labrador Trough, Canada,
      while our existing operations focussed on metallurgical coal and silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia.
      Exploration for manganese, at GEMCO’s Southern Areas, and bauxite, west of our existing Marradong mining
      area at Worsley Alumina, is expected to commence in the December 2016 quarter.

-     Our Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) [4] largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The
      corporate tax rates applicable to South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 40%; and Brazil
      34%. Permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s tax rate when the Group’s profit
      margins are compressed.

South Africa Aluminium saleable production increased by 2% (or 3kt) to 175kt in the September 2016 quarter as the
smelter continued to achieve leading rates of current efficiency and the prevalence of load-shedding events continued to
decline. Given improved power availability, we have restarted production in the 22 pots that were suspended in
September 2015 and will ramp-up to full production during the December 2016 quarter. The number of pots scheduled
for relining in FY17 is unchanged at 72 (FY16: 183 pots).

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by 26% (or 646kt) to 1.9Mt in the September 2016 quarter as
challenging geological conditions were encountered at the Appin Area 9 longwall and the step around at Appin Area 7
was extended by 22 days. No longwall moves are planned for the December 2016 quarter, with two moves scheduled for
the March 2017 quarter.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales of 9.3Mt are now expected in FY17 as the operation has recovered from challenging
ground conditions at Appin and finished goods inventory has been reduced by 300kt. Accordingly, FY17 production
guidance is reduced to 9.0Mt, with the operation expected to attain the previously targeted 9.5Mtpa rate across the
remainder of the year.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal’s unit cost guidance of US$71/t (including sustaining capital expenditure) [2] is now expected
to be achieved in the June 2017 half year, with costs to be US$4/t higher in the December 2016 half year given the
operation’s high fixed cost base.

Payable silver and zinc production decreased by 7% and 5%, respectively, in the September 2016 quarter as ore grades
and recoveries declined, consistent with the mine plan. A scheduled mill outage in August 2016 also affected production
in the quarter. The next outage is scheduled for December 2016 in accordance with the mill relining cycle. FY17 payable
silver, lead and zinc production guidance remains unchanged at 19.05Moz, 163kt and 80kt, respectively.


Notes:
1.   Provisional unaudited net cash balance as at 30 September 2016.
2.   Unit cost guidance as provided in the FY16 Financial Results and Outlook, 25 August 2016. Operating unit cost targets, including Sustaining capital
     expenditure, include royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and are based on: an alumina price of US$259/t;
     an average blended coal price of US$83/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$3.23/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a
     nickel price of US$3.95/lb; a thermal coal price of US$54/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.50/troy oz; a lead price of
     US$1,723/t; a zinc price of US$1,907/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 16.57; and a USD:COP exchange rate of
     3,025; all of which reflect forward markets as at May 2016 or our internal expectations.
3.   Includes equity accounted investments capital expenditure, but excludes expenditure related to the purchase of intangibles and capitalised
     exploration expenditure.
4.   The ETR calculation excludes equity accounted investments as they are recorded on an after tax basis.
5.   8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned by the
     B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata
     to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
6.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%.
     The Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
7.   Figures in italics indicate that an adjustment has been made since the figures were previously reported.
8.   The following abbreviations have been used throughout this report: grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes per
     annum (ktpa); million tonnes (Mt); million tonnes per annum (Mtpa); thousand ounces (koz); million ounces (Moz); thousand wet metric tonnes

1. Principal risks and uncertainties

1.1. Risk management

The identification, assessment and management of risk is fundamental to our business. Our risk
management and internal control framework is used to identify and assess risk events, and to
establish robust controls and mitigation strategies.

Risk management is embedded in our business activities, functions and processes with
materiality and tolerance for risk being key considerations in our decision making processes.
Material risks that could impact the delivery of our strategy are analysed and assessed
consistently across the business. The potential consequence of each risk is determined in
accordance with the methodology outlined in our Risk Management Standard.




Registered Office: Level 35, 108 St Georges Terrace, Perth Western Australia 6000, Australia
ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia
Controls are implemented and verified on an ongoing basis to ensure the level of risk is
monitored and managed. Action plans to correct deficiencies in the application of the Risk
Management Standard or specific deficiencies in risks and controls are tracked to ensure all
actions are completed.

Our business, operating and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
many of which are beyond the Group’s reasonable control. The following identified risks are not
listed in order of significance and are not intended to be exhaustive. They reflect the most
significant risks currently identified for our Group.

1.2. Risk factors

Strategic and External risks

Fluctuations in commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates and global economy

Nature: Our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows are affected by the volatility of commodity
prices, interest rates and currencies. The prices realised for our products are linked to global
commodity markets, which reflect the balance of supply and demand for each commodity.
Operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our operations are
located and by currencies in which the costs of imported equipment and services are
determined.

Mitigation: The combination of our high-quality operations and strong balance sheet is a key
differentiator in the current challenging economic environment. Our diverse portfolio and
geographical spread also provide some downside protection from variability. To further mitigate
risk, we typically seek to manage financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity
prices on a floating index basis. We actively monitor the markets in which we operate and
continuously review our operating and capital expenditure plans.

Actions by governments, political events or tax authorities

Nature: Our business could be adversely affected by new government regulations, such as
changes to taxation policy and controls on imports, exports and prices. Our operations are based
on material long-term investments that are dependent on long-term fiscal stability. Audits and
reviews by administrative bodies may result in us incurring additional tax or royalty payments. In
addition, our entities could be exposed to the risk of nationalisation, renegotiation or nullification
of existing contracts, leases, permits or other agreements.

Mitigation: We proactively manage relationships with local, domestic and international
governments and regulators. We engage directly with governments and key stakeholders to
ensure risk associated with regulatory change is identified, understood and, where possible,
mitigated.

Cost inflation and labour disputes could impact operating margins and expansion plans

Nature: Our business are exposed to the price variability of our production inputs and this could
negatively impact operating margins. Labour is a significant input to our operating costs. Labour
costs may vary depending on underlying demand and the requirements of each operation. An
increase in the capital cost of development projects or scheduling delays could adversely impact
anticipated financial returns. Industrial action, acts of terror and civil unrest could impact on
operations.
Mitigation: Our strategy seeks to optimise our operations, sustainably lowering operating costs
and capital expenditure. We aspire to have constructive relationships and dialogue with trade
unions and employees across our business. Investment decisions are framed by our simple
capital management framework and all discretionary investments compete, based on the risk
and return equation.

Access to water and power

Nature: Water and power are critical to all our operations. Continued access to water and power,
on current terms, to support existing activities cannot be guaranteed in the future. Underlying
factors can change, such as the climate, our operations, counterparties, contractual
arrangements or government policy.

Mitigation: We work closely with suppliers of water and power, engaging on a long-term, mutually
beneficial basis. We also work to secure water and energy resources within our control.

In areas where the long-term availability of water has become less certain as a result of climate
change and drought, we are investigating, and where appropriate investing in, initiatives such as
the desalination facility at our Hillside operation. As we seek to diversify our energy supply
sources where possible, we will continue to pursue opportunities such as the co-generation and
multiple fuel options in place at Worsley Alumina.

We may be subject to regulations in relation to dividend payments and capital returns

Nature: Our ability to pay dividends and utilise excess capital will depend on government
regulations, the level of distributions received from operating subsidiaries and associates, and
the level of cash balances and access to those cash balances.

Mitigation: We have robust procedures in place that govern the efficient allocation of capital
across the Company, including returning surplus capital to South32 Limited. These procedures
are continuously reviewed in line with government regulations and business requirements to
ensure our risk is managed. We also have a highly integrated cash management structure that
underpins our access to cash.

Regulatory risks of climate change

Nature: Carbon pricing including carbon taxes, trading or any other regulatory carbon pricing
mechanism, has the potential to affect the economic viability of our operations. We monitor
climate and energy policy developments including the large increase in the range and depth of
carbon pricing legislation globally. This includes the outcomes of the Paris Agreement signed in
December 2015 and the accompanying ‘Nationally Determined Contributions’, plus policy
changes relating to carbon pricing legislation in Australia and South Africa (in draft).

Mitigation: When considering the long-term viability of our operations and future capital
investments, we apply a range of scenarios for carbon pricing. We support carbon pricing that is
globally competitive and broad-based, covering all industry sectors and possible emission
sources. Recognising that carbon pricing will likely become more stringent over time, we are
committed to de-carbonising our operations. An emissions reduction target is included in all
employee remuneration packages, including executives.

Risks to commodity portfolio from climate change

Nature: We are monitoring and responding to increasing commitments to divest or reduce
investments in fossil fuel companies. While our energy coal operations represented 20.4 per cent
of total revenue from Group production in FY2016, this trend could have a detrimental impact on
investor appetite for our shares. Furthermore, any reduction in the anticipated level of demand
for energy coal could have a negative impact on the pricing of our energy coal products.

Mitigation: We have chosen not to develop any new energy coal basins. Our South African
energy coal operations are positioned at the low end of the industry cost curve. We supply the
domestic South African market under long-term contracts to Eskom, the national power provider
which accounts for 90 per cent of coal powered generation, and international markets. Our
seaborne energy coal is predominantly sold to emerging markets where electricity supply is
dominated by coal powered generation. We conduct scenario analyses annually to stress test
our portfolio. A number of our commodities are critical in supporting a transition to a two degree
limited future. This includes metallurgical coal and manganese to create high quality steel for
climate resilient infrastructure: aluminium for light weighting and creating more efficient transport
options; and manganese and nickel, both used in some battery technologies that support
renewable energy.

Access to infrastructure

Nature: Our products are transported to customers by a range of methods, including road, rail
and sea. A number of factors could disrupt the availability of transport services, including
weather-related problems, rail or port capacity and allocation constraints, key equipment and
infrastructure failures, and industrial action. These risks may limit our ability to deliver product to
our customers. Further, the cost of accessing required infrastructure may increase and we may
not be able to pass on the full extent of the increase to our customers.

Mitigation: Our business manages the infrastructure needs of our operations. We seek to
understand our access requirements and then implement infrastructure plans to address them.
Many of our operations have long-term agreements in place to secure necessary access.
Business continuity plans are developed to manage the risk of disruption to critical infrastructure.
Our centralised, fully integrated marketing function allows us to optimise our supply chain and
effectively manage logistics and handling of commodities from load point to customer.

Failure to maintain, realise or enhance existing reserves

Nature: Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are expressions of judgement based on
knowledge, experience and industry practice. Our value is limited to the known resources and
reserves position. Failure to take the right opportunities to optimise and enhance our resources
and reserves position could detrimentally impact long-term shareholder returns.

Mitigation: We have a number of initiatives in place to optimise our operations, unlock their
potential and identify new options that may compete for capital. Our simple capital management
framework and capital prioritisation process is designed to maximise total shareholder returns.

Support of the local communities in which businesses are located

Nature: Notwithstanding our contribution to the communities in which we are located, local
communities may become dissatisfied with the impact of our operations or oppose new
development projects. Community action could include litigation, which may affect the costs,
production and, in extreme cases, viability of our operations. There are also security risks that
may impact our people and operations.

Mitigation: We enable our operations to effectively manage relationships with communities and
we actively seek to engage and support them. Our Regional Model means our operations are
managed by people who understand their communities and the environment in which they
operate.




Operational Risks

Health and safety risks in respect of our activities

Nature: Longer-term health impacts may arise due to the exposure of the workforce to hazardous
substances. As we operate internationally, we may be affected by potential pandemic outbreaks.
Potential safety events that may have an adverse impact on our operations include fi re,
explosion or rock fall incidents both in above ground and underground mining operations,
personnel conveyance equipment failures or human errors in underground operations, aircraft
incidents, incidents involving light vehicles and mining mobile equipment, ground control failures
or gas leaks, equipment isolation during repair and maintenance, working from heights or lifting
operations.

Mitigation: The well-being of our employees is paramount and our values of Togetherness and
Care underpin everything we do. As a result, our operations have, and have had for a number of
years, comprehensive health and safety policies in place with associated performance
requirements that are intended to help prevent and mitigate the impact of such exposures. The
company-wide Care Strategy will further our eff orts to provide a safe working environment and
prevent all injuries. The creation of an inclusive workplace with a strong culture of care and
accountability will be supported by well-designed work that delivers safe outcomes and a focus
on continuously improving and learning.

Environmental risks in respect of activities including water and waste water management

Nature: Our operations, by their nature, have the potential to impact biodiversity, land, water and
related ecosystems, including from the discharge of contaminants. Changes in scientific
understanding of these impacts, regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations may
prevent or delay project approvals and result in increased costs for mitigation, off sets or
compensatory actions. They may also impact the sustainability of operations.

Mitigation: We have defined policies and standards that seek to prevent, monitor and limit the
impact of our operations on the environment. Certain sites are subject to remediation plans that
seek to address known contamination as a result of past activities. As part of this process, we
are focussed on water and waste water management, as the sustainability of our operations
relies on our ability to obtain an appropriate quality and quantity of water. We use water
responsibly and manage it appropriately, taking into account natural supply variations.

Deterioration in liquidity and cash flow

Nature: Fluctuations in commodity prices and the global economy may adversely impact future
cash flows. If we compromise our balance sheet, liquidity and cash reserves, interest rate costs
on borrowed debt and future access to financial capital markets could be adversely affected.

Mitigation: As part of our capital management framework, we have committed to maintain an
investment grade credit rating and strong liquidity through the economic cycle. Our Treasury
team is responsible for managing the balance sheet and cash flow within strict financial criteria.

Unexpected operational or natural catastrophes
Nature: We have extractive, processing and logistical operations in a number of geographic
locations. Our operations can be exposed to incidents such as fi re and explosion, loss of power
supply and critical mechanical equipment failures. Our operations, including the associated
transport networks, are exposed to the physical impacts of climate change. This includes
changes to water availability and access (both scarcity and potential for flooding), variability in
temperatures and rising sea levels. We may also be exposed to other incidents that affect
operations, including fi re, flooding, underground rock failures, pit wall failures at open-cut mines
and unexpected natural catastrophes, the frequency and severity of which may be exacerbated
as a result of climate change.

Mitigation: We undertake planning designed to protect the safety of our employees, contractors
and stakeholders, and the long-term value of our operations. Our operations use our risk
management tools to analyse risks, such as unexpected catastrophes, and implement actions to
prevent or limit the effects. We are also working on projects to increase the long-term resilience
of our operations to the physical impacts of climate change. This includes incorporating the most
up-to-date climate parameters into our planning, risk and investment model. By recognising that
we share critical and valuable natural resources with others, we are also taking action to protect
and maintain access to shared ecosystem services such as water and biodiversity for the long-
term. Contingency, business continuity and disaster recovery plans are developed to respond to
significant events to ensure the safe restoration of normal business activity. We purchase
insurance to protect ourselves against the financial consequences of an event, subject to
availability and cost.

Commercial counterparties that we transact with may not meet their obligations

Nature: We contract with a number of commercial, government and financial counterparties,
including customers, suppliers and financial institutions. Counterparties may fail to perform
against existing contracts and obligations or long-term take-or-pay agreements may adversely
impact on cost or price performance. Non-supply or changes to the quality of key inputs may
impact costs and production at operations.

Mitigation: We seek to proactively engage with our contracting counterparties to collaboratively
manage instances of non-supply or quality control prior to it occurring. Our operations manage
exposures by defining counterparty limits based on counterparty credit ratings and the level of
exposure. We purchase insurance to protect ourselves against the financial consequences of
supply disruption, subject to availability and cost.

Risks of fraud and corruption

Nature: We are exposed to the risks of fraud and corruption, both within and external to our
organisation. Fraud and corruption may lead to regulatory fines, financial loss, litigation, loss of
operating licences or reputational damage.

Mitigation: We adhere to the applicable legislative and regulatory requirements in respect of
fraud and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our Code of Business Conduct,
policies and procedures describe the controls in place to manage this risk and our expectations
of our people when faced with fraud and corruption. We also provide our people with the tools to
safely report any suspected fraudulent or corrupt activities.

Breaches of information technology security processes

Nature: Our global information technology systems, consisting of infrastructure, applications and
communication networks, could be subject to security breaches resulting in theft, disclosure or
corruption of information. Security breaches could also result in misappropriation of funds or
disruption to operations.

Mitigation: Network and physical control frameworks, together with anti-virus software, provide a
level of protection. Monitoring of networks, ethical hacking and data analysis is undertaken to
identify suspicious activity and potential exposures, allowing appropriate action to be taken.

Failure to retain and attract key employees

Nature: The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract, train and recruit sufficiently qualified
employees could affect our operations, financial position and growth.

Mitigation: We have a number of initiatives in place to provide an inclusive workplace and
establish an effective, engaged and empowered workforce. Our skills development activities
focus on having the right people in the right roles, building a strong pipeline of future leaders and
maintaining a competent workforce with deep functional expertise. Engaging with employees at
all levels allows everyone to connect, supporting decision making and continual improvement.

SMALL SHAREHOLDING SALE FACILITY



South32 Limited (ASX, JSE, LSE: S32) (South32) announces that it has established a small
shareholding sale facility (Sale Facility) for shareholders with holdings valued at less than A$500. The
Sale Facility enables eligible shareholders to sell their South32 shares without incurring any
brokerage or handling costs. This initiative is expected to reduce administration costs incurred by
South32.

The Sale Facility is open to shareholders on the South32 Australian register who hold less than
A$500 worth of shares and whose registered address is in Australia or New Zealand. Unless eligible
shareholders opt-out of participation in the Sale Facility, these shareholders will have their shares
sold on market and the proceeds remitted to them free from brokerage and handling fees.

As at 18 August 2016, there are 120,915 shareholders who would be eligible to participate in the
Sale Facility, representing 26.17% of total shareholders. The eligible shareholders hold 13,449,685
ordinary shares in South32, representing 0.25% of total capital.

Shareholders will have the ability to opt-out of participating in the Sale Facility and retain their
shareholding. For shareholders who participate in the Sale Facility, the sale price they receive for
their shares will be a volume-weighted average price of all shares sold under the Sale Facility.

A summary of the key dates in respect of the Sale Facility is as follows:

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

South32 significantly reduces costs, further strengthens its balance sheet and announces inaugural dividend

""In our first full year, the successful transition to our regional model, a series of restructuring initiatives and robust
operating performance delivered strong results. We set five production records and achieved guidance for the majority of
our upstream operations, generated controllable cost savings of US$386M and reduced capital expenditure by
US$306M.

""By optimising our operations and maintaining a core focus on value, we generated free cash flow of US$597M and
finished the year with net cash of US$312M. We will continue to unlock the potential of our portfolio, identify opportunities
and pursue investments where we see value, but will not compromise our strong balance sheet and investment grade
credit rating.

""Looking to FY17, we have maintained production guidance for the majority of our upstream operations and will stretch
performance to meet cost targets. Our functions are lean, with corporate costs now half the level envisaged at the time of
listing.

""12 months on, South32 is a much stronger company with significantly lower costs and a balance sheet that provides
flexibility. Against this backdrop, our Board resolved to pay an inaugural dividend of US 1 cent per share.""

2016 FINANCIAL YEAR SUMMARY

SAFETY

Our vision is to create a safe working environment where everyone goes home safe and well every day. Tragically, we
lost four of our colleagues in the 2016 financial year (FY16) and our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) increased
from 5.8 to 7.7 per million hours worked. Despite our efforts over many years, we have not eliminated significant
incidents and require a step change in performance. We are working hard to build an inclusive workplace with a strong
culture of care and accountability, where work is well-designed and we continuously improve and learn.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

The Group's strategy is simple, with three core elements designed to deliver sector leading total shareholder returns: the
optimisation of our existing operations; the conversion of high quality resources into reserves to unlock their potential; and
the identification and pursuit of investment opportunities beyond our portfolio. While volatile macro-economic conditions
posed a significant challenge to the industry, strict application of this strategy and an overarching focus on cash flow,
value and investment returns delivered strong results in the areas that we control. Specific performance highlights
included:

-   Free cash flow, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$597M and net cash of US$312M at 30 June 2016;
-   Record annual production at Australia Manganese (ore), Worsley Alumina, Brazil Alumina, Mozal Aluminium and
    Cannington (payable zinc), and robust performance at our other sites;
-   The successful restructuring of our operations and implementation of our regional model;                                            
-   A US$386M and US$306M reduction in controllable costs(9) and capital expenditure, respectively;
-   The creation of lean support functions and a reduction in corporate costs to approximately US$70M per annum from
    FY17, around half the level envisaged at the time of listing;
-   The completion of the Appin Area 9 (Illawarra Metallurgical Coal) and Premium Concentrate Ore (Australia
    Manganese) projects on or ahead of schedule, and below budget;
-   A significant reduction in the estimated capital cost for the development of the higher grade La Esmeralda Mineral
    Resource(10) at Cerro Matoso;
-   The progression of the Klipspruit Life Extension project at South Africa Energy Coal into the feasibility study stage,
    where the viability of a lower capital cost development option is being assessed;
-   Continuing to work with Eskom under the existing (cost plus) Coal Sales Agreement to progress a lower capital cost
    option to extend the life of the Khutala underground mine at South Africa Energy Coal;
-   Reaching agreement to mine the Eastern Leases and explore the Southern Areas at GEMCO, which have the
    potential to substantially extend the life of one of the world's largest and lowest cost manganese mines; and
-   The retention of our investment grade credit rating and the Board's resolution to pay an inaugural US 1 cent per
    share dividend.

In addition, we entered into an option agreement with Northern Shield Resources to become a partner in the Huckleberry
property in Northern Quebec, Canada. This agreement represents a low-cost entry into the Labrador Trough, a province
identified as being highly prospective for copper, nickel and platinum group elements.

EARNINGS

The Group's statutory loss of US$1.6B in the 2016 financial year (FY16) was significantly impacted by non-cash
impairment related charges recorded in the December 2015 half year totalling US$1.7B (post-tax US$1.7B). Consistent
with our accounting policies, various items are excluded from Underlying earnings including the aforementioned
impairments, major corporate restructures (US$63M pre-tax), demerger related set-up costs (US$60M pre-tax),
exchange rate gains associated with the restatement of monetary items (-US$43M pre-tax), the net benefit of
adjustments to closure and rehabilitation provisions for closed sites (-US$59M pre-tax), fair value losses on derivative
instruments (US$60M pre-tax), exchange rate gains associated with the Group's non-US dollar denominated debt and
cash (-US$30M pre-tax), exchange rate losses on tax balances (US$124M), and the tax benefit on all pre-tax earnings
adjustments (-US$178M).

The Group generated Underlying EBITDA of US$1.1B in FY16, for an operating margin of 21.5% and Underlying EBIT and
Underlying earnings of US$356M and US$138M, respectively. A deterioration in commodity markets was the primary driver
of the significant decline in profitability, reducing revenue by US$1.5B, net of price linked costs. In this context, the Group
would have recorded an Underlying EBIT loss if not for the substantial US$386M reduction in controllable costs. Detailed
earnings analysis is included.

CASH FLOW

Despite a 21% reduction in the average realised price of our commodities, we generated free cash flow from operations,
excluding equity accounted investments, of US$597M.

Capital expenditure, excluding equity accounted investments, was reduced by 39% or US$246M to US$383M. This
included:

-   Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including
    underground development), of US$351M; and

-   Major project capital expenditure of US$32M.

The purchase of intangibles and the capitalisation of exploration accounted for a further US$17M of expenditure.

The Appin Area 9 underground extension at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal was the Group's sole Major project in development
during FY16. The project was completed in the March 2016 quarter, 33% below its US$845M budget and three months
ahead of schedule.

Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of US$79M in FY16 included the Premium
Concentrate Ore (PC02) project at GEMCO (Australia Manganese) and the second phase of the Central Block
development project at the Wessels underground mine (South Africa Manganese). The PC02 project, which increased
Australia Manganese ore production capacity by 0.5Mt to 5.3Mtpa (100% basis), was delivered on schedule and under
budget in the June 2016 quarter. The second phase of the Central Block development project will enable underground
mining activity to relocate closer to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing cycle times. As a result of the fatality at
Wessels in June 2016 and the subsequent reprioritisation of activities, commissioning is now expected in the March
2017 quarter. A further US$1M in capitalised exploration expenditure associated with equity accounted investments was
incurred in FY16.
                            
Total capital expenditure(11), including equity accounted investments was US$480M in FY16.

A US$121M reduction in provisions was mostly associated with expenditure on closure and rehabilitation activities and a
stronger US dollar, while lower commodity and raw material prices led to a US$244M reduction in payables. In contrast,
a reduction in supply chain inventory and receivables benefited cash flow by US$191M and US$163M, respectively, as
average days debtors declined to 19 days (from 21 days at 31 December 2015). The resolution of two legacy tax
disputes also contributed US$46M to cash flow in the December 2015 half year.

We received dividends totalling US$33M during FY16, including US$19M from our equity accounted manganese
investments and US$14M from our investment in Mineração Rio do Norte S.A. A further US$38M was received from our
equity accounted manganese investments in the June 2016 half year as an overdraft facility owing to South32 was
repaid.

BALANCE SHEET
Strong operating cash flow and the sustainable decapitalisation of our business, via more focussed investment, further
strengthened the Group's Balance Sheet and established a solid foundation from which to grow return on invested
capital (ROIC). As at 30 June 2016, the Group's net cash position was US$312M, a significant improvement on opening
net debt of US$402M. The restructuring of a legacy financing arrangement (US$90M) in the December 2015 half year
and a US$29M reduction in finance leases primarily associated with the appreciation of the US dollar contributed to the
US$714M improvement in net cash. Additional liquidity is available via an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit facility.

DIVIDENDS

The Board has resolved to pay an inaugural final dividend of US 1 cent per share in respect of FY16. The dividend will
not be franked for Australian taxation purposes given the current level of profitability and the recognition of additional
deductions as part of the demerger related tax reset process.

This dividend is paid in line with South32's policy to distribute a minimum 40% of Underlying earnings as dividends to its
shareholders following each six-month reporting period, having regard to South32's first two priorities for cash flow, being
a commitment to maintain safe and reliable operations and an investment grade credit rating through the cycle.

SHARE SALE FACILITY

South32 announces the establishment of a small shareholding sale facility (Sale Facility) for shareholders on its
Australian register with holdings valued at less than A$500 and whose registered address is in Australia or New Zealand.
The Sale Facility enables eligible shareholders to sell their shares in South32 without incurring any brokerage or
handling costs. Further details are provided in a separate announcement on 25 August 2016. Eligible shareholders will
also receive separate correspondence providing details of the Sale Facility.

This initiative is expected to reduce annual administration costs given the large number of shareholders with small
holdings. Eligible shareholders will be entitled to the FY16 final dividend.

OUTLOOK

PRODUCTION

Production guidance for FY17 is unchanged for the majority of our upstream operations, although a downward revision is
noted for Cannington. FY18 production guidance is provided for the first time.

Worsley Alumina saleable alumina production guidance is largely unchanged with the refinery expected to produce at its
nameplate capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis) across FY17 and FY18. Similarly, Brazil Alumina saleable production
guidance for FY17 is unchanged at 1.32Mt before a small increase in production is expected in FY18.

At South Africa Energy Coal, total coal production guidance for FY17 is maintained at approximately 31Mt, albeit with a
higher proportion of domestic sales. A small decrease in production is expected in FY18. At Illawarra Metallurgical Coal,
saleable coal production guidance is unchanged at 9.5Mt for FY17, with an increase in longwall utilisation and cutting rates
anticipated following the completion of the Appin Area 9 project in January 2016. Production is expected to remain largely
unchanged in FY18.

Payable nickel production guidance for Cerro Matoso remains unchanged at approximately 36kt for FY17. A small decrease in
                                                                                              
production is expected in FY18. Access to the higher grade La Esmeralda Mineral Resource(10) will be facilitated by the
development of a low cost river crossing with payable nickel production expected to rise temporarily to more than 40ktpa in
FY19 and FY20.

Consistent with prior guidance and in response to challenging market conditions, Australia Manganese is expected to operate
below recently expanded capacity of 5.3Mwmt (100% basis), with ore production of 3.1Mwmt projected for each of FY17 and
FY18. Production guidance is not provided for South Africa Manganese as our plans will be adjusted to reflect customer
demand given our focus on value over volume.

Following the completion of our first annual planning cycle, we have optimised the longer term mine plan at Cannington,
with silver and lead production guidance for FY17 reduced by 2% and 3%, respectively, and zinc production guidance
increased by 3%. This plan, which seeks to increase total silver, lead and zinc extraction across the remaining years of
the underground operation and reduce geotechnical risk by resequencing stope design, results in a further 10-13%
reduction in payable metal production in FY18.

High rates of current efficiency have been achieved at our African aluminium smelters. The impact of electricity
load-shedding events was lower than anticipated in FY16 and production will continue to be influenced by the duration
and regularity of these outages. We are yet to restart production in the 22 pots that were taken offline at South Africa
Aluminium in September 2015 in response to challenging market conditions (equivalent to 3% of total production).

At Metalloys (South Africa Manganese), saleable manganese alloy production has been adjusted to reflect market
demand, with one of four furnaces to remain in operation until market conditions improve. At TEMCO (Australia
Manganese), power shortages in FY16 led to the suspension of two of four furnaces. These furnaces returned to full
production in July 2016.

Consistent with our focus on value over volume, we will continue to take decisive action should superior value and cash
flow be attainable by varying the output of any operation.

COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

We reduced controllable costs by US$386M and capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, by 40% to
US$462M in FY16.

Cost targets

In February 2016, we announced major restructuring initiatives at a number of our operations, including Worsley
Alumina, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Australia Manganese (GEMCO), South Africa Manganese and Cerro Matoso.
These restructuring activities have been completed, while additional cost savings were also embedded within our support
functions.

As a result, we are well positioned to achieve the majority of our FY17 operational cost targets, which have been
adjusted to reflect revised commodity price and foreign exchange rate assumptions. In this regard, our cost target for
South Africa Manganese is unlikely to be achieved before the June 2017 half year following the fatality at Wessels in
June 2016 and the subsequent reprioritisation of activities in the underground mine. Cost targets for South Africa Energy
Coal and Cannington are provided for the first time. Forecast corporate costs of approximately US$70M per annum from
FY17 are almost 50% lower than envisaged at the time of listing.

(b)   New FY17 Operating unit cost targets, including Sustaining capital expenditure, are predicated on revised commodity price and foreign exchange
      rate assumptions (notes). The target for South Africa Manganese reflects the expected June 2017 half year run-
      rate as activity has been reprioritised following a fatality at the Wessels underground mine in June 2016. New Operating unit cost targets,
      including Sustaining capital expenditure, based upon previously disclosed commodity price and foreign exchange rate assumptions would be:
      Worsley Alumina US$194/t, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal US$66/t, Australia Manganese ore US$1.56/dmtu, South Africa Manganese US$1.93/dmtu
      and Cerro Matoso US$3.68/lb.
(c)   Shows US dollar per tonne of ore processed. Periodic movements in finished product inventory may impact operating unit cost as related marketing
      costs and treatment and refining charges may change.

Capital expenditure

We expect capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, to remain largely unchanged in FY17 at
approximately US$450M(17). Major project expenditure is not anticipated, aside from study costs and land acquisitions
associated with our South Africa Energy Coal life extension options, primarily Klipspruit. Looking to FY18, sustaining
capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, is expected to remain largely unchanged from FY17, while
the rate of expenditure associated with Major projects will remain dependent on the status of our development options.
The Klipspruit Life Extension is the sole Major project scheduled for approval before the end of FY18, noting that the low
cost La Esmeralda development at Cerro Matoso does not fall into this category.

Exploration expenditure

During the year we signed an option agreement with Northern Shield Resources to become a partner in the Huckleberry
property in Northern Quebec, Canada. This agreement represents a low-cost entry into the Labrador Trough, a province
identified as being highly prospective for copper, nickel and platinum group elements. We can earn a 50% interest in the
property by funding C$2.5M of exploration spend and a further 20% interest by funding an additional C$2.5M. Northern
Shield's interest will be free carried to the completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study on the
property.

Modest investment in greenfield exploration is currently planned for FY17, although the rate of expenditure will rise
should additional opportunities be identified. Exploration expenditure of approximately US$12M is expected within our
existing footprint.

Restructuring charges

Once-off redundancy and restructuring charges of US$51M were recognised in FY16 as previously announced
operational initiatives were completed. Following a review of our functional support structures in the June 2016 quarter, a
further US$12M of redundancy and restructuring charges were recognised prior to the end of the financial year. The
majority of these once-off charges have been paid, with the remaining US$28M to be paid in FY17. US$8M of once-off
redundancy and restructuring charges were recognised and paid by Equity Accounted Investments in FY16.

These once-off charges are excluded from the Group's Underlying measures.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION

Depreciation and amortisation, excluding equity accounted investments, is expected to decrease by US$55M to
US$720M in FY17 following the recognition of non-cash impairment charges in FY16. Similarly, depreciation and
amortisation for equity accounted investments is expected to decline by US$55M to US$70M in FY17.

TAX EXPENSE

The Group's Underlying effective tax rate (Underlying ETR) primarily reflects the geographic distribution of the Group's
profit. The corporate tax rates applicable to the Group include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 40%; and
Brazil 34%. It should also be recognised that permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group's                
Underlying ETR(18) when commodity prices and profit margins are compressed. Based on current projections, the Group
is not expected to generate franking credits in FY17.

Prices, foreign exchange and inflation

A 21% reduction in the average realised price of our commodities reduced revenue by US$1.6B. Weaker aluminium and
alumina prices accounted for US$918M of this impact. Lower manganese ore and alloy, metallurgical and energy coal, and
nickel prices reduced revenue by a further US$268M, US$262M, and US$203M, respectively.

The pronounced decline in commodity markets led to a US$188M reduction in price linked costs, although this was largely
offset by general inflation which increased costs by US$141M. The inflationary impact was most pronounced at our African
operations, which accounted for 65% of the total variance.

The general strengthening of the US dollar against a basket of producer currencies provided some relief, increasing
Underlying EBIT by US$623M.

Volume

We delivered record annual production at Australia Manganese (ore), Worsley Alumina, Brazil Alumina, Mozal
Aluminium and Cannington (payable zinc), and robust performance at our other sites. In this context, the US$258M
volume related decline in revenue reflects the proactive decisions we took to temporarily suspend and then rebase
production at South Africa Manganese, optimise production at South Africa Energy Coal for cash flow and margin, and
extend the closure of loss making smelting activities at Brazil Alumina.

Controllable cost reduction

We reduced controllable costs by a substantial US$386M in FY16, including equity accounted investments. These
savings were achieved by increasing labour productivity, lowering the utilisation of and rates for contractors and
consultants, reducing procurement, freight and logistics costs, and optimising our energy footprint. This included a US$65M

(a)   Corporate and other includes Corporate cost savings of approximately US$65M.           

The temporary suspension and rebasing of production at South Africa Manganese contributed to the reduction in
controllable costs, however this was broadly offset by an increase in costs within the income statement to reflect the
associated reduction of inventory.

Other items

Other items increased Underlying EBIT by a net US$142M. Depreciation and amortisation reduced by US$120M primarily
due to impairments recorded in the December 2015 half year at Australia Manganese, South Africa Energy Coal, South
Africa Manganese and Brazil Alumina.

The suspension of aluminium smelting at Brazil Alumina reduced costs by US$57M, although this was largely offset by a
net US$36M reduction in the contribution of power sales. As previously indicated, a US$24M (onerous contract) provision
has been recorded in the June 2016 half year to reflect the anticipated future losses associated with the remaining
Eletronorte power supply commitments across FY17 and FY18.

Interest and tax associated with equity accounted investments

The Group's manganese operations are jointly controlled by South32 (60% share) and Anglo American (40% share). The
Underlying interest and taxation expense associated with these equity accounted investments declined by US$64M in FY16
to US$41M.

Net finance costs

The Group incurred Underlying net finance costs, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$125M in FY16. This
largely reflects the unwinding of the discount applied to closure and rehabilitation provisions (US$96M), and finance lease
charges (US$37M), primarily at Worsley Alumina.

Taxation expense

The Group's underlying income tax expense, which excludes taxation associated with equity accounted investments,
was US$93M for an Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) of 36.6%. The tax expense for equity accounted investments was
US$13M, including royalty related taxation. The GEMCO (Australia Manganese) Northern Territory royalty, as a profits
based tax, gives rise to royalty related taxation of US$9M in equity accounted investments.

WORSLEY ALUMINA
(86% SHARE)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 142kt (or
4%) to 4.0Mt in FY16 as an uplift in calciner availability
underpinned record performance. This is the first time that
the refinery has operated at its expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa
(100% basis) across a full year and was achieved despite a
power outage and associated process instability that was
caused by water ingress during a severe storm in April 2016.

Saleable alumina production guidance is largely unchanged
with the refinery expected to produce at its nameplate
capacity of 4.6Mt (100% basis) across FY17 and FY18.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 16% to US$210/t in FY16
as we benefitted from a stronger US dollar, reduced
employee and contractor numbers by 24%, embedded
procurement savings, including lower energy input costs, and
restructured our teams to create discrete mining and refining
operations with greater focus.

Previously announced restructuring initiatives have been
completed and we expect operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure, to decline to US$204/t in
FY17 (FY16: US$221/t). This reflects planned Sustaining
capital expenditure of US$56M as additional investment is
directed towards water infrastructure. Revised exchange rate
and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are
detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$132M in FY16 to US$42M.
Lower realised alumina prices (-US$249M, net of price-linked
costs), a favourable movement in foreign exchange rate
markets (+US$71M) and a US$41M reduction in controllable
costs had the most significant influence on financial
performance.

Capital expenditure decreased by 29% to US$44M in FY16.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$17M were incurred in FY16 and have
been excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings
measures.

SOUTH AFRICA ALUMINIUM
(100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production was largely
unchanged in FY16 as the impact of electricity load-shedding
events was lower than anticipated, particularly in the
December 2015 half year. While high rates of current
efficiency are being achieved within the potlines, production
will continue to be influenced by the duration and regularity of
load-shedding events. We are yet to restart production in the
22 pots that were taken offline in September 2015 in
response to market conditions.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 19% to US$1,430/t in
FY16, reflecting a stronger US dollar, lower aluminium price-
linked power costs and weaker raw material prices. Additional
cost savings were realised as the smelter continued to
improve its energy efficiency. A total of 183 pots were relined
across FY16 at a cost of approximately US$191k per pot
(FY15: 136 pots at US$245k per pot). 72 pots are scheduled
to be relined in FY17.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the
cost profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by
power and raw material inputs, given the operation's high
variable cost base. Hillside sources power from Eskom under
long-term contracts. The price of electricity supplied to
potlines 1 and 2 is linked to the LME aluminium price and the

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$168M in FY16 to
US$82M. The combination of lower realised aluminium prices
and premia reduced Underlying EBIT by US$258M, net of

favourable movement in foreign exchange rates (+US$66M)
and an increase in sales volumes (+US$40M).

Capital expenditure decreased by 46% to US$19M in
FY16.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$2M were incurred in FY16 and have been
excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings measures.

MOZAL ALUMINIUM
(47.1% SHARE)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium achieved record annual production of
266kt in FY16 as a reduction in load-shedding events
complemented an increase in potline current efficiency.
While high rates of current efficiency are being achieved,
production will continue to be influenced by the duration and
regularity of load-shedding events.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 12% to US$1,559/t in FY16,
reflecting a stronger US dollar and weaker raw materials
prices. Planned relining activity increased in FY16 with 109
pots relined at a cost of US$207k per pot (FY15: 91 pots at
US$231k per pot). 118 pots are scheduled to be relined in
FY17.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the
cost profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by
power and raw material inputs, given the operation's high
variable cost base. Mozal Aluminium utilises hydroelectric
power under a long-term contract that is generated by
Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power
into the South African grid to Eskom and Mozal Aluminium
sources the power via the Mozambique Transmission
Company (Motraco).

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$112M in FY16 to US$0M.
The combination of lower realised aluminium prices and
premia reduced Underlying EBIT by US$115M, net of
price-linked costs, while lower sales volumes reduced
Underlying EBIT by a further US$47M. These impacts were
partially offset by a favourable movement in foreign exchange
rate markets (+US$46M).

Capital expenditure decreased by 50% to US$7M in FY16.

BRAZIL ALUMINA
(ALUMINA 36% SHARE, ALUMINIUM
40% SHARE)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable alumina production increased by 7kt
to a record 1,335kt in FY16. Production guidance for FY17 is
unchanged at 1,320kt. A small increase in production is
expected in FY18 to 1,350kt.

Aluminium production was first curtailed in July 2013 and the
suspension of all smelting activity was announced in March
2015. We have forward sold power until the end of CY17 and
have terminated our supply contract with Eletronorte.

Costs

Alumina operating unit costs at the non-operated refinery
decreased by 12% to US$189/t in FY16 as the US dollar
strengthened and raw material costs declined.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$103M in FY16 to
US$78M. A reduction in realised alumina prices (-US$80M,
net of price-linked costs) and a declining contribution from 
powersales (-US$36M) was partially offset by a favourable
movement in foreign exchange rate markets (+US$29M).

As a result of our decision to terminate the contract with
Eletronorte, power sales are not expected to contribute to
Underlying EBIT beyond FY16. In this context, a US$24M
(onerous contract) provision has been recorded in the June
2016 half year to reflect anticipated future losses associated
with the remaining Eletronorte power supply commitments
across FY17 and FY18.

Unhedged power sales, inclusive of this provision,
contributed BRL214M to Underlying EBIT in FY16 (FY15:
BRL300M). The cumulative cash impact will change by up to
BRL40M for every +/-US10c/lb movement in the aluminium
price above a floor of US$0.66/lb

Capital expenditure at the refinery increased by 50% to
US$12M in FY16.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL
(92% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by
2.6Mt (or 8%) to 31.7Mt in FY16. Lower production resulted
from the planned closure of the opencast mine at Khutala
and a reduction in contractor activity at the Wolvekrans
Middelburg Complex, consistent with our focus on value over
volume.

Total coal production guidance for FY17 is maintained at
approximately 30.9Mt, with a higher proportion of domestic
sales. In FY18, a small decrease in production is expected to
29.8Mt.

The Klipspruit Life Extension project proceeded into the
feasibility study stage in FY16, where the viability of a
lower capital cost development option is being assessed.
In addition, we continue to work with Eskom under the
existing (cost plus) Coal Sales Agreement to progress a
lower capital cost option to extend the life of the Khutala
underground mine.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 13% to US$26/t in FY16
due to a stronger US dollar and a significant improvement in
labour productivity. In this context, the insourcing of activity
underpinned a 38% reduction in contractor numbers when
compared with the average headcount in FY15, while
employee numbers were also reduced by 14%.

Operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure,
are expected to decline only marginally to US$26/t in FY17
(FY16: US$27/t) despite the assumed weakening of the
South African Rand given the relatively high proportion of
fixed costs and lower production. In this context, Sustaining
capital expenditure of US$72M is planned. Exchange rate
and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are
detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT remained largely unchanged in FY16 at
US$95M. A reduction in contractor and labour costs
increased Underlying EBIT by US$66M while a stronger US
dollar delivered a further US$112M net benefit. Non-cash
charges declined by US$95M as depreciation and
amortisation was rebased following the recognition of
impairments in FY15 and the December 2015 half year. In
contrast, lower realised prices reduced Underlying EBIT by
US$117M, net of price-linked costs.

Capital expenditure decreased by 36% to US$63M in FY16
following the purchase of mobile equipment in the prior
period.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$15M were incurred in FY16 and have
been excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings
measures.

ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL
(100%)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by
560kt (or 6%) to 8.4Mt in FY16 as challenging geological
conditions were encountered at the Appin and Dendrobium
mines in the first six months of the reporting period. Three
planned longwall moves were also completed during the
year.

The Appin Area 9 project was completed in January 2016,
ahead of schedule and below budget, significantly increasing
longwall utilisation and cutting rates. Saleable coal production
guidance is unchanged at 9.5Mt for FY17 and this rate of
production is expected to be maintained in FY18. Two
longwall moves and one step around are planned for FY17,
with the step around scheduled for the September 2016
quarter and the two longwall moves for the March 2017
quarter.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 18% to US$61/t in FY16
as the US dollar strengthened and we reorganised the
operation into two teams, surface processing and logistics,
and underground mining, thereby removing layers of
management and functional support while creating greater
focus. Employee and contractor numbers declined by 17%.

Previously announced restructuring initiatives have been
completed and we expect operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure, to decline to US$71/t in FY17
(FY16: US$80/t). This reflects planned Sustaining capital
expenditure of US$117M, including underground
development of approximately US$66M. Revised exchange
rate and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are
detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$31M in FY16 to a loss of
US$61M. Lower realised coal prices (-US$128M, net of
price-linked costs) and a decline in sales volumes
(-US$36M) were partially offset by a US$67M reduction in
controllable costs and the benefit of a stronger US dollar
(+US$71M).

Capital expenditure decreased by 40% to US$185M in FY16
with the completion of the Appin Area 9 project. Underground
development of US$106M included US$64M for Appin Area 9.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$12M were incurred in FY16 and have
been excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings
measures.

AUSTRALIA MANGANESE
(60% SHARE)

Volumes
Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by
129kwmt (or 4%) to a record 3.1Mwmt in FY16 as
concentrator performance improved and the Premium
Concentrate Ore (PCO2) project was completed. The project,
which increased GEMCO's production capacity by 500kwmt,
was completed 17% under budget and ahead of schedule in
the June 2016 quarter.

Consistent with prior guidance and in response to challenging
market conditions, Australia Manganese is expected to
operate below recently expanded capacity of 5.3Mwmt
(100% basis), with ore production of 3.1Mwmt projected for
each of FY17 and FY18.

We obtained consent from the Anindilyakwa Land Council to
access the Eastern Leases and the Southern Areas at
GEMCO in June 2016. The Eastern Leases will enable us to
mine new areas within our existing operating footprint.
Access to the Southern Areas, adjacent to the existing
operations, will substantially increase our exploration footprint
at this highly prospective manganese operation.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 34kt
(or 20%) to 133kt in FY16 as power shortages led to the
suspension of two of four furnaces. The operation returned to
full production in July 2016.

Costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs decreased by 16%
to US$1.41/dmtu in FY16 as the US dollar strengthened and
we reduced GEMCO employee and contractor numbers by
4%. Associated costs savings more than offset an increase in
the strip ratio from 3.0 to 3.3.

Previously announced restructuring initiatives have been
completed and we expect FOB operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure, to decline to US$1.66/dmtu in
FY17 (FY16: US$1.88/dmtu FOB), despite an expected
increase in the strip ratio to 3.7. This reflects planned
Sustaining capital expenditure of US$31M. Revised
exchange rate and price assumptions for our FY17 unit cost
targets are detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$58M in FY16 to US$65M.
Lower manganese ore and alloy prices reduced Underlying
EBIT by US$163M, net of price-linked costs, although this
was partially offset by a stronger US dollar, which increased
Underlying EBIT by US$33M.

Capital expenditure decreased by US$30M to US$68M in
FY16 and included a US$28M investment to complete the
PC02 project.

Due to natural attrition and the decision not to recruit roles
associated with the PC02 project, the reduction in employee
and contractor numbers resulted in no redundancy costs at
GEMCO in FY16.

SOUTH AFRICA MANGANESE
(ORE 44.4% SHARE, ALLOY 60% SHARE)

Volumes
South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased
by 563kwmt (or 25%) to 1.7Mwmt in FY16 following the
decision to initially suspend mining activity in November 2015
and then restructure the operation in response to challenging
market conditions. Mining recommenced at both Wessels
and Mamatwan in the March 2016 quarter, ramping-up to an
optimised 2.9Mwmt pa (100% basis) production rate.

The second phase of the Central Block development project
will enable underground mining activity to relocate closer to
critical infrastructure, thereby reducing cycle times. As a
result of the fatality at the Wessels underground mine in June
2016 and the subsequent reprioritisation of activities,
commissioning is now expected in the March 2017 quarter.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 155kt
(or 63%) to 91kt in FY16 following the decision to suspend
three of the four high-carbon ferromanganese furnaces at
Metalloys in May 2015. Metalloys will continue to operate one
of four furnaces until market conditions improve.

Costs

FOB manganese ore operating unit costs decreased by 3%
to US$1.91/dmtu in FY16 as the US dollar strengthened,
production volumes were rebased and employee and
contractor numbers were reduced by 41%.

Previously announced restructuring initiatives have been
completed and we expect FOB operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure, to decline to US$1.71/dmtu in
the June 2017 half year (FY16: US$2.01/dmtu FOB). This
reflects planned Sustaining capital expenditure of US$7M.

The expected six month delay in achieving our cost target
reflects the reprioritisation of activities at the Wessels
underground mine following the fatality that occurred in
June 2016. Revised exchange rate and price assumptions
for our FY17 unit cost targets are detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$27M in FY16 to a loss of
US$47M as lower realised manganese ore and alloy prices
reduced Underlying EBIT by US$69M, net of price-linked
costs. Lower sales volumes reduced Underlying EBIT by a
further US$112M, although this impact was more than offset
by a reduction in costs associated with the temporary
suspension of operations (+US$111M) and a stronger US
dollar (+US$44M).

Capital expenditure decreased significantly to US$11M in FY16.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$8M were incurred in FY16 and have been
excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings measures.

CERRO MATOSO
(99.9% SHARE)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production decreased by 3.6kt
(or 9%) to 36.8kt in FY16. Lower production resulted from a
decline in the average ore grade, consistent with the mine
plan.

Payable nickel production guidance remains unchanged at
approximately 36.0kt for FY17. A small decrease in
production is expected in FY18, however access to the                                     
higher grade La Esmeralda Mineral Resource(10) is expected
to be facilitated by the development of a low cost river
crossing which should see payable nickel production rise
temporarily to more than 40kt in FY19 and FY20.

Costs

Operating unit costs decreased by 21% to US$4.08/lb in
FY16. This largely reflected the benefit of a stronger US
dollar, an 18% reduction in employee and contractor
numbers, and a decrease in energy usage and rates.

Previously announced restructuring initiatives have been
completed and we expect operating unit costs, including
Sustaining capital expenditure, to decline to US$3.87/lb in
FY17 (FY16: US$4.30/lb). This reflects planned Sustaining
capital expenditure of US$15M and a new collective labour
agreement which provides certainty for the next three years.
Revised exchange rate and price assumptions for our FY17
unit cost targets are detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$146M in FY16 to a loss of
US$88M due to weaker realised prices (-US$192M, net of
price-linked costs) and a decline in sales volumes
(-US$57M). These impacts were partially offset by a
reduction in controllable costs (+US$36M) and a stronger US
dollar (+US$84M).

Capital expenditure of US$18M was 50% lower than the prior period.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$4M were incurred in FY16 and have been
excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings measures.

CANNINGTON
(100% SHARE)

Volumes

Payable silver and lead production decreased by 5%, to
21.39Moz and 173.2kt respectively, in FY16 due to a
temporary reduction in mill throughput. Conversely, an
increase in the average zinc ore grade and recoveries
resulted in record annual zinc production of 79.0kt (+9%).

Following the completion of our first annual planning cycle,
we have optimised the longer term mine plan at Cannington,
with silver and lead production guidance for FY17 reduced by
2% and 3%, respectively, and zinc production guidance
increased by 3%. This plan, which seeks to increase total
silver, lead and zinc extraction across the remaining years of
the underground operation and reduce geotechnical risk by
resequencing stope design, results in a further 10-13%
reduction in payable metal production in FY18 (to 16.55Moz
for silver, 147kt for lead and 72kt for zinc).

We have also concluded that an investment decision to
potentially extend the life of the Cannington mine will not be
required before the end of this decade.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 15% to US$145/t of ore
processed in FY16 as the US dollar strengthened, employee
and contractor numbers were reduced by 17% and
procurement savings, including lower contractor rates, were
embedded.

We expect operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital
expenditure, to decline to US$138/t of ore processed in FY17
(FY16: US$153/t). This reflects planned Sustaining capital
expenditure of US$45M. Exchange rate and price
assumptions for our FY17 unit cost targets are detailed.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$13M in FY16 to
US$274M. Lower average realised prices reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$89M, net of price-linked costs,
although this impact was offset by a US$47M reduction in
controllable costs and a US$41M benefit associated with the
stronger US dollar.

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of
Cannington concentrates reduced Underlying EBIT by
US$11M in FY16 (-US$19M in the December 2015 half year;
-US$43M in FY15). Outstanding concentrate sales
(containing 3.1Moz of silver, 30.9kt of lead and 6.4kt of zinc)
were revalued at 30 June 2016. The final price of these sales
will be determined in the first half of FY17.

Capital expenditure of US$27M was 31% lower than the prior
period.

NOTES
(1)   The pro forma and statutory financial information reflects continuing operations and therefore excludes the contribution of the New Mexico Coal asset.

(2)   Percentage change has not been disclosed for statutory results on the basis that the variances between FY16 and FY15 are substantially different
      due to the impact of the Internal Restructure prior to demerger.

(3)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products.

(4)   FY16 basic earnings per share is calculated as Profit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations divided by the weighted average number of
      shares for FY16 (5,324 million). FY16 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as Underlying earnings divided by the weighted average
      number of shares for FY16. Pro forma FY15 basic earnings per share is calculated as pro forma Profit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations
      divided by the number of shares on issue at 30 June 2015 (5,324 million). Pro forma FY15 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as pro
      forma Underlying earnings divided by the number of shares on issue at 30 June 2015.

(5)   Underlying EBIT is profit from continuing operations before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments.
      Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of South32's share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is
      Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after taxation and earnings adjustment items. Underlying
      earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and
      assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and operational management are
      assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following items are
      adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:

           -     Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;

           -     Impairment losses/reversals;

           -     Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;

           -     Fair value gain/loss on derivative instruments;

           -     Major corporate restructures; and

           -     The income tax impact of the above items.

      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to
      determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in the Financial Information.

(6)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(7)   Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(8)   Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as Underlying EBIT less the
      discount on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the Group's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR), divided by the sum
      of fixed assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and impairments) and inventories. Manganese is included in the calculation on a proportional
      consolidation basis.

(9)   Controllable costs are measured on a cash basis (including equity accounted investments) and exclude significant items, inter-segment sales, foreign
      exchange rate movements, country specific inflation, price-linked costs and discontinued/suspended operations. Any controllable cost movement is
      defined in absolute terms compared to FY15 and is not a measure of unit cost performance.

(10)  La Esmeralda comprises 9.4Mt of Mineral Resources of the total reported Mineral Resources for FY16 which is provided in this report. This is made
      up of 74% Measured Mineral Resources and 26% Indicated Mineral Resources at an average grade of 1.59% Ni. The project is based on a
      completed Feasibility Study demonstrating the project is economically viable. La Esmeralda has recently been granted regulatory environmental
      approvals. The information that relates to the FY16 Cerro Matoso Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources (inclusive of Ore Reserves) is reported in
      accordance with the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves' ('The JORC Code, 2012 Edition')
      in this report. The information related to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves is based on information compiled by Ivan Espitia (MAusIMM) and
      Nelson Monterroza (MAusIMM) respectively. The above-mentioned persons are full-time employees of South32 Limited and have the required
      qualifications and experience to qualify as Competent Persons for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves as defined in the 2012 Edition of the JORC
      Code. The Competent Persons verify that this report is based on and fairly reflects the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves information in the report
      and consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on the information in the form and context in which it appears. The Mineral Resources
      and Ore Reserves breakdown by classification are contained on page 49 for Cerro Matoso. All tonnes and grade information has been rounded,
      hence small differences may be present in the totals. Tonnages are reported on a dry basis in millions of tonnes (Mt).
 
(11)  Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure
      comprises Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB),
      Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.
 
(12)  South32's ownership share of operations are as follows: Worsley Alumina (86%), South Africa Aluminium (100%), Mozal Aluminium (47.1% share),
      Brazil Alumina (Alumina 36% share, Aluminium 40% share), South Africa Energy Coal (92% share), Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100%), Australia
      Manganese (60% share), South Africa Manganese (60% share), Cerro Matoso (99.9% share), and Cannington (100%).
 
(13)  South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until employee share ownership plan (ESOP) and broad-based black economic
      empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are repaid.
 
(14)  Operating unit cost, including Sustaining capital expenditure is operating cost plus Sustaining capital expenditure divided by sales. Operating cost is
      Revenue less Underlying EBITDA. Additional manganese disclosures are included on pages 23 and 24.
 
(15)  Prior projected Operating unit cost guidance, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and prior Sustaining capital expenditure guidance, include
      royalties (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and are predicated on: an alumina price of US$255/t; an average
      blended coal price of US$65/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$2.00/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of
      US$3.75/lb; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.68; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.12; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,170; all of which reflected
      forward markets at the end of H1 FY16 or our internal expectations.
 
(16)  New projected Operating unit cost targets, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and Sustaining capital expenditure guidance, include royalties
      (where appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and are predicated on: an alumina price of US$259/t; an average blended coal
      price of US$83/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$3.23/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$3.95/lb; a
      thermal coal price of US$54/t (API4) for South Africa Energy Coal; a silver price of US$17.50/troy oz; a lead price of US$1,723/t; a zinc price of
      US$1,907/t; an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 16.57; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,025; all of which reflect
      forward markets as at May 2016 or our internal expectations.

(17)  FY17 Capital expenditure guidance is predicated on: an AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.72; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 16.57; and a USD:COP
      exchange rate of 3,025; all of which reflect forward markets as at May 2016 or our internal expectations.
 
(18)  Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) is Underlying income tax expense (pro forma Underlying income tax expense for FY15) excluding royalty related
      taxation divided by Underlying profit before tax (pro forma Underlying profit before tax for FY15); both the numerator and denominator exclude equity
      accounted investments.
 
(19)  Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the current period's sales volume. Price-linked costs
      variance reflects the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market traded
      consumables. Foreign exchange reflects the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume variance
      reflects the revenue impact of sales volume changes, based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance represents the
      impact from changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base, including the variable cost impact of production volume changes on
      expenditure, and period on period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance excludes earnings adjustments including significant items.
 
(20)  Underlying net finance cost and Underlying taxation expense are actual FY16 results, not year-on-year variances.
 
(21)  Third party product sold comprises US$264 million for aluminium (pro forma FY15: US$394 million), US$59 million for alumina (pro forma FY15:
      US$147 million), US$72 million for coal (pro forma FY15: US$88 million), US$90 million for freight services (pro forma FY15: US$40 million) and
      US$100 million for aluminium raw materials (pro forma FY15: US$126 million). Underlying EBIT on third party products comprise US$3 million for
      aluminium (pro forma FY15: US$1 million), (US$3) million for alumina (pro forma FY15: US$22 million), US$5 million for coal (pro forma FY15:
      US$1 million), US$1 million for freight services (pro forma FY15: US$ nil) and US$ nil for aluminium raw materials (pro forma FY15: US$4 million).

SOUTH32 FINANCIAL INFORMATION
For the year ended 30 June 2016

BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial information included in this document for the year ended 30 June 2016 is unaudited. The financial
information does not constitute the South32 Group's full financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016, which will
be approved by the Board, reported on by the auditors, and filed with the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission. The South32 Group's full financial statements will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian
Accounting Standards Board. Unless otherwise stated, the comparative figures for the financial year ended 30 June
2015 are from the accounts of South32 Limited.

Effective 15 May 2015, BHP Billiton shares ceased trading with an entitlement to South32 shares. Economic separation
and distribution of South32 shares to shareholders became effective from 25 May 2015. Prior to the demerger, the
South32 Group and the BHP Billiton Group were required to undertake a number of internal share and asset transfers in                                                                 
connection with the corporate restructure (Internal Restructure)(22). As required, and unless otherwise stated, comparative
statutory financial information for the South32 Group has been presented for the 2015 financial year (FY15). The
South32 Group's comparative statutory financial information only includes the results of the current South32 Group
operations (also referred to as ""operations"") from their date of acquisition during the financial year as part of the Internal
Restructure. The exception is Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, which was part of the South32 Group at 1 July 2014 and the
results of New Mexico Coal for the period 1 July 2014 to 27 October 2014, being the date that it ceased to be part of the
South32 Group as a result of the Internal Restructure. Accordingly, as a result of the Internal Restructure, the
comparative statutory financial information for FY15 does not reflect the performance of the South32 Group as it is
currently structured.

All amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated. The South32 Group's presentation currency and the
functional currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the principal currency of the economic
environment in which it operates.

Comparative figures have been prepared on the same basis as the current period figures. Amounts in this financial
information have, unless otherwise indicated, been rounded to the nearest million dollars (US$M).

SEGMENT INFORMATION

(a) Description of segments

The operating segments (also referred to as ""operations""), are organised and managed separately according to the
nature of products produced. The members of the executive management team (the ""chief operating decision maker"")
and the Board of Directors monitor the segment results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource
allocation and performance assessment. The segment information for the manganese operations are presented on a
proportional consolidation basis, which is the measure used by South32's management to assess their performance.

The principal activities of each operating segment as the South32 Group is currently structured are summarised as
follows:

Operating segment                   Principal activities
Worsley Alumina                     Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia
South Africa Aluminium              Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay
Brazil Alumina                      Alumina refinery in Brazil
Mozal Aluminium                     Aluminium smelter in Mozambique
South Africa Energy Coal            Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South
                                    Africa
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal        Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales
Australia Manganese                 Integrated producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and manganese alloys
                                    in Tasmania
South Africa Manganese              Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa
Cerro Matoso                        Integrated laterite ferronickel mining and smelting complex in Colombia
Cannington                          Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland

All operations are operated or jointly operated by South32 except Alumar (which forms part of Brazil Alumina), which is
operated by Alcoa.

(b) Segment results

Segment performance is measured on Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBIT is profit before net
finance cost, taxation and other earnings adjustment items including impairments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying
EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation. A reconciliation of Underlying EBIT, Underlying EBITDA and the South32
Group's consolidated profit after taxation from continuing operations is set out below. Segment revenue is measured
on the same basis as in the consolidated income statement.

Revenue is not reduced for royalties and other taxes payable from group production.

The South32 Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the
significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.

It is the South32 Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.

Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group
financing (including finance expense and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a South32 Group basis
and are not allocated to operating segments.

Total assets and liabilities for each operating segment represent operating assets and liabilities which predominately
exclude the carrying amount of equity accounted investments, cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances. The
carrying amount of investments accounted for using the equity method represents the balance of the South32 Group's
investment in equity accounted investments, with no adjustment for cash, interest bearing liabilities and tax balances of
the equity accounted investment.

Major corporate restructures

In February 2016 the South32 Group announced a number of major restructuring initiatives which included redundancy
and related costs associated with a reduction in the number of employees and contractors across several operations. In
the second half of the financial year additional major restructuring activities occurred within the functional support areas
with further redundancy and related costs incurred.

Impairments recognised
As a result of significant and continued weakening of commodity markets, the South32 Group recognised the following
impairments and associated tax effect in the year ended 30 June 2016. The forecast weakening of commodity prices has
also impacted the probability of generating longer term taxable income for certain operations and therefore resulted in
the derecognition of specific deferred tax asset balances in the year ended 30 June 2016. An impairment at the Brazil
Aluminium Smelter was as a result of the continued and indefinite suspension of smelting operations. The following table
shows the categorisation of the amounts within earnings adjustments:

Set-up costs

Set-up costs related to the ongoing establishment of South32's corporate and regional offices following the demerger.
The costs primarily related to transitionary contractor and consultant support, information technology infrastructure and
system support. The amount recognised is inclusive of US$30 million (2015: US$12 million) paid to BHP Billiton under an
agreement for information technology services. Those costs relate to all operating segments. All remaining set-up costs
relate to group and unallocated items.

Adjustment to Australian tax balances post-demerger including reset of tax assets

The tax basis of South32 wholly owned Australian operations was reset on demerger from BHP Billiton. The net
increase/ (decrease) to tax assets is charged/ (credited) to income tax expense in the consolidated income statement.

Derecognition of deferred tax assets

As a result of the significant and continued weakening of commodity markets, certain deferred tax assets associated with
provisions for closure and rehabilitation were derecognised as utilisation is no longer probable.

Brazil Alumina tax accounting adjustments

South32's cash and profit repatriation practices result in a probable expectation that tax deferrals will ultimately unwind.
This has resulted in the recognition of associated deferred tax balances at a rate closely aligned to the country statutory
rate and the reassessment of future tax losses as a result of revised interpretation of the applicability of local tax laws.

Closure and rehabilitation provisions and Change in discount rate

Following a review of cash flow assumptions and discount rates, South32 recognised a net decrease in closure and
rehabilitation provisions of US$59 million. Where this related to closed sites, US$68 million was recognised as a benefit
in expenses and US$9 million as a charge in net finance cost in the consolidated income statement. The benefit
recognised in expenses included US$18 million related to South Africa Energy Coal and US$50 million related to the
closed Bayside operation, formerly part of South Africa Aluminium.

Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax Legislation

On 2 September 2014, legislation to repeal the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (""MRRT"") in Australia received the support
of both Houses of Parliament. The repeal took effect on 30 September 2014 and as a result, the South32 Group
derecognised a MRRT deferred tax asset in relation to Illawarra Metallurgical Coal. The impact of this derecognition and
all other MRRT related amounts resulted in an income tax expense of US$96 million.

Fair value uplift on equity accounted investments

South Africa Manganese and Samancor AG were acquired by South32 on 3 February 2015. As a result of the
renegotiation of the agreement between BHP Billiton and Anglo American on 2 March 2015, BHP Billiton Group moved
from control to joint control of the manganese assets. South32 derecognised the carrying amounts of all assets, liabilities
and non-controlling interest attributed to Anglo American and recorded its retained 60 per cent interest at fair value. The
uplift in fair value on the commencement of equity accounting was US$749 million for South Africa Manganese and
US$172 million for Samancor AG.

Demerger related dividend withholding tax paid

Dividend withholding tax incurred on repatriation of pre-demerger profits.

Demerger related stamp duty paid

Stamp duty paid by the South32 Group on the acquisition of Australia Manganese from the BHP Billiton Group as part of
the demerger.

(c)   Whilst the South32 Group holds a greater than 50 per cent interest in Worsley, all the participants approve the operating and capital budgets and
      therefore the South32 Group is deemed to have joint control over the relevant activities of Worsley.

PRO FORMA RECONCILIATIONS AND INFORMATION

BACKGROUND

Effective 15 May 2015, BHP Billiton shares ceased trading with an entitlement to South32 shares. On 18 May 2015, South32 Limited was listed
as a separate standalone entity on the Australian Securities Exchange on a deferred settlement basis, on the London Stock Exchange on a
when-issued basis and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on a normal settlement basis. Economic separation and distribution of South32
shares to shareholders became effective from 25 May 2015.

Prior to the demerger, the South32 Group and the BHP Billiton Group were required to undertake a number of internal share and asset transfers
in connection with the corporate restructure (Internal Restructure).

STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

As required, comparative statutory financial information for the South32 Group has been presented for the financial year ended 30 June 2015
(FY15). The South32 Group's FY15 statutory financial information only includes the results of the current South32 Group operations from their
date of acquisition during the year as part of the Internal Restructure. The exception is Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, which was part of the
South32 Group at 1 July 2014. The South32 Group's FY15 statutory financial information also includes:

     -    The results of New Mexico Coal for the period 1 July 2014 to 27 October 2014, being the date that it ceased to be part of the South32
          Group as a result of the Internal Restructure; and

     -    Finance charges on internal borrowings from the BHP Billiton Group in the period.

Accordingly, as a result of the Internal Restructure, the statutory financial information for FY15 does not reflect the performance of the South32
Group as it is currently structured.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

To assist shareholders in their understanding of the South32 Group, pro forma financial information for FY15 has been prepared to reflect the
business as it is now structured and as though it was in effect for the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. The pro forma financial information is
not prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The following pro forma adjustments, including the associated tax effect, have been made on a basis consistent with those contemplated in the
South32 Listing Documents:

     -    Equity accounting of the South32 manganese assets (comprising South Africa Manganese, Australia Manganese and Samancor AG)
          from 1 July 2014 (refer note 4(c) of the Group's 2015 financial statements); and

     -    Excluding net finance costs charged by the BHP Billiton Group.

Additional pro forma adjustments, including the associated tax effect, have also been made in the presentation of pro forma financial information.
These include:

     -    Reflecting changes in corporate costs associated with South32 Limited becoming a stand-alone group as if those costs had been
          incurred from 1 July 2014;

     -    Excluding demerger related major corporate restructuring costs; and

     -    Including certain significant tax expense items such as the Brazil Alumina tax accounting adjustments.

A reconciliation between the pro forma financial information and the comparative statutory financial information is included. The statutory
financial information was audited by the Group's external auditor. The reconciliations and pro forma financial information were subject to an
unmodified review report to the Directors of South32 Limited by the Group's external auditor.

QUARTERLY REPORT JUNE 2016

“We have built a strong foundation in our first full year of operation, despite the challenging market.

We prioritised value over volume and took decisive action to restructure our operations, reduce controllable costs 
and improve efficiencies, whilst delivering two major projects on or ahead of schedule, and under budget.

We continue to unlock our resource potential, having reached a landmark agreement with the Anindilyakwa Land
Council to mine the Eastern Leases and explore the highly prospective Southern Areas at GEMCO. An
option agreement at the Huckleberry property in Canada also marks our first investment in base and precious metals
greenfields exploration, and aligns with our strategy to identify opportunities beyond our current portfolio.”

Graham Kerr, South32 CEO

CORPORATE UPDATE

-      The previously announced restructuring initiatives at five of our operations (Worsley Alumina, Illawarra
       Metallurgical Coal, Australia Manganese, South Africa Manganese and Cerro Matoso) are now complete. These
       initiatives position us well to achieve previously announced FY17 unit cost guidance [1]

-      Consistent with our strategy to unlock the potential of our resources, we obtained consent from the Anindilyakwa
       Land Council to access the Eastern Leases and the Southern Areas at GEMCO. The Eastern Leases will enable
       us to mine new areas within our existing operating footprint. Access to the Southern Areas, adjacent to existing
       operations, will substantially increase our exploration footprint at this highly prospective manganese deposit.

-      We signed an option agreement with Northern Shield Resources to become a partner in the Huckleberry property
       in Northern Quebec, Canada. This agreement represents a low-cost entry into the Labrador Trough, a province
       identified as being highly prospective for copper, nickel and platinum group elements. We can earn a 50% interest
       in the property by funding C$2.5M of exploration spend and a further 20% interest by funding an
       additional C$2.5M. Northern Shield’s interest will be free carried to the completion of a Preliminary Economic
       Assessment (PEA) study on the property [2].

-      In the financial year, South32 invested US$13M in exploration, of which US$4M will be capitalised. Exploration
       activities focussed on metallurgical coal and silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia.

-      Our Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)[3] largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The
       corporate tax rates applicable to South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 39%; and Brazil
       34%. Permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s tax rate when the Group’s profit
       margins are compressed.

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 4% (or 142kt) to 4.0Mt in the 2016 financial year as an uplift in
calciner availability underpinned record performance. This represents the first time that the refinery has operated at its
expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa (100% basis)[6] across a full year and was achieved despite a power outage and
associated process instability that was caused by water ingress during a severe storm in April 2016.

South Africa Aluminium saleable production was largely unchanged for both the 2016 financial year (697kt) and the June
2016 quarter (172kt). The impact of load-shedding was lower than expected and this benefit offset the previously
announced suspension of production in 22 pots in September 2015. The 14% increase in quarterly sales resulted from a
progressive reduction in inventory in the June quarter, following a change in monthly vessel scheduling.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 8% (or 2.6Mt) to 31.7Mt in the 2016 financial year. Lower
production resulted from the planned closure of the opencast mine at Khutala, and a reduction in contractor activity at the
Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex, consistent with our focus on value over volume.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production decreased by 6% (or 560kt) to 8.4Mt in the 2016 financial year as
challenging geological conditions were encountered at the Appin and Dendrobium mines in the first six months of the
reporting period. Three planned longwall moves were also completed during the year.
The Appin Area 9 project was completed in January ahead of schedule and below budget, significantly increasing
longwall utilisation and cutting rates at the operation. This improvement in longwall performance, and the absence of
longwall moves at Appin or Dendrobium, underpinned a 29% increase in metallurgical coal production in the June
quarter to a record 2.1Mt.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 4% (or 129kt) to a record 3.1Mt in the 2016 financial year as
concentrator performance improved and the US$139M Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) project was completed. This
project, which increases GEMCO’s production capacity by 500ktpa to 5.3Mtpa (100% basis), was completed 17% under
budget in the June 2016 quarter. As previously disclosed, the ramp-up of this project has been adjusted to match market
demand. Sales of manganese ore increased by 12% in the 2016 financial year as supply chain inventory was drawn
down to normalised levels.
Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 20% (or 34kt) to 133kt in the 2016 financial year as power shortages
in Tasmania led to the suspension of two of four furnaces. These furnaces are currently being brought back online, with
return to full production expected in July 2016.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 25% (or 563kt) to 1.7Mt in the 2016 financial year
following the decision to initially suspend (November 2015) and then restructure operations at Wessels and Mamatwan in
response to challenging market conditions. Mining recommenced at both operations in the March 2016 quarter, ramping-
up to an optimised 2.9Mtpa (100% basis) production rate. Sales of manganese ore declined by a lesser 17% as supply
chain inventory was drawn down below normalised levels.
Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 63% (or 155kt) to 91kt in the 2016 financial year, following the
decision to suspend three of the four high-carbon ferromanganese furnaces at Metalloys in May 2015. Metalloys will
continue to operate one of four furnaces until market conditions improve, consistent with our focus on value over volume.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production decreased by 9% (or 3.6kt) to 36.8kt in the 2016 financial year. Lower
production resulted from a decline in the average ore grade, consistent with the mine plan.
The previously announced headcount reduction and the restructure of labour activities to improve productivity were
completed in the June 2016 quarter. Combined with a new three-year Collective Labour Agreement, successfully
negotiated with trade unions, these efforts position Cerro Matoso to pursue further optimisation initiatives that will
improve cash generation.

Payable silver and lead production decreased by 5%, to 21.4Moz and 173.2kt respectively, in the 2016 financial year due
to a temporary reduction in mill throughput. Conversely, an increase in the average zinc ore grade and recoveries
resulted in record annual zinc production of 79.0kt (+9% YoY).
Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will reduce Underlying EBIT by US$11M

sales (containing 3.1Moz of silver, 30.9kt of lead and 6.4kt of zinc) were revalued at 30 June 2016. The final price of
these sales will be determined in the first half of the 2017 financial year.

 “We continue to strengthen our balance sheet by focussing on value, not volume.

 “We are making great progress on our cost-out program across all operations and have continued to generate cash
 despite volatile commodity markets.

 “We have successfully completed the Appin Area 9 project at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and are close to completing the
 PC02 project at GEMCO. Both will be delivered below budget.”

 -    Our strong balance sheet remains a key point of difference. At
      31 March 2016 our estimated net cash[1] position was US$18M.
 -    We are well positioned to achieve FY16 production guidance for all our operations and remain on track
      to reduce controllable costs [2] by US$300M.
 -    Strong operating performance at Worsley Alumina supported a 5% increase in production in the March
      2016 quarter.
 -    The recommencement of longwall mining at Dendrobium and completion of the Appin Area 9 project
      resulted in a 35% increase in metallurgical coal production in the March 2016 quarter.
 -    A reduction in mill availability, associated with an outage in January, resulted in lower sequential
      production at Cannington in the March 2016 quarter.
 -    We successfully reconfigured South Africa Manganese to operate with greater flexibility to respond to
      market demand, having ramped-up ore production to an optimised 2.9Mtpa (100% basis).
 -    The Appin Area 9 project was completed 33% below budget and ahead of schedule. The Premium
      Concentrate Ore Project (PC02) at GEMCO is 98% complete and will be commissioned in the June 2016
      quarter.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-      We are on track to reduce controllable costs by US$300M in FY16. Restructuring at Worsley Alumina, South Africa Manganese
       and the Australia Manganese mining operation is largely complete. Restructuring at Cerro Matoso and Illawarra Metallurgical
       Coal is expected to be completed in the June 2016 quarter.
-      Guidance for depreciation and amortisation [3] (US$760M) and capital expenditure [4] (US$550M) for FY16
       remains unchanged, while Underlying net finance costs are expected to be marginally higher than the annualised
       H1 FY16 run-rate (US$71M in H1 FY16).
-      The US$134M reduction in net debt recorded in the quarter was achieved despite a US$30M foreign exchange
       rate related increase in finance lease liabilities, which rose to US$621M (US$595M as at 31 December 2015),                                   
       and one-off redundancy and restructuring payments [5] of approximately US$23M.
-      Our strong balance sheet remains a key point of difference and we are firmly committed to an investment grade
       credit rating. In the period Moody’s [6] confirmed our credit rating at Baa1 and S&P confirmed that no rating
       actions were warranted (S&P rating is stable at BBB+).
-      Our Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) [7] largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The
       corporate tax rates applicable to South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 39%; and Brazil
       34%. Permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s tax rate when the Group’s profit
       margins are compressed.
-      Our exploration expenditure for the nine months ended March 2016 totalled US$9M, of which US$3M will be
       capitalised. Exploration activities were conducted at our existing operations and were focussed on metallurgical
       coal and silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia.
-      The U.S. International Trade Commission determined on 11 March 2016 that the U.S. silicomanganese industry
       is not materially injured or threatened with material injury by imports from Australia. As a result, no anti-dumping
       duties will be imposed on TEMCO.

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 4% (or 111kt) to 3.0Mt in the nine months ended March 2016 as high
calciner availability contributed to a 5% increase in production in the March 2016 quarter. This outstanding result was
underpinned by another strong quarter of hydrate production as the input circuit exceeded expanded capacity of 4.6Mtpa
(100% basis).
FY16 saleable alumina production guidance remains unchanged at 3.95Mt. The next major calciner outage is scheduled
for the December 2016 quarter.

South Africa Aluminium saleable production was largely unchanged in both the nine months (525kt) and quarter (173kt)
ended March 2016. Consistent with our commitment to focus on value over volume, we suspended production in 22 pots
in September 2015 in order to achieve an incremental improvement in cash flow by deferring planned pot relining activity.
Despite this decision, metal production is now expected to remain largely unchanged in FY16 as the number of
load-shedding events in the March 2016 quarter was lower than expected.

Brazil Alumina saleable alumina production of 999kt was largely unchanged in the nine months ended March 2016 and
FY16 alumina production is expected to be in line with previous guidance of 1.32Mt. The 6% increase in quarterly sales
reflects a timing difference as one shipment slipped into the March 2016 quarter.
Aluminium production was first curtailed at Brazil Alumina in July 2013 and the suspension of all smelting activity was
announced in March 2015. As previously announced, we have forward sold power until the end of CY17 and have
terminated the contract with Eletronorte. A minor provision will be booked in our June 2016 financial year statements to
reflect the anticipated cash outflow associated with this contract across the remaining 18 month period. Unhedged power
sales, inclusive of this provision, are expected to contribute approximately BRL235M to Underlying EBIT in FY16 and will
be skewed to the first half (BRL188M in H1 FY16).

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production declined by 7% (or 1.7Mt) to 24.1Mt in the nine months ended March
2016. Lower production resulted from the planned closure of the opencast mine at Khutala, and a reduction in contractor
activity at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex, consistent with our focus on value over volume. Underground
development at Khutala contributed to a 5% reduction in production for the quarter. FY16 saleable production guidance
remains unchanged at 31.95Mt (16.65Mt domestic, 15.30Mt export).

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal total saleable production decreased by 11% (or 701kt) to 5.8Mt in the nine months ended
March 2016 as challenging geological conditions were encountered in the first half of FY16 at the Appin and Dendrobium
mines and three planned longwall moves were completed during the period. A 35% increase in metallurgical coal
production in the March 2016 quarter was underpinned by the recommencement of longwall mining at Dendrobium and
the ramp-up of the new Appin Area 9 longwall following project completion ahead of schedule and below budget. The
final cost of the Appin Area 9 project is expected to be US$565M, representing a 33% saving on the original budget. The
West Cliff colliery has now been closed.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 7% (or 151kt) to 2.33Mt in the nine months ended March
2016 as the operation continued to optimise concentrator performance and benefited from drier weather conditions.
Record ore sales were achieved in the March 2016 quarter as an improvement in market conditions enabled a managed
reduction of inventory to normalised levels. FY16 ore production guidance remains unchanged at 3.05Mt as a higher strip
ratio and planned maintenance are expected to impact performance in the June 2016 quarter.
Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 10% (or 13kt) to 111kt in the nine months ended March 2016. The
37% decline in production in the March 2016 quarter reflects the temporary suspension of two of four furnaces in
response to power shortages in Tasmania. The first of the furnaces was suspended in December 2015 and the second
suspension followed in March 2016. The two remaining furnaces are currently operating at a reduced electricity load. All
four furnaces are expected to return to full production at the end of June 2016.
The Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) project which increases GEMCO production capacity by 500ktpa to 5.3Mtpa
(100% basis) is 98% complete and will be commissioned in the June 2016 quarter. The US$139M (100% basis) project
is expected to be completed under budget.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 32% (or 563kt) to 1.22Mt in the nine months ended
March 2016 following the extended suspension of operations at Wessels and Mamatwan in November 2015 in response
to challenging market conditions. Sales of manganese ore declined by a lesser 25% as supply chain inventory was
largely drawn down.
Following the completion of a strategic review, mining activity at South Africa Manganese recommenced in the March
2016 quarter. The reconfigured operation will have greater flexibility to respond to market demand, having ramped-up
production to an optimised 2.9Mtpa (100% basis). The US$30M (100% basis) Wessels Central Block project will enable
mining to relocate closer to critical infrastructure and lower production costs in the underground mine, with first ore now
anticipated in October 2016.
South Africa Manganese saleable alloy production decreased by 67% (or 140kt) to 68kt in the nine months ended March
2016, following the suspension of three of the four high-carbon ferromanganese furnaces at Metalloys in May 2015.
Metalloys will continue to operate one of four furnaces until market conditions improve.

A significant increase in the average zinc ore grade and recoveries at Cannington underpinned a 13% increase in zinc
production to 60.3kt in the nine months ended March 2016, consistent with the mine plan. Payable silver production
decreased by 6% (or 1.01Moz) to 16.36Moz in the same period. A reduction in mill availability, associated with an outage
in January, resulted in lower sequential production at Cannington in the March 2016 quarter. Planned mill outages are
scheduled to occur in May and August 2016.
FY16 production guidance remains unchanged (payable silver 21.65Moz, payable lead 175kt, payable zinc 80kt).

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

25 February 2016                                                                                         ASX / LSE / JSE: S32

""The continuing optimisation of our high quality operations and balance sheet has enabled us to
reduce net debt by almost US$300M, despite continued weakness in commodity markets. Our low
financial gearing and operational leverage is a powerful combination and the decisive action we are
taking across our portfolio will strengthen short term cash flow.""
Graham Kerr, South32 CEO

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
-   Statutory loss of US$1.7B includes non-cash impairment related charges of US$1.7B.
-   Underlying EBITDA of US$542M for an operating margin of 20%.
-   Underlying EBIT and Underlying earnings of US$141M and US$26M, respectively.
-   Controllable costs(1) reduced by US$182M.                                 
-   Total capital expenditure(2), including equity accounted investments, reduced by 22% or US$85M to US$301M.
-   Closing net debt reduced by US$286M to US$116M.
-   Underlying return on invested capital (ROIC) of 1.4%.
-   No dividend declared for H1 FY16.

OUTLOOK
-   FY16 production guidance maintained for the majority of our upstream operations.
-   Major restructuring initiatives underpin targeted US$300M reduction in controllable costs in FY16.
-   Redundancy and restructuring charges(3) of US$37M anticipated in the June 2016 half year.
-   FY16 Capital expenditure(2) guidance, including equity accounted investments, lowered by US$150M to US$550M.
-   Well positioned to significantly exceed our US$350M controllable costs savings target.

conjunction with the notes on page 27.

DECEMBER 2015 HALF YEAR PERFORMANCE

SAFETY

We are deeply saddened by the loss of two colleagues in our Africa Region in H1 FY16. Our core value of Care dictates
that safety is paramount and every one of our employees and contractors should go home safe and well, after every
shift. We are in the process of implementing our Care and Safety Strategy across all operated sites. This strategy
focusses on our frontline leaders and the importance of having well planned, designed and executed work. With focus
and perseverance we will create a safer working environment and become a more productive organisation.

Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) was 7.6 per million hours worked in H1 FY16.

EARNINGS

The Group's statutory loss of US$1.7B in H1 FY16 was significantly impacted by non-cash impairment related charges
totalling US$1.7B (post-tax US$1.7B). This included a US$916M impairment at Australia Manganese; a US$97M impairment 
at South Africa Manganese; a US$64M impairment at Manganese Marketing; a US$518M impairment at South Africa Energy Coal, 
including US$76M relating to available for sale investments; a US$97M impairment at Brazil Alumina; and the US$126M 
derecognition of deferred tax assets at South Africa Energy Coal. The tax benefit associated with these non-cash 
impairments is US$174M.

Consistent with our accounting policy, various items are excluded from Underlying earnings, including: the
aforementioned impairments; exchange rate gains associated with the restatement of monetary items (US$87M pre-tax);
fair value losses on derivative instruments (US$36M pre-tax); exchange rate gains associated with the Group's non US
dollar denominated net debt (US$26M pre-tax), demerger related set-up costs (US$60M pre-tax), exchange rate losses
on tax balances (US$178M) and the tax benefit of these remaining earnings adjustments (US$58M).

Underlying EBITDA declined by 52% in H1 FY16 to US$542M. Lower commodity prices reduced revenue by US$1.0B,
although this was partially offset by a stronger US dollar (US$401M) and lower price-linked costs (US$94M). Half year
production records were achieved at Worsley Alumina, Australia Manganese (ore) and Cannington (zinc), while power
sales at Brazil Alumina contributed US$51M to Underlying EBITDA.

Controllable cost savings of US$182M were delivered during the period as we increased labour productivity, reduced
procurement costs and optimised our energy footprint. The majority of these savings are considered to be structural in
nature and include a sustainable US$30Mpa or 23% saving in Group and unallocated costs. Depreciation and
amortisation remained largely unchanged at US$401M.

Underlying EBIT declined by 80% in H1 FY16 to US$141M. The Group recorded an Underlying net finance cost of                                                                                                 
US$71M, while Underlying income tax expense was US$44M for an Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)(12) of 34%. As a
result, Underlying earnings declined by 94% in H1 FY16 to US$26M.


    ""Our disciplined approach extends beyond our operations, to the management of our capital and
    optimisation of our balance sheet. During the December 2015 half year we created additional financial
    flexibility by resolving two legacy tax disputes and restructuring a financing arrangement. These initiatives
    reduced net debt by a combined US$136M.""
    Brendan Harris, South32 CFO

CASH FLOW

Robust free cash flow from operations, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$192M highlighted the cash
generating capacity of our operations. A 23% or US$77M reduction in Total capital expenditure, excluding equity
accounted investments, to US$253M included:

-     Stay-in-business, Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital
      expenditure of US$211M;
-     Major project (Appin Area 9) capital expenditure of US$26M; and
-     The purchase of intangibles and capitalisation of exploration expenditure of US$16M.

The Appin Area 9 underground extension at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is the Group's sole Major project in
development. This project is now 95% complete, with commissioning expected to start in the March 2016 quarter. The
project, which sustains saleable production capacity at approximately 9Mtpa, is tracking more than 30% below the
original budget of US$845M and three months ahead of schedule.

Capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of US$48M in H1 FY16 includes the Premium
Concentrate Ore (PC02) project at GEMCO (Australia Manganese) and the second phase of the Central Block
development project at Wessels (South Africa Manganese). The PC02 project, which increases Australia Manganese ore
production capacity by 0.5Mt to 5.3Mtpa (100% basis), is expected to be delivered under budget with first production
anticipated in the June 2016 quarter. The ramp-up of this project will be adjusted to match market demand. The second
phase of the Central Block development project has been accelerated to enable underground mining activity to relocate
closer to critical infrastructure, thereby reducing cycle times. The project is 78% complete, with commissioning expected
in July 2016.

Total capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments was US$301M in H1 FY16.

The resolution of two legacy tax disputes contributed US$46M to cash flow, although this was more than offset by a
US$211M increase in working capital. In this regard, a US$196M decline in provisions was largely associated with the
stronger US dollar, whilst lower commodity and raw material prices led to a US$296M reduction in payables which was
partly offset by a US$162M reduction in receivables. A decline in inventory, however, released US$119M to cash flow as
days debtors were held steady at 21 days and stock was consumed at a number of operations.

Dividends totalling US$19M were received from our equity accounted investments, although the Group contributed
US$75M to the funding of these entities during the period.

BALANCE SHEET

During H1 FY16 net debt declined by US$286M to US$116M. The restructuring of a legacy financing arrangement
accounted for US$90M or 31% of the change in net debt during the period, whilst a US$36M reduction in finance leases
(to US$595M) largely reflected strength in the US dollar.

The Group's liquidity and flexibility continues to be underpinned by an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit facility (RCF).

On 22 January 2016, Moody's and S&P announced downward revisions to their respective commodity price forecasts
and Moody's notified South32, along with 174 other mining and energy companies worldwide, that its rating had been
placed on review for downgrade. Moody's is seeking to complete its review process before 31 March 2016.

DIVIDEND

The Group's simple capital management framework prioritises investment in safe and reliable operations, and an
investment grade credit rating through the cycle. Once those core priorities have been satisfied, we intend to distribute a
minimum 40% of Underlying earnings as dividends to shareholders in each six month reporting period.

An interim dividend is not declared for H1 FY16 given the reduction in Underlying earnings to US$26M, or 0.5 US cents
per share, and the quantum of impairment related non-cash charges recorded during the period.

OUTLOOK

PRODUCTION

FY16 saleable production guidance has been maintained for the majority of our upstream operations, which in most
cases occupy the first or second quartile of industry cost or margin curves. Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable
production guidance has, however, been lowered by 7% to 8.3Mt after difficult ground conditions were encountered
during the period, while South Africa Manganese has been restructured to ensure it is appropriately configured for the
current environment. Saleable ore production at South Africa Manganese will be adjusted to match market demand.

The mining and processing plans at Australia Manganese (GEMCO) are being adjusted to ensure the operation retains
its leading, low-cost position in the industry. This includes a revised ramp-up profile for the PC02 project and a 0.2Mt or
4% reduction in guidance for FY17 Australia Manganese saleable ore production to 5.2Mt (100% basis). Conversely, an
increase in longwall utilisation at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is expected to increase saleable production towards 9.5Mt
in FY17, while a further 3% improvement in refinery availability and utilisation at Worsley Alumina is expected to increase
saleable production to approximately 4.0Mt.

That being said, we remain ready to react to changes in the external environment and will not hesitate to adjust volumes
should superior value and cash flow be attainable by varying the output of any operation.

At our downstream processing operations we continue to take decisive action.

At Brazil Alumina, we first curtailed activity at our smelter in July 2013 before suspending all aluminium production in
March 2015. With the economics unlikely to support the recommencement of smelting activity we sold forward power for
the 2017 calendar year and served termination notice on our contract with Eletronorte for the remaining years of the
contract.

At South Africa Aluminium, we responded to the deterioration in market conditions by suspending 22 pots, equivalent to
3% of total production. Whilst this decision will lead to an incremental reduction in saleable production, the decision is
expected to deliver a modest improvement in free cash flow given the associated deferral of pot relining activity.

At the Samancor Manganese Joint Venture alloying operations, saleable production has been adjusted to reflect market
demand. At TEMCO (Australian Manganese), one of the four furnaces was suspended in January 2016 for a minimum of
three months while Metalloys (South Africa Manganese) will continue to operate one of its four furnaces for the
foreseeable future.

COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

Operating and capital expenditure continues to be scrutinised in every location as we seek to sustainably de-capitalise
our business and grow ROIC. In this regard, a cumulative reduction in controllable costs and Capital expenditure,
including equity accounted investments, of approximately US$518M is now anticipated in FY16.

Controllable costs

In August 2015, we announced a commitment to reduce our annual controllable cost base, including equity accounted
investments, by at least US$350M before end FY18. Having reduced controllable costs by US$182M in H1 FY16, we are
well positioned to significantly exceed this target.

We announced a number of major restructuring initiatives subsequent to period end. A reduction of approximately 1,750
employees and contractors is expected before the end of FY16, equivalent to 7% of the Group's employee and
contractor headcount at the end of FY15. These initiatives will further optimise and stretch the performance of our high
quality operations as we seek to increase our competitiveness in the industry. We have established specific cost targets
for a number of our more challenged operations; including:

-   A reduction in South Africa Manganese operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to
    approximately US$1.90/dmtu(14) in FY17;
-   A reduction in Worsley Alumina operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to approximately
    US$200/t(14) in FY17;
-   A reduction in Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to
    approximately US$66/t(14) in FY17;
-   A reduction in Australia Manganese ore operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to
    approximately US$1.56/dmtu(14) in FY17; and
-   A reduction in Cerro Matoso operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to approximately
    US$3.90/lb(14) in FY17.

Greenfield exploration opportunities continue to be assessed although a willingness to invest shareholder funds will
remain contingent on the quality of the opportunity. A modest investment of US$10M or less is anticipated in FY16.
Exploration activity based on our existing footprint of approximately US$15M is anticipated in FY16.

Capital expenditure

Sustaining capital expenditure, comprising Stay-in-business (SIB), Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping capital
expenditure, including equity accounted investments, is now expected to decline by 23% (or US$150M) to US$500M.

The Group's share of planned capital expenditure associated with equity accounted investments of approximately
US$90M in FY16 is included in the Sustaining capital expenditure guidance noted above.

Guidance for Capital expenditure, including equity accounted investments, is reduced by US$150M to approximately
US$550M in FY16 and includes approximately US$50M for Major projects. Major project capital expenditure guidance
includes approximately US$5M for feasibility studies, primarily associated with the Klipspruit Life Extension project
(South Africa Energy Coal).

Other

All demerger related set-up costs associated with the establishment of South32 have been incurred and were 54% lower
than prior guidance at US$60M. These costs, primarily related to the establishment of the Group's IT infrastructure, are
excluded from our Underlying earnings measures in H1 FY16.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION

Depreciation and amortisation, excluding equity accounted investments, is expected to decrease by US$88M in FY16 to
US$760M following the recognition of impairment related non-cash charges during the period. Depreciation and
amortisation for equity accounted investments is also expected to decline by US$55M to US$117M in FY16.

TAX EXPENSE

South32's Underlying ETR largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group's profit. The corporate tax rates
applicable to South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 39%; and Brazil 34%. It should, however, be
recognised that permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group's Underlying ETR when commodity
prices and profit margins are compressed. In this context, the Group's Underlying ETR for FY16 could be significantly
higher than the rates recorded in FY15 (28.7%) and H1 FY16 (34.4%) should current conditions persist.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

To assist shareholders in their understanding of the South32 Group, pro forma financial information for H1 FY15 has
been prepared to reflect the business as it is now structured and as though it was in effect for the period 1 July 2014 to
31 December 2015. To provide insight into the underlying performance of the South32 Group, our financial results
include internal earnings measures used by South32 management. These internal measures include Underlying
EBITDA, Underlying EBIT and Underlying earnings.

(a) Sales price variance reflects the revenue impact of changes in commodity prices, based on the comparative period's sales volume. Price-
linked costs variance reflects the change in royalties together with the change in input costs driven by changes in commodity prices or market
traded consumables. Foreign exchange reflects the impact of exchange rate movements on local currency denominated costs and sales. Volume
variance reflects the revenue impact of sales volume changes, based on the comparative period's sales prices. Controllable costs variance
represents the impact from changes in the Group's controllable local currency cost base, including the variable cost impact of production volume
changes on expenditure, and period on period movements in inventories. The controllable cost variance excludes earnings adjustments including
significant items.

Prices, foreign exchange and inflation

A significant contraction in commodity prices reduced revenue by US$1.0B. Persistent weakness in the aluminium market
accounted for 34% of this impact. Lower metallurgical and energy coal, manganese ore and alloy, alumina and nickel prices
reduced revenue by a further US$185M, US$167M, US$126M and US$123M, respectively. The impact of lower commodity
prices reduced Underlying EBIT by US$933M, net of price-linked costs.

General inflation increased costs by US$70M. The absolute impact was most pronounced at our South African operations,
which collectively accounted for 64% of the total variance.

Weaker commodity prices and inflation were, however, partly offset by the general strengthening of the US dollar against a
basket of producer currencies, which increased Underlying EBIT by US$401M.

Volume

We achieved half year production records at Worsley Alumina, Australia Manganese (ore) and Cannington (zinc) in
H1 FY16 and remain on track to meet FY16 production guidance for the majority of our upstream operations. The
US$227M volume related decline in revenue does, however, largely reflect the decision to curtail or suspend production
at South Africa Manganese (alloy and ore saleable production), Brazil Alumina (aluminium saleable production) and our
African aluminium smelters (aluminium saleable production). The remainder of the volume related differential is
accounted for by production losses at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (US$47M), where challenging ground conditions were
encountered, and grade decline at Cerro Matoso (US$52M).

Controllable cost reduction

In August 2015, we announced a commitment to reduce our annual controllable cost base, including equity accounted
investments, by at least US$350M per annum before end FY18. Having reduced controllable costs by US$182M in H1
FY16, we are well positioned to significantly exceed this target. The majority of the savings achieved to date are
considered to be structural in nature and include a sustainable US$30Mpa or 23% saving in Group and unallocated
costs.

The suspension of operations, particularly at South Africa Manganese, contributed to the reduction in controllable costs,
although this was broadly offset by additional charges associated with a physical reduction in inventory and an
adjustment to the carrying value of inventory to reflect net realisable value.

Other items

Other items increased Underlying EBIT by a net US$40M. This included: a US$30M reduction in restoration and
rehabilitation provisions at South Africa Energy Coal; an US$18M benefit at Cerro Matoso related to employee provisions in
the prior period; and a US$17M reduction in expenses at Brazil Alumina reflecting the full suspension of smelting activities.
These benefits were partially offset by a US$30M reduction in the contribution of third party product sales and an US$18M
reduction in power sales in Brazil.

Interest and tax associated with equity accounted investments

The Group's manganese operations are jointly controlled by South32 (60% share) and Anglo American (40% share). The
Underlying interest and taxation expense associated with these equity accounted investments declined by US$38M in
H1 FY16.

Net finance costs

The Group incurred Underlying net finance costs, excluding equity accounted investments, of US$71M in H1 FY16. This
largely reflects the unwinding of the discount applied to restoration and rehabilitation provisions (US$49M), and finance
lease charges (US$25M), primarily at Worsley Alumina.

The following table reconciles H1 FY16 Underlying net finance cost to the Group's net finance cost.

Taxation expense

The Group's underlying income tax expense, which excludes taxation associated with equity accounted investments, 
was US$44M for an Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)(12) of 34%. The tax expense for equity accounted investments
was US$6M, including royalty related taxation. In this regard, the recognition of the GEMCO (Australia Manganese)
Northern Territory royalty as a profits based tax gives rise to a royalty related taxation expense of US$9M in equity
accounted investments. The Group did not generate franking credits during the period.

WORSLEY ALUMINA
(86% SHARE)

Volumes

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or
40kt) to a record 1,993kt in H1 FY16 as the operations
processed stockpiled alumina hydrate and benefitted from
additional efficiency gains. The 2% decline in sales reflected
a timing difference as one shipment slipped into the March
2016 quarter.

Saleable production guidance remains unchanged at 3.95Mt
for FY16, with a further lift to 3.97Mt anticipated in FY17 as
incremental capacity creep is delivered by improving the
consistency of ore feed and increasing refinery availability
and utilisation.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 11% to US$228/t as the US
dollar strengthened, general consumables and energy prices
declined, and additional labour productivity gains were
embedded.

The benefit associated with capacity creep and broader
restructuring initiatives is expected to reduce operating unit
costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, to
approximately US$200/t in FY17. Specific initiatives include:

-   The fundamental reorganisation of mining and refining
    into two operations and the removal of layers of
    management and functional support;
-   The reduction of approximately 390 employees and
    contractors before the end of FY16, equivalent to 15% of
    the employee and contractor headcount at the end of
    FY15;
-   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities
    to the region, which is expected to deliver a circa
    US$65M saving in FY17;
-   The continued optimisation of the coal to gas fuel mix in
    the co-generation power facility; and
-   A 34% reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure to
    approximately US$41M in FY17.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$46M in H1 FY16 to
US$33M. Lower realised alumina prices (-US$84M, net of
price-linked costs) and a favourable movement in foreign
exchange rate markets (+US$59M) had the most significant
influence on financial performance.

Capital expenditure decreased by 19% to US$22M.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$15M are anticipated at Worsley Alumina in
H2 FY16. These charges will be excluded from the Group's
Underlying earnings measures.

SOUTH AFRICA ALUMINIUM
(100%)

Volumes

South Africa Aluminium saleable production of 352kt was
largely unchanged in H1 FY16, while a 2% reduction in
December quarter production volumes reflected our decision
to suspend production of 22 pots in September 2015. This
suspension of activity is expected to deliver an incremental
improvement in cash flow as planned pot relining activity is
deferred. A loss of 18kt is anticipated should the 22 pots
remain offline for the remainder of FY16. The ability to
achieve our production guidance remains contingent upon
market conditions and the frequency and intensity of
electricity load-shedding events.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 15% to US$1,496/t,
reflecting a stronger US dollar, lower aluminium price-linked
power costs and weaker raw material prices. Additional cost
savings were realised as the smelter lowered its consumption
of coke and alumina per unit of production, and continued to
improve its energy efficiency.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the
cost profile of this first quartile smelter will be more heavily
influenced by power and raw material inputs, given the
operation's high variable cost base. Controllable costs will,
however, be impacted by an increase in relining activity
(6 pots) in H2 FY16, consistent with the smelter's natural
relining cycle. 66 pots were relined at a cost of
approximately US$204k per pot in H1 FY16, down 23% from
the prior period.

Hillside sources power from Eskom under long-term
contracts. The price of electricity supplied to potlines 1 and 2
is linked to the LME aluminium price and the South African
rand/US dollar exchange rate. The price of electricity supplied
to potline 3 is South African rand based and linked to South
African and United States producer price indices.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$148M in H1 FY16 to
US$21M. The combination of lower realised aluminium prices
and premia reduced Underlying EBIT by US$213M, net of
price-linked costs. This impact was partially offset by a
favourable movement in foreign exchange rate markets
(+US$30M) and an increase in sales volumes (+US$27M).

Capital expenditure of US$8M was broadly unchanged
from the prior period.

MOZAL ALUMINIUM
(47.1% SHARE)

Volumes

Mozal Aluminium saleable production of 133kt was largely
unchanged in H1 FY16, while production increased
marginally in the December 2015 quarter following a
modest reduction in the number of load-shedding events. 
The 12% decline in sales reflected the scheduling of 
shipments between periods. Aluminium production is 
expected to remain broadly unchanged in FY16.

The Mozal Aluminium smelter utilises hydroelectric power
under a long-term contract that is generated by Hidroeléctrica
de Cahora Bassa (HCB). HCB delivers power into the South
African grid to Eskom and Mozal Aluminium sources the
power via the Mozambique Transmission Company
(Motraco).

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 8% to US$1,653/t, reflecting
a stronger US dollar and weaker raw material prices.

While additional productivity gains are being pursued, the
cost profile of the smelter will be more heavily influenced by
power and raw material inputs, given the operation's high
variable cost base. Controllable costs will, however, benefit
from a 15% decrease in relining activity (8 pots) in
H2 FY16 that forms part of the natural relining cycle. Each
pot was relined at a cost of approximately US$212k in H1
FY16, down 14% from the prior period.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$86M in H1 FY16 to a loss
of US$10M. The combination of lower realised aluminium
prices and premia reduced Underlying EBIT by US$80M, net
of price-linked costs, while lower volumes reduced Underlying
EBIT by a further US$41M. This impact was partially offset by
a favourable movement in foreign exchange rate markets
(+US$19M).

Capital expenditure of US$5M was unchanged from the
prior period.

BRAZIL ALUMINA
(ALUMINA 36% SHARE, ALUMINIUM
40% SHARE)

Volumes

Brazil Alumina saleable alumina production of 673kt was
largely unchanged in H1 FY16 and FY16 production
guidance of 1.32Mt remains unchanged. The 5% decline in
sales reflected a timing difference as one shipment moved
into the March 2016 quarter.

Aluminium production was first curtailed at Brazil Alumina in
July 2013 and the suspension of all smelting activity was
announced in March 2015. With the economics unlikely to
support the recommencement of smelting activity we have
forward sold power for CY17 and served termination notice
on our contract with Eletronorte for the remaining years of the
contract.

Costs

Alumina operating unit costs at the non-operated refinery
declined by 7% to US$185/t as the US dollar strengthened
against the Brazilian real and raw material costs at the
refinery decreased.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$27M in H1 FY16 to
US$74M. Lower volumes associated with the suspension of
smelting activities (-US$54M), a reduction in realised alumina
prices (-US$18M, net of price-linked costs) and a decline in
power sales (-US$18M to US$51M) was partially offset by a
favourable movement in foreign exchange rate markets
(+US$53M).

As a result of our decision to terminate the contract with
Eletronorte, power sales are not expected to contribute to
Underlying EBIT beyond FY16. A minor provision will be
booked in our June 2016 financial year statements to reflect
the anticipated cash outflow associated with this contract
across the 2017 and 2018 financial years. Unhedged power
sales, inclusive of this provision, are now expected to
contribute approximately BRL235M to Underlying EBIT in
FY16 and will be skewed to the first half. Underlying EBIT
generated by these power sales in the June 2016 half year
will change by +/-BRL9M for every +/-US10c/lb movement
in the aluminium price above a floor of US$0.66/lb.

A US$4M increase was recorded for Sustaining capital
expenditure at the refinery.

SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COAL
(90% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production of 16.4Mt was
broadly unchanged in H1 FY16. Operational efficiencies at
the Khutala underground mine and the Wolvekrans
Middelburg Complex mitigated the impact of the planned
closure of the opencast mine at Khutala.

FY16 saleable production guidance remains unchanged at
32.0Mt.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 29% to US$25/t as the rand
weakened significantly against the US dollar and labour
productivity continued to rise. The insourcing of activity has
underpinned a 31% reduction in contractors when compared
with the average headcount in FY15, while employee
numbers have also been reduced by 10%.

Labour productivity remains a major focus, while several
procurement initiatives are expected to deliver additional
savings. South African inflation, however, remains a
significant challenge and is expected to more than offset the
savings associated with these initiatives.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT increased by US$45M in H1 FY16 to
US$46M. A reduction in contractor and labour costs
increased Underlying EBIT by US$53M while a stronger US
dollar delivered a further US$47M benefit. Non-cash charges
declined by US$52M as depreciation and amortisation
reflected the recognition of an impairment in the prior period
and restoration and rehabilitation provisions were reduced. In
contrast, lower realised prices reduced Underlying EBIT by
US$86M, net of price linked costs.

A US$16M decrease in Capital expenditure to US$42M
reflected the purchase of mobile equipment in the prior
period.

ILLAWARRA METALLURGICAL COAL
(100%)

Volumes

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by
17% (or 782kt) to 3.96Mt in H1 FY16 as challenging
geological conditions were encountered at the Appin and
Dendrobium mines, and a planned longwall move was
completed during the December 2015 quarter. Another two
longwall moves are expected to be completed in the March
2016 quarter. Accordingly, forecast FY16 saleable coal
production has been lowered by 7% to 8.25Mt. An increase in
longwall utilisation at the Appin and Dendrobium
underground mines, and the completion of the Appin Area 9
project is expected to increase production to approximately
9.5Mt in FY17.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 13% to US$62/t as
US dollar strengthened and broader cost savings initiatives
were embedded. At current prices and a constant AUD:USD
exchange rate, H2 FY16 operating costs are expected to
remain broadly unchanged.

A number of restructuring initiatives are being implemented in
order to reduce operating unit costs, including Sustaining
capital expenditure and underground development, by 37%
to approximately US$66/t in FY17. Specific initiatives include:

-   The fundamental reorganisation of the mining complex
    into two operations and the removal of layers of
    management and functional support;
-   The reduction of at least 300 employees and contractors
    before the end of FY16, equivalent to 14% of the
    employee and contractor headcount at the end of FY15;
-   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities
    to the region, which is expected to deliver a circa
    US$50M saving in FY17; and
-   A 58% reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure and
    underground development to approximately US$108M in
    FY17.

The Appin Area 9 project will be completed in the March
2016 quarter. Underground development of approximately
US$58Mpa is not being compromised given a commitment
to maximise long-term value, although we do retain the
flexibility to curtail this activity in the future.

Financial performance  

Underlying EBIT decreased by US$59M in H1 FY16 to a loss
of US$37M. Lower realised coal prices (-US$85M, net of
price-linked costs) and a decline in sales volumes (-US$47M)
were partially offset by the benefit associated with the
stronger US dollar (+US$55M).

Capital expenditure decreased by 38% from the prior period
to US$111M.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$10M are anticipated at Illawarra
Metallurgical Coal in H2 FY16. These charges will be
excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings measures.

AUSTRALIA MANGANESE
(60% SHARE)

Volumes

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by
6% (or 90kt) to a record 1,589kt in H1 FY16. FY16 saleable
production guidance of 5.1Mt (100% basis) remains
unchanged.

The mining and processing plans at Australia Manganese
(GEMCO) are being adjusted to ensure the operation
retains its leading, low-cost position in the industry. This
includes a revised ramp-up profile for the PC02 project
and a 0.2Mt (100% basis) or 4% reduction in FY17
saleable ore production guidance to 5.2Mt (100% basis).

Saleable manganese alloy production increased by 2%
(or 2kt) to 85kt in H1 FY16. In response to market conditions,
TEMCO has suspended production at one of its four furnaces
for a minimum of three months. While production will be
impacted in H2 FY16, customer commitments will be met
from inventory.

Costs

Manganese ore operating unit costs declined by 19% to
US$1.58/dmtu, despite a planned 20% increase in the waste
to ore strip ratio (from 3.0 to 3.6).

A double digit improvement in labour productivity and a
substantial reduction in procurement costs are expected to
more than offset a 27% increase in the strip ratio (from 3.0 to
3.8) between FY15 and FY17. Consequently, operating unit
costs, including sustaining capital expenditure are expected
to decline by 43% to approximately US$1.56/dmtu in FY17.
Specific measures being taken to reposition GEMCO include:

-   The reduction of approximately 82 employees and
    contractors before the end of FY16, equivalent to 8% of
    the employee and contractor headcount at the end of
    FY15, and the decision not to recruit 55 roles planned as
    largely related to the PC02 project;
-   A targeted 6% increase in the productivity of the mining
    fleet;
-   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities
    to the region, which is expected to deliver a circa
    US$10M saving in FY17; and
-   A 56% reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure to
    approximately US$40M in FY17.

Redundancy costs are not anticipated at GEMCO, despite
the meaningful reduction in employees and contractors.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$85M in H1 FY16 to
US$10M. Lower manganese ore and alloy prices reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$113M, net of price-linked costs, while
a stronger US dollar increased Underlying EBIT by US$27M.
Capital expenditure increased by US$7M to US$41M. This
included a US$20M investment in the PC02 project.

SOUTH AFRICA MANGANESE
(ORE 44.4% SHARE, ALLOY 60% SHARE)

Volumes

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased
by 39% (or 477kt) to 757kt in H1 FY16 following the
suspension of operations at the Hotazel mines in
November 2015.

Following the completion of the Samancor Manganese Joint
Venture's strategic review, the Hotazel mines will operate at a
reduced production rate and with greater flexibility. Subject to
market conditions, saleable production will ramp-up to
2.9Mtpa (100% basis), taking approximately 900ktpa (or 23%
of FY15 production) out of the market for the foreseeable
future.

Saleable manganese alloy production decreased by 67% (or
94kt) to 46kt in H1 FY16 following the suspension of three of
the four furnaces at Metalloys in May 2015 in response to
challenging market conditions. This resulted in a substantial
reduction in ore and alloy inventories.

Costs

Manganese ore operating unit costs increased by 27% to
US$2.48/dmtu as the significant reduction in production
created diseconomies of scale.

A series of restructuring initiatives are expected to reduce
manganese operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital
expenditure, by 24% to US$1.90/dmtu in FY17. Specific
initiatives include:

-   The reduction of approximately 620 employees across
    the joint venture, equivalent to 37% of the employee
    headcount at the end of FY15;
-   The acceleration of the second phase of the Central
    Block development project at Wessels (US$19M
    budget), which will enable mining activity to relocate
    closer to critical infrastructure and reduce cycle times;
-   The continued operation of only one of four furnaces at
    the Metalloys smelter, which is now generating free cash
    flow; and
-   A circa 80% reduction in annual Sustaining capital
    expenditure at the Hotazel mines to US$7M in FY17.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$64M to a loss of US$51M
as lower realised manganese ore and alloy prices reduced
Underlying EBIT by US$47M, net of price-linked costs. The
reduction in sales volumes impacted unit costs, although this
was partially offset by a US$22M benefit associated with the
stronger US dollar.

Capital expenditure of US$7M was significantly lower than
the prior period.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$10M are anticipated in H2 FY16.

CERRO MATOSO
(99.9% SHARE)

Volumes

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production declined by 17%
(or 3.7kt) to 17.5kt in H1 FY16 as the average ore grade
decreased, consistent with the mine plan. Payable nickel
production guidance remains unchanged at approximately
36.5kt for FY16, with a similar rate of production anticipated
in FY17.

The higher grade La Esmeralda deposit has the potential to
deliver an uplift in the average ore grade between 2018 and
2022. A new social and environmental licence to allow
access to the ore body was granted in December 2015.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 11% to US$4.43/lb, largely
as a result of the stronger US dollar and various cost savings
initiatives.

To ensure Cerro Matoso remains competitive amidst
declining ore grades and an increasing reliance on stockpiled
ore, the operation must significantly increase labour
productivity and reduce costs. In this regard, a series of
restructuring initiatives are expected to deliver a 30%
reduction in operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital
expenditure, to approximately US$3.90/lb in FY17. Specific
initiatives include:

-   The reduction of at least 350 employees and contractors 
    before the end of FY16, equivalent to 18% of the employee 
    and contractor headcount at the end of FY15;
-   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities
    to the region, which is expected to deliver a circa
    US$37M saving in FY17; and
-   A 56% reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure to
    approximately US$16M in FY17.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$136M to a loss of US$48M.
Weaker realised prices (-US$129M, net of price-linked costs)
and the grade related decline in sales volumes
(-US$52M) was only partly offset by the benefit associated
with a stronger US dollar (US$51M).

Capital expenditure declined by 33% from the prior period to
US$12M.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of
approximately US$2M are anticipated at Cerro Matoso in
H2 FY16. These charges will be excluded from the Group's

CANNINGTON
(100% SHARE)

Volumes

Cannington payable silver production decreased by a
modest 3% (or 357koz) to 11.9Moz in H1 FY16 as the
average silver ore grade remained largely unchanged.
Conversely, a significant increase in the average zinc ore
grade and recovery underpinned a 13% increase in zinc
production to a record 41.8kt. FY16 production guidance
remains unchanged (payable silver 21.65Moz, payable
lead 175kt, payable zinc 80kt) as the mine plan delivers
an increase in the ratio of zinc to lead concentrate over
the remainder of the year.

Costs

Operating unit costs declined by 15% to US$153/t. This
largely reflected a favourable movement in foreign exchange
rate markets and a reduction in labour costs and contractor
spend. By the end of FY17, the employee and contractor
headcount will have decreased by approximately 17%
relative to the average employee and contractor headcount in
FY15.

Further initiatives to increase labour productivity and
operational efficiencies are being pursued, including a
renewed focus on procurement, which is expected to deliver
a US$20M saving in FY17.

Financial performance

Underlying EBIT declined by US$17M to US$141M. Lower
average realised prices, net of price-linked costs, and sales
volumes reduced Underlying EBIT by US$58M. This was
largely offset by a favourable movement in exchange rate
markets (+US$33M).

Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of
Cannington concentrates reduced Underlying EBIT by
US$19M in H1 FY16 (-US$43M in FY15; -US$40M in
H1 FY15). Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 5.2Moz
of silver, 45.7kt of lead and 16.0kt of zinc) were revalued at
31 December 2015. The final price of these sales will be
determined in H2 FY16.

Capital expenditure was largely unchanged at US$15M.

PRO FORMA RECONCILIATIONS

BACKGROUND

Effective 15 May 2015, BHP Billiton shares ceased trading with an entitlement to South32 shares. On 18 May 2015, South32 Limited was listed
as a separate standalone entity on the Australian Securities Exchange on a deferred settlement basis, on the London Stock Exchange on a
when-issued basis and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on a normal settlement basis. Economic separation and distribution of South32
shares to shareholders became effective from 25 May 2015.

Prior to the demerger, the South32 Group and the BHP Billiton Group were required to undertake a number of internal share and asset transfers
in connection with the corporate restructure (Internal Restructure).

STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

As required, statutory financial information for the South32 Group has been presented for the financial half year ended 31 December 2015 (H1
FY16) and the financial half year ended 31 December 2014 (H1 FY15). The South32 Group's H1 FY15 statutory financial information only
includes the results of the current South32 Group operations (also referred to as ""operations"") from their date of acquisition during the half year
as part of the Internal Restructure(17) (being Brazil Alumina). The exception is Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, which was part of the South32 Group
at 1 July 2013. The South32 Group's H1 FY15 statutory financial information also includes:

     -     The results of New Mexico Coal for the period 1 July 2014 to 27 October 2014, being the date that it ceased to be part of the South32
           Group as a result of the Internal Restructure; and
     -     Finance charges on internal borrowings from the BHP Billiton Group in the period.

Accordingly, as a result of the Internal Restructure, the statutory financial information for H1 FY15 does not reflect the performance of the
South32 Group as it is currently structured.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

To assist shareholders in their understanding of the South32 Group, pro forma financial information for H1 FY15 has been prepared to reflect the
business as it is now structured and as though it was in effect for the period 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2014. The pro forma financial
information is not prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The following pro forma adjustments, including the associated tax effect, have been made on a basis consistent with those contemplated in the
South32 Listing Documents:

     -     Equity accounting of the South32 manganese assets (comprising South Africa Manganese, Australia Manganese and Samancor AG)
           from 1 July 2013 (refer note 4(c) of the Group's 2015 financial statements); and
     -     Excluding net finance costs charged by the BHP Billiton Group.

Additional pro forma adjustments, including the associated tax effect, have also been made in the presentation of pro forma financial information.
These include:

     -     Reflecting changes in corporate costs associated with South32 Limited becoming a stand-alone group as if those costs had been
           incurred from 1 July 2014;
     -     Excluding demerger related major corporate restructuring costs; and
     -     Including certain significant tax expense items such as the Brazil Alumina tax accounting adjustments.

A reconciliation between the pro forma financial information and the statutory financial information is included. The statutory financial information,
reconciliations and pro forma financial information have not been audited or reviewed by the Group's external auditor.

The following tables reconcile pro forma and statutory earnings for H1 FY15.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The segment reporting information for the South32 operations for H1 FY16 and pro forma H1 FY15 is set out below. The
segment information reflects South32's interest in its manganese assets on a proportional consolidation basis, which is the
measure that is used by South32 management to assess the performance of the manganese assets. The statutory

(a)   Third party product sold comprises US$358 million for aluminium, US$46 million for coal and US$ nil for other. Underlying EBIT on third party products comprises US$17 million for aluminium, 
      US$13 million for coal and US$ nil for other.
(b)   Share of profit/(loss) of equity accounted investments includes the impacts of earnings adjustments to Underlying EBIT.
(c)   Excludes interest income and interest expense on borrowings with BHP Billiton.

NOTES

(1)   Controllable costs are measured on a cash basis (including equity accounted investments) and exclude significant items, inter-segment sales, foreign
      exchange rate movements, country specific inflation, price-linked costs and discontinued/suspended operations. Any controllable cost movement is
      defined in absolute terms compared to H1 FY15 and is not a measure of unit cost performance.
(2)   Total capital expenditure comprises Capital expenditure, the purchase of intangibles and capitalised exploration expenditure. Capital expenditure
      comprises Sustaining capital expenditure and Major projects capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure comprises Stay-in-business (SIB),
      Minor discretionary and Deferred stripping (including underground development) capital expenditure.
(3)   Redundancy and restructuring charges are pre-tax. These charges will be excluded from the Group's Underlying earnings measures.

(4)   The pro forma and statutory financial information reflects continuing operations and therefore excludes the contribution of the New Mexico Coal asset.
(5)   Percentage change has not been disclosed for statutory results on the basis that the variances between H1 FY16 and H1 FY15 are substantially
      different due to the impact of the Internal Restructure prior to demerger. Information in respect of the demerger is detailed in note 3 to the Financial
      Information.
(6)   Revenue includes revenue from third party products.
(7)   Pro forma H1 FY15 basic earnings per share is calculated as pro forma Profit/(loss) after taxation from continuing operations divided by the number
      of shares on issue at 31 December 2014. Pro forma H1 FY15 basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as pro forma Underlying earnings
      divided by the number of shares on issue at 31 December 2015.
(8)   Underlying EBIT is profit from continuing operations before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustment items, including impairments.
      Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of South32's share of net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is
      Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings is Profit/(loss) after taxation and earnings adjustment items. Underlying
      earnings is the key measure that South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and
      assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 operations and operational management are
      assessed based on Underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA, the following items are
      adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:

           -     Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;

           -     Impairment losses/reversals;

           -     Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;

           -     Fair value gain/loss on derivative instruments;

           -     Major corporate restructures; and

           -     The income tax impact of the above items.

      In addition, items that do not reflect the underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial statements, are excluded to
      determine Underlying earnings. Significant items are detailed in note 4(iii) to the Financial Information.

(9)   Comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.

(10) Comprises Underlying EBIT excluding third party product EBIT, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue.
(11) Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a key measure that South32 uses to assess performance. ROIC is calculated as annualised Underlying EBIT
     (annualised pro forma Underlying EBIT for H1 FY15) less the discount on rehabilitation provisions included in net finance cost, tax effected by the
     Group's Underlying ETR, divided by the sum of fixed assets (excluding any rehabilitation asset and other non-cash adjustments) and inventories.
     Manganese is included in the calculation on a proportional consolidation basis.
(12) Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) is the Underlying income tax expense (pro forma Underlying income tax expense for H1 FY15) excluding royalty
     related taxation divided by Underlying profit before tax (pro forma Underlying profit before tax for H1 FY15); both the numerator and denominator
     exclude equity accounted investments.
(13) South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100% until employee share ownership plan (ESOP) and broad-based black economic
     empowerment (B-BBEE) vendor loans are repaid.
(14) Projected operating unit costs, including Sustaining capital expenditure, and Sustaining capital expenditure for FY17 include royalties (where
     appropriate) and the influence of exchange rate assumptions, and are predicated on: an alumina price of US$255/t; an average blended coal price of
     US$65/t for Illawarra Metallurgical Coal; a manganese ore price of US$2.00/dmtu for 44% manganese product; a nickel price of US$3.75/lb; an
     AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.68; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.12; and a USD:COP exchange rate of 3,170; all of which reflect forward markets
     at the end of the period or our internal expectations.
(15) Underlying net finance cost and Underlying taxation expense are actual H1 FY16 results, not year-on-year variances.
(16) Third party product sold comprises US$138M for aluminium (H1 FY15: US$358M), US$50M for freight services (H1 FY15: nil), US$28M for coal (H1
     FY15: US$46M), US$11M for alumina (H1 FY15: nil) and US$63M for others (H1 FY15: nil). Underlying EBIT on third party products for H1 FY16 was
     nil. H1 FY15 Underlying EBIT on third party products comprised US$17M for aluminium, US$13M for coal and nil for other.
(17) The South32 Group acquired each of the following operations on the respective dates in parentheses: Worsley Alumina (8 May 2015), South Africa
     Aluminium (2 February 2015), Mozal Aluminium (27 March 2015), Brazil Alumina (3 July 2014), South Africa Energy Coal (2 February 2015),
     Australia Manganese (8 May 2015), South Africa Manganese (3 February 2015), Cerro Matoso (2 February 2015), and Cannington (31 January
     2015).

     2015 financial year is abbreviated to H1 FY15; financial year (FY), grams per tonne (g/t); tonnes (t); thousand tonnes (kt); thousand tonnes per

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – ABOUT THIS REPORT

The consolidated financial statements of South32 Limited referred to as the ""Company"" and its subsidiaries and joint
operations (collectively, the ""South32 Group"") for the half year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue in
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 25 February 2016.

1.       Reporting entity

South32 Limited is a for-profit company limited by shares incorporated in Australia with a primary listing on the Australian
Securities Exchange, a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the South32 Group are described in note 4
Segment information.

2.       Basis of preparation

The half year financial statements are a general purpose condensed financial report which:

-    Have been prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
     and the Corporations Act 2001
-    Have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial
     assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value
-    Are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the majority of the Group's operations, and all values
     are rounded to the nearest million dollars (US$M or US$ million) unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC
     Class Order 98/100
-    Present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current period's presentation
     and
-    Have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied
     in the 30 June 2015 annual financial statements.

In preparing these half year financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015.

For a full understanding of the financial performance and financial position of the South32 Group it is recommended that
the half year financial statements be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June
2015. Consideration should also be given to any public announcements made by the Company during the half year
ended 31 December 2015 in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the ASX Listing Rules.

The following exchange rates relative to the US dollar have been applied in the financial statements.

3.      South32 Limited demerger

Effective 15 May 2015, BHP Billiton shares ceased trading with an entitlement to South32 shares. On 18 May 2015
South32 Limited was listed as a separate standalone entity on the Australian Securities Exchange on a deferred
settlement basis, on the London Stock Exchange on a when-issued basis and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on
a normal settlement basis. The demerger resulted in economic separation at the close of business London time on 22
May 2015 (being 23 May 2015 Melbourne time) with the settlement of intercompany balances between the South32
Group and the BHP Billiton Group. South32 shares were transferred to eligible BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc
shareholders on 24 May 2015 and 25 May 2015, respectively. Economic separation and distribution of South32 shares
to shareholders became effective from 25 May 2015. Further information on businesses acquired and disposed, as well
as the change in control with respect to the manganese operations is disclosed in the South32 Group's 2015 Annual
Report.

4.      Segment information

(i)     Description of segments

The operating segments (also referred to as ""operations"") are organised and managed separately according to the
nature of products produced.

The members of the executive management team (the ""chief operating decision maker"") and the Board of Directors
monitor the segment results regularly for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance
assessment.

The segment information reflects South32's interest in the manganese operations and is presented on a proportional
consolidation basis, which is the measure used by South32's management to assess the performance of the manganese
operations. The manganese operations are equity accounted in the consolidated financial statements. The statutory
adjustment column reconciles the proportional consolidation to the equity accounting position.

The principal activities of each reporting segment, as the South32 Group is currently structured, are summarised as
follows:

Operating segment              Principal activities
Worsley Alumina                Integrated bauxite mine and alumina refinery in Western Australia
South Africa Aluminium         Aluminium smelter in Richards Bay
Brazil Alumina                 Alumina refinery in Brazil
Mozal Aluminium                Aluminium smelter in Mozambique
South Africa Energy Coal       Open-cut and underground energy coal mines and processing operations in South Africa
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal   Underground metallurgical coal mines in New South Wales
Australia Manganese            Producer of manganese ore in the Northern Territory and manganese alloys in Tasmania
South Africa Manganese         Integrated producer of manganese ore and alloy in South Africa
Cerro Matoso                   Integrated laterite ferronickel mining and smelting complex in Colombia
Cannington                     Silver, lead and zinc mine in Queensland

The South32 Group separately discloses sales of group production from sales of third party products because of the
significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.

Group and unallocated items/eliminations represent group centre functions and consolidation adjustments. Group
financing (including finance cost and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a South32 Group basis and are
not allocated to operating segments.

It is the South32 Group's policy that inter-segment transactions are made on a commercial basis.
The following tables present revenue and profit information about the operations for the half year ended 31 December
2015 and 2014, respectively.

Impairments recognised

As a result of significant and continued weakening of commodity markets, the Group recognised the following
impairments and associated tax effect at 31 December 2015. The forecast weakening of commodity prices has also
impacted the probability of generating longer term taxable income for certain South32 operations and therefore resulted
in the derecognition of specific deferred tax asset balances in the half year ended 31 December 2015. An impairment at
Brazil Alumina recognised at 31 December 2015 was as a result of the continued and indefinite suspension of smelting
operations. The following table shows the categorisation of the amounts within earnings adjustments:

Australia Manganese (equity accounted investment)

The Australia Manganese equity accounted investment impairment of US$916 million includes full impairment of the
remaining fair value uplift applied in advance of the demerger of US$726 million, impairment of the Group's share of
property, plant and equipment of US$228 million and the recognition of an associated tax benefit of US$91 million. The
Group's share of deferred tax assets of US$53 million associated with provisions for future restoration and rehabilitation
were derecognised as utilisation is no longer probable. The recoverable amount of the equity accounted investment was
determined as US$376 million based on its fair value less cost of disposal (""FVLCD"").

South Africa Manganese (equity accounted investment)

The South Africa Manganese equity accounted investment impairment of US$97 million includes impairment of the
Group's share of property, plant and equipment of the equity accounted investment of US$45 million, impairment of the
Group's share of available for sale investments of the equity accounted investment of US$36 million and recognition of
an associated tax benefit on the impairments of US$10 million. The Group's share of deferred tax assets of US$26
million associated with provisions for future restoration and rehabilitation were derecognised as utilisation is no longer
probable. The recoverable amount of the equity accounted investment was determined as US$321 million based on its
FVLCD.


Manganese Marketing (equity accounted investment)

The Manganese Marketing equity accounted investment (Samancor AG) impairment of US$64 million relates to
impairment of the fair value uplift. The recoverable amount of the equity accounted investment was determined as
US$81 million based on its FVLCD.

South Africa Energy Coal

The South Africa Energy Coal impairment of US$442 million includes US$322 million for property, plant and equipment
at the Wolvekrans Middelburg Complex (tax benefit of US$89 million) and US$120 million for property, plant and
equipment at the Klipspruit Colliery (tax benefit of US$33 million). The recoverable amount of the Wolvekrans Middelburg
Complex and Klipspruit Colliery cash generating units were determined as -US$57 million and US$77 million
respectively, and were determined based on the FVLCD of each cash generating unit.

The available for sale investments impairment of US$76 million is associated with South African coal activities (tax
benefit of US$18 million). A charge has been recognised in the income statement rather than in Other Comprehensive
Income as a prolonged reduction in fair value is judged to represent an impairment.
South Africa Energy Coal deferred tax assets of US$126 million associated with provisions for future restoration and
rehabilitation were derecognised as utilisation is no longer probable.

Brazil Alumina

The Brazil Alumina smelter impairment of US$97 million includes US$65 million for property, plant and equipment and
US$32 million relating to smelter consumables and indirect tax assets (tax benefit of US$33 million). The recoverable
amount of the Brazil Alumina smelter cash generating unit was determined as -US$11 million based on its FVLCD. The
valuation specifically considered the likelihood of restarting smelting operations, taking into account the continued and
indefinite suspension of smelting operations.

Basis of fair value measurements

The above fair value measurements are categorised as Level 3 fair values based on the inputs in the valuation models.
In determining the FVLCD, a real post tax discount rate of 8.5%, and a country risk premium of up to 2%, were applied to
the post tax forecast cash flows expressed in real terms. The cash flows are forecast to the end of the life of operation
and include future projects which are risked for uncertainties. The key assumptions used for commodity prices are
comparable to market consensus forecasts at the date of testing, and foreign exchange rates are aligned with forward
market rates.

Set-up costs
Set-up costs related to the ongoing establishment of South32's corporate and regional offices following the demerger.
The costs primarily relate to transitionary contractor and consultant support, information technology infrastructure and
system support. The amount recognised is inclusive of US$30 million paid to BHP Billiton under an agreement for
information technology services. Those costs relate to all operating segments. All remaining set-up costs relate to group
and unallocated items within the segment note.

Derecognition of deferred tax assets

As a result of the significant and continued weakening of commodity markets, certain deferred tax assets associated with
provisions for restoration and rehabilitation were derecognised as utilisation is no longer probable.

Adjustment to Australian tax balances post-demerger including reset of tax assets

The tax basis of South32 wholly owned Australian operations was reset on demerger from BHP Billiton. The net increase
to tax assets is charged to income tax expense during the half year ended 31 December 2015.

Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax Legislation

On 2 September 2014, legislation to repeal the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (""MRRT"") in Australia received the support
of both Houses of Parliament. The repeal took effect on 30 September 2014 and as a result, the South32 Group
derecognised a MRRT deferred tax asset in relation to Illawarra Metallurgical Coal. The impact of this derecognition and
all other MRRT related amounts resulted in an income tax expense of US$96 million.

Measurement of fair value

The following table shows the South32 Group's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value with reference to the
nature of valuation inputs used:

     Level 1 -   Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial assets and
                 liabilities.
     Level 2 -   Valuation is based on inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) that are observable for the
                 financial asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
     Level 3 -   Valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Sensitivity analysis

The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities that are valued using inputs other than observable market data are
calculated using appropriate valuation models, including discounted cash flow modelling, with inputs such as commodity
prices, foreign exchange rates and inflation. The potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in
these models, based on a change in the most significant input by 10% while holding all other variables constant, is
shown in the following table.

9.        Employee share ownership plans

The South32 Group established new employee long term incentive plans during the half year ended 31 December 2015.

Awards were granted to Executive Committee members on 4 December 2015 under the following plans:

-    the FY16 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI)
-    the FY15 Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (STI) and
-    the FY16 Transitional Award Plan (TSP)

Awards were granted to eligible employees on 30 October 2015 under the following plans:

-    the FY16 Management Share Plan (MSP)
-    the FY16 Advance Award Plan (AAP)
-    the FY16 Transition Award Plan (TAP)
-    the FY15 Deferred Shares Plan (GSTIP)
-    the FY15 MAP Replacement Plan (MAP) and
-    the 2015 AllShare Plan (ASP)

Description of general share-based payment conditions

Awards take the form of rights to receive one ordinary share in South32 Ltd for each right granted, subject to
performance (LTI, TSP, MSP, AAP and TAP awards) and service conditions being met. A portion of the 2015 AllShare
Plan awards (participants located in Colombia and Mozambique) take the form of rights to receive a cash payment
equivalent to the value of South32 Ltd ordinary shares at the time of payment.

Performance rights fair value are measured using a Monte Carlo methodology and retention rights are measured using a
Black Scholes methodology.

Performance conditions are based on the South32 Group's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured separately
against two comparator indexes over the performance period as follows:

-    One third of performance rights are measured against the Morgan Stanley Capital Index World and
-    Two thirds of performance rights are measured against the Euromoney Global Mining Index (constrained by
     company and sector).

Performance rights vest when South32's TSR equals or outperforms the comparator index. Full vesting of performance
rights occur if South32's TSR outperforms both indexes by at least 5.5% per annum. To the extent that the performance
conditions are not met, awards are forfeited and no retesting is performed.

Awards do not confer any dividend or voting rights until they convert into ordinary shares at vesting. In addition, the
awards do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue, however, there is discretion under the plans to adjust the
awards in response to a variation in South32 Ltd's share capital.

Further detail of each award is provided below. Details of other incentive plans established by South32 subsequent to
demerger can be found in the South32 Group 2015 Annual Report.

Description of recurring share-based payment arrangements

The awards listed below are subject to the general conditions noted above and may be granted annually subject to
approval by shareholders at the annual general meeting for awards to the CEO and by the board of directors for all other
awards.

FY16 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI)

The LTI is South32's long term incentive plan for Executive Committee members. Awards have a four year performance
period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2019.

FY15 Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (STI)

The STI is South32's short term incentive plan for Executive Committee members. Awards vest on 30 June 2017
provided participants remain employed by South32.

FY16 Management Share Plan (MSP)

The MSP is South32's long term incentive plan for eligible employees below the Executive Committee. The MSP
comprises two elements:

-    Retention Rights vesting on 30 June 2018 provided participants remain employed by South32 and
-    Performance Rights vesting on 30 June 2019 subject to performance conditions.

2015 AllShare Plan (ASP)

The ASP is South32's employee share plan for employees not eligible to participate in the other employee share plans.
Awards will vest provided participants remain employed by South32. The vesting period depends on the participants'
location at the grant date:

-    Participants in Africa: August 2018 and
-    Participants elsewhere: August 2017.

Awards to the value of at least US$1,250 per employee will be granted annually.

Description of transitional share-based payment arrangements

The awards listed below are subject to the general conditions noted above and will not be granted on an ongoing basis.

FY16 Transitional Award Plan (TSP)

The TSP is a one-off grant made to Executive Committee members in recognition of their adjustment from a three year
LTI plan under the BHP Billiton incentive structure to a four year LTI Plan at South32. Awards have a three year
performance period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2018.

FY16 Advance Award Plan (AAP)

The AAP is a one-off grant made to all MSP participants in recognition of the different vesting periods under the MSP
retention rights and MSP performance rights. The awards have a three year performance period from 1 July 2015 to 30
June 2018.

FY16 Transition Award Plan (TAP)

The TAP is a grant made to certain eligible employees to bridge the gap between their total target reward at BHP Billiton
and their total target reward at South32. Transition Awards will be made for a maximum of five years post demerger
(FY2020).

The TAP has the same conditions as the MSP and comprises both service and performance conditions.

FY15 Deferred Shares Plan (GSTIP)

The GSTIP is a one-off grant made to individuals who were participating in the BHP Billiton Group Short Term Incentive
Plan (GSTIP) prior to demerger. Since the BHP Billiton STI plan was in place for FY2015, the STI outcomes for
participants who have joined South32 have been delivered in accordance with the BHP Billiton plan (i.e. 50% of the
outcome in cash, 50% in share awards) except the awards are rights to South32 Ltd ordinary shares, not BHP Billiton
ordinary shares.

There are no performance conditions attached to the GSTIP awards. Awards vest on 30 June 2017 provided participants
remain employed by South32.

FY15 MAP Replacement Plan (MAP)

The MAP is a one-off grant which has been made to eligible employees to replace the BHP Billiton MAP award they
would have received in March 2015 had they remained employed by BHP Billiton. Awards are made at an equivalent
value, on equivalent terms and conditions and with the same vesting date as for the BHP Billiton MAP Award. There are
no performance conditions attached to the awards. Awards will vest at the end of the vesting period (three years from
grant of the original BHP Billiton award) provided participants remain employed by South32.

Measurement of fair values

The fair value at grant date of equity-settled share awards is charged to the income statement over the period for which
the benefits of employee services are expected to be derived. The corresponding accrued employee entitlement is
recorded in the employee share awards reserve.
                                                                                                                                           Risk-free

10.      Subsequent events

On 4 February 2016 the Group announced that it had completed a strategic review of the Samancor Manganese Joint
Venture following the suspension of mining activity at the Hotazel Manganese Mines in November 2015. As a result,
mining activity restarted at South Africa Manganese, but at a substantially reduced rate and with greater flexibility, with
optimised mine plans, redundancies and other restructuring initiatives being undertaken. One of four furnaces will
continue to operate at the Metalloys smelter.
On 25 February 2016 the Group announced major restructuring initiatives that will reset the cost base of its Worsley
Alumina, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Australia Manganese and Cerro Matoso operations.

Events subsequent to the balance date

On 4 February 2016 the Group announced that it had completed a strategic review of the Samancor Manganese Joint
Venture following the suspension of mining activity at the Hotazel Manganese Mines in November 2015. As a result,
mining activity restarted at South Africa Manganese, but at a substantially reduced rate and with greater flexibility, with
optimised mine plans, redundancies and other restructuring initiatives being undertaken. One of four furnaces will
continue to operate at the Metalloys smelter.

On 25 February 2016 the Group announced major restructuring initiatives that will reset the cost base of its Worsley
Alumina, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Australia Manganese and Cerro Matoso operations.

             SOUTH32 TO RESET ITS COST BASE IN AUSTRALIA AND COLOMBIA


South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32) (“South32”) today announced a series of restructuring
initiatives that will reset the cost base of its Worsley Alumina, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Australia
Manganese and Cerro Matoso operations.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said: “Our financial results highlight both the
strength of our financial position and the opportunity that lies ahead. The initiatives that we have
announced today across our Australian and Colombian operations are central to our strategy. The
continued optimisation of our high quality operations will strengthen underlying cash flow in what
remains a challenging environment.

“The refinement of our regional operating model allows us to remove additional layers of
management while further aggregating functional support. As a result, we expect another
significant increase in labour productivity and a corresponding reduction in cash costs. When
combined with our broad-based focus on all procurement activities, we are well positioned to
significantly exceed our costs savings target, both in terms of quantum and timing.

“Operating unit costs, including sustaining capital expenditure, will move sharply lower at our
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal, Cerro Matoso and Worsley Alumina operations, mitigating cash
outflows and solidifying their position at the low end of industry cost curves 1 . In addition, the
reconfiguration of our leading Australia Manganese mine, GEMCO, will ensure that it becomes a
positive contributor to free cash flow at current prices.”

Worsley Alumina (86% share)

Operational performance at Worsley Alumina continues to be optimised following the completion
of the US$3.2B (South32 share) Efficiency and Growth project in June 2011, which positioned the
operation as one of the largest refineries in the industry. Incremental capacity creep is anticipated
beyond the current rate of production 2 , while a number of restructuring initiatives are being
implemented to reduce operating unit costs, including sustaining capital expenditure, to
approximately US$200/t3 in FY17.


Note: In August 2015, we announced a commitment to reduce our annual controllable cost base,
including equity accounted investments, by at least US$350M before end FY18.
1 Illawarra Metallurgical Coal is at the high end of the industry margin curve to account for coal quality

differentials.
2 Production guidance increase to 4.61Mt in FY17 (100% basis).
3 Projected operating unit costs are predicated on an alumina price of US$255/t for royalty calculations

and an average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.68.


Registered Office: Level 35, 108 St Georges Terrace, Perth Western Australia 6000, Australia
ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia
These initiatives include:

    -   The fundamental reorganisation of mining and refining into two operations and the removal
        of layers of management and functional support;
    -   The reduction of approximately 390 employees and contractors before the end of FY16,
        equivalent to 15% of the employee and contractor headcount at the end of FY15;
    -   A circa 3% lift in refinery availability and utilisation;
    -   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities to the region, which is expected
        to deliver a circa US$65M (South32 share) saving in FY17;
    -   The continued optimisation of the coal to gas fuel mix in the co-generation power facility;
        and
    -   A 34%4 reduction in sustaining capital expenditure to approximately US$41M4 (South32
        share) in FY17.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of approximately US$15M (South32 share)
are anticipated at Worsley Alumina in the June 2016 half year. These charges will be excluded
from the Group’s Underlying earnings measures.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal (100%)

Over the 18 months to the end of December 2015, Illawarra Metallurgical Coal reduced its
employee and contractor headcount by 100 and operating unit costs, including sustaining capital
expenditure and underground development, by 34%5. To mitigate the impact of lower prices, a
number of restructuring initiatives are being implemented in order to reduce operating unit costs,
including sustaining capital expenditure and underground development, by 37%6 to approximately
US$66/t6 in FY17.

These initiatives include:

    -   The fundamental reorganisation of the mining complex into two operations and the
        removal of layers of management and functional support;
    -   The reduction of at least 300 employees and contractors before the end of FY16,
        equivalent to 14% of the employee and contractor headcount at the end of FY15;
    -   An increase in longwall utilisation at the Appin and Dendrobium mines, and the completion
        of the Appin Area 9 project, which will increase production to approximately 9.5Mt in FY17;
    -   The continued aggregation of our procurement activities to the region, which is expected
        to deliver a circa US$50M saving in FY17; and
    -   A 58%4 reduction in sustaining capital expenditure and underground development to
        approximately US$108M4 in FY17.

The Appin Area 9 project will be completed in the March 2016 quarter, meaning that annualised
capital expenditure, including deferred development of US$104M in the December 2015 half year
will not carry forward beyond that point. Underground development (of approximately US$58Mpa)
is not being compromised given a commitment to maximise long-term value, although we do retain
the flexibility to curtail this activity in the future.

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of approximately US$10M are anticipated at
Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in the June 2016 half year. These charges will be excluded from the
Group’s Underlying earnings measures.

Australia Manganese (60% share)

To ensure GEMCO retains its leading, low-cost position in the manganese industry, the operations’
mining and processing plans are being reconfigured. As a result, guidance for manganese saleable
ore production in FY17 is lowered by 4% to 5.2Mt (100% basis). At the same time, a double digit
improvement in labour productivity and a substantial reduction in procurement costs are expected
to more than offset a 27% increase in the mining strip ratio (from 3.0 to 3.8) between FY15 and
FY17. Consequently, operating unit costs, including sustaining capital expenditure, are expected
to decline by 43%7 to approximately US$1.56/dmtu7 in FY17.

Specific measures being taken to reposition GEMCO include:

    -    A revised ramp-up of the Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) project following its
         completion in the June 2016 quarter;
    -    The reduction of approximately 82 employees and contractors before the end of FY16,
         equivalent to 8% of the employee and contractor headcount at the end of FY15, and the
         decision not to recruit an additional 55 roles largely related to the PC02 project;
    -    A targeted 6% increase in the productivity of the mining fleet;
    -    The continued aggregation of our procurement activities to the region, which is expected
         to deliver a circa US$10M (South32 share) saving in FY17; and
    -    A 56%4 reduction in sustaining capital expenditure to approximately US$40M4 (South32
         share) in FY17.

Redundancy costs are not anticipated at GEMCO, despite the meaningful reduction in employees
and contractors.

Cerro Matoso (99.9% share)

Cerro Matoso has been one of the industry’s most successful ferro-nickel operations. To ensure
Cerro Matoso remains competitive amidst declining ore grades and an increasing reliance on
stockpiled ore, the operation must significantly increase labour productivity and reduce costs. In
this regard, a series of restructuring initiatives are expected to deliver a 30%8 reduction in operating
unit costs, including sustaining capital expenditure, to approximately US$3.90/lb8 in FY17.

These initiatives include:

    -    The reduction of at least 350 employees and contractors before the end of FY16,
         equivalent to 18% of the employee and contractor headcount at the end of FY15;
    -    The continued aggregation of our procurement activities to the region, which is expected
         to deliver a circa US$37M saving in FY17; and
    -    A 56%9 reduction in sustaining capital expenditure to approximately US$16M9 in FY17.




7 Compares projected operating unit costs in FY17 with FY15. Projected operating unit costs are predicated
on a manganese ore price of US$2.00/dmtu (44% manganese product) for royalty calculations and an
average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.68.
8 Projected operating unit costs are predicated on a nickel price of US$3.75/lb for royalty calculations and an

average USD:COP exchange rate 3,170.
9 Compares projected capital expenditure in FY17 with FY15, and FY17 is predicated on an average

Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of approximately US$2M are anticipated at
Cerro Matoso in the June 2016 half year. These charges will be excluded from the Group’s
Underlying earnings measures.

                      SOUTH32 ANNOUNCES MAJOR RESTRUCTURING PLANS
                                 AND NON-CASH CHARGES


South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32) (“South32”) today announced the outcome of the South
Africa Manganese strategic review and its intention to substantially reduce cash costs at a number
of operations.

As a result of a downward revision to forecast commodity demand and prices, South32 also
advises that it expects to book pre-tax, non-cash charges of approximately US$1.7B
(post-tax US$1.7B) when it reports its December 2015 half year financial results.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said: “The completion of the South Africa
Manganese strategic review is important for our Company as it will allow us to re-base manganese
ore production at a significantly lower level while reducing Rand denominated mine gate costs by
a commensurate amount. When combined with the restructuring initiatives that are currently being
finalised at many operations across our portfolio, we expect to further strengthen our financial
position and increase our cash generating capacity through the cycle.

“We will continue to focus on the things that we can control; safety, volume, costs and capital
expenditure, as we seek to optimise the performance of our operations. This strategy to maximise
value rather than volume, our high quality operations and well-defined financial policies underpin
our resilience at current commodity prices and we remain exceptionally well positioned for any
improvement in industry fundamentals.

“We are, however, not immune to external influences and the significant change in the outlook for
commodity prices is expected to result in non-cash charges of approximately US$1.7B when we
report our December 2015 half year financial results.”

Significantly reducing production volumes and costs at South Africa Manganese

In response to a sharp decline in manganese ore and alloy prices, South32, as 60% owner and
operator of the largest manganese business globally (the Samancor Manganese Joint Venture),
suspended mining activity at the Hotazel Manganese Mines (Hotazel) in November 2015. This
suspension removed around 700kt of manganese ore production from the global supply chain and
inventories at the Hotazel mines have declined substantially as a result.


With the strategic review complete, mining activity will restart at South Africa Manganese with
immediate effect, but at a substantially reduced rate and with greater flexibility. Subject to market
conditions, the Hotazel mines will ramp-up to a saleable production rate of 2.9Mtpa (100% basis),
taking approximately 900ktpa or 23% 1 of saleable production out of the market for the foreseeable
future. At the same time, optimised mine plans, redundancies and other restructuring initiatives
are expected to reduce Rand denominated mine gate costs 2 by a commensurate amount. Annual
sustaining capital expenditure is also expected to decline by approximately 80% 3 to US$7M 4
(South32 share) in FY17.

Specific measures being taken to reposition South Africa Manganese to ensure it is appropriately
structured for the current environment, yet flexible enough to benefit from an eventual recovery in
prices include:

-   The reduction of approximately 620 employees across the joint venture;
-   The acceleration of the second phase of the Central Block development project at Wessels
    (US$19M budget, South32 share) 5 , which will enable mining to relocate closer to critical
    infrastructure and reduce cycle times;
-   A 36%1 reduction in saleable production at the Wessels mine to 740ktpa (100% basis);
-   The optimisation of the mining and processing footprint at Mamatwan, where saleable
    production will be reduced by approximately 18%1 to 2.2Mtpa (100% basis); and
-   The continued operation of only one of four furnaces at the Metalloys smelter, which is now
    generating free cash flow.

As part of the review, the Company engaged with employees, union and government
representatives. Pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, of approximately US$10M
(South32 share) are anticipated in FY16.

Broader restructuring to further optimise our operations and maximise cash flow

The demerger of South32 has given greater focus to our operations and has created the necessary
environment for our employees to enact change and improve performance. Our teams are
currently finalising plans that will deliver a meaningful reduction in costs at Illawarra Metallurgical
Coal, Cerro Matoso, Worsley Alumina and Australia Manganese. These initiatives are expected to
result in a substantial reduction in employee numbers during the remainder of FY16 and will be
detailed in our December 2015 half year financial results.

Non-cash charges to reflect the downward rebasing of demand and price forecasts

South32 is finalising its financial statements in preparation for its December 2015 half year financial
results, which will be released on 25 February 2016. In this regard, the downward revision to
forecast commodity demand and prices is expected to result in pre-tax, non-cash charges of
approximately US$1.7B (US$1.7B post-tax). These charges will be excluded from the Group’s
Underlying earnings measures in the December 2015 half year.

CORPORATE UPDATE

-    During the December 2015 half year, South32 invested US$7M on exploration, of which US$2M will be capitalised.
     Our exploration activities focused on metallurgical coal and silver in Australia, and nickel in Colombia.
-    A review of corporate functional support completed during the December 2015 half year is expected to deliver an
     annualised saving of approximately US$30M in FY16 Group and Unallocated costs. Corporate functional
     expenditure of approximately US$100M is expected in the 2016 financial year.
-    South32's Underlying effective tax rate (ETR) largely reflects the geographic distribution of the Group’s profit. The
     corporate tax rates applicable to South32 include: Australia 30%; South Africa 28%; Colombia 39%; and Brazil
     34%. It should, however, be recognised that permanent differences have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s
     tax rate when commodity prices and profit margins are compressed. In this context, an Underlying ETR [1] of
     approximately 35% is now expected for the December 2015 half year and this will rise for the full year should
     commodity prices and margins remain compressed.
-    South32 capital expenditure guidance for FY16 of US$700M was predicated on several assumptions, including an
     average AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.78 and average USD:ZAR exchange rate of 12.42. Updated capital
     expenditure guidance will be provided when the Company reports its December 2015 half year financial results to
     reflect the general appreciation of the US dollar against a basket of producer currencies, and the Group’s ongoing
     efforts to optimise its investment activities.
-    The Group’s current estimate for net debt [2] at 31 December 2015 is US$115M (US$196M at 30 September 2015
     and US$402M at 30 June 2015) and includes finance leases totalling US$595M (US$575M at 30 September 2015
     and US$631M at 30 June 2015). Our cash balance also incorporates a US$46M benefit following the resolution of
     legacy tax disputes during the December 2015 half year. The Group’s strong balance sheet remains a key point of
     differentiation and we are firmly committed to an investment grade credit rating.

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 40kt) to a record 1,993kt in the December 2015 half year as the
operations processed stockpiled alumina hydrate and benefitted from additional operating efficiency gains. The 2% decline
in sales reflected a timing difference as one shipment slipped into the March 2016 quarter.
Planned calciner maintenance in the December 2015 quarter led to a 7% QoQ reduction in saleable alumina production.
The next major calciner outage is now scheduled for the December 2016 quarter. FY16 saleable alumina production
guidance remains unchanged at 3.95Mt.

South Africa Aluminium saleable production of 352kt was largely unchanged in the December 2015 half year, while the
2% reduction in quarterly production volumes reflected our decision to suspend production in 22 pots in September 2015.
This suspension of activity is expected to deliver an incremental improvement in cash flow as planned pot relining activity
is deferred. A loss of 18kt is anticipated should the 22 pots remain offline for the remainder of FY16, with a marginal YoY
reduction in production likely.

Brazil Alumina saleable alumina production of 673kt was largely unchanged in the December 2015 half year and FY16
alumina production guidance of 1.32Mt remains unchanged. The 5% decline in sales reflected a timing difference as one
shipment slipped into the March 2016 quarter.
Aluminium production was first curtailed at Brazil Alumina in July 2013 and the suspension of all smelting activity was
announced in March 2015. With the economics unlikely to support the recommencement of smelting activity we have sold
forward power for the 2017 calendar year and served termination notice on our contract with Eletronorte for the remaining
years of the contract. As a result of this decision, power sales are not expected to contribute to Underlying EBIT beyond
FY16 as a minor provision will be booked in our June 2016 financial year statements to reflect the anticipated cash outflow
associated with this contract across the 2017 and 2018 financial years. Unhedged power sales, inclusive of this provision,
are now expected to contribute approximately BRL235M to Underlying EBIT in FY16 and will be skewed to the first half.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production decreased by 17% (or 782kt) to 3.96Mt in the December 2015 half year
as challenging geological conditions were encountered at the Appin and Dendrobium mines, and a planned longwall move
was completed during the December 2015 quarter. Another two longwall moves are expected to be completed in the
March 2016 quarter, consistent with the mine plan. Accordingly, FY16 saleable coal production has been lowered by 7%
to 8.25Mt (metallurgical coal 6.9Mt, energy coal 1.35Mt).

Cannington payable silver production decreased by a modest 3% (or 357koz) to 11.9Moz in the December 2015 half year
as the average silver ore grade remained largely unchanged. Conversely, a significant increase in the average zinc ore
grade and recovery underpinned a 13% increase in zinc production to a record 41.8kt. FY16 production guidance remains
unchanged (payable silver 21.65Moz, payable lead 175kt, payable zinc 80kt) as the mine plan will deliver an increase in
the ratio of zinc to lead concentrate over the remainder of the year.
Finalisation adjustments and the provisional pricing of Cannington concentrates will reduce Underlying EBIT by US$19M
in the December 2015 half year (-US$43M in the June 2015 financial year; -US$40M December 2014 half year).
Outstanding concentrate sales (containing 5.2Moz of silver, 45.7kt of lead and 16.0kt of zinc) were revalued at
31 December 2015. The final price of these sales will be determined in the second half of the 2016 financial year.




Notes:

1.   Provisional unaudited Underlying ETR for the December 2015 half year.
2.   Provisional unaudited net debt balance as at 31 December 2015.
3.   10% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and a broad-based black economic empowerment
     (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests owned by the ESOP and B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to
     South32 via distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, South32’s
     interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
4.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have been reported at 60%.
     The Group’s financial statement will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa Manganese ore.
5.   Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustments. Underlying EBIT is reported net of South32’s share of
     net finance costs and taxation of equity accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation.
6.   Figures in italics indicate that this figure has been adjusted since it was previously reported.

31 DECEMBER 2014 PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The demerger ASX Information Memorandum was published in March 2015 and included South32's pro forma financial
information for FY14 and H1 FY15. To assist shareholders in their understanding of the South32 Group, pro forma financial
information (non-IFRS financial information) was prepared to illustrate financial information of the South32 Group (Group) as
it was expected to be structured at 30 June 2015, and as though the Internal Restructure (refer below) had occurred as at 1 July 2013.

For the Group's FY15 pro forma financial information, additional adjustments were made to the Basis of Preparation to
include information that was not known when the ASX Information Memorandum was prepared. These adjustments were
disclosed in the South32 FY15 Annual Report.

The impact of the relevant adjustments, including the associated tax effect, has been incorporated into the previously
published H1 FY15 pro forma financial information on a consistent basis with FY15 and presented in this document.

Internal Restructure
South32 shares were transferred to eligible BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc shareholders on 24 May 2015 and 
25 May 2015, respectively. Economic separation and distribution of South32 shares to shareholders became effective from
25 May 2015. Prior to the demerger, the Group and BHP Billiton Group were required to undertake a number of internal
share and asset transfers in connection with the corporate restructure (Internal Restructure). As a result of the 
Internal Restructure, several entities, assets and liabilities were transferred to the Group and entities and assets and 
liabilities relating to the BHP Billiton Group were transferred out of the Group during FY15.

Basis of preparation
The Group's pro forma financial information has been derived from the statutory information of the Group and material
adjustments have been made to include the results of the current Group operations prior to the Internal Restructure and
other pro forma adjustments. The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the pro forma financial information and
believe that the basis of preparation fairly presents the Group's pro forma financial information for H1 FY15, including the pro
forma consolidated income statement, pro forma consolidated cash flow statement before financing activities and tax, and
after capital expenditure, and pro forma segment information.

The Group's pro forma financial information is intended for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to reflect the actual
financial performance that the Group would have obtained if the Group had operated as a stand-alone entity for the period
presented.

The Group's pro forma financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, including
the basis of preparation of the South32 Limited Financial Statements, as set out in the Notes to the Financial Statements
of the Group's 2015 Annual Report, including the recognition and measurement principles prescribed in IFRS and the
election to account for the acquisition of entities and net assets as common control transactions; except that IFRS does not
provide for:
- The preparation of Group financial information where the Group did not constitute a separate legal group during the
  relevant period; and
- The amendment of financial information for pro forma adjustments.

Reconciliations between the pro forma financial information and the unaudited statutory financial information are included.
The reconciliations and pro forma financial information are unaudited.

Notes

(1) Pro forma December 2014 half year (H1 FY15) basic earnings per share is calculated as pro forma profit after taxation
    from continuing operations divided by the number of shares on issue at 30 June 2015. Pro forma December 2014
    half year (H1 FY15) basic Underlying earnings per share is calculated as pro forma Underlying earnings divided by the
    number of shares on issue at 30 June 2015.
(2) Underlying EBIT is profit from continuing operations before net finance costs, taxation and any earnings adjustment
    items, including impairments. Underlying EBIT is reported inclusive of South32's share of net finance costs and
    taxation of equity-accounted investments. Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT, before depreciation and amortisation.
    Underlying earnings is Profit after taxation and earnings adjustment items. Underlying earnings is the key measure that
    South32 uses to assess the performance of the South32 Group, make decisions on the allocation of resources and
    assess senior management's performance. In addition, the performance of each of the South32 assets and operational
    management are assessed based on underlying EBIT. In order to calculate Underlying earnings, Underlying EBIT and
    Underlying EBITDA, the following items are adjusted as applicable each period, irrespective of materiality:
     - Exchange rate gains/losses on restatement of monetary items;
     - Impairment losses/reversals;
     - Net gain/loss on disposal and consolidation of interests in businesses;
     - Fair value gain/loss on derivative instruments;
     - Major corporate restructures; and
     - The income tax impact of the above items.
    In addition, items that do not reflect the Underlying operations of South32, and are individually significant to the financial
    statements, are excluded to determine Underlying earnings.
(3) The following abbreviations may be used throughout this report: US$ million (US$M); financial year (FY): Six months
    ending 31 December (H1), for example six months ended 31 December 2014 is abbreviated to H1 FY15.
