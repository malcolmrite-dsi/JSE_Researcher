Bond code: APFE
(“Accelerate”, “APF” or the “Company”)

ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL BY ACCELERATE OF PICK N PAY
FDC

1. INTRODUCTION

   Shareholders are advised that Accelerate (the “Seller”) has, entered into a sale of letting
   enterprise agreement (the “Agreement”) with Bellingan Properties (Pty) Ltd (the
   “Purchaser”), to dispose of Pick ‘n Pay FDC, Erf 3746 and Erf 3747 North End (“The
   Property”) situated in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, division of Port
   Elizabeth (“Pick n Pay FDC” or the “Property”) (“the Transaction”).

2. THE PROPERTY

   The Property forms part of Accelerate’s portfolio acquired by Accelerate on or about 19
   November 2014.

   As at 31 March 2020 the Property was valued at R 54 772 849 by management and is
   being sold for R 50 500 000 (“Consideration”) at a yield of 10.0%. The yield is based on
   current income collected from Pick ‘n Pay on a month to month basis.

3. THE CONSIDERATION AND APPLICATION OF THE SALE PROCEEDS

   The Consideration of R50 500 000 is in cash without any deduction or set-off whatsoever
   (the “Consideration”). APF intends to utilise the full sale proceeds towards the reduction
   of debt.

   The Transaction is classified as a category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings
   Requirements and accordingly does not require approval by Accelerate’s shareholders.

4. RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND UPDATE ON BALANCE SHEET
   OPTIMISATION STRATEGY

   Following the Fourways Equalisation, whereby Accelerate own 50% of the completed
   Fourways Mall Super Regional Centre, the Company has earmarked approximately R1,4
   billion of non-core properties for sale and set a target loan to value ratio (“LTV”) of below
   40%. It is the intention that the proceeds from the sale of these properties will be used to
   reduce debt.

5. KEY TRANSACTION TERMS

   The effective date for the Transaction will be the date on which the last of the conditions
   precedent are fulfilled or waived, as the case may be, which is expected to be during
   September 2020.

6. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     The closing of the Transaction is subject to the following conditions precedent:

     •    The Purchaser obtaining notification or the necessary funding of a minimum of 70%
          of the Purchase Price from a financial institution within 25 days of signature of the

     •    Other necessary consents and approvals customary for a transaction of this nature.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2020 AND THE FINAL REPORTING
PERIOD ENDING 31 MARCH 2021

Upon release of the Company’s financial results for the year ended 31 March 2020 Accelerate
communicated to the market that it may possibly not be paying distributions for the 30 September
2020 and 31 March 2021 reporting periods due to:

    -   Tenant assistance to be granted regarding the COVID 19 pandemic expected to exceed R 100
        million;
    -   Current market conditions and the impact of COVID 19 necessitating the company focus on
        strengthening liquidity; and
    -   The need to reduce debt and improve the financial position of the company.

In order to give clarity and certainty to both debt and equity investors the Company wishes to
formally communicate to the market that the board has resolved that it would be in the best interest
of the Company to retain cash and accordingly, not to pay distributions for the 30 September 2020
and 31 March 2021 reporting periods.

The Company further wishes to inform investors that distributable income for the period ending 30
September 2020 and the period ending 31 March 2021 is expected to be greater than 15% lower
than the distributable income for the corresponding preceding periods due to COVID-19 assistance
granted to tenants. The Company however does not have reasonable certainty of the range. A
further trading statement will be released once the reasonable certainty has been obtained.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s external auditors. The Company intends to release its interim results for the six months
ending 30 September 2020 on or about 24 November 2020.

        each holder of Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) (the “Secured Noteholders”) issued
        under the Issuer’s ZAR5,000,000,000 Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (the
        “Programme”) pursuant to the section headed “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”
        (the “Terms and Conditions”) in the programme memorandum dated 9 September 2014, as
        amended and restated from time to time (the “Programme Memorandum”), in accordance
        with Condition 16 (Notices) of the Terms and Conditions for the purposes of obtaining the
        Secured Noteholders’ written consent to an amendment as required in terms of Condition 17
        (Amendment of these Conditions) of the Terms and Conditions.

        ascribed thereto in the Terms and Conditions and/or the Additional Terms and Conditions (as
        defined below).

3.      Background

3.1        The Issuer has the following listed notes in issue requiring noteholder consent:

3.1.1         ZAR225,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 21 October 2021 with stock
              code APF04 (the “APF04 Senior Secured Notes”);

        The Issuer seeks the Secured Noteholders’ consent in accordance with Condition 18 (Meetings
        of Noteholders) of the Terms and Conditions to pass the following Extraordinary Resolutions:

                 the applicable measurement date;

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

While income remains under pressure, Accelerate continues to focus on managing costs more efficiently. Property costs (rates, water, sewerage etc) have
steadily increased at rates well above inflation, paired with negative rental reversions have resulted in significant pressure on the bottom line.

The cost to income ratio had temporarily increased to 26.2% as compared to 15.9% (March 2019) due to additional once-off expenses being incurred with the
completion of the Fourways Mall Development as well as conservative provisions put in place regarding the recoverability of arrears impacted by COVID-19.

The decrease in distributable earnings from 31 March 2019 to 31 March 2020 was
predominantly driven by:

- Prudent additional bad debt provision made at 31 March 2020 in anticipation of the impact of COVID-19
- The full COVID-19 rental reduction on the European portfolio has been accounted for in the 31 March 2020 financial year (all OBI stores in Austria and
  Slovakia are fully trading and have been paying 100% of rentals since mid-April 2020)
- An increase in B-grade office vacancies caused by the economic contraction
- The impact of the structural vacancies in buildings held for redevelopment
- Additional professional and marketing fees incurred for the Fourways Mall equalisation and relaunch.

The portfolio's weighted average lease expiry (WALE) remains strong, in excess of five years. Average lease escalations amount to approximately 7.6%
(excluding offshore).

The COVID-19 situation is highly volatile and continually evolving and the fund is working with our tenants to secure long term income streams, limit
vacancies and ensure long term sustainability for all parties involved. The fund does not however expect a significant reduction in long term rentals
streams at our larger retail centres as rentals currently charged to tenants are at or appreciably below market related rentals. Due to the effects of
COVID-19 on tenants and cash receivable from tenants, Accelerate will not be paying a final distribution.

FINANCIAL POSITION

As at 31 March 2020, Accelerate's investment property portfolio had a value of R12, 6 billion (2019: R12,7 billion), excluding the effects of straight -
lining. The movement in the value of the portfolio is mainly due to an increase in the external valuation of our offshore assets, the Fourways equalisation
completed to the value of R907 million counteracted by sales concluded by the fund of R730 million as well as conservative downward fair value adjustments
to the value of R1 billion.

The fund maintains a diversified funding base being funded 29.6% through the debt capital markets and 70.4% through bank debt with 13 DCM investors and
three banks.

Accelerate successfully accessed the debt capital markets in November 2019 through our domestic medium-term note (DMTN) programme raising a total of R285
million to refinance expiring debt capital markets (DCM) debt.

The Fund is 72.6% hedged with a weighted average swap expiry profile of 1,8 years (2,5 years at 31 March 2019). The weighted average debt maturity profile
has remained stable at over 2 years with the short-term portion of long- term debt also remaining stable at R1.1 billion (2019: R1.1 billion).

The fund continues to monitor interest rates and the swap curve to ensure swaps are executed at optimal rates when the opportunity presents itself.

The fund will benefit from out of the money swaps with a nominal of R600 million rolling off in August and September 2020.

OUTLOOK

Based on the current market conditions and the impact it has on the business, it may be unlikely that the company will be able to pay distributions during
2021. The board will however continue to assess the impact COVID-19 has and will keep shareholders informed in this regard, to the extent required.

Post potential retention of distributions as contemplated above, the fund has amended its capital retention policy to cater for a retention of up to 25% of
distributable profits depending on the company's capital requirements, growth projects and balance sheet requirements.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

The AGM of shareholders will be held on Friday, 18 September 2020. Shareholders will be notified through SENS when the notice of AGM and proxy forms are
published on the investor relations website of Accelerate Property Fund.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE: CHANGE OF MEMBERSHIP

In line with the international governance principles, Andrew Costa stepped down from the remuneration committee, post year end.

ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO:

   •   FURTHER TRADING STATEMENT AND UPDATE ON DISTRIBUTION;
   •   CHANGES TO COMPANY SECRETARY; AND
   •   UPDATE ON PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS

Shareholders are referred to the trading statement published by the Company on
30 September 2019 in terms of which it advised that Accelerate anticipated negative
distributable income growth for the year ended 31 March 2020, resulting in a 10% to 15%
reduction in distribution per share (43,32 to 45.87 cents per share) compared to the 31 March
2019 full-year distribution of 50.97cents per share (27.26 cents per share at 30 September
2018 interims and 23.37 cents per share at 31 March 2019 year-end) .

Accelerate declared and paid an interim dividend distribution of 16.12934 cents per share after
allowing for a capital retention of 4,26491 cents per share on 3 February 2020.

Subsequently, the Covid-19 virus emerged and has spread across the world and South Africa.
Further to the announcements released by the Company in relation to the pandemic and the
impact it is currently having on the property section in particular and the intention of the
Company to retain cash, Accelerate would like to advise shareholders that the board of
directors of the Company has resolved not to declare a final distribution in respect of the 31
March 2020 financial year.


The Company intends to release its results for the year ended 31 March 2020 on or about
the 8 July 2020, and confirms that application for this postponement has been made
submitted to the JSE in terms of the Market notice dated 3 April 2020 to the JSE to allow for
the postponement of the publication of the Company’s audited financial results for the
financial year ended 31 March 2020.

Change to Company Secretary

The Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Ms Margi Pinto as company
secretary, effective from 19 June 2020 in order to have a seamless handover process in
replacing our present company secretary, Keystone Compliance, who will be stepping down
on 30 June 2020.

The financial information on which this announcement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by Accelerate’s external auditors.

NOTIFICATION OF A CHANGE TO THE CREDIT RATING OF THE ISSUER

Noteholders are advised that GCR Ratings (“GCR”) has, on 27 March 2020, downgraded the national
scale ratings assigned to the Issuer from BBB+(ZA) to BBB(ZA) for the long term and from A2(ZA) to
A3(ZA) for the short term, with a Stable Outlook. GCR has also downgraded the long-term credit
ratings assigned to the Senior Secured Notes issued by Issuer from AA-(ZA)(EL) to A(ZA)(EL), with a
Stable Outlook.

Accelerate fully debt funded the equalization of Fourways Mall (the Mall) in terms of which it is now
the 50% owner of the Mall. This in turn elevated LTV levels.

In anticipation of elevated LTV levels Accelerate embarked on a balance sheet optimization strategy.
To date R 730 million of non-core assets have been sold and transferred. A further R 650 million of
non-core assets are in various stages of negotiation/sale.

The above together with the headwinds facing the South African property sector and the effects of
COVID – 19 were major contributors to the downgrade.

VOLUNTARY UPDATE – COVID-19

Accelerate supports the decisive action taken by government in curbing the impact of COVID-19 (the
Coronavirus) on all South Africans. Of paramount importance is the health and safety of our staff and
their families, our tenants, shoppers and the communities we serve.

The company has set up an internal committee (“ Response Committee”) constituting executive and
senior managers to monitor the situation, including the implementation of recommendations issued
by the relevant authorities and health organisations.

As part of our business continuity procedures, we have implemented domestic and international
travel restrictions and remote working policies.

As a preventative measure and in line with official guidance, Accelerate has engaged with its service
providers, especially its cleaning and security contractors and has expanded and intensified its hygiene
protocol across its portfolio. Cleaning hours using enhanced disinfectants have significantly been
increased, and the company is making hand sanitiser available to office staff and shoppers.

At the time of writing, some tenants in the commercial offices portfolio have opted to implement self-
imposed social isolation and work-from-home policies. These measures are not expected to impact
the company.

There are currently no restrictions placed on trading at shopping centres. The company, through the
Response Committee, continuously monitors developments on the implementation of social
distancing measures by government.

Fourways Mall has informed the Response Committee that the following measures will be
implemented by mall management :

    -   Alcohol-based hand sanitizers will be made available at each entry point to the mall, alongside
        informational material
    -   Communal surfaces, including door handles, tabletops, handrails, buttons, escalators and lifts
        will be sanitised multiple times per day
    -   Ablution facilities will be cleaned throughout the day and sanitized at least every hour
    -   All cleaning staff will be required to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, gloves and masks
        throughout their shifts
    -   Security staff have been provided with masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizers
    -   All centre management staff, including maintenance, operations and facilities staff will be
        issued with alcohol-based hand sanitizers and wipes, gloves and masks to ensure the highest
        levels of hygiene when interacting with tenants and shoppers
    -   Cleaning and security staff will be screened and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that
        any staff member presenting symptoms of the virus is treated accordingly
    -   Centre Management, cleaning and security staff have all been educated and informed on the
        virus as per resources made available by national and international healthcare institutions.
Accelerate appreciates the evolving nature and seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains
committed to contributed to efforts that will limit the spread of the virus.

The Company will continue to keep stakeholders updated and informed as the situation evolves.
