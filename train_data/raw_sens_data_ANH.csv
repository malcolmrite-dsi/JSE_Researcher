      Forward-Looking Statements

      This release contains “forward-looking statements”. These statements are based on the current expectations and views of future
      events and developments of the management of AB InBev and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
      The forward-looking statements contained in this release include statements other than historical facts and include statements typically
      containing words such as “will”, “may”, “should”, “believe”, “intends”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “targets”, “estimates”, “likely”, “foresees”,
      “preparing” and words of similar import. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements. You
      should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the current views of the management of AB InBev,
      are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties about AB InBev and are dependent on many factors, some of which are outside of
      AB InBev’s control. There are important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially
      different, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties about its impact and duration and the
      risks and uncertainties relating to AB InBev described under Item 3.D of AB InBev’s Annual Report on Form 20-F (“Form 20-F”) filed
      with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on 23 March 2020 and described in Exhibit 99.1 to AB InBev’s Current
      Report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC on 29 October 2020. Many of these risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by
      the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. Other unknown or
      unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.

      The forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere,
      including AB InBev’s most recent Form 20-F and other reports furnished on Form 6-K, and any other documents that AB InBev has
      made public. Any forward-looking statements made in this communication are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements
      and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by AB InBev will be realized or, even if substantially
      realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, AB InBev or its business or operations. Except as required
      by law, AB InBev undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
      information, future events or otherwise.

Anheuser-Busch InBev reports Third Quarter and Nine Months 2020 Results

KEY FIGURES


•      Revenue: Revenue grew by 4.0% in 3Q20, positively impacted by a healthy volume performance and revenue per hl
       growth of 2.3%. In 9M20, revenue declined by 6.8% with revenue per hl growth of 1.6%.

       2.5%. In 9M20, total volumes declined by 8.2%, with own beer volumes down by 8.3% and non-beer volumes down

       globally and by 8.1% outside of their respective home markets in 3Q20. In 9M20, the combined revenues of our
       global brands declined by 7.2% globally and by 7.5% outside of their respective home markets.

•      Cost of Sales (CoS): CoS increased by 9.6% in 3Q20 and by 8.3% on a per hl basis, driven primarily by supply chain
       adjustments implemented to meet evolving demand. In 9M20, CoS increased by 1.4% and increased by 10.8% on
       a per hl basis.

•      EBITDA: EBITDA of 4 892 million USD represents a decrease of 0.8% in 3Q20, with EBITDA margin contraction of
       188 bps to 38.2%. In 9M20, EBITDA declined by 16.7% to 12 254 million USD and EBITDA margin contracted by

•      Net finance results: Net finance costs (excluding non-recurring net finance results) were 1 333 million USD in 3Q20
       compared to 677 million USD in 3Q19. Net finance costs were 5 537 million USD in 9M20 compared to 2 047
       million USD in 9M19. The increase in 9M20 was primarily driven by a mark-to-market loss of 1 747 million USD
       linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs compared to a gain of 1 672 million USD in 9M19,
       resulting in a swing of 3 419 million USD.

•      Income taxes: Normalized effective tax rate (ETR) increased from 22.6% in 3Q19 to 26.2% in 3Q20. Excluding the
       impact of gains and losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs, our normalized ETR was
       26.0% in 3Q20 compared to 26.8% in 3Q19. Normalized ETR increased from 22.8% in 9M19 to 37.2% in 9M20
       and, excluding the impact of gains and losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs,
       normalized ETR decreased from 27.2% in 9M19 to 24.3% in 9M20.

•      Non-recurring items: Normalized EBIT excludes negative non-recurring items of 92 million USD in 3Q20 and 969
       million USD in 9M20.

•      Profit: Normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev was 1 578 million USD in 3Q20 compared to 2
       412 million USD in 3Q19 and was 1 654 million USD in 9M20 versus 7 125 million USD in 9M19. Underlying profit
       (normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev excluding mark-to-market gains and losses linked to the
       hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 1 601 million USD in 3Q20
       compared to 1 870 million USD in 3Q19, and was 3 407 million USD in 9M20 compared to 5 462 million USD in
       9M19.

•      Earnings per share (EPS): Normalized EPS in 3Q20 was 0.79 USD, a decrease from 1.22 USD in 3Q19. Normalized
       EPS in 9M20 was 0.83 USD, a decrease from 3.59 USD in 9M19. Underlying EPS (normalized EPS excluding mark-
       to-market gains and losses linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of
       hyperinflation) was 0.80 USD in 3Q20, a decrease from 0.94 USD in 3Q19, and was 1.71 USD in 9M20, a decrease
       from 2.76 USD in 9M19.

•      Interim Dividend: While our business is delivering improving results, we continue to face uncertainty and volatility
       arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In that context, our Board determined that it would be prudent and in the best
       interest of the Company to forgo the interim 2020 dividend payment. This decision is consistent with our financial
       discipline and prioritizes our deleveraging commitments, which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
       The Board’s proposal with respect to a full year 2020 dividend will be announced with our FY20 results on 25
       February 2021.

      completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and all other required documents at or prior

      (b)      Hypothetical Tender Consideration for each series of USD Notes other than the Floating Rate Notes due 2024

               determined as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on 4 September 2020 and assumes a Settlement Date of 17
               September 2020. The Reference Yield used to determine actual consideration for the USD Fixed Rate Notes is
               expected to be calculated on 14 September 2020. The information provided in the above table with respect to
               the USD Fixed Rate Notes is for illustrative purposes only. The relevant Companies make no representation
               with respect to the actual consideration that may be paid with respect to the USD Fixed Rate Notes, and such
               amounts may be greater or less than those shown in the above table depending on the Reference Yield as of
               the Price Determination Time.
      (c)      Hypothetical Tender Consideration for the Floating Rate Notes due 2024 (the “USD Floating Rate Notes”)
               reflects the actual, fixed Tender Consideration of $1,015.00 per $1,000 principal amount.
      (d)      The USD Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by AB InBev and certain of its direct and indirect
               subsidiaries.

      (e)   The calculation of the applicable Tender Consideration for the 3.500% Notes due 2024 (the “Par Call Notes”)
            may be performed using the value of such Notes as determined at the Price Determination Time as if the
            principal amount of such Notes had been due on December 12, 2023 (the “par call date”).

            (such EUR Notes collectively, the “EUR Fixed Rate Notes”, and together with the USD Fixed Rate Notes, the

      The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on 14 September 2020, unless
      extended or earlier terminated by the Companies (the “Expiration Date”). Holders must validly tender their
      Notes at or prior to the Expiration Date or the Guaranteed Delivery Date pursuant to the Guaranteed
      Delivery Procedures.

      Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on 14 September
      2020, subject to any extension by the Companies, but thereafter will be irrevocable, except in certain limited
      circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law (as determined by the Companies).
      The Settlement Date will promptly follow the Expiration Date and is expected to be 17 September 2020.

      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, Holders who (i) validly
      tender and who do not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to the Expiration Date or (ii) deliver a properly
      completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and all other required documents at or prior
      to the Expiration Date and tender their Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New
      York City time, on the second business day after the Expiration Date pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery
      Procedures, and, subject in each case to the tender in the applicable Minimum Authorized Denominations,
      and whose Notes are accepted for purchase by the Companies, will receive the applicable Tender
      Consideration described below.

      The Tender Consideration payable for each series of Fixed Rate Notes will be a price per $1,000 or €1,000
      principal amount of such series of Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, that is accepted for purchase equal to
      an amount, calculated in accordance with the formulas described in the Offer to Purchase, that would
      reflect, as of the Settlement Date, a yield to the par call date or maturity date, as applicable, of such series
      of Fixed Rate Notes equal to the sum of (i) the Reference Yield for such series, determined at 10:00 a.m.
      (New York City time), for USD Fixed Rate Notes, or 3:00 p.m. (London time), for EUR Fixed Rate Notes,
      on 14 September 2020 (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, such time and date,
      as the same may be extended, the “Price Determination Time”) plus (ii) the fixed spread applicable to such
      series, as set forth in the tables above (the “Fixed Spread”), in each case minus the accrued and unpaid
      interest on such Notes from, and including, the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to
      such Notes to, but excluding, the Settlement Date (the “Accrued Coupon Payment”). The “Reference Yield”
      means (i) with respect to each series of the USD Fixed Rate Notes, the yield of the reference security listed
      in the table for USD Notes above for such series and (ii) with respect to each series of EUR Fixed Rate
      Notes, the applicable Interpolated Rate.

      With respect to the Par Call Notes, if the Tender Offer Yield as determined in accordance with the Offer to
      Purchase is less than the contractual annual rate of interest for the Par Call Notes, then the Tender
      Consideration will be calculated based on the par call date; if the Tender Offer Yield as determined in



                                                                                                                    4
ab-inbev.com
      accordance with the Offer to Purchase is higher than or equal to the contractual annual rate of interest for
      the Par Call Notes, then the Tender Consideration for the Par Call Notes will be calculated based on the
      maturity date.

      The Tender Consideration for the USD Floating Rate Notes accepted for purchase will be $1,015.00 per
      $1,000 principal amount and the Tender Consideration for the EUR Floating Rate Notes accepted for
      purchase will be €1,007.50 per €1,000 principal amount.

      In addition to the applicable Tender Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will be
      paid the Accrued Coupon Payment. Interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes
      accepted, including those tendered through the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures. No further interest will
      be paid to the Holders who tender such Notes, including if a record date for an interest payment on such
      Notes has passed before the Settlement Date.

      The Tender Offers are not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered or the
      consummation of other offers, but are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions
      set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

      Holders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they
      hold their Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that
      holder to be able to participate in the Tender Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer
      to Purchase. The deadlines set by the clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender
      instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase.

      Holders holding EUR Notes directly in the NBB-SSS or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS (other
      than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) must, in order to be eligible to participate in the EUR Tender
      Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase, (i) arrange for the EUR Notes which they wish to
      tender to be transferred to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, and (ii) maintain,
      or where relevant, procure, access to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg through
      which such EUR Notes can be traded, and to which both the applicable Tender Consideration and the
      applicable Accrued Coupon Payment may be credited by AB InBev.

      Holders of EUR Notes who do not have access to an account, as described above, in either Euroclear or
      Clearstream, Luxembourg (either directly or through a direct participant or other intermediary), or who do
      not transfer the EUR Notes which they wish to tender to a direct participant in either clearing system, will
      not be able to submit a EUR Tender Instruction (as defined below) to the EUR tender agent and will not be
      eligible to participate in the EUR Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase.

      Any Holder of EUR Notes who (i) holds its EUR Notes directly, or through a direct participant of the NBB-
      SSS, in an “N account” within the NBB-SSS, (ii) is not eligible, in accordance with Article 4 of the Belgian
      Royal Decree of 26 May 1994, to hold its Notes (directly or indirectly) in an “X account” within the NBB-
      SSS, and who is therefore unable to transfer the relevant Notes to an account in either Euroclear or
      Clearstream, Luxembourg and (iii) who is eligible to view the Offer to Purchase and make an investment
      decision with respect to the EUR Tender Offers, may contact the EUR tender agent for further information,

      The GBP Notes will be redeemed in accordance with the Conditions of the GBP Notes in full on the
      applicable Redemption Date at a make-whole price equal to (i) the outstanding principal amount of the GBP
      Notes; or (ii) if higher, the sum, as determined by the Calculation Agent, of the present values of the
      remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the GBP Notes to be redeemed (not including
      any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the applicable
      Redemption Date on an annual basis (applying the Actual/Actual (ICMA) Day Count Fraction (as described
      in the Conditions of the GBP Notes)) at the rate per annum equal to the equivalent yield to maturity of the
      CA Selected Bond calculated using a price for the CA Selected Bond (expressed as a percentage of its
      principal amount) equal to the Reference Bond Price for the applicable Redemption Date plus 15 basis

      On each applicable Redemption Date, (i) the CAD Notes and the GBP Notes will no longer be deemed
      outstanding, (ii) the CAD Redemption Price and GBP Redemption Price will become due and payable on
      the CAD Notes and the GBP Notes, respectively and, (iii) unless ABIFI or AB InBev default in making

      Date.

Anheuser-Busch InBev reports Second Quarter and Half Year 2020 results
Short Form Announcement

BUSINESS UPDATE IN LIGHT OF THE GLOBAL COVID-19 PANDEMIC
•     The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present unprecedented challenges for societies, governments and businesses
      across the world. The health and safety of our colleagues is our first priority, and we are finding new ways to do our
      part globally to help our communities, support our partners and connect with our consumers.
•     Our performance in the second quarter was materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as expected. As the
      quarter progressed, however, we saw considerable improvement. April volumes declined by 32.4%, May volumes
      declined by 21.4% and June volumes grew by 0.7%, demonstrating the resilience of the global beer category.
•     In view of the economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an impairment review
      considering different scenarios: a base case, a best case and a worst case. No impairment was warranted under the
      base and best case scenarios. However, we were exposed to a risk of impairment for the South Africa and Rest of
      Africa cash generating units under the worst case scenario and concluded that it was prudent to recognize a 2.5 billion
      USD non-cash goodwill impairment charge applying a 30% probability of occurrence of the worst case scenario. This
      charge is partially offset by a 1.9 billion USD gain on the disposal of the Australian operations. Please refer to page 12
      for additional disclosure.
•     We have been investing behind capabilities such as B2B platforms, e-commerce channels and digital marketing for
      several years. These trends have accelerated over the past few months, positioning us well to capture growth.
•     We have taken significant actions to maintain strong liquidity in a more volatile and uncertain environment, while
      proactively managing our debt profile. We also implemented several initiatives that drove a meaningful reduction in
      SG&A, while we continue to invest effectively behind our brands and commercial strategy, preparing for a strong
      recovery.
•     The fundamental strengths of our company remain unchanged. We have a clear commercial strategy, diverse
      geographic footprint, the world’s most valuable portfolio of beer brands, industry-leading profitability, a strong team and
      an incredibly deep talent pool.

KEY FIGURES


•     Revenue: Revenue declined by 17.7% in 2Q20 with a revenue per hl decline of 0.6%, driven by restrictions related to
      the COVID-19 pandemic. In HY20, revenue declined by 12.0% with revenue per hl growth of 1.6%.
•     Volume: Total volumes declined by 17.1% in 2Q20, with own beer volumes down by 17.2% and non-beer volumes down
      by 15.5%. In HY20, total volumes declined by 13.4%, with own beer volumes down by 14.0% and non-beer volumes
      down by 7.6%. The decline was primarily driven by impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•     Global Brands: Combined revenues of our global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, declined by 16.6%
      globally and by 12.6% outside of their respective home markets. In HY20, the combined revenues of our global brands
      declined by 14.1% globally and by 14.9% outside of their respective home markets.
•     Cost of Sales (CoS): CoS decreased by 4.9% in 2Q20 and increased by 15.2% on a per hl basis, driven primarily by
      operational deleverage resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our volumes, particularly in markets where our beer
      operations were shut down within the quarter. In HY20, CoS decreased by 2.5% and increased by 12.9% on a per hl
      basis.
•     EBITDA: EBITDA of 3 414 million USD represents a decrease of 34.1% in the quarter, with EBITDA margin contraction
      of 825 bps to 33.2%. In HY20, EBITDA declined by 24.7% to 7 363 million USD and EBITDA margin contracted by 585
      bps to 34.6%.
•     Net finance results: Net finance costs (excluding non-recurring net finance results) were 1 044 million USD in 2Q20
      compared to 1 004 million USD in 2Q19. Net finance costs were 4 204 million USD in HY20 compared to 1 370 million
      USD in HY19. The increase in HY20 was primarily driven by a mark-to-market loss of 1 724 million USD linked to the
      hedging of our share-based payment programs compared to a gain of 1 124 million USD in HY19, resulting in a swing
      of 2 848 million USD.
•     Income taxes: Normalized effective tax rate (ETR) decreased from 26.0% in 2Q19 to 16.8% in 2Q20. Excluding the
      impact of gains relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs, our normalized ETR was 18.8% in 2Q20
      as compared to 27.4% in 2Q19. The decrease in our normalized ETR excluding mark-to-market gains and losses linked to the
      hedging of our share-based payment programs is primarily driven by country mix and the positive impact of tax attributes, with
      taxes applied on a lower base as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Normalized ETR increased from 22.9% in HY19 to
      66.6% in HY20 and, excluding the impact of losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs,
      normalized ETR decreased from 27.4% in HY19 to 22.8% in HY20.
•     Non-recurring items: Normalized EBIT excludes negative non-recurring items of 832 million USD in 2Q20 and 877
      million USD in HY20, mainly related to a 2.5 billion USD non-cash goodwill impairment charge that was partially offset
      by a 1.9 billion USD gain on the disposal of our Australia operations.
•     Profit: Normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev was 921 million USD in 2Q20 compared to 2 319
      million USD in 2Q19 and was 76 million USD in HY20 versus 4 714 million USD in HY19. Underlying profit (normalized
      profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev excluding mark-to-market gains linked to the hedging of our share-based
      payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 790 million USD in 2Q20 compared to 2 143 million USD in
      2Q19, and was 1 805 million USD in HY20 compared to 3 593 million USD in HY19.
•     Earnings per share (EPS): Normalized EPS in 2Q20 was 0.46 USD, a decrease from 1.17 USD in 2Q19. Normalized
      EPS in HY20 was 0.04 USD, a decrease from 2.38 USD in HY19. Underlying EPS (normalized EPS excluding mark-
      to-market gains linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 0.40
      USD in 2Q20, a decrease from 1.08 USD in 2Q19, and was 0.90 USD in HY20, a decrease from 1.81 USD in HY19.
•     Deleveraging: Net debt to normalized EBITDA was 4.86x at 30 June 2020.
•     2020 Half Year Financial Report: The report is available on our website at www.ab-inbev.com.

                                          Notice of Currency Exchange Rate
                                                  Dividend No. 28

AB InBev shareholders are referred to the announcement published on the Stock Exchange News Service of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) (“SENS”) on Tuesday, 14 April 2020 and are advised that the final dividend of
€0.50 per share (the “Dividend”) proposed by the board of directors of AB InBev was approved by AB InBev shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting held on Wednesday, 3 June 2020.

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Euro to SA Rand for the Dividend will be €1.00 to ZAR18.93170, as
calculated on Monday, 8 June 2020. Accordingly, the gross amount of the Dividend is 946.58500 SA cents per share
and will be subject to a Belgian Withholding Tax of 30% (equalling 283.97550 SA cents per share) which will be withheld
from the gross Dividend paid to shareholders.

After the Belgian Withholding Tax has been withheld, the net Dividend will be 662.60950 SA cents per share. This
withholding tax is reduced to 15% in terms of the double tax treaty in force between Belgium and South Africa. A rebate
of the additional Belgian Withholding Tax of 15% which is withheld in Belgium must be claimed by SA shareholders in
accordance with the relevant reimbursement process noted in the announcement published on SENS on Tuesday,
14 April 2020.

The Dividend may also be subject to SA Dividends Tax at the rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for an
exemption. Any shareholder that receives a Dividend which is subject to SA Dividends Tax (i.e. where no exemption is
available) will qualify for a 15% rebate from SA Dividends Tax, being the Belgian Withholding Tax of 15%.

The ultimate result is that the Dividend will be subject to a reduced Belgian Withholding Tax rate of 15% and subject to
SA Dividends Tax at a rate of 5% (unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from SA Dividends Tax, in which
case only Belgian Withholding Tax of 15% will be applicable).

Anheuser-Busch InBev reports First Quarter 2020 Results
Short Form Announcement

BUSINESS UPDATE IN LIGHT OF THE GLOBAL COVID-19 PANDEMIC


•     The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges for societies, governments and businesses across
      the world. The health and safety of our colleagues continues to be our first priority and we are doing our part globally
      to help our communities, support our partners and connect with our consumers in new ways.
•     Our business started the year with good momentum and delivered volume growth of 1.9% in the first two months of
      the year excluding China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began in late January.
•     The impact of COVID-19 on our global results increased significantly toward the end of the quarter. Consequently,
      in 1Q20 our total volume declined by 9.3% and by 3.6% excluding China. Revenue declined by 5.8% while revenue
      per hl grew by 3.9%. EBITDA of 3 949 million USD represents a decline of 13.7%, with margin contraction of 331
      bps to 35.9%.
•     We expect that the impact on our 2Q20 results will be materially worse than in 1Q20. This has already become
      evident in our April 2020 global volumes, which declined by approximately 32%, primarily driven by the closure of
      the on-premise channel in most markets and government restrictions imposed on certain operations of ours in
      connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.
•     Our diverse geographic footprint allows us to apply best practices from our experiences in China and South Korea
      to the rest of our markets, as they move through different stages of the crisis and into eventual recovery. For context,
      in China, our volumes declined by approximately 17% in April, an improvement from the 1Q20 decline of 46.5%.
•     We have been investing in new capabilities for several years to better connect with our customers and consumers
      by leveraging technology, such as B2B sales and e-commerce platforms, which provide us with a structural
      advantage in these unique circumstances.
•     We have exercised prudent financial discipline with several proactive measures, including optimizing our cost base,
      revising our final 2019 dividend proposal and maintaining a strong liquidity position.

KEY FIGURES


•     Revenue: Revenue declined by 5.8%, materially impacted by lower volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Revenue per hl grew by 3.9%, driven by ongoing premiumization and revenue management initiatives.
•     Volume: Total volumes declined by 9.3%, with own beer volumes down 10.5% and non-beer volumes down 0.2%.
      Excluding China, our volumes declined by 3.6% in 1Q20 despite initial growth of 1.9% in January and February.
•     Global Brands: Combined revenues of our three global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, declined by
      11.0% globally and by 17.5% outside of their respective home markets. Growth across the majority of our markets
      was more than offset by declines in China, which is the largest market for both Budweiser and Corona outside of
      their respective home markets.
•     Cost of Sales (CoS): CoS was flat in 1Q20 and increased by 10.3% on a per hl basis, driven primarily by operational
      deleverage resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our volumes and transactional currency headwinds.
•     EBITDA: EBITDA of 3 949 million USD represents a decrease of 13.7% in the quarter, with EBITDA margin
      contraction of 331 bps to 35.9%.
•     Net finance results: Net finance costs (excluding non-recurring net finance results) were 3 160 million USD in 1Q20
      compared to 366 million USD in 1Q19. The increase was predominantly due to a mark-to-market loss of 1 855
      million USD in 1Q20 linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs, compared to a gain of 951 million
      USD in 1Q19, resulting in a swing of 2 806 million USD.
•    Income taxes: Normalized effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to -109.3% in 1Q20 from 19.6% in 1Q19, impacted
     by non-deductible mark-to-market losses linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs. Excluding
     the mark-to-market impact linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs, our normalized ETR was
     25.9% in 1Q20 as compared to 27.5% in 1Q19.
•    Profit: Normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev was -845 million USD in 1Q20 versus 2 395 million
     USD in 1Q19. Underlying profit (normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev excluding mark-to-
     market losses linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 1
     015 million USD in 1Q20 as compared to 1 449 million USD in 1Q19.
•    Earnings per share (EPS): Normalized EPS in 1Q20 was -0.42 USD, a decrease from 1.21 USD in 1Q19, negatively
     impacted by a lower profit and mark-to-market losses linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs.
     Underlying EPS (normalized EPS excluding mark-to-market losses linked to the hedging of our share-based
     payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 0.51 USD in 1Q20, a decrease from 0.73 USD in 1Q19.

Anheuser-Busch InBev (Euronext: ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) (“AB InBev” or the “Company”)
announced today that it is revising its proposal to pay a final 2019 dividend of EUR 1.00 per share to a proposal to pay
a final 2019 dividend of EUR 0.50 per share and is rescheduling the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting

Additional information required by the JSE Listings Requirements

1.   No transfers of shareholdings to and from South Africa will be permitted between Tuesday, 9 June 2020 and Friday,
     12 June 2020 (both dates inclusive). No dematerialisation or rematerialisation orders will be permitted between
     Wednesday, 10 June 2020 and Friday, 12 June 2020 (both dates inclusive).

2.   The gross amount of the Dividend will be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding tax may be
     reduced to 15% in terms of the double tax treaty in force between Belgium and South Africa. A rebate of the
     additional Belgian withholding tax imposed must be claimed in accordance with the relevant reimbursement
     process noted below. The Dividend will also be subject to South African dividends tax at the rate of 20%, unless a
     shareholder qualifies for an exemption. Any shareholder who receives a dividend which is subject to South African
     dividends tax (i.e. where no exemption is available) will qualify for a 15% reduction in dividends tax. The ultimate
     result in such a case is that a dividend will be subject to a reduced Belgian withholding tax rate of 15% and subject
     to South African dividends tax at a rate of 5%.
3.   At Tuesday, 14 April 2020, being the declaration announcement date of the Dividend, the Company had a total of
     1,979,363,742 shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held 39,878,231 ordinary shares in
     treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,019,241,973 shares (of which 1,693,242,156 ordinary shares are
     listed and 325,999,817 restricted shares are unlisted).

4.   The Dividend will be paid out of the Company’s operating results for 2019, increased with the profits carried over,
     without drawing on any capital reserves.

5.   The Dividend is payable in South African Rand to shareholders whose shares are held through Central Securities
     Participants and brokers traded on the JSE.

South African income tax and dividends tax consequences

The Dividend should be regarded as a ‘foreign dividend’ for South African income tax and South African dividends tax
purposes.

Foreign dividends received in respect of shares which are dual-listed on the JSE are, however, exempt from income
tax. Consequently, no South African income tax should be incurred by the shareholders in respect of the Dividend
received.

The Dividend may, however, be subject to South African dividends tax at 20%. There is though, amongst others, an
exemption from South African dividends tax if the Dividend is paid to a South African resident corporate shareholder.
This exemption operates in a manner similar to other local shares listed on the JSE and the dividends paid in respect
thereof to resident corporate shareholders and retirement funds. Intermediaries may only allow an exemption from South
African dividends tax, provided shareholders have completed and lodged a valid exemption form, which is obtainable
from their intermediary.

Belgian withholding tax

The gross amount of the Dividend will as a rule be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding tax
can under certain circumstances be reduced.

Belgian dividend withholding tax can be reduced to 15% pursuant to the Belgian-South African double tax treaty in force.
Such reduced rate can be applied provided that Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is filed by the shareholder with the Bureau
Central de Taxation de Bruxelles-Etranger, boulevard du Jardin Botanique 50 boîte 3429, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
(hereinafter the “Central Bureau of Taxation”) before the expiry of a period of five years from January 1st of the year in
which the withholding tax was paid, in which case the differential between the standard withholding tax rate of 30% and
the reduced treaty rate of 15% will be reimbursed.

An explanatory note is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax authorities’ official website:

https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/mym-api-rest/finform/pdf/2575

The current version of Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax authorities’
official website:

https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/mym-api-rest/finform/pdf/2599

A Belgian withholding tax exemption is also applicable to dividends paid to South African corporate shareholders that
hold a participation of less than 10% in the capital of AB InBev but with an acquisition value of at least €2.5 million. This
regime is subject to the cumulative conditions that (i) the company is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in
the meaning of Article 3, 1), d) of the Double Tax Treaty between Belgium and South Africa and has a legal form
considered similar to the ones listed in Annex I, Part A, to the Council Directive 2011/96/EU of 30 November 2011 on
the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States,
as amended by Directive 2014/863/EU of 8 July 2014; (ii) it is subject to corporate income tax or a similar tax without
benefiting from a tax regime that deviates from the ordinary domestic tax regime; (iii) the dividends relate to AB InBev
shares which it has held or will hold in full legal ownership for an uninterrupted period of at least one year; and (iv) it
cannot in principle credit the Belgian withholding tax paid on the AB InBev dividends or obtain a refund thereof according
to the legal provisions in force on December 31 of the year preceding the year of the payment or attribution of the
dividends.
In order to benefit from this reduced withholding tax, the shareholder must provide the Central Bureau of Taxation with
a South African residency certificate confirming that it fulfils the abovementioned conditions and indicating to what extent
the Belgian withholding tax is in principle creditable or reimbursable on the basis of the South African laws applicable
on 31 December of the year preceding the one during which the Dividend is paid or attributed.

South African dividends tax rebate in respect of Belgian withholding tax

A rebate must, for South African dividends tax purposes, be deducted from any South African dividends tax payable in
respect of the Dividend (i.e. where no exemption is available). This rebate will be equal to the amount of any Belgian
withholding tax paid in respect of the Dividend, without any right of recovery, and must not exceed the amount of the
South African dividends tax imposed in respect of the Dividend.

The CSDPs and/or brokers, in their capacity as the regulated intermediaries, must obtain proof of any Belgian
withholding tax paid and deducted from the South African tax payable, as above, in the form and manner prescribed by
the South African Revenue Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, the income tax and dividends tax information provided above is only relevant to shareholders
whose shares are held through CSDPs and brokers and are traded on the JSE.

Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position should seek independent professional advice.

      accordance with the Belgian royal decree n°4 of 9 April 2020.

      Given the uncertainty, volatility and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, AB InBev has determined
      that it would be prudent and in the best interests of the Company to reduce the amount of the final 2019
      dividend. This decision is consistent with the Company’s financial discipline, deleveraging commitments and
      other actions taken to navigate this environment.

      The Company will reschedule the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting to 3 June 2020 (the
      “Rescheduled Meeting”). All resolutions proposed for the meeting originally scheduled for 29 April 2020 will be
      set on the agenda of the Rescheduled Meeting, except that the statutory annual accounts that will be presented

POSTPONEMENT OF THE UNWIND OF THE CURRENT SAB ZENZELE B-BBEE OWNERSHIP
TRANSACTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SAB ZENZELE KABILI B-BBEE OWNERSHIP
TRANSACTION


1.   INTRODUCTION
     Shareholders of SAB Zenzele Holdings (RF) Limited (“SAB Zenzele”) are referred to the
     announcement released on SENS on Monday, 17 February 2020 regarding the unwind of the
     current SAB Zenzele broad-based black economic empowerment (“B-BBEE”) ownership
     transaction (“Existing Empowerment Transaction”) and the implementation of the new SAB
     Zenzele Kabili B-BBEE transaction (“New Empowerment Transaction”) (such announcement,
     the “Terms Announcement”).

     Capitalised terms used but not separately defined in this announcement have the meaning
     ascribed thereto in the Terms Announcement.

2.   POSTPONEMENT
     The Independent Board has continued to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
     unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction and the implementation of the New
     Empowerment Transaction. Against this backdrop, the Independent Board, together with SAB
     and SAB Zenzele Kabili, have resolved to postpone the unwind of the Existing Empowerment
     Transaction and the launch of the New Empowerment Transaction, which accordingly also
     involves the postponement of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, and the meeting convened to consider
     and approve it, and the postponement of the Reinvestment Offer and the BEE Listing.

     The Independent Board has the responsibility to consider the best interests of all SAB Zenzele
     Retailer Shareholders, and believes that now is not the right time to be proposing a scheme
     where the Independent Board is asking SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders to make a long-term
     equity investment decision in the current volatile and uncertain equity market.

     Accordingly, the unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction, the shareholder vote in
     respect of the SAB Zenzele Scheme and implementation of New Empowerment Transaction
     (including the SAB Zenzele Scheme, the Reinvestment Offer and the BEE Listing), have been
     postponed by up to 1 year (i.e. prior to 31 March 2021) as permitted by the terms and conditions
     of the Existing Empowerment Transaction, to allow for equity market and operating conditions
     to improve.

3.   UPDATED TIMETABLE
     Further details in respect of an updated timetable, will be communicated in due course, and
     SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders are also encouraged to join the SAB Zenzele Retailers
     Facebook Group, www.facebook.com/groups/181049256534071/ or to dial *120*1138# or

      The proceeds of the Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The Notes will be issued by
      Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV under its Euro Medium Term Note programme base prospectus published
      on 13 December 2019, as supplemented by the supplement dated 24 March 2020.

      Exchange.

      PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold
      or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
      investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA"") or in the United Kingdom (the ""UK""). For these purposes,
      a ""retail investor"" means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
      Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (""MiFID II""); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU)
      2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
      4(1) of MiFID II. No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended
      (the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
      investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
      making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
      Regulation.

      MiFID II product governance/Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the
      purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
      Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
      professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
      eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
      or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target
      market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
      market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market
      assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.




                                                                                                                  2

      The Notes and the guarantees (together, the ""Securities"") have not been and will not be registered under
      the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or any relevant securities laws of any
      state or other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an
      exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Securities are being
      offered only outside the US to non-US persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. There
      will be no public offer of the Securities in the United States.

      the US or any other jurisdiction.


      The distribution of this announcement and other information in connection with the offer in certain
      jurisdictions may be restricted by law and persons into whose possession any document or other
      information referred to herein comes should inform themselves about and observe any such restriction. Any

      AB InBev files its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019,
      updates on the impact of COVID-19 and updates on the sale of Carlton & United
      Breweries to Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd.

      regarding the duties of issuers of financial instruments which have been admitted for trading on a regulated market.

      24 March 2020 – Anheuser-Busch InBev (Euronext: ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) (“AB
      InBev” or the “Company”) today filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
      Commission (SEC). The Form 20-F can be downloaded from the Company’s website (www.ab-inbev.com)
      under the heading Investors / Results Center / Latest SEC Filings, at the company’s Issuer Direct Corp
      webpage (https://app.irdirect.net/company/2888/hotline/) or from the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) as of 24
      March 2020. Printed copies of the complete audited financial statements contained in the Form 20-F can be

      Morrisville, North Carolina 27560 (AB-InBevReports@issuerdirect.com), +1-888-301-2501.

      On 27 February 2020, in connection with its fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, AB InBev announced a
      2020 Outlook, which is attached hereto as Annex A. That 2020 Outlook reflected the Company’s assessment
      at that time. Since 27 February 2020, the scale and magnitude of COVID-19 has increased significantly,
      resulting in restrictions imposed on many customers, as well as other limitations and social distancing
      measures in many countries in mid-March 2020. Given the uncertainty, volatility and fast-moving developments
      of the pandemic in the markets in which AB InBev operates, the Company is withdrawing that 2020 Outlook in
      its entirety because of the impact of COVID-19.

                                                                                                                                    1

      Also, as previously announced on 19 July 2019, AB InBev agreed to sell its Australian subsidiary Carlton &
      United Breweries (CUB) to Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. for 16 billion AUD, equivalent to approximately 11 billion
      USD. The parties continue to cooperate with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
      and Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) with a view to obtaining the necessary approvals and closing
      the transaction as soon as possible in the second quarter of 2020.

      Carlos Brito, Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We are living in extraordinary times. The COVID-19 pandemic
      represents unprecedented challenges for societies, governments and businesses across the world. The health
      and safety of our colleagues and communities continues to be our number one priority and we are doing our
      part globally through production of hand sanitizer and disinfectants, bottling of emergency relief water and
      other actions. We are working closely with governments, local authorities, business partners, communities
      and stakeholders.

      “We continue to implement our business continuity plans and are preparing for a strong recovery, learning from
      the experiences of our operations across the world. Since the beginning of the outbreak in China, our local
      team demonstrated tremendous resilience and agility, supported by colleagues from all our markets. Our team
      in China took bold actions to adapt our business, from brewing operations to connecting with customers and
      consumers, in response to a volatile environment and changing behaviors. Their efforts were remarkable, and
      their experience and insight continue to benefit our operations around the world. We are proud of the resilience
      and commitment of our teams. Our diverse geographic footprint, unparalleled portfolio of brands, clear
      commercial strategy and talented people will continue to take us forward.”

       Annex A – WITHDRAWN 2020 OUTLOOK (AS ANNOUNCED ON 27 FEBRUARY 2020)

         (i)    Impact of COVID-19: The impact of the COVID-19 virus outbreak on our business continues to
                evolve. The outbreak has led to a significant decline in demand in China in both on-premise and in-
                home channels. Additionally, demand during the Chinese New Year was lower than in previous years
                as it coincided with the beginning of this outbreak. For the first two months of 2020, we estimate that
                the outbreak has resulted in lost revenue of approximately 285 million USD and lost EBITDA of
                approximately 170 million USD in China.

         (ii)   Overall Performance: We will continue to evolve our top-line growth to be more balanced between
                volume and revenue per hl, as we employ the category expansion framework across our footprint to
                reach new consumers with different price points and styles. In FY20, we expect EBITDA growth of 2-
                5%, with the majority of our growth to be delivered in the second half of the year. In 1Q20, we expect
                EBITDA to decline by around 10% given the impact of COVID-19 on our results as well as a
                challenging comparable, especially in Brazil. The outlook for both FY20 and 1Q20 reflects our current
                assessment of the scale and magnitude of COVID-19, which is subject to change as we continue to
                monitor the development of the outbreak.

         (iii) Cost of Sales: We expect CoS per hl to increase by mid-single digits.


         (iv) Net Finance Costs: We expect the average gross debt coupon in FY20 to be approximately 4.0%.
              Net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses including IFRS 16 adjustments (lease
              reporting) are expected to be approximately 180 million USD per quarter. Net finance costs will
              continue to be impacted by any gains and losses related to the hedging of our share-based payment
              programs.


         (v)    Effective Tax Rate (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY20 to be in the range of 27% to 29%,
                excluding any gains and losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs.


         (vi) Net Capital Expenditure: We expect net capital expenditure of around 5.0 billion USD in FY20 as
              we are increasing investments in innovation and consumer-centric initiatives.


         (vii) Debt: Approximately 40% of our gross debt is denominated in currencies other than the US dollar,
               primarily the Euro. Our optimal capital structure remains a net debt to EBITDA ratio of around 2x.


         (viii) Dividends: We expect dividends to be a growing flow over time, although growth in the short term is
                expected to be modest given our deleveraging commitments.




                                                                                                                     4

Short Form Announcement

    KEY FIGURES


•     Revenue: Revenue grew by 4.3% in FY19 and by 2.5% in 4Q19, with revenue per hl growth of 3.1% in FY19 and
      0.9% in 4Q19. Healthy volume growth was enhanced by global premiumization and revenue management initiatives,
      although revenue per hl growth decelerated as a result of advances in our smart affordability strategy.
•     Volume: Total volumes grew by 1.1% in FY19, with own beer volumes up 0.8% and non-beer volumes up 4.8%. In
      4Q19, total volumes increased by 1.6%, with own beer volumes up 0.8% and non-beer volumes up 8.0%.
•     Global Brands: Combined revenues of our three global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, grew by 5.2%
      in FY19 and by 2.1% in 4Q19. Outside of their respective home markets, the global brands grew by 8.0% in FY19
      and by 3.9% in 4Q19.
•     Cost of Sales (CoS): CoS increased by 7.4% in FY19 and by 5.9% on a per hl basis, driven by significant commodity
      and transactional currency headwinds. In 4Q19, CoS increased by 9.1% and by 7.3% on a per hl basis.
•     EBITDA: EBITDA increased by 2.7% in FY19 to 21 078 million USD as top-line growth and continued cost discipline
      enhanced by synergy capture was partially offset by elevated cost of sales per hl. EBITDA margin contracted by 65
      bps to 40.3%. In 4Q19, EBITDA declined by 5.5% to 5 343 million USD with margin contraction of 336 bps to 40.1%.
•     Net finance results: Net finance costs (excluding non-recurring net finance results) were 4 355 million USD in FY19
      compared to 6 844 million USD in FY18. The decrease was predominantly due to a mark-to-market gain of 898
      million USD in FY19 linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs, compared to a loss of 1 774
      million USD in FY18, resulting in a swing of 2 672 million USD. In 4Q19, net finance costs were 2 309 million USD
      compared to 2 162 million USD in 4Q18.
•     Income taxes: Normalized effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to 23.0% in FY19 from 27.5% in FY18 and decreased
      to 24.5% in 4Q19 from 33.0% in 4Q18. Excluding the impact of gains and losses relating to the hedging of our
      share-based payment programs, our normalized ETR was 24.9% in FY19 as compared to 23.4% in FY18 and 17.2%
      in 4Q19 as compared to 24.7% in 4Q18.
•     Profit: Normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev was 8 086 million USD in FY19 versus 6 248
      million USD in FY18 and was 962 million USD in 4Q19 versus 1 405 million USD in 4Q18. Underlying profit
      (normalized profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev excluding mark-to-market gains and losses linked to the
      hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was 7 196 million USD in FY19 as
      compared to 8 099 million USD in FY18 and was 1 729 million USD in 4Q19 as compared to 2 306 million USD in
      4Q18.
•     Earnings per share (EPS): Normalized EPS in FY19 was 4.08 USD, an increase from 3.16 USD in FY18 and 0.48
      USD in 4Q19, a decrease from 0.71 USD in 4Q18. Underlying EPS (normalized EPS excluding mark-to-market
      gains and losses linked to the hedging of our share-based payment programs and the impact of hyperinflation) was
      3.63 USD in FY19, a decrease from 4.10 USD in FY18, and 0.87 USD in 4Q19, a decrease from 1.17 USD in 4Q18.
•     Dividend: The AB InBev Board proposes a final dividend of 1.00 EUR per share, subject to shareholder approval
      at the AGM on 29 April 2020. When combined with the interim dividend of 0.80 EUR per share paid in November
      2019, the total dividend for FY19 would be 1.80 EUR per share. A timeline showing the ex-coupon dates, the record
      dates, and the payment dates can be found on page 20.
•     Hyperinflation: The restatement of 9M19 under hyperinflation using the December purchasing power and closing
      rate had a positive impact of 55 million USD on revenue and 30 million USD on Normalized EBITDA on the FY19
      reported organic growth. The impact of 9M19 restatement under hyperinflation is excluded from the 4Q19 organic
      calculation and identified separately in Annex 2.
•     Deleveraging: Accounting for the proceeds expected to be received from the divestment of the Australian
      operations (while excluding the last 12 months EBITDA from the Australian operations), our net debt to EBITDA
      ratio would be 4.0x for the 12-month period ending 31 December 2019.
•     Combination with SAB: In 3Q19, we completed the delivery of the 3.2 billion USD synergies and cost savings on
      a constant currency basis as of August 2016 resulting from the combination with SAB.

    HEADLINE EARNINGS PER SHARE

Due to the secondary listing of the ordinary shares of AB InBev on the main board of the JSE Limited (JSE) in South
Africa, the Group is required to present headline earnings per share and diluted headline earnings per share, as
alternative measures of earnings per share, calculated in accordance with the circular entitled ‘Headline Earnings’ issued
by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, as amended from time to time.

The calculation of headline earnings per share is based on the headline earnings and a weighted average number of
ordinary and restricted shares outstanding (including deferred share instruments and stock lending) per end of the
period, calculated as follows:
                                                                            FY19              FY18 (Restated)

    DIVIDEND

The board of directors of AB InBev has proposed a final dividend of €1.00 per share (the “Dividend”), subject to obtaining
approval by the shareholders of the Company at the Annual General meeting to be held on Wednesday, 29 April 2020.
When combined with the interim dividend of €0.80 per share paid in November 2019, the total dividend for the financial
year ended 31 December 2019 amounts to €1.80 per share.

The proposed timetable for the Dividend is as follows:
                                                                                                                 2020

Additional information required by the JSE Listings Requirements

1.   No transfers of shareholdings to and from South Africa will be permitted between Tuesday, 5 May 2020 and Friday,
     8 May 2020 (both dates inclusive). No dematerialisation or rematerialisation orders will be permitted between
     Wednesday, 6 May 2020 and Friday, 8 May 2020 (both dates inclusive).

2.   The gross amount of the Dividend will be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding tax may be
     reduced to 15% in terms of the double tax treaty in force between Belgium and South Africa. A rebate of the
     additional Belgian withholding tax imposed must be claimed in accordance with the relevant reimbursement
     process noted below. The Dividend will also be subject to South African dividends tax at the rate of 20%, unless a
     shareholder qualifies for an exemption. Any shareholder who receives a dividend which is subject to South African
     dividends tax (i.e. where no exemption is available) will qualify for a 15% reduction in dividends tax. The ultimate
     result in such a case is that a dividend will be subject to a reduced Belgian withholding tax rate of 15% and subject
     to South African dividends tax at a rate of 5%.

3.   At Thursday, 27 February 2020, being the declaration announcement date of the Dividend, the Company had a
     total of 1,977,083,553 shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held 42,158,420 ordinary shares
     in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,019,241,973 shares (of which 1,693,242,156 ordinary shares are
     listed and 325,999,817 restricted shares are unlisted).

4.   The Dividend will be paid out of the Company’s operating results for 2019, increased with the profits carried over,
     without drawing on any capital reserves.

5.   The Dividend is payable in South African Rand to shareholders whose shares are held through Central Securities
     Participants and brokers traded on the JSE.

South African income tax and dividends tax consequences

The Dividend should be regarded as a ‘foreign dividend’ for South African income tax and South African dividends tax
purposes.

Foreign dividends received in respect of shares which are dual-listed on the JSE are, however, exempt from income
tax. Consequently, no South African income tax should be incurred by the shareholders in respect of the Dividend
received.

The Dividend may, however, be subject to South African dividends tax at 20%. There is though, amongst others, an
exemption from South African dividends tax if the Dividend is paid to a South African resident corporate shareholder.
This exemption operates in a manner similar to other local shares listed on the JSE and the dividends paid in respect
thereof to resident corporate shareholders and retirement funds. Intermediaries may only allow an exemption from South
African dividends tax, provided shareholders have completed and lodged a valid exemption form, which is obtainable
from their intermediary.

Belgian withholding tax

The gross amount of the Dividend will as a rule be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding tax
can under certain circumstances be reduced.

Belgian dividend withholding tax can be reduced to 15% pursuant to the Belgian-South African double tax treaty in force.
Such reduced rate can be applied provided that Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is filed by the shareholder with the Bureau
Central de Taxation de Bruxelles-Etranger, boulevard du Jardin Botanique 50 boîte 3429, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
(hereinafter the “Central Bureau of Taxation”) before the expiry of a period of five years from January 1st of the year in
which the withholding tax was paid, in which case the differential between the standard withholding tax rate of 30% and
the reduced treaty rate of 15% will be reimbursed.

An explanatory note is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax authorities’ official website:

https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/mym-api-rest/finform/pdf/2575

The current version of Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax authorities’
official website:
https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/mym-api-rest/finform/pdf/2599

A Belgian withholding tax exemption is also applicable to dividends paid to South African corporate shareholders that
hold a participation of less than 10% in the capital of AB InBev but with an acquisition value of at least €2.5 million. This
regime is subject to the cumulative conditions that (i) the company is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in
the meaning of Article 3, 1), d) of the Double Tax Treaty between Belgium and South Africa and has a legal form
considered similar to the ones listed in Annex I, Part A, to the Council Directive 2011/96/EU of 30 November 2011 on
the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States,
as amended by Directive 2014/863/EU of 8 July 2014; (ii) it is subject to corporate income tax or a similar tax without
benefiting from a tax regime that deviates from the ordinary domestic tax regime; (iii) the dividends relate to AB InBev
shares which it has held or will hold in full legal ownership for an uninterrupted period of at least one year; and (iv) it
cannot in principle credit the Belgian withholding tax paid on the AB InBev dividends or obtain a refund thereof according
to the legal provisions in force on December 31 of the year preceding the year of the payment or attribution of the
dividends.

In order to benefit from this reduced withholding tax, the shareholder must provide the Central Bureau of Taxation with
a South African residency certificate confirming that it fulfils the abovementioned conditions and indicating to what extent
the Belgian withholding tax is in principle creditable or reimbursable on the basis of the South African laws applicable
on 31 December of the year preceding the one during which the Dividend is paid or attributed.

South African dividends tax rebate in respect of Belgian withholding tax

A rebate must, for South African dividends tax purposes, be deducted from any South African dividends tax payable in
respect of the Dividend (i.e. where no exemption is available). This rebate will be equal to the amount of any Belgian
withholding tax paid in respect of the Dividend, without any right of recovery, and must not exceed the amount of the
South African dividends tax imposed in respect of the Dividend.

The CSDPs and/or brokers, in their capacity as the regulated intermediaries, must obtain proof of any Belgian
withholding tax paid and deducted from the South African tax payable, as above, in the form and manner prescribed by
the South African Revenue Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, the income tax and dividends tax information provided above is only relevant to shareholders
whose shares are held through CSDPs and brokers and are traded on the JSE.

Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position should seek independent professional advice.

1.    INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
      In 2010, SABMiller plc (through its South African subsidiary, The South African Breweries
      Proprietary Limited (""SAB"")) implemented a broad-based black economic empowerment (""BEE"")
      ownership transaction known as SAB Zenzele (""Existing Empowerment Transaction"").
      Amongst other things, the Existing Empowerment Transaction involved SAB issuing:
         *   approximately 3.52% of its total issued shares to SAB Zenzele Holdings Limited (""SAB
             Zenzele""), which in turn offered to issue ordinary shares in the share capital of SAB
             Zenzele to qualifying black people who were, at the time, retail liquor licence holders,
             retail liquor licence applicants or registered customers of ABI, which was at the time the
             soft drinks division of SAB (""SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders"");
         *   approximately 3.39% of its total issued shares to The SAB Zenzele Employee Trust
             (""Current ESOP""), which holds such shares for the benefit of certain qualifying employees
             of SAB and its subsidiaries and associated companies; and
         *   approximately 1.54% of its total issued shares to The SAB Foundation.
      The Existing Empowerment Transaction is due to unwind shortly after its 31 March 2020 maturity
      in accordance with the amended agreements entered into following the combination of SABMiller
      plc and Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA/NV (""AB InBev"") in 2016. Participants in the Existing
      Empowerment Transaction will receive R9.7 billion worth of ordinary shares in the share capital
      of AB InBev (""AB InBev Shares""), or the cash proceeds from the disposal of such AB InBev
      Shares (less associated taxes and costs), as determined in accordance with the formula set out
      in the aforementioned agreements.

                                                   1

SAB has received consistent feedback from the SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders that they
wish to be provided with an opportunity to re-invest some or all of the value to which they will be
entitled to on the unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction.

Accordingly, AB InBev is proposing, in conjunction with the contemplated unwind of the Existing
Empowerment Transaction, the implementation of a new R5.4 billion BEE ownership transaction
(""New Empowerment Transaction"") through a new company called SAB Zenzele Kabili
Holdings (RF) Limited (""SAB Zenzele Kabili""). Participants in the New Empowerment
Transaction will include the SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders, beneficiaries of the Current
ESOP that choose to re-invest, The SAB Foundation and qualifying employees of SAB through
a new employment share option plan (""New ESOP"").

As part of unwinding the Existing Empowerment Transaction and facilitating the implementation
of the New Empowerment Transaction, the board of directors of SAB Zenzele (""SAB Zenzele
Board"") has resolved that the most efficient and effective way to facilitate the principal further re-
investment by the c.29,000 SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders in the New Empowerment
Transaction, is through a scheme of arrangement in terms of section 114 of the Companies Act,
No 71 of 2008, as amended (""Companies Act""), (""SAB Zenzele Scheme""), proposed between
SAB Zenzele and the SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders. SAB Zenzele has accordingly
concluded a transaction implementation agreement with, amongst others, AB InBev, SAB and
SAB Zenzele Kabili, setting out the terms and conditions on which the New Empowerment
Transaction will be implemented.

The SAB Zenzele Scheme constitutes an ""affected transaction"" as defined in section 117(1)(c)(iii)
of the Companies Act, and as such, the SAB Zenzele Scheme is regulated by the Companies Act
and applicable Takeover Regulations (contained in Chapter 5 of the Companies Regulations,
2011) (""Takeover Regulations"").

In connection with proposing the SAB Zenzele Scheme and convening the relevant shareholders'
meeting to approve the special resolutions required to approve implementation of the SAB
Zenzele Scheme (""Shareholders' Meeting""), SAB Zenzele has prepared a circular to its
shareholders in accordance with the relevant disclosure requirements under the Companies Act
and the applicable Takeover Regulations, which circular incorporates a notice convening the
relevant Shareholders' Meeting for purposes of proposing for approval the relevant resolutions
required to implement the SAB Zenzele Scheme, and providing SAB Zenzele Retailer
Shareholders with the necessary statutorily-required information regarding the SAB Zenzele
Scheme (""SAB Zenzele Scheme Circular""). The SAB Zenzele Scheme Circular will be posted
to SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders on 19 February 2020, and will also be available on SAB
Zenzele's website, http://www.sab.co.za/sab-zenzele.

If the SAB Zenzele Scheme becomes operative, each SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder will
have ceded 15% of its entitlements to receive AB InBev Shares under the Existing Empowerment
Transaction (such full entitlements, the ""Settlement Entitlements"") to SAB Zenzele Kabili in
exchange for ordinary shares in the share capital of SAB Zenzele Kabili (""SAB Zenzele Kabili
Ordinary Shares"") of proportional value (""Scheme Consideration"").

In addition, SAB Zenzele Kabili will make an offer to SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders and the
beneficiaries of the Current ESOP (""Qualifying Investors"") to re-invest all or a further portion of
their Settlement Entitlement (subject to certain parameters described below and, in the case of
SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders, after taking into account the 15% of the Settlement
Entitlements re-invested through the SAB Zenzele Scheme (such 15% of the full entitlements,
the ""Scheme Entitlements"")), into SAB Zenzele Kabili (""Reinvestment Offer"") in exchange for
further SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of proportional value.

Simultaneously with, or shortly after the implementation of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, SAB
Zenzele Kabili will be listed on the BEE Segment of the JSE, to create liquidity and allow trading
of SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares from the outset with other BEE investors (""BEE Listing"").
In connection with the Reinvestment Offer and the BEE Listing, SAB Zenzele Kabili has prepared
a prospectus in compliance with the applicable substance and form requirements for a prospectus
set out in the Companies Act and the Companies Regulations, 2011 and applicable pre-listing
statement requirements of the JSE Limited (""JSE Listings Requirements"") (""SAB Zenzele
Kabili Prospectus"").


                                               2

2.   SALIENT DETAILS OF THE UNWIND OF THE EXISTING EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION
     If the SAB Zenzele Scheme becomes operative, Qualifying Investors will have the opportunity to
     re-invest all or a portion of their Settlement Entitlements into SAB Zenzele Kabili, subject to
     certain parameters described below. In respect of the remaining Settlement Entitlements (after
     taking into account any portion thereof which is ceded to SAB Zenzele Kabili pursuant to the SAB
     Zenzele Scheme and/or the Reinvestment Offer), each Qualifying Investor will be entitled to elect
     to be settled as follows (""Settlement Election""):
           *   cash, whereby their remaining Settlement Entitlements will be sold on their behalf and they
               will receive the cash proceeds arising from such sale, less associated taxes and costs
               (""Sale Proceeds Settlement""); and/or
           *   AB InBev Shares, whereby the remaining Settlement Entitlements will be settled in AB
               InBev Shares (""AB InBev Shares Settlement"").
      The SAB Zenzele Board wishes to draw to the attention of the SAB Zenzele Retailer
      Shareholders that their right to receive the Sale Proceeds Settlement and/or the AB InBev
      Shares Settlement (depending on their election) upon unwind of the Existing Empowerment
      Transaction is not conditional on the approval of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, save that if the
      relevant resolutions are not approved, SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders who are entitled to
      less than 100 AB InBev Shares upon the unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction will,
      consistent with the current memorandum of incorporation of SAB Zenzele (""SAB Zenzele MOI""),
      be deemed to have elected the Sale Proceeds Settlement.
      Although the entitlement to the AB InBev Shares upon the unwind of the Existing Empowerment
      Transaction (and by necessary extension the Settlement Election) is not conditional on the SAB
      Zenzele Scheme becoming operative, the value of the AB InBev Shares that each Qualifying
      Investor is entitled to is contingent on the SAB Zenzele Scheme and the Reinvestment Offer.
      Accordingly, the following two scenarios will impact on how the Settlement Election is applicable
      to a Qualifying Investor:
     I.        if the SAB Zenzele Scheme is approved and the New Empowerment Transaction, which
               includes the Reinvestment Offer, is implemented:
               *   If you are a SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder, your Scheme Entitlement (being 15%
                   of your full Settlement Entitlement) will be automatically ceded to SAB Zenzele Kabili
                   under the SAB Zenzele Scheme and you will be left with 85% of your Settlement
                   Entitlement, minus whatever portion thereof you elect to re-invest into SAB Zenzele
                   Kabili under the Reinvestment Offer (if any); or
               *   If you are a beneficiary of the Current ESOP, you will be entitled to elect the Sale
                   Proceeds Settlement or the AB InBev Shares Settlement in respect of 100% of your
                   Settlement Entitlement minus whatever portion thereof you elect to re-invest into SAB
                   Zenzele Kabili under the Reinvestment Offer (if any).
     II.       if the SAB Zenzele Scheme is not approved and the New Empowerment Transaction, which
               includes the Reinvestment Offer, is not implemented:
               The Existing Empowerment Transaction will unwind in accordance with its terms. In
               particular, you will receive the full Settlement Entitlement that you are entitled to receive
               under the Existing Empowerment Transaction (in accordance with your Settlement
               Election) and you will not have the opportunity to re-invest all or part of their Settlement
               Entitlement in the New Empowerment Transaction.
               For the avoidance of doubt, consistent with the terms of the SAB Zenzele MOI, if the
               relevant shareholder resolutions are not approved, a SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder
               who is entitled to less than 100 AB InBev Shares on the unwind of the Existing
               Empowerment Transaction shall only be entitled to receive the cash proceeds (less
               associated taxes and costs) arising from a sale of those AB InBev Shares pursuant to the
               unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction.

3.   SALIENT DETAILS OF THE NEW EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION

3.1   SUMMARY OF KEY ELEMENTS
      AB InBev and SAB intend to implement the New Empowerment Transaction, subject to the
      SAB Zenzele Scheme becoming operative, through the establishment of SAB Zenzele Kabili,
      by means of the following key elements:
      *   each SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder will re-invest their Scheme Entitlement (being
          15% of their full Settlement Entitlement) into SAB Zenzele Kabili in exchange for SAB
          Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of proportional value in terms of the SAB Zenzele Scheme,
          as described in greater detail in paragraph 3.2 below;
      *   offering (i) the beneficiaries of the Current ESOP the ability to re-invest all or a portion of
          their Settlement Entitlement, subject to certain parameters described below, in exchange
          for SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of proportional value; and (ii) SAB Zenzele
          Retailer Shareholders the ability to re-invest all or a portion of their remaining Settlement
          Entitlement (subject to certain parameters described below and after taking into account
          the Scheme Entitlement ceded to SAB Zenzele Kabili pursuant to the SAB Zenzele
          Scheme) into SAB Zenzele Kabili in exchange for SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of
          proportional value, in terms of the Reinvestment Offer described in greater detail in
          paragraph 3.3 below;
      *   SAB will contribute the equivalent of R600 million worth of AB InBev Shares to SAB
          Zenzele Kabili on behalf of the New ESOP;
      *   SAB will contribute the equivalent of R120 million worth of AB InBev Shares to the New
          ESOP. The New ESOP will sell these AB InBev Shares and use the proceeds to acquire
          SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares from those SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders who
          voted against the SAB Zenzele Scheme and wish to dispose of their SAB Zenzele Kabili
          Ordinary Shares or, failing that, to acquire further SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares in
          the market;
      *   The SAB Foundation has committed to re-invest into SAB Zenzele Kabili the equivalent of
          up to R400 million worth of AB InBev Shares (c. 21% of its Settlement Entitlement), of
          which R344 million will be used upon listing to acquire SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary
          Shares. The balance will be used to acquire SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares from
          SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders who voted against the SAB Zenzele Scheme and wish
          to dispose of their SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares or, failing that, to acquire additional
          SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares in the market;
      *   SAB will contribute the equivalent of R2 973 million worth of AB InBev Shares to SAB
          Zenzele Kabili, and in return SAB Zenzele Kabili will issue preference shares to SAB,
          representing vendor funding of R2 973 million; and
      *   SAB will contribute the equivalent of R811 million worth of AB InBev Shares (as at 31
          March 2020) at no further cost to SAB Zenzele Kabili (""Discount Shares"") to further
          enhance the capital structure of SAB Zenzele Kabili.

       SAB Zenzele Kabili has sufficient authorised but unissued SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary
       Shares to settle the various components of the New Empowerment Transaction as described
       above.

3.2    THE SAB ZENZELE SCHEME
       In terms of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, SAB Zenzele Kabili as offeror, will acquire the Scheme
       Entitlements (being 15% of the full Settlement Entitlements) from the SAB Zenzele Retailer
       Shareholders for the Scheme Consideration. The operation of the SAB Zenzele Scheme is
       subject to the fulfillment or, where appropriate, waiver, of the conditions precedent as
       described in paragraph 5.1 below.
       If the SAB Zenzele Scheme becomes operative it will be binding on all the SAB Zenzele
       Retailer Shareholders (irrespective of whether a SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder voted in
       favour of the Scheme or not) and:


                                                 4

*   each SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder will be deemed, with effect from the
    implementation date of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, to have ceded its Scheme Entitlements
    (and disposed of the AB InBev Shares underlying the Scheme Entitlements), free and
    clear of encumbrances, to SAB Zenzele Kabili;
*   SAB Zenzele Kabili will be deemed to have acquired all the Scheme Entitlements (and
    the registered and beneficial ownership of the AB InBev Shares underlying the Scheme
    Entitlements) without any further act or instrument being required, for the Scheme
    Consideration; and
*   each SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder who will have become entitled to less than 100
    AB InBev Shares upon the unwind of the Existing Empowerment Transaction and
    consequently will have received a cash settlement pursuant to the sale of such AB InBev
    Shares in accordance with the transaction terms will be deemed, with effect from the
    implementation date of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, to have waived its rights to be cash
    settled and shall be deemed to have consented to a settlement pursuant to the terms of
    the SAB Zenzele Scheme.

In consideration for the cession of the Scheme Entitlements, each SAB Zenzele Retailer
Shareholder will be entitled to receive the Scheme Consideration (being such number of SAB
Zenzele Kabili Shares as are proportional to the Scheme Entitlements ceded by such SAB
Zenzele Retailer Shareholders to SAB Zenzele Kabili under the SAB Zenzele Scheme),
subject to the terms and conditions of the SAB Zenzele Scheme Circular.

SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders are advised to refer to the SAB Zenzele Scheme Circular
for the full terms and conditions of the SAB Zenzele Scheme.

3.3  THE REINVESTMENT OFFER AND BEE LISTING
In the event the SAB Zenzele Scheme becomes operative, SAB Zenzele Retailer
Shareholders will have the ability to re-invest all or a portion of their remaining Settlement
Entitlement (subject to certain parameters described below and after taking into account the
15% ceded to SAB Zenzele Kabili pursuant to the SAB Zenzele Scheme) into SAB Zenzele
Kabili in exchange for additional SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of proportional value
pursuant to the Reinvestment Offer. Furthermore, beneficiaries of the Current ESOP have the
ability to re-invest all or a portion of their Settlement Entitlement, subject to certain parameters
described below, in exchange for SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares of proportional value.
The number of SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares being offered by SAB Zenzele Kabili
pursuant to the Reinvestment Offer is capped at 8.6 million SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary
Shares or an aggregate Rand amount of R344 million. Accordingly, it is possible that a SAB
Zenzele Retailer Shareholder who applies for SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares pursuant
to the Reinvestment Offer may not be allocated the full number of SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary
Shares that they applied for. Further details of these allocation principles will be set out in the
SAB Zenzele Kabili Prospectus.
Simultaneously with, or shortly after, implementation of the SAB Zenzele Scheme, SAB
Zenzele Kabili will be listed on the BEE Segment of the JSE pursuant to the BEE Listing,
thereby facilitating trading and liquidity for the participants of the New Empowerment
Transaction who wish to, and are entitled to, trade their SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares.

becoming operative, a listing on the BEE Segment of the JSE, under share code ""SZK"", ISIN

4.   ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF THE IMPACT OF THE SAB ZENZELE SCHEME ON SAB
     ZENZELE RETAILER SHAREHOLDERS
     In order to enable SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders to assess the impact of the SAB Zenzele
     Scheme and broader participation in the New Empowerment Transaction and understand the
     proportional value to be received pursuant to the SAB Zenzele Scheme and any participation in
     the Reinvestment Offer, the worked example below has been prepared for illustrative purposes
     only.
     The worked examples below illustrate the impact of the SAB Zenzele Scheme on a SAB Zenzele
     Retailer Shareholder that invested R100 or R2 500 in 2010. SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares
     will be issued at a subscription price of R40 per share. The number of SAB Zenzele Kabili
     Ordinary Shares to be issued to a SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder will be determined by
     dividing the 15% Scheme Entitlement by the R40 subscription price.

Notes and assumptions:

1.  Current unwind value calculated based on the provisions of the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement between AB
    InBev, SAB, SABMiller plc, SAB Zenzele, the Current ESOP and The SAB Foundation using a fixed price of GBP45 per
    SABMiller plc share, adjusted for inflation over time and reduced by the: (i) notional funding repaid as per the repurchase
    mechanism, (ii) R625m upfront special dividend paid in November 2016, (iii) R76m Distell disposal dividend paid in May
    2017 and (iv) R312m CCBA disposal dividend paid in December 2017.
2. Current unwind value multiplied by reinvestment percentage
3. Current unwind value less reinvestment into SAB Zenzele Kabili. SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder given election on how
    the balance of the Settlement Entitlement is delivered (i.e. cash proceeds of sale of AB InBev Shares on the open market
    (less associated taxes and costs) or AB InBev Shares)
4. Reinvested value divided by SAB Zenzele Kabili issue price of R40 per SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Share
5. Distributed value divided by an assumed AB InBev market value of R1 112 per AB InBev Share (where applicable)
6. Regardless of election
7. SAB Zenzele Kabili Ordinary Shares received multiplied by SAB Zenzele Kabili net asset value of R60 per SAB Zenzele
    Kabili Ordinary Share. For every R1.00 of equity invested by a SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholder, SAB will contribute R0.50
    in the form of an incentive discount
8. AB InBev Shares received multiplied by an assumed AB InBev market value of R1 112 per AB InBev Share
9. Unwind value less value of AB InBev Shares received
10. The above is before taxes and other related transaction costs and expenses

      III.     the receipt of unconditional approvals, consents or waivers from all applicable regulatory

               the JSE, and, to the extent that any such approvals, consents or waivers are subject to
               conditions, in each case on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to SAB Zenzele

      IV.      the Scheme Resolution not being opposed by 15% or more of the voting rights exercised

                    a. no person who voted against the Scheme Resolution requiring SAB Zenzele to
                       seek the approval of the Court in terms of section 115(3) of the Companies Act; or
                    b. if a person who voted against the Scheme Resolution requires SAB Zenzele to
                       seek the approval of the Court in terms of section 115(3) of the Companies Act,
                       then:
                               i. the SAB Zenzele Scheme being approved by the Court unconditionally, or
                                  if subject to conditions, the person on whom such conditions are imposed
                                  approves such conditions and undertakes in writing to comply therewith;
                                  and



                                                              9

                          ii. SAB Zenzele not treating the Scheme Resolution as a nullity in terms of
                              section 115(5)(b) of the Companies Act;
      V.     no leave is granted by the Court, pursuant to section 115(3)(b) of the Companies Act, to
             any person who voted against the Scheme Resolution and who applied to the Court for a
             review of the Scheme; and
     VI.     with regard to any SAB Zenzele Retailer Shareholders exercising appraisal rights, within
             the period prescribed under section 164(7) of the Companies Act, no valid demands having
             been received by, or remain capable of being given to, SAB Zenzele in terms of such
             section which in aggregate represent more than 5% of the SAB Zenzele shares in issue.
           The Scheme Conditions set out in (I) to (V) above (both inclusive) are not capable of waiver.
           The Scheme Condition set out in (VI) is for the benefit of SAB Zenzele. SAB Zenzele is entitled
           at any time prior to the Long Stop Date, or the Extended Long Stop Date, to waive compliance
           with such Scheme Condition. An announcement will be published in the South African press
           as soon as possible after the fulfilment, waiver or non-fulfilment, as the case may be, of the
           Scheme Conditions.
           For the avoidance of doubt, if the Scheme Conditions are not fulfilled or waived (to the extent
           possible) by the Long Stop Date, or the Extended Long Stop Date, then the SAB Zenzele
           Scheme will not become operative and the New Empowerment Transaction will not proceed.
           Consequently, Qualifying Investors will continue in their present position as participants in the
           Existing Empowerment Scheme, which will unwind in accordance with its terms. In particular,
           Qualifying Investors will receive their full Settlement Entitlement and they will not have the
           benefit of re-investing all or part of it as contemplated under the New Empowerment
           Transaction.

5.2        THE NEW EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION
           The implementation of the balance of the New Empowerment Transaction, including the BEE
           Listing, is subject to the suspensive condition that the SAB Zenzele Scheme becomes
           unconditional and operative.

      6 February 2020 (CET) – Anheuser-Busch InBev (Euronext: ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH)
      announced today that Felipe Dutra, Chief Financial and Technology Officer, will step down after a long and
      distinguished career with the company. Fernando Tennenbaum has been appointed Chief Financial Officer
      (CFO). David Almeida will become Chief Strategy and Technology Officer and Nelson Jamel has been
      appointed Chief People Officer. They will be part of the company’s Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and report
      to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Carlos Brito. Fernando Tennenbaum will also join the Executive
      Committee.

      The changes above are part of a well-established succession plan and will be effective after AB InBev’s Annual
      Shareholders’ Meeting, to be held on 29 April 2020. Felipe Dutra will remain with the company during a
      transition period of several months after the succession is effective.

      Carlos Brito, CEO, stated: “Felipe’s departure is bittersweet. For nearly 30 years, he has been a champion of
      our company and a fantastic partner to me and the members of our Senior Leadership Team as we grew the
      company. Felipe feels that now is the right time to embark on new projects, and we are respectful of his
      decision.

      “Felipe’s contributions to AB InBev are hard to overstate. Since becoming CFO in 1999 of what was then
      Brahma, he has embodied the spirit of true ownership and has been the architect of our company’s financial
      strategy, our risk management policy and our drive to deliver best-in-class cash flow and shareholder value.
      Felipe’s contributions to our value creation are significant and wide-ranging. He has been the steward of our
      financial discipline, which has freed up resources to invest behind the organic growth of our business. He has
      played a key role in the creations of Ambev and InBev, as well as in our landmark combinations with Anheuser-
      Busch, Grupo Modelo and SAB. In the last few years, he has also driven the creation of our leading Technology
      function. Perhaps most importantly, he developed a strong bench of internal talent for both Finance and
      Technology as part of his legacy. We are very grateful to Felipe and wish him the best of luck in his future
      endeavors.”


                                                                                                                              1

      Felipe Dutra said: “It has been an honor to be part of this company for nearly 30 years. I was fortunate enough
      to participate in our transformation from being a Brazilian local champion into one of the world’s most
      successful consumer goods companies. I am very thankful to the Board, to our shareholders and to Brito for
      his leadership and partnership and, most especially, to the amazing teams and colleagues that have supported
      me over the years. It has been a tremendous privilege to have been part of this journey. Today, AB InBev is
      in a strong position, both financially and operationally. We have a superb team, a solid strategy, an outstanding
      geographic footprint and an unparalleled portfolio of brands, giving me the confidence that AB InBev will
      continue to create enduring value for its consumers, customers and shareholders. I have great respect for and
      confidence in Fernando, who will build on our company’s legacy of financial discipline and operational
      excellence.”



      Chief Financial Officer: Fernando Tennenbaum, incoming CFO, is a 15-year veteran of the company and
      presently serves as Vice President of Finance for the company’s South America Zone, as well as Chief
      Financial and Investor Relations Officer of its Brazilian subsidiary Ambev S.A., a publicly traded company
      listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange and NYSE. Fernando Tennenbaum has a thorough understanding of
      the company’s business and international experience developed through several positions in the finance
      function, including Treasury, M&A and Investor Relations. He played a key role in the combination with SAB,
      leading the funding of the deal and managing of the company’s debt profile.

      “We would like to congratulate Fernando on being appointed our CFO. With deep functional expertise and
      strong technical knowledge, he is uniquely qualified to lead our Finance function and actively support topline
      growth through solid financial management. Fernando’s mandate will be to ensure AB InBev continues to
      invest behind the organic growth of the business while deleveraging toward the optimal capital structure”, said
      Brito.

      In turn, Fernando Tennenbaum said: “I would like to thank Brito and the Board for this opportunity and their
      confidence. I am grateful to Felipe for his leadership and friendship over the last 15 years. I could not be more
      excited to take on this challenge and look forward to working with the strong team at AB InBev to drive our
      value creation agenda.”

      Concurrently, Ambev S.A. has announced that Lucas Lira will be replacing Fernando Tennenbaum as Chief
      Financial and Investor Relations Officer, as of 29 April 2020. For further information, please refer to Ambev
      S.A.’s press release issued today.

      Chief Strategy and Technology Officer: David Almeida, who currently serves as Chief People and Strategy
      Officer, will become Chief Strategy and Technology Officer. He joined AB InBev 22 years ago and has broad
      experience, spanning across geographies and functions (including Finance, Sales, Integration, Strategy and
      People). David Almeida has been a member of the Senior Leadership Team since November 2015 and of the
      Executive Committee since July 2019.

      With respect to this change, Brito stated: “Bringing Strategy and Technology together will increase our focus
      and help us accelerate the initiatives we have identified for transforming our business, so we continue to lead
      future growth through consumer-centricity, operational excellence and innovation. David has played a key role



                                                                                                                     2
