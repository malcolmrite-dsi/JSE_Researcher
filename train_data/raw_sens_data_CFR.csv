General notes:
1. Trading in the entitlements to the A Warrant Receipts will only be permitted to commence 3 Business Days prior to the settlement of the A Warrant Receipts.

2. The issuance of the A Warrant Receipts on the JSE on 2 December 2020 will not give rise to any fractions of the A Warrant Receipts.
3. Certificated DR Holders are advised to dematerialise their DRs as soon as possible in order to facilitate the issue of dematerialised A Warrant Receipts. DR Holders are advised that there may be no dematerialisation or rematerialisation of their DRs between Wednesday, 25 November 2020 and Friday, 27 November 2020, both days inclusive. The register is closed for all cross-register movements between Wednesday, 25 November 2020 and Friday, 27 November 2020, both days inclusive.
4. The A Warrant Receipt register is expected to be closed for all cross-register movements as from 8 November 2023 until the Expiry Date. During that period, A Warrants traded on SIX Swiss Exchange will not be capable of exchange against A Warrant Receipts traded on the JSE and vice versa.
5. The JSE code for the A Warrant Receipts is CFRO and the ISIN is CH0562931086.
6. The above dates and times are subject to change. Any material change will be released on SENS. Detailed dates and times relating inter alia, to the settlement of New DRs upon the exercise of A Warrant Receipts will be announced in due course.

Farfetch, Alibaba Group and Richemont Form Global Partnership to Accelerate the Digitisation of the Luxury Industry


- Alibaba to launch Farfetch luxury shopping channels on Tmall Luxury Pavilion and Luxury Soho; will also invest in newly formed Farfetch China Joint Venture and in Farfetch Limited
- Richemont to invest in newly formed Farfetch China Joint Venture and in Farfetch Limited; will also explore additional opportunities to work closely with Farfetch
- Farfetch and Alibaba to leverage their platforms and augmented retail technologies to accelerate the digitisation of the luxury industry; also forming a Steering Group, joined by influential luxury leaders, Johann Rupert and François-Henri Pinault
- Artemis to increase existing ownership in Farfetch with additional investment

November 5, 2020 - Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA and HKSE: 9988) and Richemont (SWX:CFR) today announced a global strategic partnership to provide luxury brands with enhanced access to the China market as well as accelerate the digitisation of the global luxury industry. Leveraging each company's respective expertise and extensive reach, the partnership will bring luxury retail to the next generation by seamlessly integrating the digital and physical realms.

Farfetch to Launch on Alibaba's Luxury Platforms in China

Farfetch will launch luxury shopping channels on Alibaba's platforms, Tmall Luxury Pavilion and Luxury Soho, China's premier luxury and luxury outlet destination within the Tmall marketplace, as well as Alibaba's cross-border marketplace Tmall Global. The new channels expand the reach of Farfetch's global luxury platform to Alibaba's 757 million consumers, offering luxury brands a multi-brand solution through a single integration with Farfetch. This will provide luxury labels with a unique opportunity to elevate their brand awareness, while also significantly expanding their addressable market of luxury consumers through their participation on Farfetch's global marketplace. For luxury consumers, this provides multiple ways to shop for their favorite brands either through the Farfetch integration, or through the already highly successful NET-A-PORTER integration on Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

Strategic Investments in Farfetch and Farfetch China

As part of the global partnership, Alibaba and Richemont will invest USD600 million (USD300 million each) in private convertible notes issued by Farfetch Limited. Alibaba and Richemont will also invest USD500 million (USD250 million each) in Farfetch China, taking a combined 25% stake in a new joint venture that will include Farfetch's marketplace operations in the China region. In addition, Alibaba and Richemont have an option to purchase a further combined 24% of Farfetch China after the third year of the joint venture's formation. Alibaba and Richemont will also explore additional opportunities to work closely with Farfetch to provide services to luxury brands. The investments by Alibaba and Richemont in Farfetch China and the establishment of the joint venture are expected to be completed during the first half of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.

Separately, Artemis has also agreed to increase its existing investment in Farfetch with a USD50 million purchase of Farfetch's Class A ordinary shares.

Accelerating the Digitisation of the Global Luxury Industry

Luxury New Retail (""LNR"") is a visionary initiative which will leverage Farfetch's and Alibaba's state-of-the-art omnichannel retail technologies to serve the needs of luxury businesses, including a full suite of enterprise solutions powered by Farfetch. These solutions will serve both mono-brand and multi-brand distribution strategies for luxury brands, including fully-connected e-commerce websites and apps, omnichannel retail technology, and access to the Farfetch and Tmall Luxury Pavilion marketplaces via a single integration.

Farfetch and Alibaba have also formed a steering group to further enhance the LNR initiative, which is aimed at leading the digitisation of the global luxury retail industry. Richemont Chairman, Johann Rupert, and Artemis Chairman, François-Henri Pinault, will join Farfetch and Alibaba on the LNR steering group as founding members, bringing their combined decades of industry leadership and expertise.

José Neves, Farfetch Founder, Chairman and CEO said: ""This announcement is a major step in our mission to connect the curators, creators and consumers of the luxury fashion industry. The USD1.15 billion investment in Farfetch from Alibaba Group, Richemont, and Artemis is a strong validation of our position as the global platform for luxury.

The new initiatives with Alibaba Group and Richemont extend Farfetch's strategy to power the digital transformation occurring across the luxury industry, which has been accelerated by the unprecedented challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Luxury New Retail initiative will explore ways we can help the wider industry move forward and thrive in the post-COVID world.""

Daniel Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group, said: ""This highly complementary partnership brings together some of the world's leading luxury retail and technology platforms, representing another milestone in Alibaba's strategy to meet the rapidly growing demand for luxury products in China. The Chinese luxury market – which is expected to account for half of global luxury sales by 2025 – consists of hundreds of millions of young, digitally-native consumers. By partnering with Farfetch and expanding our existing relationship with Richemont, we will accelerate the digitisation of the global luxury retail industry and transform the luxury shopping experience for consumers.""

Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said: ""Building on our successful joint venture with Alibaba, these developments represent a further meaningful acceleration of our journey towards Luxury New Retail. This initiative brings together a powerful combination of highly complementary strengths - notably with our Maisons' luxury retail expertise and YOOX NET-A-PORTER's deep brand partnerships, expert curation and exceptional customer care - that will help us deliver a seamless omnichannel experience to our discerning clientele.
Partnerships make you stronger. I am delighted to partner with Daniel, José, and François-Henri to bring our shared vision to fruition, setting new standards for the future of luxury.""

François-Henri Pinault, Chairman, Artemis, said: ""The growth potential of luxury e-commerce has never been so promising, and the importance of China for the luxury industry is only becoming more obvious every day. Thanks to the vision of José Neves, Farfetch played an important role in improving the omnichannel experience for luxury customers in recent years. The investment by Artemis demonstrates our belief in the future of Farfetch and I am personally looking forward to exploring the future of luxury retail with this group of visionaries and experts.""  

Goldman Sachs International acted as Lead Financial Adviser and Allen & Company LLC acted as Financial Adviser to Farfetch.

FARFETCH ISSUANCE OF USD600 MILLION 0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2030

In conjunction with the above strategic developments, Alibaba Group and Richemont have each agreed to purchase USD300 million of the 0% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the ""Notes"") issued by Farfetch Limited (the ""Company"") for total gross proceeds of USD600 million. The additional capital will support Farfetch's long-term strategy of delivering a global technology platform for the luxury fashion industry and facilitate the Company's continued focus on executing its growth plans and driving towards operational profitability.  The sale of the Notes to Alibaba Group and Richemont is expected to settle on or about November 17, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.
 
In conjunction with its investment, Alibaba Group will nominate one director to the Farfetch Board.

The Notes will mature on November 15, 2030 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. At any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert the Notes at its option at an initial conversion price of approximately USD32.29, which reflects a 22% premium to the volume-weighted average price over the trailing thirty (30) trading day period ending on October 30, 2020. Upon conversion, the Notes will be settled in Class A ordinary shares of the Company (with the Company's right, in certain circumstances, to settle the Notes in its Class A ordinary shares, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company's election). If certain events occur that constitute a ""fundamental change"" (as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the Notes), holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or some of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus all accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, and including, the maturity date.  The Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who convert Notes in connection with a fundamental change.

Alibaba Group and Richemont may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their respective Notes on June 30, 2026 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, such repurchase date.

The Company will not be able to redeem the Notes prior to November 15, 2023, except in the event of certain tax law changes. On or after November 15, 2023, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the relevant Notes if the last reported sale price of its Class A ordinary shares has been at least 130% (or 200%, if a substantial portion of the relevant Notes are held at the time by Alibaba Group or Richemont) of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of the redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100%  of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

When issued, the Notes will be the Company's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; contractually subordinated to the Company's 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025; and structurally junior to any indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's subsidiaries.

ARTEMIS INVESTMENT DISCLOSURE:

In conjunction with the above strategic developments, Artemis has agreed to purchase 1,889,338 Class A ordinary shares issued by Farfetch for total gross proceeds of approximately USD50 million.  The issuance of shares to Artemis is expected to settle on or about November 17, 2020 subject to customary closing conditions.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT

16 OCTOBER 2020


RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES EGM AND UPDATE TO EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME AND CONDITIONAL SHARE CAPITAL INCREASE


Shareholder loyalty scheme

On 9 September 2020, Richemont announced the temporary suspension of its proposed shareholder loyalty scheme in order to study the potential impact of cancelling the Company's depository receipt programme in South Africa and delivering Richemont A shares to holders of South African depository receipts. Having successfully completed its study, the Board of Directors is pleased to announce that it will proceed with the issuance of tradeable warrants to shareholders, allowing them either to trade the warrants or, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrants, acquire new Richemont A shares in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price.

The exercise price of the tradable warrants proposed in the scheme will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares before the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), thereby allowing those shareholders who hold the warrants until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares during the lifetime of the warrants. 

The revised terms of the warrants will be described in the updated information memorandum to be published on the Company's website on 19 October 2020 and will contain clauses allowing the Company to transition away from its depository receipt programme, if and when it decides to do so. The final terms of the warrants, including the exercise price, will be published after the EGM.


Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the warrants, shareholders will be asked to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of shareholders on 17 November 2020 to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision in the articles of association and to authorise the issuance of a maximum of 22 000 000 new A shares (and an identical number of B shares) upon exercise of the warrants.

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association will be found in the updated information memorandum to be issued on 19 October 2020.


Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)

Richemont also confirms that the EGM will be held at 10.00 a.m. at its registered office on 17 November 2020. Given the continued uncertainties linked to Covid-19 and related health and safety concerns, the Board of Directors has decided it prudent, pursuant to Article 27 of the Ordinance 3 of the Swiss Federal Council 'on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19)', to hold the meeting without the attendance of shareholders.

Shareholders are invited to submit voting instructions through the Company's registrar, Computershare Schweiz AG, or by sending them directly to the independent representative of the shareholders, Etude Gampert and Demierre, Notaires. Detailed instructions on how to vote can be found in the meeting notice which will be posted on Richemont's website on 19 October 2020.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

Please note that Computershare have received refunds from the Swiss Federal Tax Authority for which they have been unable to make payment. If you have previously made a claim and have not received your refund, please contact Computershare (contact details as above), who will be able to advise you if your payment is pending. Please further note that any long outstanding payments older than ten years, which Computershare have been unable to pay, will become forfeit at the end of February 2021.

RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME


The Board of Directors of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (Richemont) announces its intention to study the possibility of delivering Richemont A shares to holders of South African depository receipts, thereby cancelling the Company's depository receipt programme in South Africa. The contemplated simplified structure is intended to reduce administrative complexity and facilitate cross-border trading in Richemont A shares between investors on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Consequently, the Board has taken the decision to temporarily postpone the issuance of warrants under the proposed shareholder loyalty scheme, to study the possible impact of this contemplated change in cross-border trading.

The Board will therefore no longer propose the creation of a conditional capital as listed under Item 3 (""Creation of a conditional share capital"") in the notice of meeting dated 12 August 2020, at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) due on 9 September 2020. The Board's proposal under Item 3 will therefore be withdrawn from the agenda of the AGM.

The Board will submit a revised proposal on the matter at an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders, which will be held later this year.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS IN RESPECT OF UNDERLYING COMPAGNIE FINANCIERE RICHEMONT SA 'A' SHARES ('CFR DRs') 


The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand. 

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.00 per share.  It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on 9 September 2020 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 percent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 0.65 per share. 

A number of major banks (Absa, Nedbank, RMB and Standard Bank) have notified clients that they will be discontinuing the use of cheques as a means of payment. We expect this to become the norm for all banks by 2021. We therefore suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure that they have provided them with account details and the information held in the Strate system is correct.

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 percent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 23 September 2020, at the time of the payment of the dividend. In the past, certain CFR DR Holders may have lost their opportunity to reclaim the withholding tax due to incorrect contact information being supplied to Strate. We suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure the information held in the Strate system is correct. In completing last year's withholding tax reclaim, claimants may have included their email address. For all of those who provided this information, the withholding tax reclaim form will be sent by email to you. For those who have not provide email details we would ask you to contact Computershare at the following address WHT.Richemont@Computershare.co.za Once received
Computershare will email the withholding tax reclaim form to you for your completion. We hope that this may alleviate the postal difficulties some claimants have experienced in the past. If you do not have an email address, please contact Computershare on 0861 100 935, to arrange a withholding tax reclaim form to be posted to you.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling was obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those CFR DR holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:


                                                        Net dividend
                                    Swiss               in Swiss francs
                 Gross dividend     withholding tax     before South
                 per CFR DR         at 35%              African
                 in Swiss francs    in Swiss  francs    dividend tax

Total            0.1000             (0.03500)           0.06500

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 18.27540: Swiss franc 1. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per CFR DR after South African dividend tax is ZAR 109.65240 cents, as set out in the table below:

Gross dividend    Swiss withholding  South African    
Per CFR DR        tax at 35%         withholding tax    Net dividend

Total 182.75400   (63.96390)        (9.13770)           109.65240 

Under the withholding tax recovery programme, qualifying SACMA residents will currently be entitled to recover the equivalent of CHF 0.0200 per CFR DR. The amount recovered will be converted into rand and will be remitted to CFR DR holders who participate in the programme once the reimbursement of the tax has been received from the Swiss Federal Tax Authorities ('SFTA'). Your attention is drawn to the fact that the refunds are to be paid by the SFTA in Swiss francs and that the SFTA imposes a maximum time period of three years after the dividend payment in which to make your claim. The Swiss francs received by Richemont Securities SA will be converted into rand at the rand: Swiss franc exchange rate ruling at the time of receipt. Bearing in mind the fluctuating rand: Swiss franc exchange rate, the effective rate used to arrive at the rand refund payment to CFR DR holders will differ from that applicable to the dividend payment itself.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA | EQUITY-BASED LOYALTY SCHEME CORRECTION TO THE SPECIFIED NUMBER

1. Introduction

Holders of Richemont Securities Depositary Receipts (""DRs"") (""DR Holders"") are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 7 August 2020 wherein Richemont Securities advised DR Holders that the board of directors of Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re Richemont SA, Switzerland (""Richemont"" or ""CFR"") (the ""Board"") has proposed an equity based shareholder loyalty scheme whereby it will issue tradable warrants to its shareholders. Richemont will issue A warrants to holders of Richemont A shares (""A Warrants""), B warrants to holders of Richemont B shares (""B Warrants"") collectively the ""Warrants"" and the Company will issue A warrant receipts to DR Holders (""A Warrant Receipts""). Richemont shareholders and DR Holders will be able to either trade the A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts or, subject to the terms and conditions of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts, acquire new Richemont A shares or DRs respectively, in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. DR Holders will receive 
two A Warrant Receipts for every DR held.


2. Correction to the Specified Number

The Specified Number is the number of A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts, as the case may be, required to be exercised to purchase one CFR Share or one DR, as the case may be during the Exercise Period. The Specified Number in paragraph 7 of the SIM was incorrectly described as ""The Specified Number of A Warrant Receipts giving the right to Eligible Holders to subscribe for one DR during the Exercise Period will be equal to the Rand amount of the Exercise Price"". The following paragraph is hereby substituted for the description of Specified Number in paragraph 7 of the SIM, ""The Specified Number of A Warrant Receipts giving the right to Eligible Holders to subscribe for one DR during the Exercise Period will be equal to the Specified Number as defined in the IM and the terms of the A Warrants.""

The impact of the correction to the Specified Number is that Eligible Holders will require fewer A Warrant Receipts to be exercised to purchase one DR during the Exercise Period. The illustrative calculation in paragraph 6 of the SIM that provides an example of the potential financial calculation of the A Warrant Receipts has also been updated.


3. Supplementary information memorandum

Information on the loyalty scheme, the information memorandum (""IM"") for Richemont shareholders and the supplementary information memorandum (""SIM"") for DR Holders, was made available on the Company's website (https://www.richemont.com/media-cfr/company-announcements.html?view=article&id=806) on 7 August 2020, and was posted to DR Holders on 12 August 2020.

An updated version of the SIM containing the correct description of the Specified Number and the updated illustrative calculation will be available on the Company's website as at the date of this announcement and an Erratum will be distributed to DR Holders on or about 24 August 2020.

NOTICE OF MEETING

The Annual General Meeting ('AGM') of shareholders of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (the 'Company') will be held at 10.00 a.m. at the registered office of the Company, Chemin de la Chênaie 50, 1293 Bellevue, Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, 9 September 2020.

Agenda

1. Annual Report
The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting, having taken note of the reports of the auditor, approve the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the financial statements of the Company and the directors' report for the business year ended 31 March 2020.

2. Appropriation of profits
On 31 March 2020, the retained earnings available for distribution amounted to CHF 6 203 709 317. The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of CHF 1.00 be paid per Richemont share. This is equivalent to CHF 1.00 per 'A' registered share in the Company and CHF 0.10 per 'B' registered share in the Company. This represents a total dividend payable of CHF 574 200 000, subject to a waiver by Richemont Employee Benefits Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, of its entitlement to receive dividends on an estimated 9 million Richemont 'A' shares held in treasury. The Board of Directors proposes that the remaining available retained earnings of the Company at 31 March 2020, after payment of the dividend, be carried forward to the following business year.

3. Creation of a conditional share capital
The Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting to create a conditional capital having a maximum aggregate amount of CHF 24 200 000 and allowing the Company to issue not more than 22 000 000 'A' shares and not more than 22 000 000  'B' shares upon issuance of shareholder warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries, and to amend the articles of association of the Company to that effect as follows:

""5a. Conditional Share Capital

A' shares
The share capital of the Company shall be increased by a maximum aggregate amount of SFr 22 000 000 through the issuance of not more than 22 000 000 'A' shares of one Swiss franc (SFr 1.00) each, which shall be fully paid-in, upon the exercise of warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to holders of 'A' shares (the 'shareholder warrants A'). The transfer of the new 'A' shares to be issued upon exercise of shareholder warrants A shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Art. 6 I

'B' shares
The share capital of the Company shall further be increased by a maximum aggregate amount of SFr 2 200 000 through the issuance of not more than 22 000 000 'B' shares of one tenth of one Swiss franc (SFr 0.10) each, which shall be fully paid-in, upon the exercise of shareholder warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to holders of 'B' shares (the 'shareholder warrants B'). The transfer of the new 'B' shares to be issued upon the exercise of shareholder warrants B shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Art. 6 II.""

Common provisions
Preferential subscription rights of shareholders are excluded for what regards the issuance of 'A' shares and 'B' shares pursuant to this Art. 5a. The Board of Directors shall determine the terms of the shareholder warrants A and of the shareholder warrants B and of the issuance of the new 'A' shares and 'B' shares contemplated in this Art. 5a.

Information on the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the Company's articles of association can be found in the information memorandum (the 'Information Memorandum') dated 7 August 2020 established by the Company.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA | EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME


1. Introduction

Holders of Richemont Securities depositary receipts (""DRs"") (""DR Holders"") are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 15 May 2020 wherein Richemont Securities advised DR Holders that the board of directors of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland (""Richemont"" or ""CFR"") (the"" Board"") has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.0000 per Richemont A share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Richemont at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday, 9 September 2020 in Geneva (""CFR AGM""). As DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont A share, the gross dividend entitlement per DR is CHF 0.1000.

Following a review of practical, legal and fiscal considerations, Richemont is pleased to announce that it will issue tradable warrants to its shareholders. Richemont will issue A warrants to Richemont A shareholders (""A Warrants""), B warrants to Richemont B shareholders (""B Warrants"") collectively the ""Warrants"" and the Company will issue A warrant receipts to DR Holders (""A Warrant Receipts"").  Richemont shareholders and DR Holders will be able to either to trade the A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts or, subject to the terms and conditions of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts, acquire new Richemont A shares or DRs respectively in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. The exercise price of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts (""Exercise Price"") will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares and DRs respectively prior to the CFR AGM, thereby allowing those Richemont shareholders and DR Holders who hold the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares and DRs during the lifetime of the Warrants. DR Holders will receive two A Warrant Receipts for every DR held.

Under the deposit agreement entered into on 18 December 1992, most recently amended on 26 March 2014 (""Deposit Agreement""), Richemont will deposit A Warrants attributable to the DR Holders with Richemont Securities (""Depositary"") which will in turn issue back-to-back A Warrant Receipts to DR Holders, which will represent the underlying A Warrants issued by Richemont.

Commenting on the shareholder loyalty scheme, Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""We are currently facing an unprecedented global health crisis. Predicting the likely scope and timing of a recovery in demand remains difficult, if not impossible. A surge in Covid-19 cases has forced countries to reverse reopenings and to reimpose restrictions. Therefore, amid the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding broader economic conditions, the Board of Directors has decided that it is appropriate to retain an extra liquidity buffer with a reduced dividend level while awarding shareholders a supplementary benefit that will allow them to capture any ultimate improvement in global conditions. Due to the prevailing uncertainty, we have decided to set the maturity of the warrants at three years, to capture the potential future upside in the market price of Richemont shares, once all the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic will have hopefully been overcome.""


2. Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the Warrants, Richemont shareholders will be asked at the CFR AGM to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision in the articles of association authorising the issuance of a corresponding number of new Richemont A shares and Richemont B shares upon exercise of the Warrants.


3. Supplementary information memorandum

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association can be found in the information memorandum (""IM"") for Richemont A shareholders and supplementary information memorandum (""SIM"") for DR Holders, both of which will be published on the Company's website (https://www.richemont.com/media-cfr/company-announcements.html?view=article&id=806) on 7 August 2020, posted to DR Holders on 12 August 2020 and referenced in the invitation to the CFR AGM.

RICHEMONT
COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT
7 AUGUST 2020

RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME, CONDITIONAL SHARE CAPITAL INCREASE, BOARD NOMINATION AND AGM ARRANGEMENTS


Shareholder loyalty scheme

On 15 May 2020, Richemont announced that its Board of Directors would propose a dividend of CHF 1.00 per A share / CHF 0.10 per B share at the upcoming Annual General Meeting and that it was considering an equity-based shareholder loyalty scheme.

Following a review of the practical, legal and fiscal considerations, Richemont is pleased to announce that it will issue tradable warrants to shareholders, allowing them either to trade the warrant or, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrants, acquire new Richemont A shares in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. The exercise price will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares before the 2020 Annual General Meeting, thereby allowing those shareholders who hold the warrants until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares during the lifetime of the warrants.


Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the warrants, shareholders will be asked at the 2020 Annual General Meeting to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision  in the articles of association and to authorise the issuance of a corresponding number of new shares upon exercise of the warrants.

Commenting on the shareholder loyalty scheme, Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""We are currently facing an unprecedented global health crisis. Predicting the likely scope and timing of a recovery in demand remains difficult, if not impossible. A surge in Covid-19 cases has forced countries to reverse reopenings and to reimpose restrictions. Therefore, amid the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding broader economic conditions, the Board of Directors has decided that it is appropriate to retain an extra liquidity buffer with a reduced dividend level while awarding shareholders a supplementary benefit that will allow them to capture any ultimate improvement in global conditions. Due to the prevailing uncertainty, we have decided to set the maturity of the warrants at three years, to capture the potential future upside in the market price of Richemont shares, once all the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic will have hopefully been overcome.""

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association can be found in the information memorandum dated 7 August 2020 which will be published on the Company's website on 7 August 2020 and referenced in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting.


Board nomination

Richemont also announces the nomination of Wendy Luhabe for election to the Board of Directors. Her appointment is subject to the approval of shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. She will serve as a Non-Executive Director and become a member of the Board's Nominations Committee.

Wendy has extensive experience in luxury goods and a long relationship with Richemont, chairing Vendôme South Africa (Richemont's subsidiary in South Africa) from 2001 to 2011.

Ms Luhabe is a social entrepreneur and economic activist with multiple honours for her pioneering contribution to the economic empowerment of women in South Africa. She is the founding Chair of Women in Infrastructure Development and Energy (WINDE) which focuses on the economic empowerment of women. Ms Luhabe founded 'Bridging the Gap', an organisation which equips black graduates with corporate skills, as well as Women Private Equity Fund (WPEF), South Africa's first private venture capital fund for women. She is also a founding member of Women Investment Portfolio Holdings (WIPHOLD) which empowers women to become investors in the South African economy. 

Ms Luhabe has over 25 years of Board experience across diverse industries and companies, including Tiger Brands, Vodacom, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the International Marketing Council (IMC), Alliance Capital, and the IMD and ESSEC business schools. She is currently on the Boards of Pepkor, as a Non-Executive Director, and Libstar, which she chairs. 

Ms Luhabe has worked tirelessly to contribute to the development of women and to educate and mentor younger generations. She created the Wendy Luhabe Foundation and established a scholarship at the University of Johannesburg. She holds a degree in commerce from the University of Lesotho and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Fort Hare. 


2020 Annual General Meeting

Richemont also announces that the Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be held at 10.00 a.m. at its registered office on Wednesday, 9 September 2020. Given the continued uncertainties linked to Covid-19 and related health and safety concerns, the Board of Directors has decided it prudent, pursuant to Article 27 of the Ordinance 3 of the Swiss Federal Council 'on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19)' of 19 June 2020, to hold the meeting behind closed doors. 

Shareholders are invited to submit voting instructions through the Company's registrar, Computershare Schweiz AG, or by sending them directly to the independent representative of the shareholders, Etude Gampert & Demierre, Notaires. Detailed instructions on how to vote can be found in the notice of meeting posted on Richemont's website on 12 August 2020.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED 30 JUNE 2020


Financial highlights

• Strong impact from Covid-19, with sales for the quarter down by 47% at actual and constant exchange rates compared to the prior year period

• Double digit sales decline across all regions, distribution channels and business areas due to widespread temporary store and distribution centre closures, a halt in tourism and subdued consumer sentiment in many markets; at actual rates
  o Decreases were less pronounced in the Middle East and Africa and in Asia Pacific, the latter benefiting from 47% sales growth in China
  o Online retail sales showed stronger resilience than sales in other channels; excluding Online Distributors, online sales contributed 8% of Group sales compared to 2% in the prior year period
  o Jewellery Maisons and Online Distributors fared better than the other business areas 

• As of 30 June, all distribution centres and most stores have reopened with exceptions in the Americas and travel retail

• The Group's gross and net cash positions at 30 June 2020 amounted to EUR 7.9 billion and EUR 1.8 billion, respectively

Review of trading for the three-month period ended 30 June 2020 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

During the quarter under review, the Group's trading and operations were strongly impacted by Covid-19. Sales contracted significantly across all regions, channels and business areas, notwithstanding a 49% increase in China.

Performance reflected unprecedented levels of disruption and widespread temporary closures of internal, franchise or multi-brand retail partner stores, as well as the closure of Online Distributors' fulfilment centres. The pandemic affected regions to varying degrees, depending on the duration of closures, reliance on tourist spending and the 'feel good factor' of their domestic clientele. In Europe, sales were 59% lower than in the prior year period, with all markets impacted by public health protection measures, as well as subdued local demand and a lack of international tourism when stores gradually reopened during the quarter. Sales in Asia Pacific were the most resilient. The 29% sales decrease across the region reflected declines across all markets, with the exception of China, which delivered triple digit online sales growth and very strong domestic retail sales in the absence of overseas purchases from the Chinese clientele from the mainland. Sales in the Americas contracted by 61%, with business areas impacted significantly by the temporary store and distribution centre closures. In Japan, sales declined by 64% as stores were closed for most of the quarter under review. The year-on-year sales decline in the Middle East and Africa was contained to 38%, partly reflecting the recent internalisation of operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as advanced purchases in anticipation of the Kingdom's VAT increase on 1 July.

Retail and wholesale sales decreased by 43% and 65%, respectively, due to temporary store closures, severely reduced tourism and generally weak consumer sentiment. Retail sales were lower across geographies, with the exceptions of strong increases in China and the local South Korean market. Online retail sales decreased by 22%, largely due to the temporary closure of the Online Distributors' fulfilment centres, following strong double digit growth in the comparative prior year period. Of note, quarterly online retail sales exceeded wholesale sales in the period, reaching 25% of Group sales compared to 17% in the prior year period. Excluding Online Distributors, the contribution of online sales rose to 8% of Group sales from 2% in the prior year period, fuelled by strong demand across all business areas.

The 41% decrease in sales at the Jewellery Maisons reflected lower sales across all product lines and regions, with Asia Pacific recording a lower rate of decline than the business area average. In China, sales increased by 68% over the period. This was particularly driven by increased online and offline retail spend and the contribution of the recently opened Cartier flagship store on Tmall Luxury Pavilion. Sales at the Specialist Watchmakers decreased by 56% due to the aforementioned negative factors, accentuated by a strong reliance on multi-brand retail partners, a comparatively low exposure to China and low online retail penetration worldwide. During the quarter, the Specialist Watchmakers launched a number of online initiatives and participated in the Watch Show on the Cloud to introduce their creations to the Chinese market. Online Distributors recorded a 42% sales decline as a result of temporary distribution centre closures and a highly competitive pricing environment. The Group's other businesses posted a 59% sales reduction, with all Maisons impacted by temporary store and distribution centre closures.

""The significant interest from investors demonstrates recognition of our strong cash generation profile and unique business model around Maisons with centuries of heritage as well as digital native businesses. Whilst Richemont has a robust balance sheet and more than adequate cash resources, we view it prudent to secure additional liquidity to weather potentially tougher times ahead. This bond transaction will support the long term development of our Maisons and businesses.""

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA - DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('CFR DR')


The foreign dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. 

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register. 

The board of directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.0000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday 9 September 2020 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 0.6500 per share.  South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent Swiss withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. 

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

           Gross dividend        Withholding tax
           per CFR DR            at 35%               Net dividend
           in Swiss francs       in Swiss francs      in Swiss  francs
Total      0.1000                (0.0350)             0.0650

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to Rand as at 8 September 2020, for payment of the dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday 8 September 2020, being the finalisation date.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""          Tuesday,15 September 2020
 
Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from the

Review of trading in the three month period ended 31 December 2019 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

During the quarter under review, sales progressed by 4%, with growth in all regions except Japan. Sales in Europe grew by 9%, benefiting from favourable comparative numbers and strong sales in most markets. Sales in Asia Pacific increased by 2%, driven by strong double digit sales growth in China and Korea, which more than offset a severe sales contraction in Hong Kong SAR, China and contrasted performances in other Asian markets. Sales in the Americas rose by 5%, led by good performances in the US that compensated for declines in other markets. The 3% sales increase in the Middle East and Africa reflected a good performance of retail (both online and offline) and favourable comparative numbers in a soft economic environment. Sales in Japan decreased by 7%, impacted by lower tourist spending given a comparatively stronger Japanese yen and the October 2019 value added tax increase that benefited first half sales.

The retail channel posted a 5% increase in sales, notwithstanding the negative impact of temporary store closures in Hong Kong SAR, China during most of the period under review. Sales were particularly noteworthy in China. The online retail channel saw a mid-single digit sales progression, with strong demand in the US. Sales in the wholesale channel were broadly in line with the prior year period, reflecting good performance of franchise stores, notably in Korea, partly offset by the impact of ongoing cautious watch inventory management and distribution optimisation initiatives which have now reached completion. 

The 6% sales progression at Jewellery Maisons was broad-based, driven by jewellery and watches across collections. The performance of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati was particularly noteworthy given the negative impact of Hong Kong SAR, China. Sales grew in all regions except Japan. The Specialist Watchmakers registered modest sales growth, notwithstanding a challenging situation in Hong Kong SAR, China, with higher sales in directly operated boutiques and wholesale sales broadly in line with the prior year period. At the Online Distributors, an increasingly competitive pricing environment in online retail and disruption caused by storm damage to MR PORTER's Landriano warehouse facilities limited sales growth to 2%. The Group's other businesses recorded a 3% decline in sales, reflecting challenging trading conditions for our Fashion & Accessories Maisons with the exception of Peter Millar which continued to show strong momentum in the US. 

The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 2.4 billion (2018: EUR 2.3 billion).


Trading in the nine month period ended 31 December 2019

Sales over the nine month period to December increased by 8% at actual exchange rates and by 5% at constant exchange rates, broadly in line with the trend seen in the first six months of the financial year. They are presented in Appendix 1a. 

As a reminder, sales for the prior year period included eight months of sales for YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP and seven months of sales for Watchfinder & Co.


 
Corporate calendar
The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 15 May 2020, and its annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 9 September 2020 in Geneva.

In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2019 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the current three month period, the current nine month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.
