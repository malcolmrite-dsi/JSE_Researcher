                                       Speeches by Karen Wood, Chair and
                                       Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer


Karen Wood, Chair

I don’t need to tell any of you that 2020 has been a year like no other.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required all of us to adapt the way we work. While it has presented many challenges, it
has also given us opportunities to connect with people around the world, as today’s meeting has shown.

In response to the pandemic, Graham and his management team moved quickly to deploy South32’s crisis and
emergency protocols. The team was guided by three imperatives: keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe
and reliable operations and supporting the communities we work with.

Graham will speak more about our response to COVID-19 in his address but I do want to recognise the extraordinary
efforts from the entire South32 workforce. I want to pay particular tribute to the operational teams around the world
who have gone above and beyond, in accordance with our Purpose and our Values, to keep our people safe and help
support the communities where we operate.

The Board is deeply grateful to each and every member of the team.

Our people going home safe and well at the end of each day is at the core of everything we do. Sadly, we did not
meet that commitment when in May, Duncan Mankhedi Ngoato lost his life. Duncan was a diesel mechanic who
worked for Modi Mining, a contractor to South32 performing work at the Ifalethu operation which is part of the South
Africa Energy Coal business.

The Board has reviewed the findings of the investigation into Mr Ngoato’s death. Those findings highlighted the
causes and identified additional measures, which we are implementing, to do everything we can to ensure a similar
incident does not happen again. Again, Graham will talk about this in more detail.

This year we have changed our approach to disclosure of fatalities. Historically, it has been our practice to report
fatalities that occur where we have control over the work or the location where the work is being performed.

From this year we will also disclose any fatalities for contractor activities associated with our operations that take
place in locations where we do not have control.

No loss of life is acceptable and is felt – deeply - across South32.

In May we celebrated our fifth anniversary as a company. Over this time, we’ve taken a number of steps to optimise
our portfolio, unlock the full value of our business and identify and pursue new opportunities.

In the last year, we have progressed the divestment of South Africa Energy Coal, completed the review of our
manganese alloy smelters, announced an agreement for the sale of TEMCO in Australia and placed Metalloys in
South Africa into care and maintenance.

We advanced our development projects including the Hermosa project in Arizona and exercised an option with Trilogy
Metals to form the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects joint venture in the Ambler Mining District of Alaska.

These are just some of the milestones that mark our journey so far. Shortly, Graham will talk more about our evolving
portfolio.

Despite volatile prices and government actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 impacting some of our operations, we
delivered a strong operating performance.

We reported Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 1.2 billion US dollars and free
cash flow of 583 million US dollars.

At the end of the 2020 financial year, we had a net cash balance of 298 million US dollars.
                                                                                                                         2
We returned 424 million US dollars to shareholders during the reporting period. This included 323 million US dollars
returned to shareholders as part of our ongoing capital management program.

Of the capital returned, dividends in respect of the financial year totalled 3.2 US cents per share (or 4.7 cents in
Australian dollar terms), including a fully franked final dividend of one US cent per share.

Having expanded our capital management program to 1.43 billion US dollars in February 2020, the Board responded
quickly to preserve the strength of our balance sheet by suspending our on-market share buy-back in March.

Following another quarter of strong operating performance and the further strengthening of our financial position, we
have recently lifted our on-market share buy-back suspension. Our capital management program is 93 per cent
complete with 106 million US dollars remaining to be returned to shareholders, ahead of the program’s extension or
expiry on 3 September 2021.

These decisions were taken consistent with our capital management framework, which prioritises maintaining safe
and reliable operations and an investment grade credit rating.

Our intent is to distribute a minimum of 40% of Underlying earnings as ordinary dividends.

We encourage competition for excess capital – such as investment in the business, acquisitions, greenfield
exploration, share buy-backs, and special dividends.

Over the past five years, we have paid 1.9 billion US dollars in dividends.

The Board’s well-established practice of regularly visiting our operations and offices around the world was disrupted
by COVID-19 during the year. These visits are a very important part of our work and give us the opportunity to better
understand the challenges our people face wherever they are located. They also help inform us of the cultural
aspects of our company’s work that underpin the way we do business.

We did manage to complete visits to Hillside Aluminium in Richards Bay, South Africa, our office in Johannesburg,
and Illawarra Metallurgical Coal in New South Wales before COVID-19 intervened.

As you would expect, the Board moved to meet virtually from March with increased frequency. We continued to hear
from local leadership teams and held virtual sessions with the teams at GEMCO, on Groote Eylandt in the Northern
Territory, and at Hillside Aluminium and focused on their responses to COVID-19.

We are anxious to resume our direct engagement with our operational teams as soon as it is possible to do so.

Since the formation of South32, we have been committed to mitigating our impact on the environment.

In the 2020 financial year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 23.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. We are on track to
meet our FY21 target and keep those emissions at or below FY15 levels.

We recognise that if we are to meet our commitment for net zero emissions by 2050, then we need a plan to take us
there.

Work is now underway on our next set of emissions targets and that plan will be released as part of our FY21
reporting.

We are also targeting substantial reductions in our Scope 1 emissions at Worsley Alumina and Illawarra Metallurgical
Coal in Australia – the two assets that account for the bulk of our Scope 1 emissions - and are progressing our
decarbonisation studies for those operations.

We appreciate that our stakeholders want to better understand our rationale for joining industry associations.

There is also an interest in how we might address potential divergent positions on material topics like climate change.

In response - and for the first time - we have published Our Approach to Industry Associations, which outlines our
view on the important role of these groups.

We believe that the right industry associations can help us understand, learn and contribute to industry best practice
while also providing an avenue to engage in, and influence, matters affecting our industry.

When the company was formed in 2015, we defined our Purpose as making a difference by developing natural
resources to improve people’s lives now and for generations to come and being trusted by our owners and partners to
                                                                                                                       3
realise the potential of their resources. That Purpose is unchanged. To do this successfully we must have deep and
respectful relationships with local communities.

Across the world, we have supported our communities with investments of 24 and a half million US dollars focused on
four key areas aligned to community need.

These are: education and leadership, health and social wellbeing, economic participation and natural resource
resilience.

We recognise the traditional rights and values of Indigenous Peoples and respect their cultural heritage.

As a company, we understand the importance of engaging and working with our Traditional Owners and Indigenous
groups in relation to our activities. We work to obtain free prior and informed consent before we operate.

In Australia, we recently launched our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan, which raises the bar on our previous
commitments.

Under the Plan, we will further embed reconciliation activities in our core business practices and decision-making. It
also documents our support for the establishment of a First Nations Voice to be enshrined in the Australian
Constitution as outlined in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

In June, we began an internal review of our approach to cultural heritage management to determine where we may
need to strengthen or enhance our systems. We are involved in discussions to help review current systems across
Australia and ensure all voices are heard and considered.

Our multi-year partnership with the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation to support Indigenous students to
access schooling and complete Year 12 is just one of the ways we’re supporting the development of emerging and
future community leaders.

On the other side of the world, at our Cerro Matoso operation in Colombia, we reached agreement with 15 groups,
including seven Indigenous communities covering engagement, investment and environmental management.

These agreements provide a strong foundation to work in partnership to create healthier and stronger communities.

The work we’re doing is helping to empower Indigenous peoples and communities to make choices and have a say in
the decisions that affect them and this will have a lasting impact that spans future generations.

We know we can only be successful when our communities share in the benefits of what we do.

We also seek to enable economic participation through our commitments to build a diverse workforce that is
representative of the countries and communities where we operate.

I believe that businesses need to find the same passion and commitment for diversity as we do for safety. Outcomes
will be better if we truly reflect the society in which we operate.

We have set targets to increase the number of women who work for us, and in South Africa, to grow the
representation of Black People in our workforce.

Overall representation of women increased by one percent across our business to 19 percent – not yet enough, but
progress.

On our Board, women account for 37.5 percent and on our Lead Team 44 percent – both of which meet our targets.

In South Africa, representation of Black People in our workforce and management is 83 percent, up one percent from
a year earlier and heading towards our target of 85 percent.

Looking ahead, uncertainty is likely to persist in global markets for some time and we expect to face our share of
challenges as the world continues to respond to COVID-19.

We will remain resolute in our focus on preserving our strong balance sheet and on creating long-term value.

Graham and his team are positioning us for further growth and success.

Most importantly, we will all work to ensure everyone goes home safe and well at the end of every shift.



                                                                                                                     4
On behalf of the Board and all shareholders, I want to thank Graham, his lead team and everyone who is part of
South32 for their important and valued contributions.

I’d also like to thank shareholders for your continued support and for joining us today.

I’ll now hand you to Graham.

Graham Kerr, Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.

While the COVID-19 pandemic only emerged in the second half of the 2020 financial year, it’s impact on our business
was significant and it has heightened our focus on the things that matter most.

I’d like to start by talking to our safety performance, which is fundamental to our success as a business.

The death of Duncan Mankhedi Ngoato, who was fatally injured at our South Africa Energy Coal operation, is
unacceptable. I offer my sincere condolences to Duncan’s family, friends and colleagues for their tremendous loss
and we have provided support to those affected by his death.

A global stop for safety has given our teams the chance to talk about what happened and what we need to do to make
our sites safer.

We conducted a full investigation into the incident in conjunction with Duncan’s employer, Modi Mining. The learnings
from the investigation have been shared at all our sites, and with his employer to prevent a similar tragedy occurring
again.

While we saw a nine per cent year-on-year decrease in our Total Recordable Injury Frequency and increased
reporting of potential incidents and near misses this year, there is still more work to be done in this space.

We’re increasing capability to manage health and safety risk across the organisation, sharing learnings and
continuously improving the way we work.

Nothing is more important than our people going home safe and well.

I’d also like to take a moment to acknowledge Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi.

I first worked with Dr X, as he was fondly known to many of us, when we both sat on the Board of Richards Bay
Minerals. His passion for people, communities and South Africa impressed me greatly.

Over the years’ Dr X provided priceless advice and guidance.

Whenever he visited our operations and offices it was clear to see what an inspiration he was to our people.

Dr X leaves a considerable legacy and he is missed by everyone who knew him.

The COVID-19 pandemic took all of us by surprise this year.

As Karen said, our response has been focused around three areas - keeping our people safe and well; maintaining
safe and reliable operations; and supporting our communities.

Critical controls were introduced, such as screening and testing, additional cleaning and hygiene measures, and
physical distancing to help keep our people safe.

Importantly, we rolled out a range of wellbeing initiatives and support tools to help our people and their families,
including online resources and access to health and wellbeing experts.

To give our people space to focus on the work that matters most, we reviewed our priorities and stopped work that
was not business-critical.

Our communities have also been top of mind. We pledged 7 million US dollars to support our communities to respond
and recover from the health and economic impacts of COVID-19.

I’m proud of how our teams mobilised quickly to respond to this unprecedented event, while rising to the challenges of
working and living in new ways.

                                                                                                                       5
The pandemic has created substantial market uncertainty.

To keep our business resilient, we reduced our planned sustaining capital expenditure, pursued cost efficiencies
across the Group and suspended our on-market share buy-back, with the suspension lifted earlier this month.

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we delivered a strong operating result for the year.

Production records were set at Australian Manganese ore, Hillside Aluminium and Brazil Alumina.

Worsley Alumina delivered a further two per cent increase as the refinery progressed towards sustainable production
at nameplate capacity.

Nine of our 10 operations achieved lower operating costs.

Turning now to our portfolio.

During the year we advanced our strategy to exit lower returning businesses, which is expected to improve margins
and lift return on invested capital.

A key enabler to take our portfolio forward is the sale of South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources, which is subject
to the satisfaction of material conditions. It is on-track for completion in the December 2020 half year.

Following an extensive review, we achieved outcomes for both of our manganese alloy smelters.

In August we entered into a binding conditional agreement with GFG Alliance for the sale of TEMCO. It will continue to
operate into the future, which is a great outcome for our people and the local community.

Unfavourable conditions meant divestment was not an immediate option for Metalloys, which was placed on care and
maintenance. This preserves the option to pursue divestment in the future.

Our strategy of building a pipeline of development options by partnering in early stage greenfield exploration projects
saw us acquire a 50 per cent interest in the Ambler Metals joint venture after we exercised our option with Trilogy
Metals.

Investing in exploration is integral to our strategy and this was an important milestone as we reshape and improve our
portfolio by adding high-quality copper and base metal development options.

At our Hermosa project in Arizona, we advanced the pre-feasibility study for the Taylor Deposit, which is expected to
be completed in the June 2021 half year. We also published our initial Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark
Deposit.

A feasibility study for the Eagle Downs project is progressing, with a final investment decision expected by the end of
the calendar year.

It is my firm belief that when mining is done well and sustainably, it makes a positive difference in the world. We know
we can impact people’s lives for the better through our environmental and social performance and we take that
responsibility seriously.

To demonstrate our commitment to corporate sustainability we signed the United Nations Global Compact. We’re
implementing the Compact’s Ten Principles, which span human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

Further progress was made on our decarbonisation studies at Illawarra Metallurgical Coal and Worsley Alumina, the
sites where we want to achieve substantial reductions in Scope 1 emissions.

At our Hermosa project we completed the remediation of two million tonnes of tailings from a legacy mine to reduce
the risk of run-off contaminating local waterways.

Working together with our communities to create shared value is one of the most important ways we can help improve
the way people live and work.

We invested 24.5 million US dollars in community initiatives and activities including the 7 million US dollars we
contributed as part of our COVID-19 response. We also donated one million Australian dollars to bushfire relief efforts
in Australia.

In Colombia, we transferred more than 390 hectares of land to seven Indigenous Councils of the Zenú community and
the Black Community Council of Bocas de Uré for sustainable agriculture.
                                                                                                                   6
To make an impact in the areas that matter most, we developed a framework to measure our investments across
education, economic participation, health and social wellbeing, and natural resource resilience.

Wherever we operate, we engage the local Indigenous communities to make sure our site work programs are
sensitive to areas of cultural significance and the views of our traditional and local communities.

As Karen mentioned, we commenced a review of our approach to cultural heritage management towards the end of
the 2020 financial year which is ongoing.

This year we marked our fifth anniversary as South32. We’ve become a successful, stand-alone company that
delivers on its purpose and strategy.

We couldn’t have done this without the collective efforts of our people and I extend my thanks to all of our teams
around the world.

Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, improved
performance at several operations, and made solid progress on reshaping our business for the future.

Looking forward, we expect market uncertainty to continue for some time.

We’ll continue to progress our strategy, ensuring we preserve our balance sheet and deliver value for shareholders.

We also expect to deliver a further reduction in operating costs across the majority of our operations.

Most importantly, we’ll continue our unwavering focus on creating a safe workplace for all of our people.

Thank you for your ongoing support for South32. I’ll now hand back to our Chair.

Corporate Update
-   We continue to respond to COVID-19, adjusting to the different phases of the pandemic across the jurisdictions
    where we operate, focussing on keeping our people well, maintaining safe and reliable operations and supporting
    our communities.
-   We further simplified our functional support structures by reorganising the accountabilities of our leadership 
    team and will reduce its size to align to our planned portfolio changes. In support of this initial step towards 
    delivering a further US$50M in annualised savings from FY22, we have commenced the staged reduction of our office 
    footprint, including the downsizing of our offices in Singapore and London.
-   Net cash (note 1) increased by US$70M to US$368M, despite a build in working capital during the quarter. Subsequent
    to the end of the period, we paid a fully-franked ordinary dividend of US$48M in respect of the June 2020 half year.
-   We received net distributions (note 2) of US$21M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments 
    (EAI) in the September 2020 quarter following the payment of US$73M (100% share) in royalties at Australia Manganese 
    in respect of the prior 6 month period.
-   Following another quarter of strong operating performance and the further strengthening of our financial position 
    we have lifted our on-market share buy-back suspension. Our US$1.43B capital management program is 92% complete with 
    US$121M remaining to be returned to shareholders, ahead of its extension or expiry on 3 September 2021(note 3).
-   We continued to progress the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings 
    Proprietary Limited (Seriti Resources) (note 4) receiving final approval under Section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum 
    Resources Development Act in the period. Separately the Competition Commission of South Africa recommended the 
    Competition Tribunal conditionally approve the transaction with the Competition Tribunal hearings expected to be finalized
    in the December 2020 quarter. While the transaction remains subject to material conditions including approvals from Eskom
    Holdings SOC Limited (note 5) we expect to agree a resolution for the future of our South Africa Energy Coal business by 
    no later than 31 December 2020. 
-   GEMCO entered into a binding agreement to divest the TEMCO manganese alloy smelter, which is subject to approval from
    Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board. Our Metalloys manganese alloy smelter remains on care and maintenance.


Development and Exploration Update
-   We progressed our pre-feasibility study for the Hermosa project’s Taylor Deposit and scoping study for the Clark Deposit.
    Study work to date supports a potential unconstrained development of Taylor, including its integration with Clark. All options
    under consideration have different cost, permitting and schedule implications. To allow finalisation of this work, the Taylor
    pre-feasibility study is now expected to be concluded in the June 2021 half year at which time we will provide an update on our
    preferred configuration, expected capital profile and timeline to first production.
-   We remain on-track to consider a final investment decision with our joint venture partner for the Eagle Downs Metallurgical
    Coal project by the end of this calendar year.
-   At our Ambler Metals joint venture, permitting of the proposed industrial access road progressed, with the signing of the
    Record of Decision by the United States Bureau of Land Management and issuance of the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit
    by the United States Army Corp. of Engineers. The joint venture also appointed Ramzi Fawaz as its President and CEO during
    the quarter. Mr. Fawaz brings extensive leadership experience in North American project development to the role.
-   We completed a pre-feasibility study for the Eastern Leases at Australia Manganese during the period, progressing the project
    to feasibility stage. The Eastern Leases has the potential to extend the mine life at our low-cost GEMCO mine. Exploration
    drilling in the Southern Areas is expected to recommence in the December 2020 quarter.
-   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
    US$5M during the September 2020 quarter. Our greenfield exploration activity continues to be impacted by COVID-19
    restrictions on the movement of people and equipment, which has limited the ability to execute exploration work programs in
    certain jurisdictions. We continue to review the evolving environment and work with our partners to optimise our exploration
    programs to maximise the benefit of the US$18M we plan to spend in FY21.
-   We directed US$8M towards exploration programs at our existing operations and development options in the September 2020
    quarter (US$7M capitalised), including US$2M at Hermosa (all capitalised).

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production increased by 20% (or 1.0Mt) to 6.3Mt in the September 2020 
quarter as production ramped up following the disruption to operations caused by the nationwide COVID-19 
restrictions in the prior quarter. Export sales benefitted as additional volumes were delivered from new pits 
at the Klipspruit colliery, ahead of mechanical completion of the life extension project, which was achieved
subsequent to the end of the period.

Domestic sales increased by 20% during the September 2020 quarter, as improved 
demand from Eskom following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions was met by higher production volumes from our 
Khutala colliery and a drawdown in finished goods inventory.

As we continue to maximise margins and suspend production from loss-making pits, we now expect H1 FY21 saleable
production to be at the lower end of our 10.5 to 12.5Mt guidance range.

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 21% (or 419kt) to 2.4Mt in the September 2020 quarter 
with the operation’s successful return to a three longwall configuration in April 2020 supporting a 22% increase in 
metallurgical coal saleable production. Energy coal saleable production increased by 18% to a record 508kt in the period
as we monetized low-margin coal wash material.

FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 7.7Mt as we plan for lower volumes of energy coal sales over the remainder 
of the year and longwall moves are scheduled for the December 2020 and June 2021 quarters.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 3% (or 26kwmt) to 880kwmt in the September 2020 quarter
as favourable ore characteristics supported an improvement in primary concentrator output, more than offsetting 
lower volumes of our Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) fines product. PC02 fines contributed 9% of total production 
in the period. With its lower relative price realisations, PC02 contributed to an overall modest discount for our
 manganese ore sales to the high grade 44% index (note 10) during the September 2020 quarter.

While we continue to monitor market conditions and the potential impact from the wet season across the remainder of 
the year,FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,500kwmt.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 7% (or 2kt) to 27kt in the September 2020 quarter as one of the four 
furnaces at TEMCO remained offline.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production increased by 55% (or 207kwmt) to 581kwmt in the September 2020 quarter 
as the operation returned to full capacity, following the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in the prior quarter. 
We took advantage of favourable market conditions by utilising higher cost trucking as an alternate route to market
 while rail logistics continued to normalise. While we continue to monitor market conditions and the attractiveness 
of higher cost trucking, FY21 production guidance remains unchanged at 2,000kwmt.

We did not produce any manganese alloy in the September 2020 quarter as our Metalloys manganese alloy smelter remained 
on care and maintenance.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production decreased by 14% (or 12.6kt) to 76.6kt in the September 2020 quarter as planned
surface maintenance led to a 15% reduction in ore processed. Ore mined volumes declined by a lesser 4% during the period as
continued strong underground performance supported the establishment of run of mine inventory.

Processed silver, lead and zinc grades met our expectations during the September 2020 quarter and FY21 production guidance
remains unchanged (silver 11,800koz, lead 113.9kt and zinc 60.7kt).

  1.         Principal risks and uncertainties

  Risk management

  Our approach to risk management is governed by our risk management framework, which has been in place since the
  inception of our company in 2015. The minimum mandatory requirements for the management of risks that have a
  material impact on our purpose, strategy and business plans are defined in our material risk management standard.

  The framework and the standard are delivered through the System of Risk Management which is aligned to the
  principles of the International Standard for Risk Management AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018. This approach applies to all
  employees, Directors and contractors of the company and its subsidiaries. Our risks are regularly assessed and
  managed at both a company-wide strategic level and at a material tactical level for operations, functions and projects.

  Material risks

  Our System of Risk Management and assurance processes are based on the three lines of defence model and aim at
  managing our material risks. It enables us to:
  – Provide stable and consistent processes, tools and routines to identify and regularly assess the most impactful risks
  and opportunities;
  – Ensure predictable outcomes and prevent unforeseen events with material impacts;
  Registered Office Level 35 108 St Georges Terrace Perth WA 6000 Australia
  ABN 84 093 732 597 Registered in Australia                                                                        1
– Ensure risks are well understood and managed at all levels of the organisation; and
– Eliminate risks where appropriate or improve our processes using a risk based approach.
Risks assessed as material are routinely reported to the South32 Lead Team and reviewed by the Risk and Audit
Committee as well as the Sustainability Committee; assisting the Board to carry out its role in overseeing our risk
management and assurance practices. Our reliance on data that supports the management of our material risks has
been significantly improved, with the introduction of our new risk management tool, Global360.

This software connects data relating to the management of our risks, events, hazards and assurance actions,
providing transparency of real-time status of our risks and controls and improving our rate of decision-making and
responses. Aside from helping us manage our operations and functions, reliable data on material risks significantly
contributes towards the management of our strategic risks. This provides insight into trends and emerging themes that
can trigger a review of our business plans or inform a change in strategic direction.

Strategic risks

Our strategic risks and associated management response are evaluated every year. The review process is informed
by external and internal events that could have a potential impact on our organisation, as well as emerging themes
across our material risks. In FY20, we identified 13 strategic exposures that could influence our plans and the
sustainability of our business. With the interruption of COVID-19 we have focused our response on three key areas –
keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and supporting our communities, all of
which are critical to protecting the future of our business.

Ensuring that our people go home safe and well
Strategic Risk: A safe and healthy working environment is fundamental to living our values.

Opportunities: Ensuring that our people go home safe and well drives the culture we aspire to and meets societal
expectations, as well as our expectations of each other.

Threats: The impact of not having a safe working environment can be devastating for our employees, contractors and
communities. It can alter lives, impact shareholder returns, stakeholder confidence and ultimately our licence to
operate.

Our response:
    -   In everything we do, we focus on the health and safety of our people, contractors and communities;
    -   We have a system of risk management, comprehensive health and safety policies, systems and standards
        with associated performance requirements designed to prevent and mitigate potential exposure to health and
        safety risks;
    -   We engage, develop and train our people to ensure our work is well designed and executed;
    -   We investigate actual and potential significant events, put controls in place, and share our learnings across
        the organisation – so that everyone can benefit;
    -   We continuously improve our work environment to make it safer and more productive for our people; and
    -   We have an independent assurance function that reviews our risk register and the associated controls, to test
        how effective they are.


Actions by government, political risks and/or tax authorities
Strategic Risk: When changes in legislation, regulation and/or policy impact our strategic goals and the way we work,
we aim to effectively manage this uncertainty.

This includes uncertainty surrounding direct and indirect taxes, and royalties where we operate, as well as around
broader policy decisions and regulatory changes, relating but not limited to:
    - Nationalisation of mineral resources;
    -   Renegotiation or nullification of contracts;
    -   Leases, permits or agreements; and
    -   Environmental performance.

Opportunities: Proactive engagement leading to strong relationships with governments provides mutual understanding
of drivers for decision-making. This increases clarity around policy and regulatory environments, enables appropriate
and tailored responses to issues, and provides investment certainty.
                                                                                                                   2
Threats: Legislation adverse to our business and regulatory or policy decisions taken by governments can result in
operational disruption, affect future planning or in extreme cases lead to cessation of operations.

Our response:
    -  We have the specialised knowledge we need through employment or consulting, including tax management
       capability, tax advice, and external relations advice;
    -   We monitor political activity in all jurisdictions we operate in;
    -   We engage with our key stakeholders in all jurisdictions where we operate and identify them through active
        mapping and developing engagement plans;
    -   We work through selected industry associations to influence how the industry is positioned;
    -   We monitor policy, legislative and regulatory changes and we also engage with relevant authorities; and
    -   We produce an annual Tax Transparency and Payments to Governments Report, which shows how we meet
        our regulatory tax obligations.


Portfolio composition
Strategic Risk: Our objective is to outperform by offering our shareholders exposure to high-quality operations in
commodities with a strong and sustainable outlook, in jurisdictions where we believe we can operate into the future –
in line with our values.

Opportunities: We invest for value in our preferred commodities and jurisdictions. We do this by progressing our
internal development options, by acquiring exploration opportunities, development projects or existing operations and
by divesting non-preferred exposures that we believe will not generate an acceptable shareholder return.

Threats: If we don’t invest in a disciplined way or divest non-preferred exposures for value, we could reduce
shareholder returns. Climate change, and the transition to a low-carbon economy, may present both risks and
opportunities for our portfolio commodity composition. This is discussed under 'Climate change resilience' on page 30.

Our response:
   -   We keep our strategy front of mind as it informs the decisions we make about portfolio composition. We
       formally evaluate our strategic positioning annually with the Board and provide updates throughout the year;
    -   We have a dedicated greenfields exploration team focused on building a pipeline of low-cost, high-quality
        resource development options;
    -   We apply a rigorously developed and independently verified Commodity Price Protocol (CPP) process, to
        develop long-term views for our portfolio commodities and foreign exchange rates for the jurisdictions we
        operate in;
    -   We maintain a life of operations planning process. By evaluating the embedded options in our operations, we
        can progress with organic options at the right time;
    -   We follow strong due diligence processes for acquisitions and new business ventures;
    -   We apply a standardised valuation methodology with consistent key macroeconomic assumptions;
    -   We have a mature and independent peer review process, which we rigorously follow to inform key investment
        decisions; and
    -   We actively manage portfolio change with dedicated specialists to deliver integration and separation benefits.


Global economic uncertainty, volatility and liquidity
Strategic Risk: Our aim is to manage risks related to uncertain and changing macroeconomic conditions. We do the
same when it comes to the volatility in commodity, currency and debt capital markets, given how much they can
impact our earnings, balance sheet and growth goals.

Opportunities: We retain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating and capital discipline to enhance our
resilience through economic cycles. This approach also provides greater financial flexibility when market conditions
are favourable, which in turn allows us to create strong competition for capital. By investing selectively in our existing
operations and growth opportunities, or increasing returns to shareholders we aim to maximise total shareholder
returns over time.



                                                                                                                      3
Threats: A significant deterioration in economic conditions, market demand and falling commodity prices, and/or an
adverse movement in exchange rates has the potential to significantly reduce profitability, cash flow and total
shareholder returns.

Our response:
   - Our diverse portfolio strengthens our resilience to the disruption of any one commodity, geography or
       operation;
    -   We prioritise a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating, so that we remain in control
        through economic cycles;
    -   We test our financial strength across a range of scenarios, including a depressed demand and pricing
        environment. We also maintain a minimum liquidity buffer;
    -   We adjust our capital management plans according to market conditions;
    -   We maintain strong relationships with high-quality customers and suppliers from all around the world;
    -   We mostly sell our products with reference to floating, market-based prices, which are broadly inversely
        correlated with floating global currency markets and the input costs we’re exposed to; and
    -   We carry out an annual review of commodity prices, which we use to inform our operational plans.


Unexpected major events or natural catastrophes
Strategic Risk: Our operations and transport networks can be disrupted by events such as pandemics, unexpected
natural disasters or major process failures.

Opportunities: Delivering an outstanding performance in health, safety, environment and communities enhances our
operational and business resilience.

Threats: Failure to manage major unexpected events or natural catastrophes could result in a significant event or
other long-term damage that could harm the Group’s financial performance and/or licence to operate. The role of
climate change in increasing the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes is also addressed under 'Climate
change resilience’ on page 30.

Our response:
    -   When facing potential catastrophes, we put safety and wellbeing at the heart of everything we do;
    -   We use a strong system of risk management in design, construction and operation phases, to analyse risks
        and design plans that prevent or limit business impacts;
    -   We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place with trigger action response scenarios.
        We’ve tested these to make sure we can respond rapidly to major events and safely restore our operations
        and protect the health of people and the communities in which we operate;
    -   We have governance functions independent of the operations that provide assurance against our own
        comprehensive internal standards including equipment integrity, tailings dams management and technical
        stewardship;
    -   We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks (this
        may not fully cover all financial losses); and
    -   We work with external experts, relevant industry bodies and technology suppliers, to provide additional
        assurance and input.


Key talent identification, attraction and retention
Strategic Risk: Our ability to identify, attract and retain key talent and develop capabilities is fundamental to delivering
our strategic priorities.

Opportunities: Defined talent management processes can help lift performance and better enable us to deliver on our
strategy.

Threats: Failure to manage talent and develop the right capabilities within our business can ultimately erode
shareholder value.

Our response:


                                                                                                                       4
    -   We focus on enhancing our offering to employees and potential employees to distinguish ourselves in the
        market through effective approaches to talent and recruitment management, remuneration, skills development
        and succession planning;
    -   We continually seek ways to better engage and empower our workforce, including leading flexibility policies
        and a focus on ensuring we maintain an inclusive workplace;
    -   Our dedication to ‘making a difference’ inspires our people;
    -   We identify key talent and provide them with experience and growth through time in critical roles;
    -   Our strategic planning process identifies capability requirements for the future;
    -   We work to strengthen our reputation and status in the community as an employer of choice through
        community engagement programs; and
    -   We continue to improve our long-term workforce planning and talent management program across the
        organisation.


Evolving culture of the organisation
Strategic Risk: We recognise the value of a strong culture as a critical enabler to how we deliver our purpose and
strategy.

Opportunities: Proactively and deliberately shaping our culture will help us to deliver on our purpose and strategy
while being guided by our values.

Threats: A misaligned culture can result in organisational underperformance, and financial and reputational damage.

Our response:
   -   We are working to better understand the gap between what our culture is and what we want it to be – and to
       have a clear approach to help us close any gaps;
    -   We continue to develop an inclusive and diverse workplace where our people reflect the countries and
        communities in which we operate;
    -   Our Board monitors and assesses culture through Operation visits; staff engagements; endorsement and
        tracking of inclusion and diversity metrics, employee engagement results, and Speak Up data;
    -   We are making sure our ways of working (systems, symbols and behaviours) are aligned to our aspired
        culture; and
    -   We identify and deploy effective levers to deliberately shape our culture in an ever-evolving world.


Predictable operational performance
Strategic Risk: Predictable operational performance improves our ability to keep our people safe, meet our regulatory
and social obligations, reliably provide quality products to our customers and deliver shareholder returns.

Opportunities: We mature our operating system to control the operations and processes that deliver value. We spend
capital annually to sustain our production capacity to create value and we invest in high-return projects and improve
the reliability of our production capability.

Threats: If we can’t safely achieve our production targets and mitigate rising unit costs, it will impact directly on our
profits and cash flow, as well as our ability to meet our commitments to our stakeholders.

Our response:

    -   We carry out rigorous quality assurance programs over our operations, marketing and logistics;
    -   We review our asset health and integrity on a regular basis;
    -   We reconcile the performance of our Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve quality against production on an
        annual basis;
    -   We carry out rigorous modelling and reviews of our geotechnical drilling data;
    -   We operate within target inventory operating windows and regularly review our internal scheduling and
        operational planning;
    -   We monitor raw material supply contracts and implement early detection procedures at load ports;
    -   We utilise long-term and short-term planning, scheduling and verification processes;
                                                                                                                       5
    -   We carry out operational resource planning and regularly review our productivity metrics;
    -   We apply structured work design processes for critical or high value tasks; and
    -   We apply verification systems to ensure we’re compliant with work standards.




Maintain competitiveness through innovation and technology
Strategic Risk: Technology and innovation are advancing at a rapid pace. Companies who are unable to effectively
leverage technology and innovation will find themselves falling behind in shareholder returns.

Opportunities: To stay competitive, we will position our organisation to effectively identify, adopt and sustain
technology and innovation that delivers shareholder returns.

Threats: Failure to keep pace with and leverage, advances in technology could result in reduced shareholder returns.
Cyber security incidents could pose multiple risks including disruption to operations, theft, disclosure or corruption of
information.

Our response:
    -   We are continuously improving our approach to innovation, improvement and technology;
    -   We are delivering specific programs focused on adoption and improvement of critical technology capabilities
        across multiple time horizons including cyber security, data science, automation and mobility;
    -   We have a clear, value-based, ‘portfolio’ approach to testing and scaling up innovation across the group;
    -   We have rigorous internal standards and processes (technology ‘ways of working’);
    -   We benchmark our digital operations’ performance against industry best practice and have organised the
        coordination and integration of technology advances into South32’s growth portfolio;
    -   We actively manage cyber security and data centre risks through our system of risk management and have
        increased our cyber security controls in response to COVID-19 and an increase in remote working;
    -   We monitor customer satisfaction and manage customer support; and
    -   We follow a rigorous assurance process for our approach to innovation, improvement and technology.


Security of supply of logistics chain and critical services
Strategic Risk: Together with our customers and suppliers we manage the inbound and outbound supply chains.
Critical categories include raw materials, energy, water, gas, heavy mobile equipment, tyres and logistics (which
includes road, rail, air and shipping).

Opportunities: By securing commercially competitive terms, we capitalise on market opportunities while supporting the
safe and reliable performance of our operations.

Threats: Failure to secure commercially acceptable terms could disrupt our operations, increase operating costs and
damage our reputation. Pandemic has potential to disrupt in and out bound supply chains. Climate change has
potential to increase frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events which may threaten our supply chain,
logistics and critical services. This is addressed under 'Climate change resilience’ on page 30.

Our response:
    -  We have a business continuity plan that ensures we optimise existing supply chains and identify alternate
       sources for critical supplies;
    -   We build strong strategic partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers on a long-term, mutually beneficial basis;
    -   We have a clearly defined transformation strategy and enterprise and supplier development program in South
        Africa aimed at building and growing small and medium enterprises; and
    -   We actively review and manage payment terms to support small and local businesses in all jurisdictions.


Maintain, realise or enhance the value of our resources and reserves
Strategic Risk: We exist to realise the potential of the resources and reserves we are entrusted to develop.



                                                                                                                    6
We work to continually optimise our operations through sound technical and economic understanding of our resources
and reserves.

Opportunities: We continue to enhance our understanding of our resources and reserves. We leverage this enhanced
understanding through the annual business planning cycle to investigate additional opportunities to add value to our
business.

Threats: If we fail to continually optimise our operations and projects, it will have a significant impact on shareholder
returns and ultimately, the sustainability of the company.

Our response:

    -   We report Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (including Coal Resources and Coal Reserves) in
        accordance with the JORC Code as required in Chapter 5 of the ASX Listing Rules;
    -   We apply an annual business planning standard and process, structured to maximise value throughout the life
        of our operations;
    -   Our capital prioritisation, capital allocation and planning processes prioritise the highest-value options across
        our portfolio;
    -   We apply a rigorous project development process that includes independent peer review of project risks and
        approval tollgates; and
    -   Our closure standard ensures that our full-life-of-operations value incorporates closure and rehabilitation
        liabilities.


Climate change resilience
Strategic Risk: South32 has been actively addressing risks associated with climate change for several years. By using
climate change scenarios, we can identify opportunities and threats to our portfolio and operations.

We assess these risks through a framework that includes policy, market and physical factors.

Opportunities: We regularly assess our customer and broader stakeholder preferences, as well as developments in
policy and competitive technologies, to ensure our products remain in demand and resilient. Our pipeline of
development options and exploration programs include commodities with a favourable outlook in a low carbon future,
with a bias to base metals.

Threats: Failure to build the resilience of our business to the physical impacts of climate change, reduce our
emissions and respond to changes in policy and technology could negatively impact our supply chain, business
continuity and access to key inputs (such as water), our communities, costs, legal exposure, demand for our products,
stakeholder confidence and ultimately shareholder returns. Refer to related risks of ‘Security of supply of logistics
chain and critical services’, ‘Unexpected major events or natural catastrophes’ and ‘Portfolio composition’.

Our response:
    -  We seek to understand our portfolio performance in a range of future climate scenarios, considering both
       opportunities and threats;
    -   We identify potential controls in the short, medium and long-term to improve the climate change resilience of
        our portfolio;
    -   We support the Paris Agreement objectives and are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by
        2050;
    -   We identify and implement greenhouse gas reduction projects and energy planning, with our emissions
        reduction targets linked to remuneration;
    -   We use climate modelling data to inform us of the level of risk to our operational plans;
    -   We prioritise our land management efforts to improve resilience, including minimising land disturbance and
        maximising rehabilitation efforts; and
    -   We’re transparent in our disclosure of climate change-related opportunities and threats in our annual
        reporting, which is aligned to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
        Disclosures. Further details on this risk and its management is detailed in our Sustainable Development
        Report.


Evolving stakeholder expectations
                                                                                                                      7
Strategic Risk: There are evolving expectations of mining and metals companies by employees, government,
investors, lenders, host communities and broader society. Our stakeholders may have divergent views and wants.

We actively engage our stakeholders to understand and respond to their views and identify ways we can create
social, environmental and economic value.

Opportunities: We undertake proactive, collaborative and transparent engagement with our stakeholders, to build
relationships based on trust and shared understanding. Our ongoing licence to operate will be supported through
recognition of our contribution to our stakeholders and broader society.

Threats: Failure to achieve stakeholder support could damage our reputation and negatively impact our licence to
operate, limiting our ability to grow our business in existing and new jurisdictions, and impacting our ability to access
funding for new or existing operations.

Our response:
    -    Our purpose and strategy expressly balance economic outcomes with social and environmental outcomes,
         now and into the future. In the decisions we take, we look to minimise impact and create enduring social,
        environmental and economic value for all our stakeholders;
     -   We undertake internal and external stakeholder analysis and engagement on a wide range of financial,
         environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Our approach is aligned with the ICMM Mining Principles
         and Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards;
     -   We recognise that mineral resources are managed by governments on behalf of their citizens. We proactively
         engage with governments to keep public policymakers informed and we advocate for our positions. We
         monitor policy and political developments;
     -   We always aim to build strong, honest and meaningful relationships with local communities, so that we’re
         ready to listen to their concerns. We regularly complete and review community perception surveys, social
         baseline studies and impact and opportunity assessments;
     -   We have a rigorous process to understand the expectations of our shareholders on a wide range of issues
         informed by regular engagement; and
     -   We transparently report on our risks, opportunities, regulatory obligations, commitments and areas where
         we’re working that are relevant to our stakeholders.

Corporate Update
-    We continue to prudently manage our balance sheet, taking action to maintain the financial strength of our business. Following
     our decision to suspend our on-market share buy-back program on 27 March, we did not purchase any shares during the
     quarter. Our US$1.43B capital management program remains 92% complete with US$121M of our suspended on-market
     share
     buy-back program remaining, ahead of its extension or expiry on 4 September 2020 (note 1).
-    We received net distributions (note 2) of US$313M (South32 share) from our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI)
     in FY20, including US$153M in the June 2020 quarter.
-    Subsequent to the end of the period, we extended the expiry date of our undrawn revolving credit facility by one year to
     February 2023, providing the Group with ongoing access to a further US$1.45B in liquidity in addition to our strong balance
     sheet.
-    We realised US$50M in annual functional cost savings in FY20, following the simplification of the Group’s support 
     structures. In addition, to prepare for a potentially extended period of volatility and lower commodity prices, we 
     initiated a further review of activity during the June 2020 quarter aimed at delivering a meaningful reduction in 
     controllable costs. We expect to provide an update on this work with our FY20 financial results.
-    We progressed the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited
     (Seriti Resources), acquiring the 8% interest previously owned by our Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)
     consortium partner and receiving approval for the transaction from the Richards Bay Coal Terminal Proprietary Limited during
     the June 2020 quarter. Subject to a number of material conditions (note 3) being satisfied, the transaction remains on track 
     to be completed in the December 2020 half year.
-    After consideration of its future economic viability we made the decision with our joint venture partner to place our South
     African manganese alloy smelter, Metalloys, on temporary care and maintenance. We also progressed the review of our
     Australian manganese alloy smelter, TEMCO, albeit the process has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying its
     expected completion.
-    In consideration of the future economic viability and continuing review of our Metalloys and TEMCO smelters, we expect to
     book pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of approximately US$109M (post-tax ~US$90M, South32 share) in our
     FY20 financial results. One-off, pre-tax restructuring costs, including redundancies, at Metalloys of approximately US$7M
     (post tax ~US$5M, South32 share) are also anticipated. These charges will be recorded in the Group’s share of profit of 
      EAI and excluded from Underlying earnings in FY20.
-    Our geographical earnings mix will have a significant bearing on our effective tax rate (ETR) given differing country tax 
     rates(note 4), while the impact of intragroup agreements, exploration expenditure in foreign entities and other permanent
     differences will continue to be magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. Until 
     it is sold, South Africa Energy Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0%, with all tax assets de-recognised from 30 June 2019 and no
     benefit to be recorded for losses made prior to sale. Accordingly, our FY20 Group ETR is expected to be in a range between
     100% and 125% (excluding EAI).




Development and Exploration Update
Hermosa project
- We continue to review the impact of COVID-19 in Arizona and its influence on timelines for work being undertaken at
  Hermosa. Our exploration programs remain temporarily suspended and we now expect to complete the pre-feasibility study for
  the Taylor Deposit in the December 2020 quarter.
- Notwithstanding the above delay, we have updated the Mineral Resource estimate for the Taylor Deposit (note 5) with new
  information and geological modelling undertaken from additional resource definition drilling completed in support of the current
  pre-feasibility study. The Mineral Resource estimate (Table A) has increased by 12Mt to 167Mt, averaging 3.34% zinc, 3.84%
  lead and 71g/t silver. The deposit remains open at depth and laterally.
- We also reported a Mineral Resource estimate for the first time for the Clark Deposit. The Mineral Resource estimate was
  reported at 55Mt, averaging 2.31% zinc, 9.08% manganese and 78g/t silver (note 6). A scoping study to advance our
  understanding of the processing and new emerging end-market opportunities in battery technology for the Clark Deposit is
  underway.
- We directed US$19M (all capitalised) during FY20 to exploration programs at identified regional prospects and to advance our
  resource definition work. During the period we advanced our understanding of the broader land package potential, enabling an
  improved focus for future drilling programs beyond the known Mineral Resource estimates of the Taylor and Clark Deposits.

Other development and exploration options
- We completed the remaining coal quality drilling at Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal, with the interpretation of those results to
  support our on-going feasibility study work. We remain on-track to make a final investment decision by the end of this calendar
  year.
- Together with our joint venture partner, we made the decision to postpone our CY20 exploration program at
  Ambler Metals due to COVID-19 restrictions in Alaska and their impact on our ability to conduct the field season. The delay in
  this year’s program is not currently expected to impact delivery of the Arctic pre-feasibility study that was commenced by the
  joint venture partners in the March 2020 quarter.
- Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
  US$15M during FY20. Greenfield exploration activity continues to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of
  people and equipment which has limited the ability for some of our partners to access exploration areas in certain jurisdictions.
  We continue to review the evolving environment and work with our partners to plan our exploration programs for FY21.
- We directed US$49M towards exploration programs at our existing operations and development options in FY20 (US$34M
  capitalised), including US$3M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and US$19M at Hermosa as noted above (all capitalised).

COVID-19 Response
At South32 our focus is on keeping our people well, maintaining safe and reliable operations and supporting our communities
through the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the situation closely, deferring non-critical activity and ensuring our
operations run safely, adjusting to the changes we have put in place.

With the pandemic impacting our business differently, depending on our locations around the world as the pandemic spreads, we
have activated emergency management teams to identify, prevent and respond to risks as they arise. We have also implemented
site specific protocols including screening and testing programs for our workforce and made isolation facilities available at 
all of our operations. We have implemented additional cleaning and hygiene measures, awareness programs for our workforce, adjustments
to work routines to enable appropriate social distancing and the provision of transport to site which is regularly sanitised. We are
providing our workforce with the appropriate personal protective equipment and have implemented additional protective measures
at all of our sites and offices. At all of our locations we are following the local requirements and advice from health authorities 
and governments for operating during the pandemic.

We have established a South32 Global Community Investment Fund, committing US$7M to the areas that need it most. To date,
our support has included provision of water, essential hygiene and medical supplies, public health awareness and education
campaigns, building capacity in local health care systems and supporting those who are unable to access critical goods and
services.

-   Realised prices exclude third party products and services. We currently anticipate an underlying EBIT loss for third party
    products and services(note 16) of approximately US$17M in FY20 (FY19: US$5M). This predominantly reflects the
    procurement of lower cost third party volumes to replace higher cost equity production to fulfil contractual commitments at

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 2% (or 91kt) to 3,886kt in FY20, as the refinery finished the year on a strong
note with an increase in calciner availability underpinning a 9% increase in production during the June 2020 quarter. The refinery
continues to benefit from improvement initiatives that are expected to support a sustainable increase in production to nameplate
capacity of 4.6Mt (100% basis). Sales increased by 20% during the June 2020 quarter as a result of higher production and a
slipped shipment from the prior quarter.

We realised a modest premium to the Platts Alumina Index(note 17) (PAX) on a volume weighted M-1 basis for alumina sales in
FY20, with price realisations in the June 2020 half year falling in-line with the market as a result of specific legacy supply 
contracts with our Mozal Aluminium smelter. Contracts with the smelter are linked to the LME aluminium price and alumina indices on an M-1
basis, with caps and floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. All other alumina sales were at
market based prices.

the strong operating performance, lower alumina prices and an increase in the use of higher cost third party bauxite is expected to
impactthe profitability of the operation in FY20. Our use of third party bauxite is expected to reduce in FY21, which together with a
reset in the cost of supply from Mineração Rio do Norte S.A (MRN), in accordance with its linkage to alumina and aluminium, is
expected to result in lower Operating unit costs for the refinery.

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 3kt to a record 718kt in FY20 as the smelter continued to test its maximum
technical capacity, despite the impact to production from increased load-shedding.

The smelter sources alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with prices linked to the PAX on an M-1 basis, while its power is
sourced from Eskom under separate contracts for its three potlines. We have been engaging with Eskom on a new pricing
arrangement that would cover power supplied to the smelter, agreeing an interim arrangement ahead of a new 10 year pricing
agreement being considered for approval by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). The interim arrangement and
the new long term agreement are important milestones to secure the future of the smelter beyond CY20, with the tariff being
South African Rand based with a rate of escalation linked to the South Africa Producer Price Index (PPI).

Mozal Aluminium saleable production increased by 1kt to 268kt in FY20 as the smelter continued to test its maximum technical
capacity, despite the impact to production from increased load-shedding. In order to further improve the smelter’s cost
competitiveness we continue to execute the AP3XLE energy efficiency project during FY20. The project is expected to deliver a
circa 5% (or 10kt pa) increase in annual production by FY24 with no associated increase in power consumption.

South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 9% (or 2.3Mt) to 22.7Mt in FY20 as contractors were demobilised in
the December 2019 half year to maximise margins, before COVID-19 restrictions impacted operations during the June 2020
quarter.

Export sales declined by 19% during the June 2020 quarter as a result of lower production volumes and the diversion of coal to
domestic customers, as export shipments were affected by COVID-19 lockdown impacts to our logistics chain and end market
demand. While production has now ramped-up following the easing of lockdown restrictions, we continue to respond to the evolving
environment and its potential to impact our operations and logistics chain in the future.

Notwithstanding production being at the top end of our revised guidance range, the recognition of one-off costs in the June 2020
half year are expected to result in FY20 Operating unit costs of approximately US$42/t (H1 FY20: US$43/t).

Illawarra Metallurgical Coal saleable production increased by 5% (or 359kt) to 7.0Mt in FY20 as the Dendrobium and Appin
longwalls continued to perform strongly across the year, with Dendrobium achieving record run of mine performance.
Notwithstanding challenging strata conditions, the operation’s return to a three longwall configuration in late April and the
completion of a longwall move at Dendrobium during the prior quarter underpinned a 44% increase in saleable production in the
June 2020 quarter.

While the return to a three longwall configuration marked an important milestone for the Appin restart plan, the continued strong
performance from a two longwall configuration supports our current study work to maximise long term value at the operation. We
expect to provide an update on the outcome of the review with our FY20 financial results.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production increased by 4% (or 121kwmt) to a record 3,470kwmt in FY20, with the operation
returning to full production following the removal of temporary roster changes in response to COVID-19 restrictions during the
June 2020 quarter. Manganese ore sales increased by 20% during the June 2020 quarter as we took advantage of favourable
market conditions and a shipment slipped from the prior quarter.

Our average realised price for external sales of Australian ore was a 7% discount to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore
index(note 19) in FY20 as we responded to market demand with increased volumes of Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) and other
secondary products. Our low cost PC02 circuit continued to operate above its design capacity, contributing 12% of total 
production in FY20 (FY19: 10%). Our PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both 
grade and product-type discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index. Manganese alloy saleable
production decreased by 29% (or 44kt) to 110kt in FY20 as one of the four furnaces at TEMCO remained offline.

South Africa Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 14% (or 309kwmt) to 1,878kwmt in FY20 as we responded to
weaker market conditions in the December 2019 half year, reducing our use of higher cost trucking and undertaking an extended
maintenance shut at our underground Wessels mine. Further, both the open pit Mamatwan and underground Wessels mines were
placed on temporary care and maintenance during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in the June 2020 quarter, subsequently
returning to full capacity with lockdown restrictions lifted.

Sales decreased 34% during the June 2020 quarter as volumes were also impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions to our shared
logistics infrastructure. Notwithstanding the lifting of restrictions, we continue to respond to the evolving environment and its
potential to further impact our operations and logistics chain.

Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 23% (or 16kt) to 53kt in FY20. After consideration of the future economic
viability of Metalloys, we made the decision with our joint venture partner to place the smelter on temporary care and maintenance.

Cerro Matoso payable nickel production decreased by 1% (or 0.5kt) to 40.6kt in FY20 as the operation achieved a higher rate of
plant utilisation and throughput, partially offsetting planned lower ore feed grades.

While our rate of production has been unaffected by the Colombian national lockdown in response to COVID-19, we continue to
monitor the impact of restrictions on the movement of people and equipment, which has resulted in the deferral of our planned
major furnace refurbishment. As previously reported, this work has been rescheduled to the December 2020 half year (previously
the June 2020 quarter) and consequently FY21 production guidance is now expected to be 33.5kt (previously 37.4kt).
Sales declined 2% during the June 2020 quarter. Our ferronickel product sells with reference to the LME Nickel index price on a
M or M+1 basis and attracts product discounts that have widened in the current market.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 9% (or 19.8kt) to 238.0kt in FY20 as planned higher zinc grades more
than offset lower silver and lead grades, and the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level following the
Queensland flood event in FY19. The draw down and further improvement in underground mine performance supported the
realisation of efficiencies in mill throughput, resulting in a 14% lift in ore processed during FY20.

Notes:

1.    As at 30 June 2020, US$1.0B has been allocated to the on-market share buy-back (477M shares at an average price of A$2.94 per
      share) and US$292M returned in the form of special dividends.
2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and should
      not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
3.    Refer to the market announcement “Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal” dated 6 November 2019.
4.    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group for FY20 include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, Colombia 33%,
      Mozambique 0% and Brazil 34%. The Colombian corporate tax rate is 32% in CY20 and will decrease on an annual basis by a 
      percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject to a royalty on revenues 
      instead of income tax.

5.    The information in this report that relates to Mineral Resources for the Taylor Deposit is presented on a 100% basis, represents 
      an estimate as at 31 May 2020, and is based on information compiled by Matthew Readford. Mr. Readford is a full-time employee of
      South32 and is a member and Chartered Professional of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr. Readford has 
      sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration, and to the activities 
      being undertaken, to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of
      Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves'. The Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this report of 
      the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.
6.    The information that relates to the Mineral Resources of the Clark Deposit was declared in the market announcement “Hermosa 
      Project – Mineral Resource Estimate Declaration” dated 12 May 2020 (www.south32.net) based on information compiled by Matthew 
      Hastings, Competent Person. South32 confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the 
      information included in the original announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates
      in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. South32 confirms that the form and 
      context in which the Competent Person’s findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market 
      announcement.
7.    Production guidance for Hillside Aluminium and Mozal Aluminium did not assume any load-shedding impact on production.
8.    During the current period South32 acquired the 8% interest in South Africa Energy Coal previously owned by a Broad-Based 
      Black Economic Empowerment(B-BBEE) consortium. This transaction was undertaken ahead of the proposed sale of South Africa 
      Energy Coal to Seriti Resources, subject to a number of material conditions being satisfied.
9.    Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales have 
      been reported at 60%. The Group’s financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa 
      Manganese ore.
10.   Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing 
      the total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver
      (US$14.4/oz) have been used for FY19, FY20 and FY20e.
11.   Realised prices are unaudited. Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken 
      independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume 
      unless otherwise stated.
12.   Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, 
      divided by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an 
      intracompany transaction.
13.   Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, 
      divided by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an 
      intracompany transaction. Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
14.   Realised nickel sales prices are unaudited and inclusive of by-products.
15.   Realised prices for Cannington are unaudited and net of treatment and refining charges.
16.   Underlying EBIT on third party products and services is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication
      of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
17.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Platts Alumina Index (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one 
      month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”) was US$283/t in FY20.
18.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
      Metallurgical Coal production.
19.   The quarterly sales volume weighted average of the Metal Bulletin 44% manganese lump ore index 
      (CIF Tianjin, China) on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month minus one or “M-1”)
      was US$5.04/dmtu in FY20.

                       Hermosa Project – Mineral Resource Estimate Declaration

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) is pleased to report for the first time
a Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark Deposit which forms part of its 100% owned Hermosa
project located in Arizona, USA (Appendix 1 – Figure 1). The Clark Mineral Resource estimate (Table
                                                         1
A) is reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012) at 55 million tonnes, averaging 2.31% zinc
(Zn), 9.08% manganese (Mn) and 78g/t silver (Ag).

The Clark Deposit is interpreted as the upper oxidised, manganese-rich portion of the mineralised
system that contains the previously reported Taylor Mineral Resource estimate. A scoping study to
advance our understanding of the processing and end-market opportunities for the Clark Deposit is
underway, while a pre-feasibility study for the separate development of the Taylor Deposit is due for
completion in the September quarter 2020.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said “The declaration of a Mineral Resource estimate
for the Clark Deposit marks another important milestone for the Hermosa project, following our initial
Mineral Resource estimate for the Taylor Deposit in June 2019.

“When completed, the Taylor Deposit pre-feasibility study is expected to further de-risk our investment
by demonstrating its ability to deliver strong shareholder returns over many decades. The Clark
Deposit provides an additional option to realise longer term value from within the broader land
package.

“With ongoing exploration programs testing possible extensions to the Taylor Deposit and newly
identified prospects in the regional land package, we expect this work to reaffirm our view that
Hermosa is one of the most exciting base metals projects in the industry.”

The Hermosa project is a polymetallic development option located in Santa Cruz county, Arizona and
is 100% owned by South32. It comprises the zinc-lead-silver Taylor Deposit, the zinc-manganese-
silver Clark Deposit and an extensive, highly prospective land package with potential for discovery of
zinc and copper mineralisation.

Notes:
1. Cut-off grade: NSR of US$175/t.
2. Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based on South32’s long term forecasts for zinc, manganese and silver pricing; haulage,
   treatment, shipping, handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions are consistent across geological domains and
   are approximately 62% for zinc, 80% for manganese and 81% for silver. All masses are reported as dry metric tonnes (dmt). All tonnes
   and grade information have been rounded to reflect relative uncertainty of the estimate, hence small differences may be present in the
   totals.



Estimate of Mineral Resource for the Clark Deposit

South32 confirms the first time reporting of the Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark Deposit as at
12 May 2020 (Table A).
The estimates of Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 (JORC Code) and the
Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules. This report summarises the information contained in the
JORC Code Table 1 which is included in Appendix 1 to this report. The breakdown of the total Mineral
Resource estimate into the categories specified in the JORC Code is contained in Table A.

Geology and geological interpretation

The Clark Deposit within the Hermosa project (Appendix 1 – Figure 2) is the oxidised portion of a
carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) style, massive sulphide deposit. It is hosted in Mesozoic
Hardshell volcanic rocks and underlying Permian carbonate rocks of the Pennsylvanian Naco Group
of south-eastern Arizona (Appendix 1 - Figure 3).

The zinc-manganese-silver oxide mineralisation of the Clark Deposit is interpreted to be an up-dip
extension of the zinc-lead-silver sulphide Taylor Deposit, although of different mineralogy and
geochemistry. Mineralisation primarily spans the contact between the Hardshell volcanic rocks and
the underlying Concha carbonate stratigraphy for approximately 1.3km from near surface down a
general northwest dip of 30° to where it abuts the Taylor sulphide mineralisation. The 800m lateral
extent of mineralisation at the Clark Deposit has not been closed off by drilling.

Drilling techniques

Initial drilling of the Clark Deposit conducted by ASARCO between 1950-1991 utilised three different
drilling methods of rotary air hammer (RH) (91 holes), diamond core (DDH) (22 holes), and reverse
circulation (RC) (one hole). Wildcat Silver, later becoming Arizona Minerals Inc (AMI), drilled 165 RC
and 267 DDH drill holes between 2007 to 2018. South32 drilling continued to extend the drill footprint
at both the Clark and Taylor deposits following the acquisition of AMI in August 2018, adding an
additional 31 DDH drill holes to the total drill hole database considered for this Mineral Resource
estimation.

Four AMI and three South32 DDH drill holes twinned ASARCO RH drilling to validate geology and
assay data.

The geological model is based on data from 579 drill holes of various styles including RH, RC, and
DDH of HQ (95.6mm) or NQ (75.3mm) diameter (Appendix 1 - Figure 4), all drilled from surface of
which 311 intersect the mineralisation at the Clark Deposit and were utilised in the Mineral Resource
estimation (Appendix 1 - Figure 5).

Sub-vertical drilling was undertaken until August 2018 and 259 of these holes were utilised in the
estimation. Since August 2018 all holes were angled between 60°and 85° to maximise the
mineralisation intersection angle. Core orientation was introduced from October 2018 to incorporate
structural measurements into geological modelling for stratigraphic and fault interpretation.
Sampling and sub-sampling techniques

Details of the sampling procedures are unknown for the ASARCO drilling campaigns of 1950-1991,
however sample lengths were predominantly 1.5m (5’), ranging between 6cm and 6m. AMI drill holes
were sampled at nominal 1.5m (5’) intervals or terminated at litho-structural boundaries for DDH,
producing a sample range between 15cm and 2m. Diamond drill core was sampled by hydraulic
splitting until 2013, from then onwards a core saw was used for sampling. RC holes were drilled wet
by AMI, with cleaning of the holes between 5’ sample intervals.

AMI and South32 samples were submitted for preparation at external certified laboratories in Tucson
(Skyline Laboratories and Australian Laboratory Services (ALS)) and Reno (Inspectorate
Laboratories). Preparation involved crushing of the sample, a rotary split portion for each sample, and
pulverisation to generate pulps for assay. Specific preparation methods vary between laboratories
and drilling campaigns. Since 2014, samples have been prepared by ALS Minerals Tucson and
involve drying, crushing the entire sample to more than 70% passing 2mm, rotary splitting to achieve
a 250g subsample and pulverizing to greater than 85% passing 75µm.

Sample analysis method

AMI re-analysed 4,272 ASARCO pulp samples at Skyline Laboratories in 2006 to validate the copper,
lead, zinc, and manganese assay results using inductively-coupled plasma and atomic absorption
spectrometry (ICP-AAS). Silver and gold fire assays of a second split from each pulp were undertaken
by Assayers Canada in Vancouver.

AMI drill samples taken between 2007-2012 were prepared at Skyline Labs and analysed by ICP for
copper, lead, zinc, and manganese. Silver assays of 250g duplicate pulps for all samples were sent to
Assayers Canada from 2006-2009 (fire assays) and Inspectorate Laboratories in Reno for 2010-2012
(fire assay with AAS finish).

Over 2013-2014, AMI identified a low bias for silver reported by fire assay through a quality control
program using in-house standards. A re-assay of 8,078 samples from 188 holes mostly from the Clark
Deposit was undertaken by ALS Minerals using a four-acid digest and ICP-AAS. These replaced the
original fire assay silver results in the database.

Since 2014, all samples have been prepared by ALS Tucson and analysed at ALS Vancouver using
four-acid digestion, ICP-AAS, and more recently inductively-coupled plasma and optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES). Quality control protocols introduced and maintained since this time comprise
certified reference material (CRM) inserted every 20 samples, field duplicates every 15m (50’), blank
material submitted at the start and end of every sample batch, coarse crush and pulp repeats every
40 samples, and third-party laboratory pulp repeats every 50 samples.

Efforts to validate ASARCO sampling over the project history comprise two campaigns of pulp re-
assay by AMI in 2006 (4,272 samples) and South32 in 2019 (3,070 samples). The findings for the
2019 re-assay program generally indicate excellent reproducibility in ICP results for zinc, manganese
and silver across grade ranges material to the Mineral Resource work. Gravimetric fire assay results
for silver at lower grades (less than 10g/t Ag) generally perform poorly against the modern ICP
results. The poor performance of these historical analytical techniques against modern results has
been well-documented in previous studies.

Minor element assays from the South32 re-assay program were also inserted into the drilling
database for historical samples where no previous analysis had been undertaken and to underpin the
estimation of these elements.
Estimation methodology

Resource estimation was conducted using ordinary kriging interpolation for three elements of
economic interest (zinc, manganese, silver) and seven elements for metallurgical or rock
characterisation (iron, lead, calcium, sulphur, magnesium, potassium, aluminium). Estimation search
criteria, nested as two passes, are consistent with geostatistical models developed for each
estimation domain according to the appropriate geological controls.

Sample selection criteria, block dimensions, and other parameters of the estimation were reviewed
against results of qualitative kriging neighbourhood analysis (QKNA). Validation includes statistical
analysis, swath plots and visual inspection.

Specific gravity measurements from drill cores were used as the basis for estimating dry bulk density
in tonnage calculations for both mineralised and non-mineralised material. Initial testing and
comparison of pre- and post-drying sample weights from a small 280 sample population within two
drill holes indicated a moisture content of 2.03%.

Mineral Resource classification

Mineral Resource classification criteria are based on the level of data informing both the geological
model and grade estimation. Grade estimation confidence is overlaid on the geological modelling
classification criteria whereby estimation parameters such as slope of regression are matched to
block estimation criteria that relates to the number and distance of data informing the estimate in
relation to semi-variogram models for each element. No Measured Mineral Resources have been
defined for the Clark Deposit due to uncertainty associated with historical drill hole data, local
variability illustrated by the South32 twin drilling program and considering the conceptual level of
process flow sheet development. Indicated Mineral Resources are estimated from at least five
samples in two drill holes with data spacing within approximately 100m and are not defined in the SE
areas of the Clark Deposit which is supported primarily by RC drilling. Inferred Mineral Resources are
constrained by the reporting of estimates to within demonstrated grade and geological continuity
ranges, and generally to the extents of the confined Mineral Resource domains.

Mining and metallurgical methods and parameters

Reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction have been determined through assessment
of mining, processing and financial aspects at a scoping level study on the Clark Mineral Resource
estimate. The assessment outcome informs the net smelter return (NSR) cut-off value used for
reporting the Mineral Resource estimate.

Cut-off grade

The Clark Deposit of the Hermosa project is a zinc-manganese-silver deposit which uses an
equivalent NSR value as a grade descriptor. Input parameters for the NSR calculation are based on
South32’s long term forecasts for zinc, manganese and silver pricing; haulage, treatment, shipping,
handling and refining charges. Metallurgical recovery assumptions are consistent across domains and
are approximately 62% for zinc, 80% for manganese, and 81% for silver.

A dollar equivalent cut-off of NSR US$175/dmt forms the basis of assessment for reasonable
prospects for eventual economic extraction, supported by inputs detailed to scoping study level.

Corporate Update
-   Net cash(Note 1) decreased by US$127M to US$150M during the March 2020 quarter with our interim and special fully
    franked dividend payments (US$107M) funded during the quarter, ahead of distribution to shareholders on 2 April. Our balance
    sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents of US$1.2B, no term debt and an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit
    facility.
-   Our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) did not make net distributions(Note 2) to the Group in the March 2020
    quarter and we have seen additional cash build in our joint venture, despite paying royalties of US$76M (100% share) in
    respect of the prior six month period. Excess cash in the joint venture is expected to be distributed to partners in the June 2020
    quarter.
-   On 27 March, consistent with the prudent management of our strong balance sheet, we suspended our on-market share
    buy-back program. Following the allocation of a further US$77M to share purchases in the March 2020 quarter (53M shares at
    an average price of A$2.21 per share) and payment of a US$53M fully franked special dividend on 2 April, our US$1.43B
    capital management program was 92% complete with US$121M  of our now suspended on-market share buy-back program remaining 
    ahead of its extension or expiry on 4 September 2020(Note 3).
-   On 11 February, we formed a 50:50 Joint Venture with Trilogy Metals Inc. for the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in northwest
    Alaska (Ambler Metals JV). We subscribed for our 50% interest with a payment of US$145M to the Ambler Metals JV, of which
    US$57.5M has been loaned back to South32(Note 4).
-   We progressed the sale of our shareholding in South Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited
    (Seriti Resources), submitting our filings for required regulatory and third party approvals. Subject to a number of material
    conditions(Note 5) being satisfied, the transaction remains on track to be completed in the December 2020 half year.
-   While we progressed the review of options for our manganese alloy smelters, the timeline to complete the review has been
    impacted by government restrictions in response to COVID-19. On 27 March we placed our South African Manganese manganese alloy 
    smelter, Metalloys, on temporary care and maintenance in response to the national lockdown.
-   As previously reported, we have initiated a Group wide review that is expected to deliver a reduction in controllable costs
    across our operations from FY21. Sustaining capital expenditure, including EAI, is now expected to decline to approximately
    US$500M in FY20, as we embed savings from reduced activity in response to market conditions and reflect updated
    assumptions for our average exchange rates to an AUD:USD of 0.67, USD:ZAR of 15.76 and USD:COP of 3,544.
-   Our geographical earnings mix will have a significant bearing on our ETR given differing country tax rates(Note 6), while the
    impact of intragroup agreements, exploration expenditure in foreign entities and other permanent differences will continue to
    be magnified when margins are compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions. Until it is sold, South Africa Energy
    Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0%, with all tax assets de-recognised from 30 June 2019 and no benefit to be recorded for
    losses made prior to sale. Whilst it is therefore difficult to predict our ETR (excluding EAI), we do expect it to remain elevated 
    in H2 FY20 (H1 FY20: 75.0%).


Development and Exploration Update
-   We progressed our pre-feasibility study for the Taylor deposit at the Hermosa project which we now expect to be completed in
    the September 2020 quarter. We also directed US$5M (all capitalised) to exploration programs at newly identified regional
    targets and resource definition drilling at the project. A Mineral Resource estimate for the Clark deposit in accordance with
    JORC Code guidelines is expected to be released in the June 2020 quarter(Note 7).
-   Subsequent to the end of the quarter we completed the remaining resource quality drilling at Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal,
    with the interpretation of those results to support on-going feasibility study work. On 27 March, we reported that given current
    market uncertainty, we are prioritising work with our joint venture partner to preserve the value of our investment beyond the
    final investment decision scheduled for the end of this calendar year.
-   Following the formation of the Ambler Metals JV in the March 2020 quarter, we released Mineral Resource estimates for the
    Arctic and Bornite deposits for the first time in accordance with JORC Code guidelines. During the June 2020 quarter, the joint
    venture partners will review the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on planned activities for the remainder of the calendar year.
    We anticipate a reduction in the approved exploration and study budget of US$22.8M due to reduced exploration activity.
-   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we invested
    US$3M during the March 2020 quarter (US$13M in the nine months ended March 2020). Greenfield exploration activity has
    been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of people and equipment which limited the ability for some of our
    partners to access exploration areas in certain jurisdictions. Accordingly, FY20 greenfield exploration guidance has been
    reduced by US$10M to US$20M with these restrictions expected to continue for the remainder of the calendar year.
-   We directed US$12M towards exploration programs at our existing operations (US$10M capitalised), including US$5M at
    Hermosa as noted above (all capitalised).

Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 3% (or 70kt) to 2,869kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the refinery
benefitted from improvement initiatives expected to support a sustainable increase in production to nameplate capacity of 4.6Mt
(100% basis).

Sales declined by 12% during the March 2020 quarter as scheduled calciner maintenance impacted production, and a shipment
slipped to the June 2020 quarter as a result of COVID-19 quarantine delays at port. Subject to existing or additional COVID-19

Hillside Aluminium saleable production increased by 1% (or 4kt) to a record 540kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the
smelter continued to test its maximum technical capacity, despite the impact to production from load-shedding.

Hillside Aluminium is considered an essential business in South Africa for the maintenance of power generation, given the role it
plays in the sustainability of Eskom’s generation network. As a result, the smelter continues to operate despite the nationwide
lockdown that is currently scheduled to expire on 30 April, having commenced at midnight on 26 March.

As previously reported, FY20 production guidance has been withdrawn due to the uncertain impact of measures or restrictions that
may be required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$11M (or 48%) to US$12M.

Mozal Aluminium saleable production was unchanged at 201kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the smelter continued to
test its maximum technical capacity, despite the impact to production from load-shedding. Subject to no impact from existing or                                                                                                                     
additional COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year, FY20 production guidance(Note 8) remains
unchanged at 273kt.

The smelter sources all of its alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a percentage of the
LME aluminium index under a legacy contract and the remainder linked to the Platts alumina index on an M-1 basis, with caps and
floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. As a result the smelter’s cost of alumina was a premium
to the index in the nine months ended March 2020.

the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$1M (or 8%) to US$11M.

South African Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 5% (or 825kt) to 17.4Mt in the nine months ended March 2020 as the
demobilisation of contractors in response to market conditions and heavy rainfall experienced in the March 2020 quarter, more than
offset a 12% increase in export sales volumes. Higher export sales volumes were achieved as a result of improved dragline
availability at Klipspruit and the diversion of lower calorific value coal to the export market to take advantage of favourable market
conditions.

The diversion of lower calorific value coal has an impact on the average price received for our export sales and accordingly we
realised a discount of approximately 20% to the API4 index(Note 12) in the nine months ended March 2020. Notwithstanding the
increased tonnages in the nine months ended March 2020, export sales declined 7% during the quarter, as the temporary closure
of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, caused by the national lockdown resulted in the deferral of shipments.
Our average realised price for domestic coal in the nine months ended March 2020 was US$24/t. In the June 2019 quarter, we
invoked a hardship clause in our contract to supply coal from the Wolvekrans-Middelburg Complex to the Duvha power station with
a view to securing a long term pricing tariff that supports the sustainability of the business. During the March 2020 quarter an
interim pricing arrangement has been agreed to ensure continuous supply while Eskom undertakes their review of the hardship
claim.

As previously reported, FY20 production guidance has been withdrawn following the nationwide lockdown in South Africa that is
currently scheduled to expire on 30 April, having commenced at midnight on 26 March. While our domestic operations are
considered essential in South Africa for the maintenance of power generation and are exempt from the lockdown, domestic
demand is expected to be impacted by lower total power generation during the June 2020 quarter. Our export operations were
placed on temporary care and maintenance at commencement of the lockdown. We subsequently requested and received
government approval to undertake limited activity during the lockdown period and have partially remobilised at a reduced rate.
Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$21M (or 32%) to US$44M.

Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 1% (or 15kwmt) to 2,616kwmt in the nine months ended March 2020
as lower primary circuit throughput, following heavy rain in late FY19, was partially offset by an increase in demand for our low cost
Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) product. We continued to operate the PC02 circuit above its design capacity, contributing 11% of
total production in the nine months ended March 2020 (10% in the prior corresponding period). Manganese ore sales declined 12%
during the March 2020 quarter due to lower production and a shipment that slipped to the June 2020 quarter as a result of
quarantine delays at port.

FY20 production guidance has been lowered by 5% to 3,375kwmt, reflecting lower year to date throughput and reduced
productivity expectations to finish the year following temporary roster changes made to respond to COVID-19. Guidance is subject
to no further impact from COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year. We also continue to
monitor the potential impact of the wet season and market conditions on our adjusted FY20 production guidance.
Manganese alloy saleable production decreased by 29% (or 33kt) to 81kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as one of the four
furnaces remained offline.

Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 10% (or 16.4kt) to 174.5kt in the nine months ended March 2020 as
the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level and recorded a higher average zinc grade, that more than offset
lower silver and lead grades across the period.

Subject to no impact from existing or additional COVID-19 restrictions or measures during the remainder of the financial year, FY20
production guidance remains unchanged at 221.0kt payable zinc equivalent with a lower average zinc grade expected in the June
2020 quarter. Reduced sales in the March 2020 quarter reflect lower silver and lead production and a return to normalised
inventory levels following elevated sales in the prior quarter. Our lead and zinc sells with reference to the LME market on a M+2 or 
M+3 basis and our realised prices are disclosed net of treatment and refining charges that have widened in the current market.

Following a review of activity in response to market conditions and an update to our assumptions for foreign exchange rates over
the remainder of FY20, guidance for sustaining capital expenditure has been reduced by US$5M (or 9%) to US$50M.


Notes:

1.    Net Cash number is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of 
      profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and 
      should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance 
      or liquidity.
3.    Since inception, US$1.0B has been allocated to the on-market share buy-back (477M shares at an average price of A$2.94 
      per share).
4.    South32 subscription payment of US$145M to form the Ambler Metals JV. The JV has retained US$87.5M of the subscription 
      payment to fund its activities,exploration and a pre-feasibility study for the Arctic deposit, and loaned US$57.5M back 
      to South32. On a proportionally consolidated basis the net effect on South32’s net cash is US$(72.5)M.
5.    Refer to the market announcement “Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal” dated 6 November 2019.
6.    The primary corporate tax rates applicable to the Group for FY20 include: Australia 30%, South Africa 28%, 
      Colombia 33%, Mozambique 0% and Brazil 34%. The Colombian corporate tax rate is 32% in CY20 and will decrease on an 
      annual basis by a percent each year, stabilising at 30% from 1 January 2022. The Mozambique operations are subject 
      to a royalty on revenues instead of income tax.
7.    Information that relates to estimates of Mineral Resources for the Clark Deposit (formally the Central Deposit) of 
      the Hermosa project are foreign estimates under ASX Listing Rules and are not reported in accordance with the JORC 
      Code. Reference should be made to the clarifying statement on Mineral Resources in the market announcement “South32 
      to acquire Arizona Mining in agreed all cash offer” dated 18 June 2018, in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.12. 
      South32 is not in possession of any new information or data relating to the foreign estimate that materially impacts 
      on the reliability of the estimate or has the ability to verify the foreign estimate as a Mineral Resource in 
      accordance with the JORC Code. South32 confirms that the supporting information contained in the clarifying statement 
      in the 18 June 2018 market announcement continues to apply and has not materially changed. Competent 
      Persons have not done sufficient work to classify the foreign estimates as Mineral Resources in accordance with JORC Code. 
      It is uncertain that following evaluation and further exploration that the foreign estimates will be able to be reported 
      as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code. During FY20 we have undertaken a work program 
      aimed at increasing confidence in the resource to ensure that resources are reported in accordance with the JORC Code.
8.    Production guidance for Mozal Aluminium does not assume any load-shedding impact on production.
9.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests 
      owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via distributions 
      attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans are repaid, 
      South32’s interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
10.   Consistent with the presentation of South32’s segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales 
      have been reported at 60%. The Group’s financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South Africa 
      Manganese ore.
11.   Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing the 
      total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver (US$14.4/oz) 
      have been used for FY19, YTD FY20 and FY20e.
12.   The sales volume weighted average of the API4 index on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing 
      (Month minus one or “M-1”)was US$72/t in the nine months ended March quarter 2020.
13.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
      Metallurgical Coal production.

                              South32 Acts in Response to Market Conditions

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises several steps it is taking in response to
market conditions and the restrictions being implemented by governments aimed at containing the spread of COVID-
19.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr, said “As COVID-19 impacts people across the world including the
countries in which we operate, we remain focussed on keeping our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable
operations, and supporting our communities. At the same time, we are taking action to maintain the financial strength
of our business in response to a rapidly evolving environment.

“Our business is well positioned to successfully navigate this period of uncertainty. The initiatives announced today
are aimed at delivering approximately US$160M in lower expenditure over the next 15 months to protect our financial
position. Our balance sheet remains strong, with reported net cash of US$277M at 31 December 2019, including cash
and cash equivalents of US$1.4B, no term debt and an undrawn US$1.5B revolving credit facility.

“The prudent management of our strong balance sheet will continue through our disciplined allocation of capital
                                                                                                           1
consistent with our unchanged capital management framework. Since demerger, we have returned US$2.9B to our
shareholders by way of ordinary dividends and our capital management program. The disciplined approach we
continue to take to capital allocation and our simple capital management framework ensures our shareholders will be
rewarded as financial performance improves.”

Lower expenditure comprises an expected reduction in Sustaining capital expenditure (US$150M) and exploration
activity (US$10M). Sustaining capital expenditure savings will be realised by a reduction in spend of 10% in FY20 and
             2
18% in FY21 . In addition, to prepare for a potentially extended period of low prices, we are reviewing activity across
the Group aimed at delivering a meaningful reduction in controllable costs, building on our strong Operating unit cost
performance in H1 FY20. We expect to see the benefit of this work and lower producer currencies reflected in our
FY21 Operating unit cost guidance.

Further to these initiatives, we have suspended the remaining US$121M of our current on-market share buy-back with
the opportunity to review its extension ahead of its expiry on 4 September 2020.

We will continue to review the evolving environment, to understand the impact on timelines for our development
options and will take further action as required to prioritise long term value across the Group. In this regard, the pre-
feasibility study at Hermosa is now expected to be concluded in the September 2020 quarter. Separately, given the
current market uncertainty, we are working with our joint venture partner to preserve the value of our Eagle Downs
Metallurgical Coal investment beyond the investment decision scheduled for the end of this calendar year.




1
  Includes fully franked ordinary dividend (US$54M) and fully franked special dividend (US$54M) to be paid on 2 April 2020.
2
  FY20 Sustaining capital expenditure includes equity accounted investments and South Africa Energy Coal. FY21 Sustaining capital expenditure
reduction calculated using top end of current guidance range (US$450-550M) and excludes South Africa Energy Coal. FY20 and FY21 assumes
prior guidance currency assumptions (AUD:USD exchange rate of 0.69; a USD:ZAR exchange rate of 14.58 and a USD:COP exchange rate of
3,364).

Mr Kerr said “Sustaining capital expenditure to maintain safe and reliable operations remains a priority, however the
flexibility of our programs across the Group means that some activity is able to be deferred to future years in response
to unexpected market conditions.

“Investing in exploration and our development options to create shareholder value also remains integral to the Group’s
strategy. Our financial priorities remain unchanged, and today’s actions, including the suspension of our on-market
share buy-back, are a prudent response to the current exceptional circumstances and consistent with our commitment
to maintain a strong financial position.”

Update to operations:

The Group previously reported the withdrawal of FY20 guidance for our South African operations as a result of the
government’s announcement of a 21 day nationwide lockdown, commencing midnight on Thursday 26 March 2020.

In response to the government’s announcement, our South Africa Manganese operations, along with our export coal
production from South Africa Energy Coal, have been placed on care and maintenance for a minimum of 21 days.

Our Hillside Aluminium smelter and domestic coal production from South Africa Energy Coal are considered
businesses essential for the maintenance of power generation, given the role they play in the sustainability of Eskom’s
generation network and will continue to operate during the lockdown.

In Colombia, because of the threat of COVID-19, the President announced a 19 day nationwide lockdown,
commencing midnight on Tuesday 24 March 2020. Our Cerro Matoso operation continues to operate with government
approval at a reduced rate. As a result of the uncertain impact of the restrictions to production volumes, which are
expected to be more than offset by a change in timing of our scheduled furnace refurbishment in the June 2020
quarter, we are withdrawing guidance and will update the market when further information becomes available.

To-date, we have not yet experienced production interruptions from COVID-19 at any other operations. We continue
to monitor the impact of restrictions placed on the movement of people and goods across the world and will continue
to update the market as appropriate.

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (South32) advises the South African President has taken
action to enforce a nationwide lockdown aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19, commencing midnight on
Thursday 26 March 2020, for 21 days.

South32 understands that businesses essential for the maintenance of power generation in South Africa are exempt
from the lockdown. We will work with the government to determine the impact of this exemption on our South African
Energy Coal and South Africa Aluminium operations, given the role they play in the sustainability of Eskom’s
generation network.

We are seeking clarification from government that the lockdown will extend to South Africa Manganese and have
commenced planning for our manganese ore operations and the remaining furnace at our Metalloys alloy smelter to
be placed on care and maintenance.

As a result of the government’s announcement, we are withdrawing FY20 guidance for our South African operations
and will update the market when further information becomes available.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said “Our response to COVID-19 is built around three areas – keeping
our people safe and well, maintaining safe and reliable operations, and supporting our communities, all of which are
critical to the future of our business.

“We have implemented a range of measures at all our locations to ensure the health and wellbeing of our people and
communities, by reducing the risk of infection and the rate of spread, while maintaining day-to-day operations.

“To-date, we have not yet experienced production interruptions from COVID-19 at any other operations. We continue

  2. After the South African dividends tax has been withheld, the net dividends will be 26.81075 South African
     cents per ordinary share.

     South African dividends tax.

     13 February 2020.

Corporate Update

-   In November 2019 we entered into a binding conditional agreement for the sale of our shareholding in South
    Africa Energy Coal to Seriti Resources Holdings Proprietary Limited (Seriti Resources) and two trusts which will
    acquire and hold equity on behalf of employees and communities. As previously reported, subject to a number of material 
    conditions(note 1) being satisfied, the transaction is expected to close in the December 2020 half year.
-   We exercised our option to acquire a 50% interest in a joint venture (JV) with Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX: TMQ,
    Trilogy) that will own the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (UKMP) located in northwest Alaska. On formation of the
    JV, expected in the March 2020 quarter, Trilogy will contribute all of its assets associated with the UKMP and
    South32 will contribute US$145M to the JV.The JV will retain US$87.5M of the subscription payment to fund its activities and 
    exploration programs with the balance of US$57.5M loaned back to South32.
-   Our manganese equity accounted investments (EAI) sold a legacy shareholding in an unlisted entity for US$93M
    (South32 share) during the quarter. With the majority of these funds returned immediately to the Group, we
    received net distributions(note 2) of US$160M (South32 share) from our manganese EAI during the December
    2019 half year.
-   We progressed the review of options for our manganese alloy smelters including their potential divestment,
    closure or suspension.
-   Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital management we paid our US$139M final dividend in respect of
    FY19 in October 2019 and purchased a further 106M shares for a cash consideration of US$192M during the
    December 2019 half year. To 31 December 2019 we had completed US$1.18B of our approved US$1.25B capital
    management program, including the purchase of 424M shares at an average price of A$3.03 per share
    (US$939M) and US$239M returned in the form of special dividends.
-   Our geographical earnings mix and the impact of permanent differences that are magnified when margins are
    compressed or losses are incurred in specific jurisdictions, continues to have a significant bearing on our ETR.
    Until it is sold, South Africa Energy Coal is expected to have an ETR of 0% with all tax assets de-recognised as at 30 June
    2019 and no benefit to be recorded for losses made prior to sale. Accordingly, in the December 2019 half year our
    Group ETR is expected to be in a range between 75% and 85% (excluding EAI) and is expected to remain elevated should South 
    Africa Energy Coal continue to be loss-making until its divestment.

    -   Realised prices exclude third party products and services. We currently anticipate an underlying EBIT loss for
        third party products and services(note 12) of approximately US$12M in the December 2019 half year (H1 FY19:
        US$28M). This predominantly reflects the procurement of lower cost third party volumes to replace higher cost
        equity production in order to fulfil contractual commitments at South Africa Energy Coal.

    Development and Exploration Update
    -   We completed the voluntary remediation program for historical tailings at Hermosa, establishing the initial tailings
        storage facility that is able to support the commencement of future production when production permits are
        received. Our pre-feasibility study remains on-track for completion in the June 2020 half year.
    -   We advanced feasibility study work at the Eagle Downs Metallurgical Coal project ahead of a final investment
        decision scheduled for the December 2020 half year.
    -   Consistent with our strategy to partner with companies to fund early stage greenfield exploration opportunities, we
        invested US$10M during the December 2019 half year. We directed a further US$26M towards exploration
        programs at our existing operations (US$19M capitalised), including US$2M for our EAI (US$1M capitalised) and
        US$12M at Hermosa (all capitalised) to further increase our knowledge of the Taylor Deposit and the greater
        Hermosa land package.

    Worsley Alumina saleable production increased by 1% (or 27kt) to 1,933kt in the December 2019 half year, despite an
    extended calciner shut, as the refinery continued to benefit from improved calciner availability and we opportunistically
    sold stockpiled hydrate. FY20 production guidance remains unchanged at 3,965kt with further calciner maintenance

    We realised a premium to the Platts Alumina Index(note 13) on a volume weighted M-1 basis for alumina sales in the

    Aluminium smelter that are linked to the Platts Alumina Index on an M-1 basis, with caps and floors embedded within
    specific contracts that reset every calendar year. All other alumina sales were at market based prices.

    Brazil Alumina saleable production increased by 10% (or 66kt) to a record 702kt in the December 2019 half year as
    the refinery benefitted from improved steam generation following the installation of package boilers in the June 2019
    quarter, enabling the benefits of the De-bottlenecking Phase One project to be realised. Notwithstanding the strong 
    operating performance, lower alumina prices and an increase in the use of higher cost third party bauxite is expected to 
    impact the profitability of the operation in the December 2019 half year. FY20 production guidance remains unchanged at 
    1,330kt with maintenance scheduled for the June 2020 quarter.

    Mozal Aluminium saleable production decreased by 1% (or 1kt) to 134kt in the December 2019 half year as the
    smelter's operating performance continued to be impacted by load-shedding events. Despite an increase in the
    frequency of disruptions, FY20 production guidance(note 3) remains unchanged at 273kt.
   
    The smelter sources all of its alumina from our Worsley Alumina refinery with approximately 50% priced as a
    percentage of the LME aluminium index under a legacy contract and the remainder linked to the Platts alumina index on an 
    M-1 basis,with caps and floors embedded within specific contracts that reset every calendar year. As a result the smelter's 
    cost of alumina was a significant premium to the index in the December 2019 half year.

    South Africa Energy Coal saleable production decreased by 3% (or 386kt) to 11.8Mt in the December 2019 half year
    as the operation demobilised contractors in response to market conditions, more than offsetting a 15% increase in
    export sales volumes following improved dragline availability at Klipspruit.

    Notwithstanding the improvement in dragline performance, supporting a 46% increase in export sales during the
    December 2019 quarter, its ramp-up to full utilisation has been slower than anticipated as a result of wet weather.
    Combined with our near-term outlook for domestic demand and the demobilisation of contractors operating in
    unprofitable pits, we now expect FY20 production to be at the bottom end of our guidance range (26.0Mt). Operating
    unit costs are expected to be approximately 10% above the top end of our guidance range of US$40/t in the
    December 2019 half year, ahead of benefitting from an expected increase in volumes during the June 2020 half year
    and the realisation of cost saving initiatives which include contractor demobilisation.

    Australia Manganese saleable ore production decreased by 2% (or 36kwmt) to 1,775kwmt in the December 2019 half

    Separately, with demand for our low cost Premium Concentrate Ore (PC02) product remaining favourable, we
    continued to operate the circuit above its design capacity, contributing 11% of total production (H1 FY19: 9%). The
    PC02 fines product has a manganese content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade and product-type
    discounts when referenced to the high grade 44% manganese lump ore index.

    Cannington payable zinc equivalent production increased by 12% (or 12.7kt) to 120.1kt in the December 2019 half
    year as the operation drew down run of mine stocks to a normalised level and recorded a higher average zinc grade in
    the September 2019 quarter, that more than offset lower silver grades across the half year.
    
    Processed silver, lead and zinc grades met our expectations in the December 2019 half year and FY20 production
    guidance remains unchanged (silver 11,200koz, lead 104.0kt and zinc 59.0kt) with sequentially lower lead and silver
    grades expected in the June 2020 half year. Higher payable zinc sales in the December 2019 half year reflect timing 
    differences following significant floods in North Queensland in the March 2019 quarter that caused an extended outage of
    a third-party rail line connecting Cannington to the Townsville port.

                                                                                                                       8

     Notes:
     1.    Refer to the market announcement ""Agreement to Divest South Africa Energy Coal"" dated 6 November 2019.
     2.    Net distributions from equity accounted investments includes net debt movements and dividends, which are unaudited and 
           should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial 
           performance or liquidity.
     3.    Production guidance for our Hillside Aluminium and Mozal Aluminium smelters does not assume any load-shedding impacts 
           on production.
     4.    8% of South Africa Energy Coal is owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. The interests
           owned by the B-BBEE consortium were acquired using vendor finance, with the loans repayable to South32 via 
           distributions attributable to these parties, pro rata to their share in South Africa Energy Coal. Until these loans 
           are repaid, South32's interest in South Africa Energy Coal is accounted at 100%.
     5.    Consistent with the presentation of South32's segment information, South Africa Manganese ore production and sales
           have been reported at 60%. The Group's financial statements will continue to reflect a 54.6% interest in South 
           Africa Manganese ore.
     6.    Payable zinc equivalent (kt) was calculated by aggregating Revenue from payable silver, lead and zinc, and dividing 
           the total Revenue by the price of zinc. FY19 realised prices for zinc (US$2,122/t), lead (US$1,754/t) and silver 
           (US$14.4/oz) have been used for FY19, H1 FY20 and FY20e.
     7.    Realised prices are unaudited. Volumes and prices do not include any third party trading that may be undertaken 
           independently of equity production. Realised sales price is calculated as sales Revenue divided by sales volume unless
           otherwise stated.
     8.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided 
           by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany 
           transaction.
     9.    Realised ore prices are unaudited and calculated as external sales Revenue less freight and marketing costs, divided 
           by external sales volume. Ore converted to sinter and alloy, and sold externally, is eliminated as an intracompany 
           transaction. Manganese ore sales are grossed-up to reflect a 60% accounting effective interest.
     10.   Realised nickel sales prices are unaudited and inclusive of by-products.
     11.   Realised prices for Cannington are unaudited and net of treatment and refining charges.
     12.   Underlying EBIT on third party products and services is unaudited and should not be considered as an indication of 
           or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
     13.   The average of the Platts Alumina Index (FOB Australia) on the basis of a one month lag to published pricing (Month 
           minus one or ""M-1"")was US$299/t in the December 2019 half year.
     14.   Illawarra Metallurgical Coal sales are adjusted for moisture and will not reconcile directly to Illawarra 
           Metallurgical Coal production.

PASSING OF DR XOLANI MKHWANAZI

 South32 is deeply saddened to announce the death of our Non-executive Director Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi on Saturday,
 4 January 2020, following a short illness.

 Xolani joined the Board of South32 Limited in July 2015, shortly after the Company's formation, following a
 distinguished executive career, including with BHP Billiton where he served as Chairman of BHP Billiton South Africa
 and as President and Chief Operating Officer of South Africa Aluminium.

 With significant experience in mining and metals and expertise in science, Xolani played a critical role in the
 establishment of South32 and made a valuable contribution to the Sustainability Committee based on his deep
 understanding of social and environmental issues.

 ""Xolani was greatly admired for his grace and his wisdom. He was a scientist and an esteemed business leader with a
 passion for South Africa, its people and the resources sector. His contribution was felt throughout the Company and
 we will miss him greatly"" said Chair Karen Wood.

 Prior to his executive roles at BHP Billiton, Xolani served as Chief Executive Officer at Bateman Africa and the
 National Energy Regulator. He previously held senior positions at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
 where he played a significant role in the formulation of the South African National Science and Technology Policy.

 Xolani held a PhD in Applied Physics from Lancaster University and was a strong supporter of increasing student
 participation in science, engineering and technology in South Africa. He received recognition for his contribution to the
 sciences, including an honorary degree awarded by Lancaster University in July 2019.

 South32's Board and management extend their deepest condolences to Xolani's family.

SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE

South32 Limited (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32; ADR: SOUHY) (""South32"") and Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX, NYSE
American: TMQ) (""Trilogy Metals"") announced today that South32 has exercised its option to acquire a 50%
interest in a joint venture company (""Joint Venture"") that will own the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (""UKMP"")
located                              in                            northwest                           Alaska.
Trilogy Metals will contribute all of its assets associated with the UKMP and South32 will contribute
US$145 million to the Joint Venture. Establishment of the Joint Venture is expected to occur in February 2020
and follows an initial exploration partnership between South32 and Trilogy Metals over three field seasons to
advance both parties' geological understanding of the UKMP.

Following formation, the Joint Venture will retain US$87.5 million of the US$145 million subscription payment to fund its
activities and exploration programs with the balance of US$57.5 million loaned back to South32. The loan will be repaid
in instalments, on notice by the Joint Venture as required to advance development studies, resource drilling and regional
exploration programs.

South32 Chief Executive Officer, Graham Kerr said ""Investing in exploration to create shareholder value is integral to
our Group's strategy. Forming the UKMP Joint Venture will be another important milestone as we reshape and improve
our portfolio, by adding high-quality copper and base metals development options. The decision to exercise the option
follows a successful exploration partnership with Trilogy Metals and is an exciting step forward.""

""We look forward to furthering our partnership with Trilogy Metals and NANA Regional Corporation, the Inupiat-owned
Alaska Native corporation in the region, as we work together to advance the Arctic and Bornite deposits and further test
the significant regional potential across the Ambler Mining District.""

Trilogy Metals Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, James Gowans said ""Having the support and partnership
from a senior mining company like South32 - both in terms of their financial support and technical expertise - is
tremendous for Trilogy Metals. The Ambler Mining District has great potential that we expect will finally be realised with
the formation of the Joint Venture and when the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Project, providing key
infrastructure access, is approved. We are very excited to advance this partnership.""

""This joint venture is an investment in the future - not only for the UKMP but for NANA shareholders and the people of
Alaska,"" said NANA Regional Corporation, Inc (""NANA"") president and CEO Wayne Westlake. ""Continued exploration
offers opportunities for economic growth, allowing NANA to further fulfill our mission to improve the quality of life for our
people.""

About UKMP

The UKMP is located in the Ambler Mining District in Alaska and includes the high grade, polymetallic Arctic deposit,
the Bornite copper deposit and a highly prospective regional exploration portfolio.

Figure 1 can be found within the National Storage Mechanism version of the release.



Arctic is a polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) style deposit that has a reported reserve and resource 1
in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). Current activities at Arctic are focused on advancing
development studies and permitting, following release of a pre-feasibility study by Trilogy Metals in April 2018. Bornite
is a carbonate hosted copper deposit that has a reported resource2 in accordance with NI 43-101. The 2020 field season
will include further exploration drilling at Bornite and regional activity across the highly prospective Ambler VMS and
carbonate hosted copper belts.

South32 expects to release initial JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimates for Arctic and Bornite in the
March quarter 2020 following establishment of the Joint Venture. South32 cautions that the NI 43-101 Mineral
Resources for Arctic and Bornite published by Trilogy Metals are foreign estimates and are not reported in accordance
with the JORC Code. A Competent Person has not done sufficient work to classify the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources
and Mineral Reserves as JORC Code Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves respectively in accordance with the JORC
Code. It is uncertain that following evaluation and/or further exploration work that the NI 43-101 Mineral Resources and
Mineral Reserves will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC
Code.

About NANA

NANA is a for-profit Alaska Native corporation formed as a result of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)
of 1971. NANA manages 2.3 million acres of land located in northwest Alaska, largely above the Arctic Circle, and is
owned by more than 14,500 Inupiat shareholders, or descendants, who live or have roots in the region. In October 2011,
Trilogy Metals and NANA entered into an agreement to consolidate their landholdings into the land package that hosts
the UKMP and established a framework for co-operative development of their respective interests by formation of a joint
venture or royalty payment mechanism.

About Trilogy

Trilogy Metals is a metals exploration and development company focused on exploring and developing the Ambler
mining district located in north-western Alaska. It is one of the richest and most-prospective known copper-dominant
districts located in one of the safest geopolitical jurisdictions in the world. It hosts world-class polymetallic VMS deposits
that contain copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, and carbonate replacement deposits which have been found to host
high-grade copper and cobalt mineralization. Exploration efforts have been focused on two deposits in the Ambler
mining district - the Arctic VMS deposit and the Bornite carbonate replacement deposit. Both deposits are located within
the Company's land package that spans approximately 143,000 hectares. The Company has an agreement with NANA,
a Regional Alaska Native Corporation that provides a framework for the exploration and potential development of the
Ambler mining district in cooperation with local communities. Our vision is to develop the Ambler mining district into a
premier North American copper producer.

    SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE                            3
Forward-looking statements

This press release includes certain ""forward-looking information"" and ""forward-looking statements"" (collectively,
""forward-looking statements"") within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to,
statements regarding the completion of the transactions contemplated herein, the timing of the establishment of the
Joint Venture, the realisation of the value in the mining district related to the Joint Venture and the final structure thereof
and access road and the use of proceeds from the contribution payment by South32 and the timing of the release of the
JORC compliant Mineral Resource estimates. These forward-looking statements reflect expectations at the date of this
release; however, they are not guarantees or predictions of future performance. They involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. Readers are cautioned not to put undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable laws or regulations, neither Trilogy Metals nor
South32 undertakes to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information
or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Trilogy Metals' expectations include risks
related to the negotiation and settlement of definitive documentation and the satisfaction or waiver of conditions
precedent to the establishment of the Joint Venture and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in Trilogy Metals' Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018 filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities
and with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and in other Trilogy Metals reports and documents
filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities from time to time.

Mineral Resources and Reserves - clarifying statements

The estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for Arctic and Bornite are foreign estimates under the ASX
Listing Rules reported in accordance with NI 43-101 and filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on 6 April 2018 and 20 July
2018 respectively.

In accordance with NI 43-101, Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.
There is no certainty that all or any part of mineral resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. Inferred Mineral
Resources are based on limited drilling which suggests the greatest uncertainty for a resource estimate and that
geological continuity is only implied. Additional drilling will be required to verify geological and mineralisation continuity
and there is no certainty that all of the Inferred Resources will be converted to Measured and Indicated Resources.
Quantity and grades are estimates and are rounded to reflect the fact that the resource estimate is an approximation.

The categories of Mineral Resource classification used are in accordance with NI 43-101. NI 43-101 is a  qualifying
foreign estimate' (Chapter 19, ASX Listing Rules) and has similar categories of resource classification as the JORC
Code (Appendix 5A, ASX Listing Rules).

Reliability of estimate: South32 has experience of managing similar operations to Arctic and Bornite. South32's key
technical and operational personnel have conducted site visits to Arctic and Bornite. Trilogy Metals provided information
used to estimate Mineral Resources to South32 for review.

The basis for the estimates as provided to South32 consists of a geological database incorporating geology, analytical
results and surface topography. Mining and processing recoveries are based on the NI 43-101 reports on Arctic (filed
6 April 2018) and Bornite (filed 20 July 2018) which are available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).

South32 believes that the information provided is the most recent publicly available.

Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the current requirements of the SEC, and information
on mineral deposits contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In
particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term ""resource"" does not equate to the term ""reserves"",
and the requirements for ""reserves"" under NI 43-101 are also not the same as those under SEC rules. Under U.S.
standards, mineralization may not be classified as a ""reserve"" unless the determination has been made that the
mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
The SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning ""measured mineral
resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" or ""inferred mineral resources"" or other descriptions of the amount of
mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute ""reserves"" by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC.
Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted
into reserves. U.S. investors should also understand that ""inferred mineral resources"" have a great amount of uncertainty
as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Accordingly, information concerning
     SOUTH32 AND TRILOGY METALS TO FORM UPPER KOBUK MINERAL PROJECTS JOINT VENTURE                                       4
mineral deposits set forth in this press release may not be comparable with information made public by companies that
report in accordance with U.S. standards.

Competent persons' statement

In accordance with ASX listing rule 5.12, Tracy Fouet, a Competent Person, employee of South32 and a Chartered
Professional and Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, confirms the information in this market
announcement that relates to the Arctic and Bornite NI 43-101 foreign estimates filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) on
6 April 2018 and 20 July 2018 are accurate representations of the available data and studies provided to South32 by
Trilogy Metals. Ms Fouet has sufficient relevant experience for the styles of mineralisation and types of deposits under
consideration to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for the Reporting
of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code). Ms Fouet consents to the inclusion in the
report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.

Qualified Persons

Andrew W. West, Certified Professional Geologist, Exploration Manager for Trilogy Metals, is a Qualified Person as
defined by National Instrument 43-101. Mr. West has reviewed the scientific and technical information in this news
release on behalf of Trilogy Metals and approves the disclosure contained herein.
