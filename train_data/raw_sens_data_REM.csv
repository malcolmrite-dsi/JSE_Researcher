SUMMARY OF AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND CASH DIVIDEND
DECLARATION

SALIENT FEATURES
• Total headline earnings per share: down by 61.3% to 560.6 cents
• Headline earnings per share from continuing operations: down by 68.7% to 307.5 cents
• Earnings per share: down by 9.1% to 1 176.4 cents
• Ordinary dividend per share: down by 53.0% to 265 cents
• Intrinsic net asset value per share as at 30 June 2020: R154.47

COVID-19
The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures have brought desperation and devastation upon millions.
In South Africa, lives and livelihoods have been lost, with household finances decimated and many going hungry in
large parts of our country. This crisis is one of unknown unknowns and managing the crisis is the number one priority
for Remgro and all of our investee companies. Our focus is on the factors within our control, the health and well-being
of our people, ensuring that our investments have the most robust financial positions to support business continuity and
making sure that underlying investee companies that are in a position to offer help to the country are enabled to do so.

RESULTS
For the year to 30 June 2020, total headline earnings decreased by 61.4% from R8 195 million to R3 167 million, while
total headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 61.3% from 1 448.9 cents to 560.6 cents. As a result of the
unbundling of Remgro’s 28.2% interest in RMB Holdings Limited (RMH) (RMH Unbundling), headline earnings is also
presented for continuing operations and discontinued operations. The investment in RMH is treated as a discontinued
operation and, accordingly, discontinued operations include the equity accounted income of RMH. For the year under
review the investment in RMH was equity accounted for the nine months to 31 March 2020 (2019: twelve months to
30 June 2019). Headline earnings and HEPS from continuing operations decreased by 68.7% from R5 551 million to
R1 737 million and from 981.4 cents to 307.5 cents, respectively. Headline earnings and HEPS from discontinued
operations decreased by 45.9% from R2 644 million to R1 430 million and from 467.5 cents to 253.1 cents, respectively.

The decrease in headline earnings from continuing operations is mainly due to the negative impact that the Covid-19
pandemic and the resultant lockdown measures had on the earnings of Rand Merchant Investment Holdings Limited,
FirstRand Limited, Total South Africa Proprietary Limited, Kagiso Tiso Holdings Proprietary Limited, Distell Group
Holdings Limited and RCL Foods Limited, as well as lower interest income, increased losses from Community
Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited as they expand their fibre network footprint, organically and
acquisitively, and a once-off donation of R500 million to The South African SME Relief Trust (Sukuma donation).

INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE
Remgro’s intrinsic net asset value per share decreased by 33.7% from R233.03 at 30 June 2019 to R154.47 at
30 June 2020. The decrease reflects the impact of the RMH Unbundling and the negative impact of the Covid-19
pandemic on market values (listeds) and fair values (unlisteds) of underlying investee companies. The closing share
price at 30 June 2020 was R99.90 (2019: R187.90) representing a discount of 35.3% (2019: 19.4%) to the intrinsic net
asset value.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 40
Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 50 cents (2019: 349 cents) per share has been declared out of
income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par
value, for the year ended 30 June 2020. The final dividend was adjusted downwards to take into account the RMH
Unbundling and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 10 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 40 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate
in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The total gross dividend per share for the year ended 30 June 2020 therefore amounts to 265 cents, compared to
564 cents for the year ended 30 June 2019.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares. The
income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.

“unclaimed” in the share register until the shareholder provides the Transfer Secretaries with the relevant banking details
for payout.

TRADING STATEMENT

Paragraph 3.4 (b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”)
requires companies to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that their
financial results for the period to be reported upon next, will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

Remgro’s results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are due to be released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on or about 28 September 2020. As a result of the unbundling of Remgro’s 28.2% interest in
RMB Holdings Limited (“RMH”), headline earnings is also presented for continuing operations and
discontinued operations. The investment in RMH is treated as a discontinued operation and
accordingly, discontinued operations include the equity accounted income of RMH. For the year
under review the investment in RMH was equity accounted for the nine months to 31 March 2020
(2019: twelve months to 30 June 2019).

In compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the following guidance is provided to Remgro
shareholders regarding the expected outcome for the year ended 30 June 2020:

                                                      Year ended       Guidance for the year ended

 Total headline earnings per share                       1 448.9       55% - 65%       507.1 – 652.0
 Headline earnings per share from continuing
 operations                                                981.4       65% - 75%        245.4 – 343.5

The decrease in headline earnings from continuing operations is mainly due to the negative impact
that the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown measures had on the earnings of most of
Remgro’s underlying investee companies.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported
on by the Company’s external auditors.

UNBUNDLING OF SHAREHOLDING IN RMB HOLDINGS LIMITED (""RMH""), CASH PROCEEDS IN RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL
ENTITLEMENTS AND APPORTIONMENT OF TAX COST FOR SOUTH AFRICAN TAX PURPOSES

1. Introduction

Holders of Remgro no par value ordinary shares and Remgro unlisted no par value B ordinary shares (""Remgro
Shareholders"") are referred to the detailed terms and finalisation announcements released by Remgro on the Stock
Exchange News Service on 14 April 2020 and 26 May 2020 respectively, regarding the unbundling by way of a dividend in
specie of the 397,447,747 shares in RMH (the ""Unbundled RMH Shares"") to Remgro Shareholders. Remgro Shareholders
will, pursuant to the dividend in specie, become entitled to Unbundled RMH Shares in the ratio of 0.69939 Unbundled RMH
Shares for every 1 share held in Remgro (""Remgro Shares"") (the ""Remgro Unbundling""). The Remgro Unbundling constitutes
an unbundling transaction in terms of section 46 of the South African Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 (""Income Tax Act"").

2. Purpose of the announcement

The purpose of this announcement is to notify Remgro Shareholders of the following:

   -   The value to be utilised in determining the cash payment due to a Remgro Shareholder in respect of any fractional
       entitlements (""Cash Proceeds"");
   -   The closing prices of both the Unbundled RMH Shares and Remgro Shares on Wednesday, 3 June 2020, the day the
       Remgro Shares begin trading ""ex"" the entitlement to receive the Unbundled RMH Shares; and
   -   The ratio in which the expenditure incurred and / or the market value (for purposes of paragraph 29 of the Eighth
       Schedule to the Income Tax Act) (""Market Value"") in respect of the Remgro Shares must be apportioned between
       the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares for South African taxation purposes (""Apportionment Ratio"").

3. Cash Proceeds of fractional entitlement

As outlined in paragraph 4 of the detailed terms announcement, in implementing the Remgro Unbundling, Remgro is
required by the Listing Requirements of the JSE Limited (""Listing Requirements"") to round down the fractional entitlements
to Unbundled RMH Shares to the nearest whole number. The fractions of Unbundled RMH Shares to which Remgro
Shareholders remain entitled, will not be transferred to them but will be aggregated and sold on the Remgro Shareholders’
behalf in the open market as soon as practically possible after the Remgro Unbundling.

Remgro Shareholders will accordingly receive a monetary amount (i.e. the Cash Proceeds) in respect of their fractional
entitlements to Unbundled RMH Shares. In accordance with the Listing Requirements, the Cash Proceeds have now been
determined with reference to the volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") of an Unbundled RMH Share on the securities
exchange operated by the JSE Limited on Wednesday, 3 June 2020 reduced by 10%.

Taking into account the VWAP of ZAR59.00264, Remgro Shareholders are advised that the calculation of the Cash Proceeds
due to Shareholders in respect of any fractional entitlements will be based on a price of ZAR53.10237 (i.e. ZAR59.00264 x
0.9) per Unbundled RMH Share.

4. Apportionment Ratio tax principles

Remgro Shareholders will have a combined expenditure in respect of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares
received pursuant to the Remgro Unbundling.

Remgro Shares held as trading stock: Any Remgro Shareholder holding Remgro Shares as trading stock will be deemed to
acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure of such Remgro Shares and Unbundled RMH
Shares will be the amount taken into account by the Remgro Shareholder in respect of those Remgro Shares, as contemplated
in section 11(a), section 22(1), or section 22(2) of the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure to be
allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the Market Value of the Unbundled
RMH Shares bears to the sum of the Market Value of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares at the end of the
day of the Remgro Unbundling, being Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The expenditure so allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares
will reduce the expenditure relating to the retained Remgro Shares.

Remgro Shares held as capital assets: Any Remgro Shareholder holding Remgro Shares as capital assets will be deemed to
acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as capital assets. The combined expenditure of such Remgro Shares and Unbundled
RMH Shares will be the original expenditure incurred in respect of the Remgro Shares, that is allowable in terms of paragraph
20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and where the Remgro Shares were acquired before 1 October 2001, the
expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be, adopted or determined as contemplated in paragraph 29 of the Eighth
Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be,
to be allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the Market Value of the
Unbundled RMH Shares bear to the sum of the Market Value of the Remgro Shares and the Unbundled RMH Shares at the
end of the day of the Remgro Unbundling, being Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case
may be, so allocated to the Unbundled RMH Shares will reduce the expenditure and/or Market Value, as the case may be,
of the retained Remgro Shares.

Remgro Shareholders are advised to consult their own professional tax advisors should they have any queries regarding the
taxation consequences of the Remgro Unbundling and the calculation of their costs for taxation purposes.

5. Apportionment Ratio calculation

Shareholders are further referred to paragraph 9 of the detailed terms announcement, which require Remgro to advise
Remgro Shareholders of the Apportionment Ratio.

Shareholders are hereby advised that the Apportionment Ratio is based on the closing price of ZAR110.80 per Remgro Share
and ZAR59.94 per Unbundled RMH Share on Wednesday, 3 June 2020. The Apportionment Ratio applicable to the Unbundled
RMH Shares has therefore been calculated as follows:

Apportionment Ratio = (A / (A + B))
Where –
A = the closing price of an Unbundled RMH Share x the unbundling ratio, i.e. ZAR41.92 (being ZAR59.94 X 0.69939);
B = the closing price of a Remgro Share, i.e. ZAR110.80
= (ZAR 41.92 / (ZAR41.92 + ZAR110.80))
= 27.44961%

Shareholders are hereby advised that the expenditure incurred and/or Market Value, as the case may be, in respect of
Remgro shares must therefore be apportioned in the ratio of 27.44961% to an Unbundled RMH Share and 72.55039% to a
Remgro Share.

1. Introduction

   Remgro Shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcements released on
   the Stock Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on 19 November 2019, 7 January 2020
   and 18 February 2020 relating, inter alia, to the in-principle decision by
   Remgro to pursue the distribution, in full or in part, of its shareholding in
   RMH and FirstRand Limited (""FirstRand"") to Remgro Shareholders. Concurrently
   with Remgro's cautionary announcements, RMH proposed the distribution by RMH
   of its FirstRand shares to its shareholders (""RMH Unbundling"") as part of a
   restructuring of the RMH portfolio of assets and liabilities.

   Remgro Shareholders are further referred to the cautionary announcement
   released on SENS on 31 March 2020 in terms of which Remgro Shareholders were
   advised that the board of directors of Remgro (""Board"") had resolved to proceed
   with the distribution of Remgro's 28.2% interest in RMH to Remgro Shareholders
   (the ""Remgro Unbundling""), but to retain Remgro's 3.9% direct interest in
   FirstRand.

   Remgro Shareholders are also referred to the terms announcement released by
   RMH concurrently with this announcement in which RMH has advised RMH
   shareholders that it intends distributing its entire shareholding in FirstRand
   to RMH shareholders by way of a distribution in specie. Following the
   implementation of the RMH Unbundling, RMH will remain listed, with its property
   portfolio as its sole remaining asset.

   The purpose of this announcement is to provide Remgro Shareholders with
   detailed information regarding the implementation of the Remgro Unbundling.

2. Rationale

   Remgro constantly evaluates the optimal composition of its investment portfolio
   to ensure that it remains an attractive and appropriately rated permanent
   capital investment vehicle for investors. It is important to Remgro to ensure
   that the portfolio composition is shaped by a long-term perspective on
   shareholder value creation. Key considerations in this context include the
   level of maturity, independence and the size of an investment relative to the
   size of the overall Remgro portfolio.
   
   As RMH has developed into a large, mature, independently run business of scale
   with an overweight contribution to the Remgro portfolio, Remgro is of the
   opinion that the Remgro Unbundling will unlock significant value for Remgro
   Shareholders. The Remgro Unbundling also presents an opportunity to rebalance
   the maturity of Remgro's remaining investment portfolio, as well as the
   relative contribution of the remaining portfolio investments to enable greater
   impact and shareholder value creation.

   The Remgro Unbundling has significant benefits for Remgro Shareholders,
   including, inter alia:
    -   Reducing the underlying discount to net asset value that the Remgro shares
        currently trade at by reducing the three listed entry points into the
        underlying operations via FirstRand, RMH and Remgro;
    -   Giving Remgro Shareholders direct access to RMH shares and the dividends
        payable in respect thereof; and
    -   Enabling Remgro Shareholders to participate in the RMH Unbundling pursuant
        to which FirstRand shares will be distributed to them.

   Remgro's direct 3.9% interest in FirstRand will be retained to provide
   additional balance sheet capacity that will support growth in Remgro’s existing
   portfolio, as well as its ability to pursue new opportunities that may arise.

3. Key terms of the Remgro Unbundling

   Remgro will distribute all its RMH Shares (comprising 397,447,747 ordinary
   shares) (the ""Unbundled RMH Shares"") on a pro-rata basis to all the Remgro
   Shareholders as a dividend in specie.

   Remgro Shareholders will receive 0.69939 Unbundled RMH Shares for every 1
   Remgro share held on the Record Date (as defined in paragraph 11 below). The
   transfer of the Unbundled RMH Shares will result in fractional entitlements,
   which is explained in more detail in paragraph 4 below.

   The Remgro Unbundling will result in Remgro Shareholders holding a direct
   interest in RMH. As direct shareholders of RMH, Remgro Shareholders will be
   entitled to participate in the RMH Unbundling.

   The detailed tax implications of the Remgro Unbundling are set out in paragraph
   9 below.

4. Fractional entitlements, cash proceeds and applicable rate

   In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, fractional entitlements will
   be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The aggregated excess fractions
   of the Unbundled RMH Shares to which Remgro Shareholders will remain entitled,
   will be sold in the market, on the Remgro Shareholders’ behalf, as soon as
   practicable after the Remgro Unbundling. The cash proceeds of the sale of the
   fractional entitlements (""Cash Proceeds"") will be paid to the relevant Remgro
   Shareholders on the basis set out below, net of any applicable taxes (such as
   Securities Transfer Tax (""STT"")) and costs.

   Cash Proceeds due to Remgro Shareholders will be determined at a 10% discount
   to the VWAP of RMH Shares on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (""JSE"") on
   Wednesday, 3 June 2020, being the day on which Remgro shares will begin to
   trade 'ex' the entitlement to receive the Unbundled RMH Shares. The actual
   price used to calculate the Cash Proceeds will be announced on SENS on Thursday,
   4 June 2020, by 11h00.

5. Financial effects

   Based on Remgro’s unaudited results for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
   the pro forma financial effects of the Remgro Unbundling on the earnings per
   share (""EPS""); diluted EPS, headline earnings per share (""HEPS""); diluted HEPS,
   HEPS, excluding option remeasurement, diluted HEPS, excluding option
   remeasurement; net asset value per share (""NAV""); net tangible asset value per
   share (""NTAV"") and intrinsic NAV per share (""INAV"") of Remgro, are set out
   below.

   These financial effects are prepared for illustrative purposes only to assist
   Remgro Shareholders to assess the impact of the Remgro Unbundling but, because
   of their nature, may not give a fair presentation of the effect of the Remgro
   Unbundling on Remgro’s results of operations.

   The summarised pro forma financial effects have been prepared in a manner
   consistent in all respects with International Financial Reporting Standards
   (""IFRS""), the accounting policies adopted by Remgro as at 31 December 2019 and
   the JSE Listings Requirements. The summarised pro forma financial effects have
   not been audited, or reported on, by Remgro’s auditors or reporting
   accountants.

   The pro forma financial effects are the responsibility of the Board. The
   material assumptions used in the preparation of the pro forma financial effects
   are set out in the notes following the table below.

Notes:
1.     The pro forma financial effects are based on the unaudited financial
       results of Remgro for the six months ended 31 December 2019. The
       financial impact on the earnings of Remgro are illustrated as if the
       Remgro Unbundling had been completed on 1 July 2019, while the impact
       on the net assets of Remgro are shown as if the Remgro Unbundling had
       been implemented on 31 December 2019.
2.     The following common assumptions have been used in the calculation of
       the pro forma financial information:
          a. A FirstRand share price of R62.80 at 31 December 2019; and
          b. An RMH share price of R80.44 at 31 December 2019.
3.     As a result of the Remgro Unbundling, Remgro ceases to have significant
       influence in FirstRand and would therefore have to derecognise its
       FirstRand equity accounted investment and account for it as a financial
       asset at fair value through other comprehensive income (the “FirstRand
       Reclassification”). The pro forma income statement effects represent
       the dividends received from FirstRand and the reversal of Remgro's
       attributable portion of FirstRand’s and RMH’s equity accounted earnings
       for the six months ended 31 December 2019, as well as the profit realised
       on the Remgro Unbundling and FirstRand Reclassification
4.     The statement of financial position effects represent the profit
       realised on the Remgro Unbundling and FirstRand Reclassification as
       described above, as well as the dividend in specie.
5.     The financial effects set out above have been prepared based on IFRS
       and interpretations of IFRS applicable at 31 December 2019.

6. Information relating to RMH

   RMH is an investment holding company with a track record of investing in
   disruptive and entrepreneurial financial services businesses.

   RMH was listed on the JSE in 1992 as a vehicle to allow investors to co-invest
   with the founders of Rand Merchant Bank, and since then has played a significant
   role in the establishment and growth of some of South Africa’s most iconic
   financial services businesses, including FirstRand, Discovery, Momentum
   Metropolitan and OUTsurance.

   In 2011, RMH's insurance interests (Discovery, Momentum Metropolitan and
   OUTsurance) were separately listed as Rand Merchant Investment Holdings
   Limited. Since then RMH has been an investment vehicle into FirstRand, one of
   South Africa’s most successful financial services groups. RMH is the largest
   shareholder in FirstRand.

   During July 2016 RMH expanded its investment strategy to include a property
   investment business alongside its 34% investment in FirstRand. This involved
   establishing a diversified portfolio of scalable entrepreneur-led businesses
   with proven track records in managing and growing property portfolios.

   For further detailed information on RMH, Remgro Shareholders are referred to
   the annual report of RMH for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 and the
   unaudited interim results of RMH for the six-month period ended 31 December
   2019, both of which can be accessed on RMH's website (www.rmh-online.co.za).

7. Condition precedent

   The implementation of the Remgro Unbundling is subject to the fulfilment, or
   waiver, as the case may be, of the condition precedent that by no later than
   30 April 2020 the Ontario Securities Commission has granted an exemption from
   the prospectus requirement of section 53 of the Securities Act (Ontario) in
   connection with the Remgro Unbundling.

8. Exchange Control Regulation

   The Unbundled RMH Shares are not freely transferable from the common monetary
   area and must be dealt with in terms of the South African Exchange Control
   Regulations, 1961 (as amended) (""Exchange Control Regulations""). The following
   summary of the Exchange Control Regulations is intended as a guide only and
   is not a comprehensive statement of the Exchange Control Regulations or advice.
   Remgro Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding the Exchange Control
   Regulations should contact their own professional advisers. This summary is
   based on the laws and regulations as in force and as applied in practice as
   at the date hereof and is subject to changes to those laws and regulations and
   practices subsequent to such date.

   8.1 Emigrants from the Common Monetary Area consisting of South Africa, the
   Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and eSwatini (""CMA"")

   Any share certificates that may be issued by RMH to emigrants from the CMA
   will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange Control
   Regulations.
   
   Uncertificated Unbundled RMH Shares will be credited directly to the emigrants’
   respective emigrant share accounts at the CSDP or broker controlling their
   remaining portfolios and an appropriate electronic entry will be made in the
   relevant register reflecting a “non-resident” endorsement. The CSDP or broker
   will ensure that the emigrant adheres to the Exchange Control Regulations.

   Any Unbundled RMH Shares and/or securities issued in certificated form, cash
   dividends and residual cash payments based on emigrants’ Unbundled RMH Shares
   and/or securities controlled in terms of the Exchange Control Regulations will
   be forwarded to the authorised dealer in foreign exchange controlling their
   remaining assets.

   8.2 Residents outside of the CMA

   Any share certificates that may be issued by RMH to non-residents of the CMA
   will be endorsed ""non-resident"" in accordance with the Exchange Control
   Regulations.

   Uncertificated Unbundled RMH Shares and/or securities will be credited directly
   to the non-resident’s non-resident share accounts at the CSDP or broker
   controlling their portfolios and an appropriate electronic entry will be made
   in the relevant register reflecting a ""non-resident"" endorsement. The CSDP or
   broker will ensure that the non-resident adheres to the Exchange Control
   Regulations.

   Any Cash Proceeds payable to non-resident Remgro Shareholders in relation to
   their fractional entitlements are freely transferable from South Africa,
   subject to being converted into a currency other than Rand or paid for the
   credit of a non-resident Rand account.

9. Taxation

   The following summary describes the tax consequences of the Remgro Unbundling
   that may apply to Remgro Shareholders generally. This summary is based on the
   laws as in force and as applied in practice as at the date hereof and is
   subject to changes to those laws and practices subsequent to such date.

   In the case of persons who are non-residents of South Africa for tax purposes,
   this summary should be read in conjunction with the provisions of any
   applicable double tax agreement between South Africa and their country of
   residence. Remgro and its advisers cannot be held responsible for the taxation
   consequences that the Remgro Unbundling may have on individual Remgro
   Shareholders and therefore if you are in any doubt about your tax position you
   should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser.

   The Remgro Unbundling will constitute a disposal by Remgro of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares to Remgro Shareholders. It is intended that the disposal will be
   implemented in terms of section 46 of the Income Tax Act, which allows for a
   tax neutral implementation of the Remgro Unbundling from an income tax, Capital
   Gains Tax (""CGT""), dividend tax and STT perspective, including the following
   concessions for Shareholders:

   9.1 Remgro shares held as trading stock

   Remgro Shareholders holding Remgro shares as trading stock will be deemed to
   acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as trading stock through a dividend in specie
   that must be disregarded for dividends tax purposes. The distribution must
   also not be treated as a return of capital for the purposes of paragraph 76B
   of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

   The original expenditure incurred in respect of the Remgro shares will be
   apportioned between the Unbundled RMH Shares and the Remgro shares based on a
   ratio that is determined with reference to the respective closing prices of
   the shares in RMH and Remgro on the first business day after the LDT Date (as
   defined in paragraph 11 below).

   9.2 Remgro shares held as capital assets

   Remgro Shareholders holding Remgro shares as capital assets will be deemed to
   acquire the Unbundled RMH Shares as capital assets through a dividend in specie
   that must be disregarded for dividends tax purposes. The distribution must
   also not be treated as a return of capital for the purposes of paragraph 76B
   of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

   The CGT 'base cost' of the Remgro shares in the hands of Remgro Shareholders
   immediately before the Remgro Unbundling will be apportioned between the
   Unbundled RMH Shares and the Remgro shares based on a ratio that is determined
   with reference to the respective closing prices of the shares in RMH and Remgro
   on the first business day after the LDT Date (as defined in paragraph 11
   below).

   Remgro Shareholders will be deemed to have acquired the Unbundled RMH Shares
   on the date on which the Remgro shares were originally acquired.

   9.3 Apportionment ratios to be used

   Remgro will advise Remgro Shareholders of the relevant apportionment ratios
   to be used to determine their tax cost bases in the Remgro shares and the
   Unbundled RMH Shares by way of an announcement to be released on SENS on the
   second business day after the LDT Date (as defined in paragraph 11 below).

   These ratios must be used in the determination of any income or capital gains
   or losses (as the case may be), derived on any future disposals of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares or Remgro shares.

10. Foreign Shareholders

   The following summary describes the restrictions applicable to Remgro
   Shareholders in terms of the Remgro Unbundling who have registered addresses
   outside South Africa and/or who are nationals, citizens or residents of
   countries other than South Africa (""Overseas Shareholders"") or who are persons
   (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) who have a
   contractual or legal obligation to forward this announcement to a jurisdiction
   outside South Africa, or who hold Remgro shares for the account or benefit of
   any such Overseas Shareholder and will therefore hold RMH in a similar manner
   and hence may have an impact on Remgro Shareholders.

   The Remgro Unbundling will be implemented as a pro-rata distribution in specie
   for no consideration to all Remgro Shareholders recorded as such in the
   register of Remgro on the Record Date.

   It is the responsibility of any Overseas Shareholder (including, without
   limitation, nominees, agents and trustees for such persons) being notified by
   this announcement of the Remgro Unbundling and wishing to have their Unbundled
   RMH Shares transferred to them in terms of the Remgro Unbundling to satisfy
   themselves in respect of the applicable laws in their territory, including
   obtaining any requisite governmental or other consents, observing any other
   requisite laws, requirements or formalities and paying any issue, transfer or
   other taxes due in such territories.

   Accordingly, persons (including, without limitation, nominees, agents and
   trustees) being notified in terms of this announcement should not distribute
   or send the announcement to any person in, or citizen or resident of, or
   otherwise into any jurisdiction where to do so would or might contravene
   applicable law or regulation, including local securities laws or regulations.
   Any person who does distribute this announcement into any such territory
   (whether under a contractual or legal obligation or otherwise) should draw the
   recipient’s attention to the contents of this paragraph.

   Remgro reserves the right, but shall not be obliged, to treat as invalid any
   transfer of Unbundled RMH Shares in terms of the Remgro Unbundling, which
   appears to Remgro or its agents to have been executed, effected or dispatched
   in a manner which may involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations
   of any jurisdiction; or if Remgro believes (in its discretion) or its agents
   believe that the same may violate applicable legal or regulatory requirements;
   or if Remgro believes (in its discretion) that it is prohibited or unduly
   onerous or impractical to transfer the RMH Shares to such Overseas Shareholder
   in terms of the Remgro Unbundling.

   If an Overseas Shareholder is of the view that the transfer of the Unbundled
   RMH Shares in terms of the Remgro Unbundling to such Overseas Shareholder may
   involve a breach of the securities laws or regulations or violate applicable
   legal or regulatory requirements, such Overseas Shareholder must as soon as
   reasonably practicable notify their CSDP or broker of such fact or
   circumstance.

   Remgro shall be entitled (in its discretion), including in either of the
   aforementioned instances, to do all things necessary or desirable to ensure
   compliance with applicable law and/or regulation including selling the
   Unbundled RMH Shares that would otherwise have been transferred to the Overseas
   Shareholder under the Remgro Unbundling on behalf of the Overseas Shareholder
   and at their risk, with the net proceeds of such sale (after deduction of any
   applicable taxes which may in this instance include STT, withholdings or costs)
   to be paid to the Overseas Shareholder. In this regard, the Unbundled RMH
   Shares may be aggregated and disposed of on the JSE in an orderly manner by
   the Remgro transfer secretaries on behalf of and for the benefit of such
   Overseas Shareholders as soon as is reasonably practical after the
   implementation of the Remgro Unbundling at the best price that can reasonably
   be obtained at the time of sale.

REMGRO’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

The majority of South African Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are experiencing financial and
operational stress due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent lockdown, further exacerbating the lack
of economic growth.

The Remgro Management Board has voluntarily decided to forego 30% of their salary for the months
of April, May and June 2020. The savings to the Company generated from this reduction in salaries will
be paid by the Company to the Sukuma Relief Programme, an initiative aimed at supporting SMEs, and
administered by Business Partners Limited.

FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on 19 November 2019, 7 January 2020 and 18 February 2020 relating, inter alia, to
the proposed distribution by RMB Holdings Limited (""RMH"") of its FirstRand Limited
(""FirstRand"") shares to RMH shareholders (""RMH Distribution”) as part of a restructuring of the
RMH portfolio of assets and liabilities (“the RMH Restructuring”) and the in-principle decision
by Remgro to pursue the distribution, in full or in part, to its shareholders of Remgro's exposure
to RMH and FirstRand (the ""Remgro Distribution"").

Shareholders are further referred to the RMH announcement released concurrently with this
announcement in which RMH advised its shareholders that, although still committed to the
RMH Restructuring, given the unprecedented market turmoil being experienced in South Africa
and globally as a result of Covid-19, the RMH Board is currently assessing the optimal timing
and detailed transaction steps required to give effect to the RMH Restructuring.

Remgro is supportive of the RMH Board’s process to finalise the terms of the RMH
Restructuring under these circumstances.

With regards to the Remgro Distribution, and having taken cognisance of the current market
conditions, the Remgro Board has resolved that it will, subject to the relevant regulatory
approvals, proceed with the full distribution of its 28.2% interest in RMH to its shareholders.
The Remgro Board has further resolved to retain its 3.9% direct interest in FirstRand in order
to provide additional balance sheet capacity to support growth in Remgro’s existing portfolio
and its ability to pursue new opportunities that may arise.

Remgro will publish the detailed terms of the Remgro Distribution by no later than 14 April
2020 and shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
company’s securities, until a detailed announcement is made.

SALIENT FEATURES

• Headline earnings per share, excluding option remeasurement: +2.4% to 750.7 cents
• Earnings per share: -57.9% to 766.3 cents
• Intrinsic net asset value per share as at 31 December 2019: R240.93
• Interim dividend per share sustained: 215 cents

RESULTS

Introduction
Shareholders are reminded that this report is based on the actual results for the six months ended 31 December 2019.
Therefore, this report does not reflect the current market conditions and must be read in that context.

Headline earnings
For the period under review, headline earnings decreased by 0.4% from R4 259 million to R4 242 million, while headline
earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 0.2% from 752.1 cents to 750.9 cents.

Included in headline earnings for the period under review is a positive fair value adjustment amounting to R1 million
(2018: R106 million), relating to the decrease in value of the bondholders’ exchange option of the exchangeable bonds
(option remeasurement). Excluding the option remeasurement, headline earnings increased by 2.1% from
R4 153 million to R4 241 million, whereas HEPS increased by 2.4% from 733.4 cents to 750.7 cents. The increase in
headline earnings, excluding option remeasurement, is mainly due to higher earnings from Mediclinic International plc,
Siqalo Foods Proprietary Limited, the banking platform and Total South Africa Proprietary Limited. The increase is
partly offset by lower contributions from Community Investment Ventures Holdings Proprietary Limited, Rand Merchant
Investment Holdings Limited and Grindrod Limited, as well as lower interest income.

INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE

Remgro’s intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 3.4% from R233.03 at 30 June 2019 to R240.93 at
31 December 2019. The closing share price at 31 December 2019 was R195.00 (30 June 2019: R187.90) representing
a discount of 19.1% (30 June 2019: 19.4%) to the intrinsic net asset value.

DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 39

Notice is hereby given that an interim gross dividend of 215 cents (2018: 215 cents) per share has been declared out
of income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par
value, for the six months ended 31 December 2019.

A dividend withholding tax of 20% or 43 cents per share will be applicable, resulting in a net dividend of 172 cents per
share, unless the shareholder concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced
rate in terms of an applicable double-tax agreement.

The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares.
The income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 15 April 2020, and Friday,

In terms of the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation, dividends will only be transferred electronically to the bank
accounts of shareholders, while dividend cheques are no longer issued. In the instance where shareholders do not
provide the Transfer Secretaries with their banking details, the dividend will not be forfeited, but will be marked as
“unclaimed” in the share register until the shareholder provides the Transfer Secretaries with the relevant banking details
for payout.

RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service on 19 November 2019 and on 7 January 2020 relating, inter alia, to the proposed
distribution by RMB Holdings Limited (""RMH"") of its FirstRand Limited (""FirstRand"") shares to
RMH shareholders (""RMH Distribution"") and the corresponding proposed distribution by
Remgro, in full or in part, of Remgro's exposure to RMH and FirstRand, to Remgro
shareholders (""Remgro Distribution"").

CHANGE IN FUNCTION OF DIRECTORS

In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, the following information is disclosed:

On 28 November 2019 the Remgro Board of directors appointed
Mr Fred Robertson, a current Remgro independent non-executive
director, as co-deputy chairman with Mr Josua Malherbe, who is the
current deputy chairman.

It was the Company's previously stated intention (per the Stock
Exchange News Service announcement dated 19 September 2019) to
amend its Board Charter to provide for only one deputy chairman.
On reflection, Remgro has determined that Mr Robertson will bring
valuable insight, skills and experience to the deputy chairman
role. The Board Charter will accordingly remain unchanged.

Mr Phillip Jabulani Moleketi has been appointed as a member of the
Remuneration   and   Nomination   Committee   with   effect   from
28 November 2019.

Mr Gideon Gabriel Nieuwoudt has been appointed as a member of the
Investment Committee with effect from 28 November 2019.
