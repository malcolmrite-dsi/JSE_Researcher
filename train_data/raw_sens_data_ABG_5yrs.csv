ABSA GROUP LIMITED – BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2020

This Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group) and
Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group’s regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-     The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-     Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not
      superseded by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.



1. Key prudential metrics and RWA


In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage positions of the Group and the Bank in this document are reflected on a
regulatory basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded). However, the capital and leverage positions of the Group are also managed
on a statutory basis (which includes unappropriated profits). The summary table below provides key capital adequacy and liquidity information on both
a regulatory and statutory basis as at 30 September 2020. As at 30 September 2020 all profits in the Group and Bank were appropriated, with the
result that regulatory and statutory basis were identical.

Capital
-     The Group’s CET1 capital position was well above minimum regulatory requirements as at 30 September 2020 and within the Board target range
      of 11 - 12%.
-     Group RWAs decreased by R14.6bn from R935.7bn to R921.1bn from June 2020 to September 2020 mainly within the Absa Regional Operations.
      This was driven by rand strength combined with the impact of the Group deploying more of its surplus liquidity into low risk securities rather than
      deposits with banks.
-     Group CET1 capital increased by R1.3bn due to higher capital supply supported by improved profitability. At a total capital level, this was offset
      by a decrease in Tier 2 capital of R1.5bn post the call of subordinated debt during September 2020.
-     The Bank leverage ratio has decreased marginally from June 2020. This is due to an increase in leverage exposure as a result of balance sheet
      growth mainly in investment securities and loans to customers which was partially offset by improvements in capital supply. The Group leverage
      ratio remained flat due to additional capital supply generated by Group entities.




                                                                                                                                       
Liquidity
-     The liquidity risk position of the Group is in line with risk appetite, and well above the minimum regulatory requirements.
-     The Group liquidity coverage ratio increased to 139% (June 2020: 127%) as the liquidity resources of the Group strengthened over the third
      quarter of the year and included Absa Bank investing in alternative forms of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as the Bank reduces reliance on
      the committed liquidity facility (CLF), in line with the phase out requirements set out by the Prudential Authority.
-     The Group net stable funding ratio strengthened to 119% (June 2020: 117%) with strong core deposit growth from retail and corporate clients.




1.2 KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)
In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an
incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory
capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5 issued by the Prudential Authority. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of
the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on a transitional basis.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2020



Shareholders are advised that due to the significant uncertainty created by the covid-19 pandemic and
economic downturn, Absa Group will host a market update today. It will include the following update on the
Group’s financial performance for the first nine months of 2020 and guidance on its 2020 earnings.



Trading update

The Group experienced the following financial trends for the first nine months of 2020, on a normalised
basis:

Revenue growth was similar to the 3% increase in the first half.

The Rand was 11% weaker year-on-year (YoY) than our Absa Regional Operations (ARO) currencies for
the period, in line with the first half’s 12%.

In line with our guidance, the growth in gross Group loans slowed slightly to 5% YoY. In South Africa, Retail
and Business Banking (RBB) and Corporate and Investment Bank’s (CIB) gross loans grew 3% and 5%
respectively YoY, while ARO increased 11%.

Overall deposit growth was in line with the first half at 15% YoY, with particularly strong third quarter growth
from Relationship Banking and CIB in South Africa, while Retail in South Africa grew 11% YoY. The Group
liquidity coverage ratio averaged 139% in the third quarter.

Net interest income growth for the first nine months was similar to the first half’s 6% YoY. Given strong
growth in average interest bearing assets in the third quarter, our net interest margin for the nine months
declined to 4.13% from 4.23% in the first half. Lower rates were a drag, although the structural hedge
released over R700m in the third quarter. Balance sheet construct was the main cause of the third quarter
margin compression, as substantial surplus liquidity was placed into low-margin government bonds and
loans to banks. Moreover, low-margin deposit growth was strong, while higher margin loans declined and
mortgages increased.



                                                                                                    
Our non-interest income trajectory for the first nine months improved slightly from the 2% decline in the
first half. Although fee and commission income recovered strongly from the weak second quarter, it
remained down YoY in the third quarter and below first quarter levels, particularly in RBB South Africa.
While net insurance premium income grew by high single digits YoY for the first nine months, claims
increased in the third quarter due to higher mortality and credit life claims. Trading revenue in Global
Markets grew substantially for the period, and was strong in the third quarter, particularly in South Africa
off a low base.

Operating expenses remain very well managed, decreasing by a similar amount for the nine months to the
first half’s 2% decline. Headcount fell by 1200 year-to-date, while performance costs dropped substantially
YoY during the nine months. South African costs declined YoY, while ARO’s increased due to incremental
run costs after separating from Barclays PLC.

Lower operating expenses supported positive JAWS for the nine months similar to the 5% recorded in the
first half, despite the modest YoY revenue growth. As a result, our cost-to-income ratio improved noticeably
YoY, and YoY pre-provision profit growth for the nine months was the same as the first half’s 9%.

Credit impairments for the nine months trebled YoY given the substantial first half charge. However, third
quarter credit impairments were better than expected, with a credit loss ratio slightly above the 100 basis
point top end of our through-the-cycle target range. As a result, the credit loss ratio for the nine months
improved to 219 basis points from the first half’s 277 basis points. No material adjustments were made to
the substantial macroeconomic variable coverage built in the first half.

RBB South Africa’s third quarter credit loss ratio increased substantially YoY, although it improved
noticeably from the first half, particularly in mortgages. Of the R154bn in payment relief granted to RBB
South Africa customers, 24% by value extended payment relief when it expired. Of the R116bn in RBB
South Africa relief book that expired, 91% are paying and 9% have missed one or more payments. Missed
payments on the expired payment relief book are lowest in Relationship Banking and home loans at 4%
and 8% respectively, and higher in unsecured. As part of the government loan guarantee scheme R1.8bn
in business loans have been approved, from R0.5bn at 30 June 2020.

CIB South Africa’s third quarter credit loss ratio was below CIB’s through-the-cycle target range of 20 to 30
basis points. Its lending subject to payment relief increased to R38bn from R37bn at 30 June 2020.

While ARO’s credit charge improved in the third quarter, it doubled YoY. CIB ARO’s payment relief loans
increased to R15bn from R11bn at 30 June 2020. In Retail outside of South Africa, 13% of the payment
relief granted was extended, while 5% of the portfolio that expired has missed a payment.



                                                                                                  
The Group delinquency profile and non-performing loans deteriorated slightly in the third quarter. Stage 2
loans increased to 11.6% from 10.0% at 30 June 2020, while stage 3 increased to 5.89% from 5.65%,
despite CIB South Africa and ARO improving. RBB South Africa’s stage 3 loans rose, largely due to
personal loans. The group’s balance sheet credit provisions as a proportion of loans was 4.62% at 30
September 2020, from 4.46% at 30 June 2020.

As a result of these factors, the group’s return on equity for the first nine months was more than double
the first half’s 2.6%, as the third quarter return on equity improved to low double digits.

The Group common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio increased to 11.3% at 30 September 2020, within the board
target range of 11% to 12%, and its net asset value per share grew 6% YoY.

Focusing on our third quarter, YoY revenue and cost growth were similar to the first half, producing positive
JAWS. Credit impairments improved noticeably from the first half, but were still substantially higher YoY,
although the credit loss ratio was only slightly above the group’s through-the-cycle range. The group’s
return on equity improved considerably to low double digits. Division-wise, RBB South Africa’s revenue
declined, albeit far less than its costs, and its credit impairments increased substantially, although its credit
loss ratio improved noticeably from the first half. CIB South Africa’s substantial YoY revenue growth off a
low base, together with lower costs and credit impairments produced a strong third quarter. Meanwhile,
incremental run costs after separating from Barclays and substantially higher credit impairments YoY
dampened ARO’s third quarter performance.

Most of these third quarter trends continued into October.




Outlook and trading statement

Our latest forecast is for South Africa’s real GDP to fall 8.7% this year and grow 2.6% next year. We expect
another 25 basis point cut in South Africa’s prime rate today, although this remains finely balanced.
Thereafter, it is likely to remain flat until a 25 basis point increase in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a whole,
our ARO markets’ real GDP is expected to be largely flat this year, well below our pre-Covid-19 forecast of
5.7% growth and slightly lower than our estimate of 0.9% in August. We see limited scope for further large
rate cuts across the ARO portfolio.

Excluding any further major unforeseen political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, our 2020
guidance is as follows:

The Group’s net interest margin is expected to decline noticeably this year, with the second half lower,
largely due to a change in balance sheet construct. Annual revenue sensitivity to further rate cuts in South

                                                                                                      
Africa is a R250m reduction per 50 basis points. Despite the expected reduction in margin, YoY net interest
income growth in the second half is expected to be similar to the first half growth.

Loan growth should slow in the second half, while deposits are expected to grow far faster than loans.

Operating expenses are expected to decline YoY, producing positive JAWS, although pre-provision profit
growth is likely to slow slightly from the first half.

The credit loss ratio for the full year is expected to exceed global financial crisis levels. The second half
credit loss ratio is likely to improve noticeably compared to the first half, but remain above the through-the-
cycle range of 75 to 100 basis points.

The group’s return on equity is expected to remain well below cost of equity this year, although it is likely
to improve considerably in the second half.

With improved second half capital generation, the Group CET1 ratio is expected to remain resilient. Due
to our focus on preserving capital, we do not envisage declaring an ordinary dividend for 2020.

Shareholders are advised that Absa Group’s IFRS headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the year ending 31 December 2020 are expected to decline by more than 40% from the
2019 comparatives of 1750.1 cents and 1717.6 cents respectively. Normalised HEPS for the year is also
expected to decline by more than 40% from the 1926.0 cents for 2019. We will provide a more specific
guidance range once reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline has been obtained.



Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Absa Group’s auditors.

Editor’s Note:

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods
where the financial impact of separation is considered material.

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC Separation
A normalised view of the 2020 half-year results is provided which adjusts for the consequences of the separation from Barclays
PLC. This view better reflects the Group’s underlying performance. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
compliant financial results will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act and the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings
Requirements and include a reconciliation between the normalised and IFRS views. Normalised results will be presented for
future periods to the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is considered material.
The normalised results have not been prepared using the accounting policies of the Group and do not comply with IFRS. These
results are considered to be pro forma financial information, are presented for illustrative purposes only and have been presented
in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the SAICA Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information and any relevant
guidance issued by the IRBA. The normalised results have not been reviewed or reported on by the external auditors of the
Group and are the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors. Given its nature, the pro forma financial information may not
fairly present the Group’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows.

Declaration of dividends

In the current economic climate, capital conservation is regarded as paramount to the Group’s sustainability over the short to
medium term. The Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank (PA) has encouraged the boards of directors of banks
to ensure that capital conservation takes priority over any distributions of dividends on ordinary shares. As a result of this
guidance from the PA and the Board’s view as to the need for capital conservation and the appropriate management of capital at
this time, no interim dividend for the period ended 30 June 2020 has been declared by the Group.

TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

In accordance with section 3.4(b) of the JSE Listings Requirements, and updating Absa Group’s trading
statement published on 26 May 2020, shareholders are advised that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty regarding our financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (1H20).
The Group’s normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) for 1H20 is expected to be between 80%
and 85% lower than the 977.5 cents for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (the “comparative period”).
On an IFRS basis, 1H20 HEPS and earnings per share are expected to decline by between 92% and
97% from the comparative period’s 920.0 and 918.9 cents, respectively.
In line with our recent trading statement, the Covid-19 pandemic, national lockdowns and weak economy
during the first half had a material impact on customer loan and transaction volumes, while significantly
lower policy rates reduced our net interest margin, despite protection from our structural hedge.
Consequently, 1H20 revenue growth slowed to low single digit year-on-year. Operating expenses
reduced from the comparative period, producing positive JAWS and high single digit pre-provision profit
growth, with an improved cost-to-income ratio for the half. However, credit impairments were four times
higher, resulting in a credit loss ratio of 2.77% from 0.79% in the comparative period. Half of the increase
reflects judgmental macro-economic overlays, which strengthened stage 1 and 2 loan coverage
materially. Based on our current expectations, credit impairments should decrease significantly in the
second half of 2020. Absa Group’s balance sheet remains resilient, with an 11.0% common equity tier 1
ratio at 30 June 2020, together with strong levels of liquidity and an 85% loans-to-deposits and debt
securities ratio.
We will announce 1H20 results on 24 August 2020. Details of our results presentation are available at:

Shareholders are advised that the information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for periods where
the financial impact of separation is considered material.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE FOR THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF 2020 AND TRADING
STATEMENT FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2020



Shareholders are advised that Absa Group will host a market update today, given the significant uncertainty
created by the covid-19 pandemic and economic downturn. It will include the following update on the
group’s financial performance for the first four months of 2020 and guidance on its first half 2020 earnings
and outlook for the full year.



Trading update

The covid-19 pandemic started as a public health crisis, but has triggered an unprecedented disruption of
markets and economies worldwide. Our response has been guided by the principles of wanting to ensure
the health and safety of our staff, to support our customers and to ensure the resilience of our franchise
from an operational and financial perspective. We have also been involved in humanitarian efforts to
support vulnerable communities across all the markets in which we operate.

Although Absa Group’s earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were somewhat impacted by covid-19 towards
the end of March, our return on equity was slightly lower than the comparative period in 2019, and we were
on track to achieve the guidance we had issued.

However, the national lockdown in South Africa had a substantial impact on our financial performance in
April 2020 and accordingly affecting the first four months of the year.

The Group experienced the following financial trends for the first four months of 2020:

We had some benefit from a weaker Rand versus currencies in our Absa Regional Operations (ARO). On
average, the Rand was 8% weaker than our ARO currencies during the period versus the comparable
period in 2019.

Despite slowing materially in April, the year-on-year growth in customer loans to 30 April 2020 was low
double digit, while customer deposit growth was in the high teens. Group customer loans declined slightly
month-on-month in April, across Retail and Business Banking (RBB) SA, Corporate and Investment Bank
(CIB) and ARO.


                                                                                                 Page 1 of 4
Absa Group’s net interest margin declined year-on-year, due to the rate cuts in South Africa and most of
our ARO markets. Net interest income growth was high single digits year-on-year, but is expected to slow.

Non-interest revenue growth was mid-single digit year-on-year, despite RBB SA declining due to
substantially reduced transaction volumes during the national lockdown. There was a material decline in
RBB SA’s fee income in April, with ATM volumes, bancassurance sales, card turnover and point of sale
volumes decreasing significantly month-on-month. However, there are signs of some recovery in
transactional volumes in May, as parts of the economy gradually re-open.

CIB’s non-interest income for the period increased, with strong Markets revenue growth off a low base.
Markets corporate client flows reduced noticeably in April while institutional flows remained intact.

Operating expenses were well contained, producing positive JAWS for the first four months and strong pre-
provision profit growth.

However, credit impairments for the period doubled year-on-year, with large increases in personal loans
and credit cards. The Group credit loss ratio was similar to 2009 financial year levels of 1.7%, well above
our through-the-cycle target range. The substantial increase in credit impairments occurred largely in April.

Consequently, Absa Group’s return on equity for the first four months fell materially year-on-year.



Trading statement

It is difficult to provide guidance for the rest of the year, given the significant uncertainty about the impact
of covid-19, national lockdowns and the macroeconomic outlook. These have a material impact on
customer loan and transaction volumes and credit impairments, in particular.

We currently expect South Africa’s real GDP to fall 10% and our ARO portfolio to decline slightly on
average. We expect lower average policy rates for 2020 across the board. Based on these assumptions,
and excluding further major unforeseen political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, our guidance
for 2020 is as follows:

We see limited customer loan growth year-on-year and customer deposits are likely to increase by more
than customer loans.

The 275 basis points (bp) lower interest rates in South Africa is expected to reduce the group’s net interest
income by approximately R1.6bn in 2020, after factoring in the meaningful benefit of its structural hedge.
We believe there could be another 50bp rate cut in South Africa this year. The annual sensitivity to further
rate cuts in South Africa is a R250m reduction per 50bp.

Revenue growth is expected to slow from the first four months, reflecting reduced customer loan production
and transactional activity on the back of the impact of the lockdowns and negative GDP.



                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4
Operating expenses for the year are expected to decline slightly year-on-year, reflecting a hiring freeze,
lower short-term incentives, significant project reprioritization and material reductions in marketing spend.

On credit impairments, IFRS 9 requires the use of forward looking assumptions when determining the level
of provisions required. These assumptions have a basis in historical information, but will require additional
levels of management judgement in this unprecedented stressed environment.

Coverage is expected to significantly increase as the macroeconomic base case has deteriorated, resulting
in lower realizable collateral values, higher likelihood of default and a greater proportion of defaults
impacting significant increases in credit risk. Judgement regarding the financial health of clients will need
to be based on a multitude of factors.

To assist customers experiencing challenges as a result of covid-19, RBB SA launched a comprehensive
payment relief plan on 30 March 2020. It provides three months of payment relief across all credit products
for wealth, business bank, private bank and retail customers. Take up has been substantial and to date we
have provided R8bn of payment relief over three months to 398 thousand customers on 584 thousand
accounts, covering R146bn of customer loans.

We expect a significant increase in credit impairments this year, to well above the Group’s through-the-
cycle target range of 75bp to 100bp. Given the substantial uncertainty, we will provide additional disclosure
on the judgements we have made and more guidance on the Group’s likely credit impairment for the year
when we report first half results on 24 August 2020.

Absa Group’s return on equity for 2020 is likely to decline materially from last year’s 15.8%.

We expect the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to remain resilient. It may decrease to below our board
target range of 11% to 12% as a consequence of the crisis; however, stress testing confirms that it should
remain well above regulatory requirements. Given our focus on preserving capital, we currently do not
envisage declaring an ordinary dividend for 2020.

Shareholders are advised that Absa Group’s IFRS headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per
share (EPS) for the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% below the
comparatives for the first half of 2019 of 920.0 cents and 918.9 cents, respectively. Normalised HEPS for
the six-month period ending 30 June 2020 is expected to be more than 20% lower than the normalised
HEPS of 977.5 cents for first half of 2019. We will provide a more specific guidance range once there is
reasonable certainty regarding the extent of the decline.

We are reviewing the Group’s medium-term financial targets and will update the market when there is
greater certainty in the macroeconomic outlook.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information contained in this trading update and trading
statement have not been reviewed or reported on by Absa Group’s auditors.

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods
where the financial impact of separation is considered material.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED – BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 31 MARCH 2020

This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group)
and Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group’s regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-       The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-       Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not
        superseded by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.



1.      Key prudential metrics and RWA
In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage position of the Group and the Bank in this document are reflected on a
regulatory basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded), and in accordance with IFRS accounting rules (which requires the impact of the
contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation to be included). However, the capital and leverage position of the Group is
also managed on a statutory, normalised basis (which includes unappropriated profits, and excludes the impact of the contribution amounts received
from Barclays PLC). The summary table below provides key capital adequacy and liquidity information on both normalised and statutory, IFRS basis as
at 31 March 2020.

Capital
The capital adequacy ratios remain strong, above the minimum regulatory requirements and within Board target range. Absa Group’s statutory CET1
ratio (calculated on a normalised basis) declined by 70bps over Q1 2020, driven by payment of the final 2019 dividend of R5.2bn or 55bps of the
decrease. Higher capital deductions due to higher valuation reserves and a higher available for sale reserve, together with the IFRS 9 transitional
adjustment contributed to the remaining reduction.
-   Capital demand increased by R69.4bn, of which R40bn related to Rand weakness. The increased capital demand due to currency movements was
    offset by R6bn additional supply from Absa Regional Operations (ARO) entities due to the weaker exchange rate.
-   Constant currency RWA growth of R29bn was primarily in Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) due to asset growth, probability of default (PD)
    migration and FX volatility. Counterparty credit risk and market risk were also a drag on consumption, given the market dislocation in March. An
    offset of R9bn came from the sale of the Edcon storecard book which concluded in February 2020.
-   Capital deductions reduced the capital ratio, as the stressed market environment in March resulted in a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in
    valuation reserves and available for sale reserve which increased from R0.6bn to R2.5bn combined.
-   The IFRS 9 phasing adjustment reduced capital supply by R0.9bn and will be fully phased in by 2021.
-   The Group redeemed R2.5bn and issued R2.7bn of Tier 2 capital during February 2020. The capital markets for further issuances are currently
    uncertain, although the Group has minimal redemptions for the remainder of 2020.
The leverage ratio (calculated on a normalised basis) has reduced from 7.0% to 6.6%. This is due to an increase in leverage exposures as the balance
sheet grew due to customer and interbank lending in combination with the weaker currency, which was only partially offset by a growth in Tier 1 capital.
In response to the COVID-19 stress, the Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 of 2020, which temporarily reduces the current Pillar 2A minimum capital
from 50bps at a CET1 level, 75bps at a Tier 1 level and 100bps at a total capital level to zero. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% has also been
made available for banks to utilize during the COVID-19 stress. The Prudential Authority Directive 2 of 2020 is effective from 6 April 2020.


Liquidity
-   The liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio remain strong, above the minimum regulatory requirements and within risk appetite.
-   The QoQ decrease in the liquidity coverage ratio from 134.4% to 120.8% was mainly attributable to an increase in net cash outflows as a result of
    wholesale funding clients reducing the duration of their deposits, given the stressed financial market conditions in March 2020. The Prudential
    Authority released Directive 1 of 2020, reducing the LCR minimum from 100% to 80% due to the COVID-19 market stress. The Prudential Authority
    Directive 1 of 2020 is effective from 1 April 2020.
-   The net stable funding ratio decreased slightly QoQ, from 112.7% to 112.1%, due to the above-mentioned shortening in duration of wholesale
    funding.

1.2   KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)
In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an
incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory
capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of the Group on a fully loaded basis, as
well as on a transitional basis.
The Prudential Authority have issued Directive 2 of 2020 which temporarily reduces Pillar 2A minimum capital requirement to zero. This relief is effective
from 6 April 2020; therefore, the disclosures below do not include the Pillar 2A reduction.

 (1)    The difference between the CET1 ratio on a transitional basis and the fully loaded ECL accounting model total capital ratio is less than 5bps, hence
        no difference is shown.
 (2)    The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (3)    The D-SIB add on is not required to be disclosed.
 (4)    The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank LCR and the LCR of ARO. For this purpose, a simple average of the relevant 3 month-
        end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Absa Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-day LCR
        observations.
 (5)    Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special-purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore holdings.
 (6)    The 2020 minimum regulatory capital requirement of 11.5% includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes the bank-specific individual capital
        requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestically systemically important bank (D-SIB) add-on. The Pillar 2A reduction of 100bps per the guidance
        in the SARB directives has not been taken into account in determining the minimum regulatory capital requirement above as this is only effective
        from 1 April 2020.
 (7)    SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (8)    Includes the operational risk floor.
 (9)    Excludes R3.57bn relating to IFRS9 RWA impact phase in.

        of the relevant 3 month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-
        day LCR observations.

Notes:
(1) The Group Chairman’s fees cover her chairmanship and membership of all Board committees and sub-committees (excluding the
Separation Oversight Committee), including the chairmanship of the boards of Absa Bank Limited and Absa Financial Services Limited.
(2) Executive directors of the Company do not receive fees as members of the Company Board and Board committees.
(3) The GACC, GRCMC, RemCo and SEC chairmen receive fees equal to two-and-a-half times (2.5x) the fee payable to the members of these
committees.
(4) The chairmen of Board committees and sub-committees other than the GACC, GRCMC, RemCo and SEC receive fees equal to twice the
fee payable to members of these committees.
(5) The fees indicated above are exclusive of VAT. Where applicable, VAT will be levied by the non-executive directors and such fees plus
VAT will be paid to the non-executive directors concerned (subject to the issue of a valid tax invoice reflecting fees plus VAT).
Motivation
The motivation for the amendment is that the Absa Group Board reconsidered the original
special resolution number 1 proposing an across-the-board 4.5% increase in non-executive
remuneration, in view of the prevailing situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and,
accordingly, resolved that no increase in non-executive remuneration is the appropriate and
responsible recommendation.

   DEALINGS BY ABSA GROUP DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

   In accordance with paragraph 3.63 of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are advised that the
   following ordinary shares have been awarded to executive directors, prescribed officers and the company
   secretary of Absa Group:

   1.     Absa Group Share Incentive Plan – Long-Term Performance Award

   The Share Incentive Plan – Long-Term Performance Award (Performance Share Award) is designed to
   incentivise long-term performance with vesting of awards subject to fulfilment of a combination of
   financial and non-financial Group performance targets measured over a three-year performance period.
   The awards were also considered in the context of moving a greater proportion of total remuneration into
   variable remuneration and, in this instance, longer term performance. For executive directors and the
   prescribed officers, this award will vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of
   the grant date subject to the achievement of the performance targets, and continued employment
   requirements as set out in the Plan Rules. Dividend equivalents may be added to the awards at the
   vesting of an award tranche in terms of the Scheme Rules and will be paid to the extent that the shares
   vest.

   The number of shares under the Performance Share Award was fixed with reference to the 20-day
   volume-weighted average price preceding the grant date (being 1 April 2020), which was the award date
   determined by the Absa Group Remuneration Committee. The quantum of the awards was determined
   having regard to 2019 Group performance and individual ability to support and influence the future
   execution of the Group strategy. The share awards were granted to the executive directors, prescribed
   officers and company secretary as set out in the table below. These awards have since been accepted
   on the date indicated below.

  2.    Absa Group Share Incentive Plan - Deferred Award
  In terms of our Remuneration Policy on incentive awards, executive directors and prescribed officers are
  obliged to defer 50% of the value of their total bonus into shares. In prior years, the deferral element
  comprised of a combination of deferred cash and shares. For 2019 awards onwards, all deferral is in the
  form of shares.

  The mechanism used for this is the Deferred Award, which is a conditional right to receive Absa Group
  shares. Dividend equivalents may be added to the Deferred Awards at the vesting of a Deferred Award
  tranche. The Deferred Award is subject to continued employment at date of vesting.

  The number of shares under the Deferred Awards (in respect of the 2019 financial year performance, and
  as already set out in our 2019 Remuneration Report) were fixed with reference to the 20-day volume-
  weighted average price preceding 1 April 2020 (the grant date). This table sets out the deferred
  incentives which were awarded under the Deferred Award and granted to the executive directors,
  prescribed officers and company secretary off market. Deferred Awards will vest in three equal tranches,
  on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date subject to the rules of the Share Incentive Plan
  (as amended from time to time). These awards have since been accepted on the date indicated below.

PAYMENT OF FINAL 2019 ORDINARY DIVIDEND


With reference to the Prudential Authority’s Guidance Note 4/2020, dated 6 April 2020,
shareholders are advised that Absa Group will pay a final ordinary dividend of 620 cents per
ordinary share for the period ended 31 December 2019.


We have consulted carefully with the Prudential Authority both before and after the issuance of
Guidance Note 4/2020 and have clarified with the Prudential Authority that we should continue
to pay our dividend declared on 11 March 2020. The Prudential Authority has confirmed that,
where governance processes have reached a point where there is a legal obligation to pay
dividends, banks should pay. We will, however, continue to carefully consider our capital and
funding position and the guidance note of the Prudential Authority for the 2020 year.


While the Board agrees with the need to conserve capital in the current environment, legal
advice confirms that a dividend must be paid after having been declared and communicated.
We also recognise that there are pensioners and other investors who have placed reliance on
our dividend declaration.


The final ordinary dividend for 2019 is payable to shareholders recorded in the register of
members of the Company at the close of business on 17 April 2020. It will be subject to local
dividends withholding tax at a rate of 20%. Shares will commence trading ex-dividend on
15 April 2020 and the payment date is 20 April 2020.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED AND ABSA BANK LIMITED: MOODY’S DOWNGRADES CREDIT RATINGS
FOLLOWING DOWNGRADE ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN SOVEREIGN

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Moody’s
Investor Services (“Moody’s”) has on 31 March 2020 lowered the long-term local currency and foreign
currency deposit ratings of Absa Bank Limited to Ba1 from Baa3, and the long-term issuer ratings of Absa
Group Limited to Ba2 from Ba1.The outlook on both ratings remains negative.

These rating actions follow Moody’s decision to downgrade the South African government’s local and
foreign currency issuer rating to Ba1 from Baa3, with a negative outlook, on 27 March 2020. Moody’s
does not rate financial institutions above the credit profile of the government.

The above ratings actions do not reflect any fundamental change in the credit quality of the Absa Group
and Absa Bank Limited.

For additional details on the rationale of the ratings action please see the press release by Moody’s on 31
March 2020 titled “Rating Action: Moody’s downgrades the ratings of five South African banks following
downgrade on the South African sovereign. The outlook is negative”

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC separation

A normalised view of the 2019 results is provided which adjusts for the consequences of the separation from
Barclays PLC (Separation). This view better reflects Absa Group's underlying performance. International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) compliant financial statements will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act and the
JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements and include a reconciliation between the normalised and IFRS views. Normalised
results will be presented for future periods to the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is considered material.


Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial information as per JSE Listing
Requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of the Group's Board of directors and is presented
for illustrative purpose only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in
equity, and results in operations or cash flows. The pro forma financial information contained in this announcement has
been reviewed by Absa Group's external auditors and their unmodified limited assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE
3420 is available for inspection at the Company's registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED - BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2019

This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group)
and Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group's regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-      The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-      Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not superseded
       by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.


1. Key prudential metrics and risk weighted assets (RWA)

In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage position of Group and Bank in this document is reflected on a regulatory
basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded), and in accordance with IFRS accounting rules (which requires the impact of the contribution
amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation to be included). However, the capital and leverage position of the Group is also managed
on a statutory basis. For reference, the summary table below provides key capital and leverage information on a statutory, IFRS basis as at 30 September
2019.

Capital adequacy

The Group remains capitalised above the minimum regulatory capital requirements. Absa Group continues to optimise the level and composition of capital
resources. In line with this objective, the Group will continue to raise Basel III compliant capital instruments as and when appropriate, in the domestic
and/or international capital markets.
The Absa Group statutory CET 1 ratios (calculated on an IFRS basis) have reduced by 70bps over Q3 2019, driven by the impact of the interim dividend
of R4.2bn combined with RWA growth.

1.   Key prudential metrics and RWA



KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an incurred
loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory capital
impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on
a transitional basis.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption from 30 June 2019 to 30 September 2019 were as follows:

-        Credit risk: The increase of R38.2bn is attributable to increases in the IRB portfolios of R17.9bn and standardised portfolios of R20.3bn. The primary
         driver for the increase in the South African IRB portfolios is exposure growth in Retail and Business Banking (RBB). The R20.3bn increase in the
         standardised portfolios is as a result of balance sheet growth of R12.5bn and foreign exchange movements of R7.5bn.
-        CCR & CVA: The decreases in CCR of R1.2bn and in CVA of R1.5bn are mainly attributable to market volatility.
-        Market Risk: The increase of R1.7bn is primarily as a result of specific risk capital on local currency sovereign bonds held by ARO.

Notes:
 (1) These numbers have been restated. Refer to reporting changes overview on the inside front cover of the Group results booklet for the period ended
      30 June 2019.
 (2) The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (3) Bank-specific confidential requirement.
 (4) The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Bank LCR and the LCR of the Absa Regional Operations (ARO). For this purpose, a simple average
      of the relevant 3 month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-
      day LCR observations. The December 2018 and March 2019 Group LCR was restated post a change in certain assumptions.
 (5) The 2019 minimum regulatory capital requirement is calculated at 11.5% (2018: 11.13%), which includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes
      the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the D-SIB add-on.
 (6) SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (7) Includes the operational risk floor.
 (8) IRC: incremental risk charge.
 (9) Calculated at 11.5% of RWA.
 (10) Numbers reported are on a regulatory basis, and include the contribution amounts from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
 (11) The Absa Group LCR for 30 September 2019 reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank and Absa Regional Operations (ARO) LCR. The ARO LCR
      is calculated as a simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points. The surplus HQLA of ARO in excess of the minimum requirement of
      100% has been excluded from the calculation of the ARO LCR.
 (12) The Absa Bank Limited quarterly LCR is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-day observations.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

-     Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R5.9bn (both in respect of Absa Group and Absa Bank Limited) due
      to balance sheet growth in Retail and Business Banking (RBB). This is offset by a decrease in the IFRS9 transitional adjustment of R3.5bn
      in respect of Absa Group Limited and R3.7bn in respect of Absa Bank Limited. Portfolios subjected to the standardised approach increased
      by R2.7bn, primarily due to exchange rate fluctuation applicable to the Absa Regional Operations.
-     CVA: The R1.1bn CVA increase in RWA (both in respect of Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited) is primarily due to market volatility.
-     Market Risk: The Absa Group increase of R2.4bn is driven by the growth in the Absa Regional Operations. The Absa Bank Limited decrease
      of R321m is driven by lower risk levels in value-at-risk.


Key Metrics (at consolidated group level) [KM1]

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited have moved from
the recognition of credit losses on an incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited have
elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5.

Leverage Ratio


The leverage ratio framework is complementary to the risk-based capital framework and is a non-risk based contingency measure to restrict the
build-up of excessive leverage in the banking sector.

The tables below represent the leverage ratios for Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited at 31 March 2019 and the comparatives for the
past three quarter end periods, namely 31 December 2018, 30 September 2018 and 30 June 2018.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks by ensuring that they
have sufficient unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) ) to cover net cash outflows (NCOF) to survive a prescribed stress scenario over
a 30 calendar day period. The LCR became effective on 1 January 2015, with a requirement of 60%, which is being phased in by increasing the
minimum regulatory requirement by 10% per year to reach a minimum of 100% compliance level on 1 January 2019. The requirement for 2019 is
100% (2018: 90%).

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under Guidance Note 5 of 2017,
which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Notes:
1. The 31 March 2019 figures are unaudited whilst the 31 December 2018 comparatives are reported on an audited basis.
2. The IFRS view includes the contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
3. Reserves as at 31 March 2019 have already been reduced by the value of the 2018 final ordinary dividend of R5.3bn for Absa Group Limited
    and R500m for Absa Bank Limited, which were declared on 11 March 2019 and paid on 15 April 2019.
4. The normalised ratios exclude the impact of the separation from Barclays PLC and reflect the underlying performance of the Group.
5. The Board target ranges apply to statutory ratios on a normalised basis. Regulatory ratios are measured against regulatory minimum levels.
6. Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore holdings.
7. The South African minimum regulatory capital requirement for 2019 of 11.5% includes the RSA minimum of 8%, Pillar 2a buffer of 1% and
    capital conservation buffer of 2.5% but excludes the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestic
    systemically important banks (D-SIB) add-on (excluding the Pillar 2a and capital conservation buffers). The Pillar 2a buffer reduced from 2%
    on 31 December 2015 to 1% by 1 January 2019.
8. SA-CCR is calculated using the Current Exposure Method.
9. Numbers restated due to the IFRS 9 audit requirement.
10. The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa. The D-SIB add on is not publicly disclosed.
11. For liquidity reporting purposes Absa Bank Limited represents the banking operations in South Africa.
12. The Absa Bank Limited quarterly LCR is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-day observations.
13. The Absa Group Limited LCR for 31 March 2019 reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank Limited LCR as noted in (12) above with that of the
    non-South African banking entities, which is calculated as a simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points. In addition, the surplus
    HQLA of non-South African banking entities in excess of the minimum requirement of 100% has been excluded from the calculation.
14. Numbers restated.

Profit and dividend announcement

Salient features
Absa Group Limited (the Group) discloses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial results and 
a normalised view, which adjusts for the financial consequences of separating from Barclays PLC.

IFRS basis
* Headline earnings per share (HEPS), which included R3.2bn of separation costs, recognised as operating expenses,
  decreased 1% to 1 703.7 cents from 1 724.5 cents.
* The Group declared a 4% higher full year dividend per share (DPS) of 1 110 cents.

  Africa Banking, rose 9% to R3.2bn and WIMI increased 3% to R1.3bn.
* Return on Equity (RoE) declined to 13.4% from 14.2%. 
* Revenue increased 4% to R76.5bn and costs rose 8% to R46.8bn. 
* Pre-provision profit (total income less operating expense) decreased 1% to R29.7bn.
* Credit impairments fell 10% to R6.3bn, resulting in a 0.73% credit loss ratio from 0.87%.
* Net Asset Value (NAV) per share increased 1% to 13 233 cents.

Normalised basis
* Diluted normalised HEPS grew 4% to 1 910.0 cents from 1 845.4 cents
* RoE increased slightly to 16.8%
* Revenue grew 4% to R75.7bn and operating expenses rose 5% to R43.6bn
* Pre-provision profit increased 1% to R32.0bn
* Absa Group's normalised Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12.0% remains above regulatory requirements and 
  the Board's target range. Its statutory CET1 was 12.8%. 
* NAV per share rose 4% to 11 985 cents.

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, Absa Group continues to report IFRS-compliant financial results 
and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and better reflects the Group's 
underlying operational performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods where the 
financial impact of separation is considered material.

Normalisation adjusts for the following items: R330m of interest earned on Barclays PLC's separation contribution
(2017: R325m); hedging revenue linked to separation activities of R525m (2017: R80m); operating expenses of 
R3 161m (2017: R1 901m) and R194m of other expenses (2017: R394m), plus a R484m (2017: R408m) tax impact of the 
aforementioned items. In total, these adjustments added R1 986m (2017: R1 245m) to the Group's normalised headline 
earnings during the period. Since normalisation occurs at a Group level, it does not affect divisional disclosures. 
Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial information as per JSE listing 
requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of the Group's Board of the directors and 
is presented for illustrative purpose only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial 
position, changes in equity, and results in operations or cash flows.

Overview of results
The Group's IFRS headline earnings declined 1% to R14 142m from R14 378m and diluted HEPS decreased 1% to 1 700.4
cents. The Group's IFRS RoE fell to 13.4% from 14.2%, largely due to the higher capital base from the Barclays PLC
separation contribution and costs, while its return on average assets declined to 1.17% from 1.27%. Net interest 
income increased 3% and non-interest income grew 5%, resulting in 4% higher total revenue. Operating expenses grew 
8%, increasing the cost-to-income ratio to 61.2% from 59.0%. Pre-provision profit decreased 1% to R29,7bn. The 
Group's NAV per share rose 1% to 13 233 cents including Barclays PLC's remaining separation contribution in equity.

On a normalised basis,  Group's headline earnings grew 3% to R16 128m from R15 623m and diluted HEPS rose 4% to 
1 910.0 cents from 1 845.4 cents. The Group's normalised RoE was 16.8% from 16.5% and its return on assets was 
1.34% from 1.39%. Revenue grew 4% to R75.7bn, with net interest income and non-interest income rising 3% and 5%, 
respectively. The Group's net interest margin on average interest-bearing assets decreased to 4.64% from 4.83%, 
largely due to adopting IFRS 9. Gross loans and advances to customers grew 13% to R872bn, while deposits due to 
customers rose 7% to R736bn. With operating expenses growing 5%, the normalised cost-to-income ratio increased to 
57.7% from 56.7%, and pre-provision profit rose 1% to R32.0bn. In constant currency (CCY), pre-provision profit 
grew 2% and headline earnings 4%. Credit impairments fell 10% to R6.3bn, resulting in a 0.73% credit loss ratio 
from 0.87%. The Group's normalised NAV per share increased 4% to 11 985 cents and it declared a 4% higher full 
year DPS of 1 110 cents.

RBB South Africa's headline earnings rose 2% to R8 880m primarily due to 10% lower credit impairments. Retail 
Banking South Africa headline earnings grew 2% to R6 359m, while Business Banking South Africa increased 1% to 
R2 521m. CIB South Africa's earnings declined 1%, given 76% higher credit impairments. Corporate South Africa 
grew 4% to R1 171m and Investment Banking South Africa decreased 4% to R2 196m. ARO's headline earnings grew 
9% to R3 218m (CCY 13%), with RBB up 26% (CCY 29%) and CIB increasing 7% (CCY 11%). WIMI's headline earnings 
increased 3% to R1 268m, with continuing business line earnings up 8%.  

South African earnings grew 3% to R13.0bn, while Africa Regions rose 6% (CCY 10%) to account for 20% of the 
Group's earnings.

Operating environment
For the year, global growth is estimated to have remained  at 3.7%, but was less synchronised among the larger
developed markets. Growth in the US accelerated, supported by tax cuts, while political uncertainty and concern 
over trade slowed growth in the Euro Area and the United Kingdom (UK). Global trade tensions, a stronger dollar 
and concerns about United States (US) policy tightening increased market volatility. Global inflation firmed 
on higher oil prices and weaker emerging market currencies. Monetary policy continued on a gradual tightening 
path but is likely to become more restrictive by end of 2019. 

South Africa recorded its first recession since the last global financial crisis in the first half of 2018. The 
recession was short-lived as economic activity rebounded in the 3rd quarter at an annualised rate of 2.6% from 
negative 0.5% in the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter, GDP growth slowed to an annualised rate of 1.4% as 
gross fixed capital formation fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. For the year, GDP growth moderated to 0.8% 
from 1.4% in 2017. Weak labour markets and moderating confidence weighed on consumers appetite for credit and 
willingness to spend. Headline consumer price inflation finished 2018 at 4.5% year on year, broadly similar to 
its level at the beginning of the year, having ranged from 3.8% to 5.2% in the intervening months. The Reserve 
Bank cut the repurchase rate by 25 bps in March but reversed this in November (+25 bps), citing upside risks to 
the inflation outlook. 

Economic growth in our key Africa regions faced significant uncertainties and headwinds during 2018. On a
GDP-weighted basis and excluding South Africa, the region's economy grew by an estimated 5.6% in 2018, down from 
5.8% in 2017. Monetary policy tightened in a number of markets on the back of weaker currencies and rising 
inflation.

Group performance
Statement of financial position
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 on 1 January 2018, in terms of which credit impairments moved from an incurred basis to an
expected credit loss approach (ECL). The Group applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, with an adjustment to retained 
earnings and other reserves as at 1 January 2018, and elected not to restate comparative periods. The Group has 
reconsidered the treatment of post write-off recoveries in the calculation of the portfolio's accounting for LGD, 
since the previously published results as at 30 June 2018. The Group will exclude post write-off recoveries from 
LGD for accounting purposes.

The exclusion of post write-off recoveries from LGD has significantly increased the allowance for ECL as at 
1 January 2018:
* The restated allowance for ECL is R29 703m (including interest in suspense and ECL provision on off balance 
  sheet items), relative to the amount of R27 767m, as previously published. 
* This has resulted in a  reduction in the Group's retained income as at 1 January 2018 of R5 413m (after taxation
  adjustment of R2 063m and non-controlling interest of R328m), relative to the amount previously published of 
  R4 106m (after taxation adjustment of R1 572m  and non-controlling interest of R190m).
* The IFRS 9 transition disclosures previously published as at 30 June 2018 have been restated.

Total IFRS assets increased 10% to R1 289bn at 31 December 2018, largely due to 13% growth in loans and advances 
to customers.

Gross Loans and advances to customers
Gross loans and advances to customers increased 13% to R871bn. RBB South Africa loans rose 6% to R488bn. Retail
Banking South Africa's loans grew 5% to R416bn, reflecting 12% growth in Vehicle and Asset Finance (VAF) and 
Personal Loans, 2% growth in Home Loans, while Card increased 4% despite a reduced store card portfolio. Business 
Banking South Africa's gross loans rose 11% to R72bn, with term loans increasing 19%. CIB South Africa's gross 
loans grew 25% to R275bn, including 23% higher term loans and reverse repurchase agreements up 52%. ARO's gross 
loans increased 26% to R102bn or 12% in constant currency.

Funding
The Group's liquidity position remains strong, with liquid assets and other sources of liquidity growing 2% to 
R218bn which equates to 30% of customer deposits. The Group's average liquidity coverage ratio for the fourth 
quarter was 117%, comfortably above the minimum regulatory hurdle of 90% during 2018. Deposits due to customers 
grew 7% to R736bn. The Group's loans to deposit and debt securities ratio increased to 93.8% from 90.6%. Deposits 
due to customers constituted 72.3% of total funding. RBB South Africa's deposits grew 11% to R333bn, with Retail 
Banking South Africa up 11% to R208bn and Business Banking South Africa increasing 10% to R125bn. CIB South 
Africa's deposits fell 2% to R174bn. ARO's deposits increased 23% to R134bn, or 10% in constant currency.

Net asset value
The Group's IFRS NAV rose 1% to R109bn despite a R5.5bn reduction on adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 and the 
NAV per share grew 1% to 13 233 cents. During the year the Group generated retained earnings of R13.9bn, from 
which it paid R9.0bn in ordinary dividends. Its foreign currency translation reserve increased by R2.6bn.

On a normalised basis, NAV rose 3% to R101bn.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) grew 11% to R819bn at 31 December 2018, largely due to increased credit risk 
RWAs. The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum regulatory capital requirements. It's 
normalised CET1 and total capital adequacy ratios were 12.0% and 15.4% (from 12.1% and 14.9%), respectively. The 
Group generated 2.0% of CET 1 capital internally over the past year. The day 1 impact from implementing IFRS 9 
reduced the Group's CET1 ratio by 7 bps, as we opted to phase it in over three years. Declaring of a 4% higher 
full year DPS of 1 110 cents on a dividend cover of 1.7 times took into account the operating environment, the 
Group's strong capital position, internal capital generation, strategy and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income
Net interest income
IFRS net interest income increased 3% to R43 755m from R42 644m (Normalised: increased 3% to R43 425m from 
R42 319m), while average interest-bearing assets grew 7%. The Group's net interest margin (to average interest-
bearing assets) declined to 4.64% from 4.83%, mostly due to transitioning to IFRS 9, which reduced the margin by 
12 bps. Excluding the impact of IFRS 9, loan pricing decreased 3 bps, while composition added 3 bps to margin, given 
slower growth in Home Loans. Deposit pricing reduced the margin by 3 bps, primarily due to competitive pricing on 
fixed retail deposits in South Africa. Deposit composition decreased the margin by 3 bps, as average wholesale 
funding balances grew faster than customer deposits. With lower average interest rates in South Africa, the equity 
and deposit endowment reduced the Group margin by 5 bps. The structural hedge released R545m to the income statement, 
3 bps more than the prior year, to largely offset the reduced endowment contribution. ARO reduced the margin by 2 bps
due to lower interest rates. Treasury's improving asset/liability construct in South Africa added 6 bps, partially 
offset by the reduction between prime and Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR).

Non-interest income
Non-interest income grew 7% to R32 760m from R30 571m (normalised: increased 5% to R32 235m from R30 671m) to 
account for 43% of total revenue from 42%. On a constant currency basis, the growth was 6%.

Net fee and commission income grew 4% to R22 523m, which represented 70% of total non-interest income. Within this,
cheque account fees increased 9% to R5 401m, electronic banking grew 3% to R5 335m, while credit cards and merchant 
income rose by 6% and 9%, respectively. 

Net trading income excluding hedge accounting grew 7% to R5 183m, reflecting CIB Markets South Africa income increasing 
10%, while ARO Markets income decreased 2%.

RBB South Africa's non-interest income grew 5% to R18 083m, as Retail Banking South Africa increased 6% and Business
Banking South Africa grew 2%. Within Retail Banking, Transactional and Deposits rose 8%, reflecting price increases,
debit card turnover, cheque account growth and the reclassifying of fee write-offs to credit impairments. CIB South 
Africa increased 7% to R4 589m, with 2% higher Corporate transactional banking revenue.

ARO non-interest income grew 6% to R5 157m, or 9% in constant currency, as CIB increased 3% and RBB 8%. 

WIMI's non-interest income increased 6% to R5 514m, including 10% higher Life Insurance net premium income and 8%
growth in Short-term Insurance net premium income.

Impairment losses on loans and advances
Implementing IFRS 9 increased the Group's IAS 39 credit provisions and interest in suspense by R7.0bn or 36% at 
1 January 2018 to R28.9bn. This impact is R1.9bn higher than the amount previously published following a change 
in the treatment of post write-off recoveries in the calculation of accounting LGD. Previously reported IAS 39 
impairment ratios in respect of performing and non-performing portfolios are not comparable to similar ratios 
under IFRS 9. At 31 December 2018 the Group's stage 3 (defaulted) loans were 5.10% of gross loans and advances 
from 5.53% at 1 January 2018 and the ECL coverage ratios on these were 45.1% and 43.7%, respectively.

At the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) meeting held in November 2018, the committee concluded that any
unrecognised interest, which is subsequently recovered should be presented as a credit impairment gain.  Following 
this decision, the Group has amended its accounting treatment. This change does not impact profit or loss, but it 
does reduce both the Group's ECL and interest income by R608m for the year ending 31 December 2018 
(30 June 2018: R292m). 

Credit impairments decreased 10% to R6 324m from R7 022m, which improved the Group's credit loss ratio to 0.73% 
from 0.87% of gross loans and advances to customers and banks. Excluding the IFRS-IC conclusion's impact credit 
impairments declined 1%. 

RBB South Africa credit impairments decreased 10% to R4 555m, resulting in a 0.94% credit loss ratio from 1.10%.
Retail Banking South Africa credit impairments declined 9% to R4 313m, improving its credit loss ratio to 1.04% 
from 1.20%. Home Loans' charge fell 84% to R113m resulting in a 0.05% credit loss ratio from 0.30%. Card and 
Payments' credit loss ratio declined to 3.42% from 4.53%, given 23% lower credit impairments of R1 478m. Vehicle 
and Asset Finance credit impairments grew 29% to R1 096m, increasing its credit loss ratio to 1.02% from 0.87%. 
Personal Loans' charge fell 1% to R1 105m and its credit loss ratio improved to 5.51% from 6.09%. Business Banking 
South Africa credit impairments decreased 12% to R242m, improving its credit loss ratio to 0.35% from 0.43%.

CIB South Africa credit impairments increased 76% to R998m from R567m, due to a large single name exposure. Its 
credit loss ratio increased to 0.36% from 0.24%.

ARO's credit impairments fell 38% to R794m from R1 289m, reducing its credit loss ratio to 0.77% from 1.34%. 
Within this, RBB's charge declined 14% to R820m, a 1.80% credit loss ratio, while CIB's fell 91% to R32m or a 
0.07% credit loss ratio.

Operating expenses
Group operating expenses grew 8% (CCY +6%) on an IFRS basis, to R46 803m from R43 304m, resulting in a 61.2%
cost-to-income ratio from 59.0%. On a normalised basis operating expense increased 5% to R43 642m from R41 403m 
resulting in a 57.7% cost-to-income from 56.7%.

Staff costs grew 5% and accounted for 53% of total operating expenses. Salaries rose 8% and total incentives fell 2%. 

On a normalised basis staff costs grew 4% and accounted for 55% of total operating expenses. Salaries rose 7% and
total incentives fell 2%. Headcount decreased 2% to 40 856, largely due to reductions in South Africa and a 
disposal in WIMI.

Non-staff costs grew 7%. Professional fees grew 17% (normalised: 7%) to R2 700m, while telephone and postage 
increased 1% and printing and stationary decreased 1%. Operating leases on properties were flat at R1 606m and 
property costs increased 4% to R1 816m (normalised: 2% to R1 759m).  Marketing costs increased 9% to R1 962m from 
R1 793m due to the brand launch (normalised: decreased 7% to R1 595m reflecting lower product campaign spend). 
Total IT-related spend grew 7% to R7 886m and constituted 18% of Group operating expenses. Amortisation of 
intangible assets rose 30% to R846m (normalised: 25% to R815m), while cash transportation increased 16% to R1 266m. 
The 18% growth in depreciation reflects investment in technology and optimisation of the corporate property 
portfolio and branch network.

RBB South Africa costs grew 5% to R25 770m. Retail Banking South Africa increased 5% and Business Banking South 
Africa 5%, due to salary increases, amortisation of IT infrastructure, digital fraud losses and one-off 
restructuring and rebranding initiatives. 

CIB South Africa expenses grew 12% to R6 304m, after two years of low cost growth, due to investment in systems 
and technology and building out capabilities after separating from Barclays PLC.

ARO's expenses increased 6%, or 8% in constant currency, to R9 535m due to incremental costs following separation 
from Barclays PLC and high inflation rates in some countries. CIB increased 13% and RBB grew 3%. 

WIMI's costs declined 5% to R3 098m, due to disposals, as continuing business line costs grew 4%. Positive 
operating Jaws improved its cost-efficiency ratio to 33.3%.

Taxation
The Group's taxation expense increased 7% to R6 282m (normalised: 8% to R6 766m), slightly above the 5% pre-tax 
profit, resulting in a 29.2% (normalised: 28.1%) effective tax rate from 28.1% (normalised: 27.5%).

Segment performance
RBB South Africa
Headline earnings increased 2% to R8 880m, due to 10% lower credit impairments as pre-provision profits declined 2%.
Revenue grew 2% to R43 591m, with non-interest income increasing 5%. Costs rose 5% to R25 770m, resulting in a 59.1%
cost-to-income ratio from 57.4%. The credit loss ratio improved to 0.94% from 1.10%. RBB South Africa generated a 
return on regulatory capital (RoRC) of 24.0% and constituted 53% of total normalised headline earnings excluding 
the Group centre.

Retail Banking South Africa
Headline earnings grew 2% to R6 359m, primarily due to 9% lower credit impairments. Card and Payments earnings 
grew 15% to R1 723m, as a result of 23% lower credit impairments and 13% growth in acquiring turnover. Despite 7% 
higher pre-provision profits, Transactional and Deposits earnings fell 3% to R2 311m, because of significantly 
higher credit impairments. Home Loans earnings were flat at R1 736m, as credit impairments fell 84% to offset 9% 
lower revenue due to the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS-IC conclusion. Vehicle and Asset Finance earnings fell 9% to 
R877m, as 29% higher credit impairments outweighed 5% higher pre-provision profits. Personal Loans earnings 
increased 7% to R461m, due to a combination of pre-provision profits rising 2% and credit impairments declining 
by 1%. Retail Banking South Africa accounted for 38% of normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre.

Business Banking South Africa
Headline earnings increased 1% to R2 521m. Pre-provision profits were flat, given 5% cost growth due to continued
investment in frontline staff and systems. Credit impairments fell 12%, due to IFRS-IC conclusion. Business Banking
South Africa generated 15% of overall normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre.

CIB South Africa
Headline earnings decreased 1% to R3 367m, primarily due to 76% higher credit impairments. Pre-provision profits 
grew 5% although 12% higher costs exceeded 8% revenue growth. Corporate earnings grew 4% to R1 171m, largely due 
to 11% revenue growth. Investment Bank earnings decreased 4% to R2 196m, due to 70% higher credit impairments. 
CIB South Africa contributed 20% of total normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre and generated 
a 15.6% RoRC.

cost-to-income ratio. RBB earnings increased 26% to R844m, or 29% in constant currency, given positive operating 
leverage and 14% lower credit impairments. CIB earnings grew 7%, or 11% in constant currency, to R2 508m as its 
credit impairments dropped 91%. ARO accounted for 19% of total normalised headline earnings excluding the Group 
centre and produced a 18.5% RoE.

Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance
Headline earnings grew 3% to R1 268m, while earnings from continuing business lines increased 8% to R1 195m. Gross
operating income grew 10% to R6 869m and costs decreased 3% to R3 740m. Life insurance earnings grew 4% to R870m. 
The embedded value of new business increased 15%. Investment Cluster earnings declined 6%, largely due to margin 
compression since assets under management grew 1% to R337bn.  Short-term insurance earnings grew 32% to R299m. 
South Africa underwriting margins increased to 9.6%. WIMI's South Africa earnings increased  9% to R1 326m, while 
Africa Regions reported a loss of R58m. WIMI's RoE improved to 21.7% and it generated 8% of total earnings 
excluding the Group centre.

Prospects
South Africa's economic growth outlook for 2019 appears relatively modest. We see only tentative growth for 
consumer spending of 1.5%, with probably more downside than upside risks. On the view that the consumer remains 
constrained and business confidence tentative, we forecast GDP growth of 1.7% in 2019. Eskom's challenges are one 
key uncertainty for 2019, as is the global environment.  Beyond the election, the economy is likely to remain a 
challenge for fiscal policy, while we expect the Reserve Bank to leave interest rates unchanged for some time.

In our Africa regions markets, we forecast real GDP growth of 5.9% with risks tilted to the downside. 
Infrastructure investment, improved mining output and agriculture should help support growth in 2019. Global 
uncertainties will continue to weigh on the currency, inflation and interest rate outlook in the region.

Based on these assumptions, and excluding any major unforeseen political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, 
we expect stronger deposit growth this year and it should exceed our loan growth. We again see better loan growth 
from Absa Regional Operations in constant currency than from South Africa, where momentum should continue. Our 
net interest margin is likely to decline slightly. Costs will remain well controlled and we are targeting positive
operating Jaws for the full year, although this could be challenging in the first half, given the slow start we 
expect from the economy and financial markets. Our credit loss ratio is likely to increase off a low base. Our 
Group CET1 ratio should remain above board targets and we are comfortable with our dividend cover at current 
levels. Lastly, our RoE should increase slightly in 2019, on the path to achieving our target of 18% to 20% by 
2020.

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC separation
On 1 March 2016, Barclays PLC announced its intention to sell down its 62,3% interest in the Group. A comprehensive
separation programme was initiated by Barclays PLC and the Group to determine possible interactions between the 
companies to ensure that the Group can operate as an independent and sustainable group without the involvement of 
Barclays PLC.

Barclays PLC currently holds 14,9% in the Group.

As part of its divestment Barclays PLC contributed ?765m to the Group, primarily in recognition of the investments
required for the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. Investments will be made primarily in rebranding, technology 
and separation-related projects and it is expected that these will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of 
separation investments on the Group over time.

The separation process will have an impact on the Group's financial results for the next few years, most 
notably by increasing the capital base in the near-term and generating endowment revenue thereon, with increased 
costs over time as the separation investments are concluded ahead of the associated benefit realisation. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require that the Barclays PLC contribution be recognised 
directly in equity, while the subsequent investment expenditure (including the depreciation or amortisation of 
capitalised assets), will be recognised in profit or loss. The aforementioned will result in a disconnect between 
underlying business performance and the IFRS financial results during the separation period. Normalised financial 
results will therefore be disclosed while the underlying business performance is materially different from the 
IFRS financial results. Refer to the IFRS results.

The following presents the items which have been excluded from the normalised financial results:
* Barclays PLC contribution (including the endowment benefit)
* Hedging linked to separation activities
* Technology and brand separation projects
* Depreciation and amortisation on the aforementioned projects
* Transitional service payments to Barclays PLC
* Employee cost and benefits linked to separation activities
* Separation project execution and support cost 

Basis of presentation
IFRS financial results
The Group?s summary provisional consolidated financial results have been prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), interpretations issued by the 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC), the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants? Financial 
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by 
the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements and the requirements of the Companies Act.  

The information disclosed in the SENS is derived from the information contained in the audited annual consolidated
financial statements and does not contain full or complete disclosure details. Any investment decisions by 
shareholders should be based on consideration of the audited annual consolidated financial statements, which is 
available on request. The presentation and disclosures comply with International Accounting Standards IAS 34.

The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions. 
Use of available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. The 
accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Group?s results and financial position, in terms of the 
materiality of the items to which the policies are applied, and which involve a high degree of judgement including 
the use of assumptions and estimation, are impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, fair value 
measurements, impairment of fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets (2018)/
available-for-sale financial assets (2017), consolidation of structured or sponsored entities, post-retirement 
benefits, provisions, income taxes, share-based payments, liabilities arising from claims made under short-term 
and long-term insurance contracts and offsetting of financial assets and liabilities.

The directors assess the Group's future performance and financial position on an ongoing basis and have no reason 
to believe that the Group will not be a going concern in the reporting period ahead. For this reason, the 
information in this report has been prepared on a going concern basis.

Constant currency
Constant currency pro forma financial information has been presented to illustrate the impact of changes in the
Group's major foreign currencies, namely the, Botswana Pula, Ghanaian Cedi, Kenyan Shilling, Mauritius Rupee, 
Mozambique Metical, Seychelles Rupee, Tanzanian Shilling, Uganda Shilling and Zambia Kwacha. Because of its nature, 
the constant currency pro forma financial information may not fairly present the Group's financial position, 
changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.  In determining the constant currency pro forma financial 
information, amounts denoted in the above listed currencies for the current period have been converted to the 
presentation currency using the spot exchange rate as at 31 December 2017. The constant currency pro forma 
financial information is the responsibility of the directors.

Normalised financial results
The summary provisional consolidated normalised financial results (normalised results) have been prepared to 
illustrate the impact of the separation from Barclays PLC and adjust for the interest income on Barclays PLC's 
separation contribution, hedging linked to the separating activities, operating expenses and other expenses, as 
well as the tax impact of the aforementioned items (collectively the ""separation"").  

Normalised results have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and because of their nature may not fairly
present the Group's financial position, changes in equity, cash flows and results of operations.

The normalised results have not been prepared using the accounting policies of the Group and do not comply with 
IFRS. These results are considered to be pro forma financial information and have been prepared in terms of the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange listing requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of 
the Group's Board of directors.

The pro forma financial information contained in this announcement has been reviewed by the group's external auditors
and their unmodified limited assurance report prepared in terms of ISAE 3420 is available for inspection at the
company's registered office on weekdays from 09:00 to 16:00

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in preparing the summary provisional consolidated financial statements are the same 
as those in place for the Group?s annual consolidated financial statements for the reporting period ended 
31 December 2017 except for the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers (IFRS 15), internal accounting policy amendments and changes to the Group?s operating segments and 
business portfolios changes. Refer to note 15.

Standards issued not yet effective
IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
leases. One of the key changes brought by IFRS 16 is the elimination of the classification of leases as either 
operating leases or finance leases for a lessee, and the introduction of a single lessee accounting model.

Applying the revised model, a lessee is required to recognise:
* a right of use asset together with a lease liability representing the future lease payments for all leases 
  (unless the lease term is shorter than 12 months or the underlying asset is of low value and the related exemptions 
  are elected); and
* depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the statement of comprehensive income.

The standard provides revised guidance in defining what constitutes a lease and how the lease term is determined as
well as enhanced disclosure requirements for both lessees and lessors about its leasing activities and how exposures 
are managed.

During 2018, the joint leases programme (incorporating corporate real estate services and finance) has focused its
efforts on implementing the IT solution, which will ensure that leases are recognised and disclosed in terms of the
requirements of IFRS 16, collating the required lease data, designing and testing new processes, and ensuring 
appropriate financial disclosures.

The effective date of IFRS 16 is 1 January 2019. The Group intends to apply the modified retrospective approach on
adoption, with right of use assets measured retrospectively using the Group's transition date incremental borrowing 
rate. 

The implementation of IFRS 16 will require the recognition of right-of-use assets (presented as part of property and
equipment) and lease liabilities, together with a debit against retained earnings of between R225m and R285m (net of
deferred tax, non-controlling interests and the release of IAS 17 straight line reserves). Right-of-use assets will be risk
weighted in line with the nature of the underlying assets, and the debit to retained income will reduce CET1. The 
value of the right-of-use assets recognised is expected to be less than R3.8bn and the value of the increase in lease
liabilities is expected to be less than R4.6bn (before the release of the IAS 17 straight-lining liability 
of approximately R400m).

IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
insurance contracts issued. It also requires similar principles for reinsurance contracts held and issued investment
contracts with discretionary participation features.  The standard brings a greater degree of comparability and transparency
about an insurer's financial health and the profitability of new and in-force insurance business.  

IFRS 17 introduces a general measurement model that measures groups of insurance contracts based on fulfilment cash
flows (comprising probability-weighted current estimates of future cash flows and an explicit entity specific adjustment
for risk) and a contractual service margin. The premium allocation approach (PAA) is a simplified measurement model that
may be applied when certain conditions are fulfilled. Under the premium allocation approach, the liability for remaining
coverage shall be initially recognised as the premiums, if any, received at initial recognition, minus any insurance
acquisition cash flows. The general measurement model has specific modifications applicable to accounting for reinsurance
contracts, direct participating contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. 

At a Board meeting held on 14 November 2018, the IASB tentatively decided to propose amending the IFRS 17 effective
date for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. This is a deferral of 1 year compared to the current date
of 1 January 2021 and is subject to public consultation, which is expected to take place in 2019.

A joint insurance programme incorporating finance, actuarial, data and IT was started in the last quarter of 2017 to
address the implementation requirements of IFRS 17. It is a multi-year programme impacting models, data, systems and
business processes. During 2018, the programme has focused on interpreting the requirements, project design and model
prototyping as well as the commencement of impact assessment. 2019 will see the programme move into a 'build and test' 
phase with planned parallel testing ahead of the 2021/2022 implementation.

(1) Numbers have been restated, refer to note 15.3 for further details.
(2) Net interest margin has been restated to reflect an update of the Group's policy for classifying assets as
    interest bearing or non-interest bearing. The updated policy classifies reverse repurchase transactions entered into 
    for regulatory purposes as interest bearing; under the previous policy these transactions were classified as non-interest 
    bearing. Under the previous policy the Group's net interest margin would have been 4.77% (2017:5.05%) on IFRS and 4.80%

(1) The Group disposed of its controlling stake in a non-core subsidiary which was classified as held for sale.
(2) As part of the disinvestment, Barclays PLC contributed R12,1bn in recognition of the investments required for 
    the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. The contribution meets the definition of a transaction with a shareholder 
    and was recognised in equity on the date that the Group became entitled to the contribution.
(3) As part of the separation, Barclays PLC contributed cash of R1 981m to the independent Absa Empowerment Trust to
    allow for its subsidiary to purchase 12 716 260 Group shares (1.5%) in the furtherance of the Group's objective of
    establishing a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment structure. In terms of IFRS, these shares have been accounted 
    for as treasury shares and eliminated against the Group's share capital.
(4) CLS Group Holding AG shares were transferred to Barclays PLC for no consideration in 2005. During the current
    reporting period these shares were transferred back to the Group for a nominal consideration of one British Pound 
    Sterling (GBP). The shares have been recognised at a fair value of R48m. The related credit has been recognised 
    in equity as a shareholder contribution. 
(5) The additional Tier 1 capital notes represent perpetual, subordinated instruments redeemable in full at the 
    option of Absa Group Limited (the issuer) on 12 September 2022 subject to regulatory approval. Interest is paid at 
    the discretion of the issuer and is non-cumulative. In addition, if certain conditions are reached, the regulator 
    may prohibit the issuer from making interest payments. Accordingly, the instruments are classified as equity 
    instruments.

IAS 33 Earnings per share prescribes that the weighted average number of shares outstanding during a reporting period,
and for all periods presented, should be adjusted for events that change the number of ordinary shares outstanding
without a corresponding change in resources. The contribution of cash by Barclays PLC and acquisition of Absa Group Limited
shares by a subsidiary of the independent ABSA Empowerment Trust in the previous reporting period did not result in an
adjustment to the net asset value of the Group. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2017 has been
restated to reflect the acquisition from Barclays PLC of 12 716 260 (1.5%) Absa Group Limited shares in the prior reporting
period. The acquisition of shares has been treated as treasury shares from the beginning of 2017, which has led to a
reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purposes of determining the weighted average number of shares
in the Headline earnings per share and Diluted headline earnings per share.

(1) The net amount is reflected after taxation and non-controlling interest.
(2) Numbers have been restated, refer to note 15.3.1 for further details.

8.1.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period 

During the period, the Group acquired the remaining 50% in a non-core investment, which was previously held as an
investment in associate at fair value.  The acquisition of the investment had an effective acquisition date of 
16 March 2018 and is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. The acquisition date fair value of the 
consideration transferred amounted to R198m. 
                                                                                    Fair value

8.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period 
Apart from the business classified as non-current assets/liabilities held for sale and disposed of (refer to 
note 1) there were no other disposals of businesses that were finalised during the current reporting period. 
The cash consideration received on disposal of subsidiary included in non-current assets/liabilities held for 
sale was R1 398m.

8.2.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period
There were no acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period.

8.2.2 Disposals of businesses during the previous reporting period

sale was R205m. 

9. Related parties
There were no one-off significant transactions with related parties of Absa Group Limited during the current reporting
period.

In the prior reporting period, as part of the separation, Barclays PLC sold ordinary Absa Group Limited shares
representing 12.2% and 33.7% of issued ordinary share capital in May 2016 and June 2017, respectively. Barclays PLC 
currently holds 126.2m ordinary Absa Group Limited shares representing 14.9% of issued ordinary shares. The remaining 
85.1 % of the shares are widely held on the JSE.

Barclays PLC contributed ?765 million to the Group, primarily in recognition of the investments required for the Group
to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested primarily in rebranding, technology and
separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of separation 
investments on the Group over time. 

Barclays PLC contributed cash of R1 891m to be used in the furtherance of the Group's objective of establishing
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment structure. The cash was contributed to the independent Absa Empowerment Trust, 
whose subsidiary purchased 12 716 260 Absa Group shares. In terms of the requirements of IFRS, these shares have been 
accounted for as treasury shares and eliminated against the Group's share capital.

CLS Group Holding AG shares were transferred to Barclays PLC for no consideration in 2005. During the previous
reporting period these shares were transferred back to the Group for a nominal consideration of one British Pound (GBP). 
The shares have been recognised at a fair value of R48m. The related credit has been recognised in equity as a shareholder
contribution. 

10. Commitments
                                                                                                      2018        2017

Authorised capital expenditure

The Group has capital commitments in respect of computer equipment, software and                
property development. Management is confident that future net revenues and funding 
will be sufficient to cover these commitments.
Operating lease payments due

                                                                                                     6 020       5 369    

The operating lease commitments comprise a number of separate operating leases in relation to property and equipment,
none of which is individually significant to the Group. Leases are negotiated for an average term of three to five years
and rentals are renegotiated annually.

11. Contingencies
                                                              2018          2017    
                                                                Rm            Rm    
Guarantees                                                  46 529        38 799    
Irrevocable debt facilities/other lending facilities       199 062       162 907    
Irrevocable equity facilities                                    8            33    
Letters of credit                                           14 838         7 814    
Other                                                           63           262    
                                                           260 500       209 815    

Guarantees include performance guarantee contracts and financial guarantee contracts.

Financial guarantee contracts represent contracts where the Group undertakes to make specified payments to a
counterparty, should the counterparty suffer a loss as a result of a specified debtor failing to make payment when due in
accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. This amount represents the maximum off-statement of financial position
exposure.

Irrevocable debt facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate the
facilities by written notice. Following the implementation of IFRS 9 other lending facilities in respect of which expected
credit losses are recognised have been included above, as the Group does not enforce the ability to revoke these
facilities in the normal day-to-day management thereof.

Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total
contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

An impairment provision of R123m has been raised on financial guarantees, R48m has been raised for letters of credit
and R497m on irrevocable debt facilities/other lending facilities. 

Irrevocable equity facilities and other contingencies fall outside the scope of the expected credit losses model of
IFRS 9. 

Legal matters
The Group has been party to proceedings against it during the reporting period. The following material cases were
ongoing at the reporting date:

* Pinnacle Point Holdings Proprietary Limited:  It is alleged that a local bank conducted itself unlawfully in
relation to a financial product offered by it, and that Absa Bank Limited was privy to such conduct. Subsequent to the
withdrawal of the first plaintiff's (Pinnacle Point Holdings) claim, the total claim amount has been substantially reduced,
however, the second to fifth plaintiffs persist with their claims for damages for an amount of R470m. 

* Ayanda Collective Investment Scheme (the Scheme): Absa Capital Investor Services was the trustee of Ayanda
Collective Investment Scheme, in which Corporate Money Managers (CMM) managed a portfolio of assets within the Scheme. 
The joint curators of the CMM group of companies and the Altron Pension Fund (an investor in the fund) allege that the 
defendants caused damages to them arising from their alleged failure to meet their obligations in the trust deed together 
with their statutory obligations set out in the Collective Investment Scheme Act, in respect of which they seek payment 
of R934m.

The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in South Africa and a number of
other jurisdictions. It is involved in legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to
time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, 
fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other 
statutory and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal
and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer
protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking
and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a
material adverse effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the
matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters
will not be material to the Group's results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst
other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of income otherwise reported for the
reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they cannot
reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter. Provision is made for
all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis has resulted in a significant
tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally and locally, especially for companies that are deemed
to be of systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of
the banking and consumer credit industries globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. 

The nature and impact of future changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action especially in the areas
of financial crime, banking and insurance regulation, cannot currently be fully predicted and are beyond the Group's
control. Some of these are likely to have an impact on the Group's businesses, systems and earnings. 

The Group is continuously evaluating its programmes and controls in general relating to compliance with regulation.
The Group undertakes   monitoring, review and assurance activities, and the Group has also adopted appropriate remedial
and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and has made disclosures on material findings as and when
appropriate. 

Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Absa Group Limited, identified potentially fraudulent activity by certain of its
customers using advance payments for imports in 2014 and 2015 to effect foreign exchange transfers from South Africa to
beneficiary accounts located in East Asia, UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the Group conducted a review of relevant
activity, processes, systems and controls, and provided information to relevant authorities, in a process which has now
largely concluded. No financial impact is anticipated.

In February 2017 the South African Competition Commission (SACC) referred Barclays PLC, Boutique Collective Investments 
(Pty) Ltd (BCI) and Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Absa Group Limited, among other banks, to the Competition Tribunal 
to be prosecuted for breaches of South African antitrust law related to Foreign Exchange trading of South African Rand. The 
SACC found from its investigation that between 2007 and 2013 the banks had engaged in various forms of collusive behaviour. 
Barclays PLC was the first to bring the conduct to the attention of the SACC under its leniency programme and has cooperated 
with, and will continue to cooperate with, the SACC in relation to this matter.  The SACC is therefore not seeking an order 
from the Tribunal to impose any fine on Barclays Bank PLC, BCI or Absa Bank Limited. 

Income Taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group's tax charge and
provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities may have
indicated disagreement with the Group's treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. 

The Group recognises provisions for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will
be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate. The carrying amount of any resulting provisions will
be sensitive to the manner in which tax matters are expected to be resolved, and the stage of negotiations or discussion
with the relevant tax authorities. There may be significant uncertainty around the final outcome of tax proceedings,
which in many instances, will only be concluded after a number of years. Management estimates are informed by a number of
factors including, inter alia, the progress made in discussions or negotiations with the tax authorities, the advice of
expert legal counsel, precedent set by the outcome of any previous claims, as well as the nature of the relevant tax
environment. The dispute with the South African tax authority that was referred to in the 2017 financial statements has now
been settled.

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such
differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period in which such
determination is made. These risks are managed in accordance with the Group's Tax Risk Framework.

14. Assets and liabilities held at fair value
14.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework includes
a Traded Risk and Valuations Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), which is independent from the
front office.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally
approve valuation policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are reported to 
the Absa Group Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will
therefore consider the appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC team independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair value
measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk areas when
performing independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They also assess and document the
inputs obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which supports conclusions that valuations are
performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.

Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to the
specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating the fair value of the
properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible the fair value of the Group's investment properties is determined through valuations performed by
external independent valuators.

When the Group's internal valuations are different to that of the external independent valuers, detailed procedures
are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC team verifies the procedures performed by the front office
and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent valuations.

14.2 Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects
the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Quoted market prices - Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. Such
fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and 
frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
Fair values are classified as Level 2 if they have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in an
active market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if
there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 10% to
the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar
nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for 
similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using inputs derived from
observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for
similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant,
assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, dependent on
the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons with similar
companies and price: earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). OTC derivative contracts include
forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, equity prices and
commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices, dealer
price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual cash
flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus the originally
priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used to reflect valuation date
pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, are used to determine expected cash
flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying rates
currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded derivatives, the
embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives as detailed above.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value. For
other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying value because the
instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

14.3 Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below:

Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices
respectively. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact that they are managed
on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will
generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with
hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data. For those assets and liabilities
where the firm is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for
certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), the mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a
transaction cost.
 
Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair
value of counterparty credit risk, the Group's own credit quality, as well as the cost of funding across all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the Group's model governance framework. This process identifies the assumptions
used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). Where necessary, fair
value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation adjustments are dependent on the size
of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all
known risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis. 

14.4  Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group's assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair
value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

14.6.1 Significant transfers between levels

During the 2018 and 2017 reporting periods, transfers between levels occurred because of changes in the observability
of valuation inputs, in some instances owing to changes in the level of market activity. Transfers have been reflected
as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

14.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs

As part of the Group's risk management processes, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the significant unobservable
parameters, in order to determine the impact of reasonably possible alternative assumptions on the valuation of level 3
financial assets and liabilities. The assets and liabilities that most impact this sensitivity analysis are those with
more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The alternative assumptions are applied independently and do not take account
of any cross correlation between assumptions that would reduce the overall effect on the valuations.

The following tables reflects the reasonable possible variances applied to significant parameters utilised in our
valuations:

Credit spreads                                   100/(100) bps

Yield curves and repo curves                     100/(100) bps                                         
Future earnings and marketability discounts      15/(15)%                                              
Funding spreads                                  100/(100) bps                                         

A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to profit or loss, or a change in the
fair value asset or liability by more than 10% of the underlying value of the affected item. This is demonstrated by the
following sensitivity analysis which includes reasonable range of possible outcomes:

(1) The gains and losses from banking and trading activities on investment securities have been restated to include
unrealised gains on unlisted Private Equity investments, resulting in an increase of R27.61m. Previously only unrealised
gains relating to unobservable corporate bonds were taken into account in the disclosure, and has therefore been
corrected accordingly.

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the
discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered unobservable inputs
for items which mature after 5 years. However, if the items mature in less than 5 years, these inputs are considered to
be observable, depending on other facts and circumstances.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying price of the
market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to the
unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.

15. Reporting changes overview
A number of key financial reporting changes were effected during the current reporting period, including the adoption
of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9, and a consequential amendment to IAS 1. The Group elected to amend its accounting policy with
regards to the presentation of interest expense, so as to align to the amendment for the presentation of effective interest
under the IAS 1 amendment. In addition, the Group elected to amend its internal accounting policy governing the
valuation of policyholder liabilities under the Group's life insurance contracts. 

Implementation of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):
* IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) - The Group has applied IFRS 9 on a retrospective basis, with an adjustment to
retained earnings and other reserves as at 1 January 2018. As permitted under IFRS 9, the Group has elected not to
restate comparative periods.
* IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) - The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15 using the
cumulative effect method, under which the comparative information has not been restated. 
Amendments to IFRS:
* A change to the presentation of interest income, as required by an amendment to IAS 1. This amendment has resulted
in the presentation of effective interest income as a separate line item within profit or loss on the face of the
statement of comprehensive income.
Amendments to internal accounting policies:
* In addition to the amendment required to the presentation of effective interest income under IAS 1, the Group has
voluntarily elected to bifurcate both interest income and interest expense, as presented on the face of the statement of
comprehensive income. Further, the Group has voluntarily elected to restate the prior reporting period, and
* A change in the valuation method applied to policyholder liabilities under the Group's life insurance contracts.

Correction of prior period error:
* The Group determined that certain intra-day 'due for settlement accounts' in respect of long and short proprietary
positions with the JSE have been incorrectly netted in prior reporting periods, notwithstanding the fact that these
accounts are not permitted to be net settled. Correction of this error did not have an impact on profit or loss, or equity,
but it did result in a gross up of other assets and other liabilities.

The most significant reporting change effected during the current period was the adoption of IFRS 9. The project has
been one of strategic importance to the Group over the past 5 years, with extensive work being performed in building new
models, and developing the necessary infrastructure and data management systems to deliver a high-quality implementation
on 1 January 2018. A natural concomitant of adopting any new IFRS, particularly one of this level of complexity, is the
evolution of technical interpretation, particularly in areas where diversity has been identified and challenged. There
are two areas of technical interpretation which have evolved since the publication of the Group's IFRS 9 transitional
disclosures within this report, as at 30 June 2018. These are as follows:

* Exclusion of post write-off recoveries (PWOR) from loss given default (LGD) modelling: IFRS 9 provides that financial assets
should be written off, and accordingly derecognised, when the Group believes there to be no reasonable expectation of
recovery. The Group has well-governed internal policies, which define how an individual account should be assessed for
write-off, and ensure that post write-off recoveries remain insignificant over the long run. Further, the policies are
recalibrated over time, as and when actual recovery experience changes. Whilst the Group's write-off policy determines the
point of derecognition at an individual account level, it also impacts the level of recoveries modelled on a collective
basis for the purposes of determining the LGDs to be applied at a portfolio level.  The Group's LGD models have
historically included the present value of all forecast recoveries on a pool of loans, over the full life of such loans, thereby
including cash flows which would otherwise be classified as post-write off recoveries, from an accounting perspective. 

The IFRS 9 requirements for write-off have been one of the most robustly debated topics following the global banking
industry's adoption of IFRS 9. Whilst the guidance regarding derecognition under IFRS 9 remains largely unchanged from
IAS 39, IFRS 9 does explicitly provide that write-off constitutes a derecognition event. The IASB's intention in drafting
IFRS 9, and specifically with regards to the treatment of post write-off recoveries in the calculation of LGD, has been
the subject of extensive technical debate across the industry. This matter has not however been formally tested through
international accounting forums, such as the IFRS-IC and the IFRS 9 Transition Resource Group. However, in line with
evolving IFRS 9 technical interpretation, the Group has reconsidered the approach previously applied to LGD modelling for
accounting purposes. The Group believes that under IFRS 9, the write-off assumptions should be consistently applied at
both an individual account level and on a collective modelling basis. Accordingly, the Group will adjust the original
treatment it applied as at 1 January 2018. The exclusion of post write-off recoveries from LGD, under IFRS 9, has resulted 
in a significant increase in the allowance for ECL recognised in the statement of financial position, as at 1 January
2018. The restated allowance for ECL is R29 703m (including interest in suspense and ECL provision on financial guarantee
contracts, letters of credit and undrawn facilities), relative to the amount of R27 767m as previously published.  This
has further resulted in a reduction in the Group's retained income as at 1 January 2018 of R1 307m (after taxation
adjustment of R491m and non-controlling interest of R138m). The 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 transition disclosures previously
published in the 30 June 2018 report have been restated. The change in valuation methodology did not have a significant 
impact on the credit losses recognised during the current reporting period, since the impact on both the 1 January 2018 
and 31 December 2018 ECL allowances, were of a similar magnitude. Please refer to section http://15.1.2.6 for further information.  

* Interest recoveries on cured stage 3 financial assets: IFRS 9 requires interest income on stage 3 assets to be
calculated based on the net carrying value of the exposure, that is, the gross carrying value less the ECL allowance. In
order to practically give effect to this requirement, the Group first suspends the recognition of contractual interest, and
second, multiplies the net carrying value by the effective interest rate (EIR). Interest income recognised on stage 3
assets will therefore be less than the contractual interest charged. In some instances, the Group may recover contractual
interest which is in excess of that previously recognised under IFRS 9. This prompted extensive industry debate
regarding whether such excess should be presented as a credit impairment gain, reflecting a credit recovery event, or as
interest income, reflecting recovery of interest in the ordinary course of business. A request for clarification regarding 
this IFRS 9 requirement was submitted by the banking industry through the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants
(SAICA) to the IFRS-IC in August 2018. At the IFRS-IC meeting held in November 2018, the committee observed that any
unrecognised interest, which is subsequently recovered, should be presented as a credit impairment gain.  Since such
clarification was only provided post the Group's 30 June 2018 reporting date, the Group had elected to present an amount of 
R292m as interest income over the reporting period ending 30 June 2018. It was the Group's view that presentation of the
recovered interest previously unrecognised as a credit impairment gain would understate, and accordingly distort, the Group's
ECL. The Group has however amended its accounting treatment following the decision made by the IFRS-IC. The accounting
treatment does not impact profit or loss, but it does reduce both the Group's ECL and interest income. As at 31 December
2018, the interest recoveries on cured stage 3 assets amounted to R608m and was presented within ECL as a credit
impairment gain. This is discussed further in section http://15.1.2.8.

Other less significant amendments to IFRS became effective during the current reporting period, although these had no
impact on the financial results of the Group. These amendments relate to IAS 40 Investment Property, IAS 28 Investment
in Associates and Joint Ventures, as well as IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Transactions (IFRS 2). The changes to IFRS 2 were
however early adopted by the Group in 2016. A new IFRS-IC Interpretation, IFRS-IC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and

(1) The Group has restated the 1 January 2018 ECL allowance, and the related effects on retained income, which it
    previously presented in this report, as at 30 June 2018. Under this amendment, which follows from the adoption of 
    IFRS 9, post write-off recoveries have been excluded from LGD, thereby resulting in a reduction of R1 307m in 
    retained income as at 1 January 2018.

15. 1. Initial adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
15.1.1. Overview and highlights
http://15.1.1.1. The impact of IFRS 9 on the Group
IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2018 and introduces significant changes to three fundamental areas of the
accounting for financial instruments, namely;
* The classification and measurement of financial instruments;
* The scope and calculation of credit losses, which has moved from an incurred loss, to an expected credit loss (ECL)
approach; and
* The hedge accounting model.

Whilst the adoption of a revised classification and measurement framework has had a less material impact on the Group,
application of the IFRS 9 ECL methodology has affected both the financial and regulatory capital position, and can be
reasonably expected to impact the net profit or loss of the Group going forward.

In accordance with the transition options allowable under IFRS 9, the Group will continue to apply the hedge
accounting requirements set out in IAS 39. The Group employs a governed hedging programme to reduce margin volatility 
associated with structural balances (that is, rate insensitive liabilities as well as the endowment associated with equity).
Operational complexity would be introduced by adopting the revised IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements ahead of the
finalisation of the IASB's Dynamic Risk Management project in respect of macro hedging. The Group has accordingly elected
not to adopt the revised IFRS 9 hedge requirements.

http://15.1.1.2. The impact of adopting a revised classification and measurement framework for financial instruments
A portfolio of South African consumer price index (CPI) linked investment securities have been reclassified from
available-for-sale under IAS 39, to amortised cost under IFRS 9. This aligns the portfolio's classification with the Group's
business model of holding the instruments to collect contractual cash flows. Other less significant reclassifications of
financial assets were also recorded, although these did not have any impact on equity (refer to section 15.1.10). The
accounting for financial liabilities remains largely unchanged, except for financial liabilities designated at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL). Gains and losses on such financial liabilities are required to be presented in other
comprehensive income (OCI), to the extent that they relate to changes in own credit risk. The Group early adopted this
requirement in 2017, and therefore recognised a debit of R147m in OCI in that reporting period.

http://15.1.1.3. The impact of adopting a revised ECL methodology
The adoption of IFRS 9 will impact the timing of credit loss recognition, by accelerating the recognition of losses
relative to IAS 39, and potentially creating increased volatility through the incorporation of forward looking
assumptions. From an economic perspective, total long-run credit losses incurred by the Group will not be impacted by 
the change in accounting framework. The Group dedicates considerable resources to gaining a clear and accurate understanding 
of credit risk across the business and to correctly reflecting the value of the assets in accordance with applicable accounting
principles. The core processes remain the measurement of exposures and concentrations, performance monitoring and
tracking of asset quality, and the write-off of assets in accordance with the Group's credit risk policies.

http://15.1.1.4. Summary of the impact of IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018
The disclosures set out within this section of the report serve to bridge the statement of financial position of the
Group as at 1 January 2018 between IAS 39 and IFRS 9. Information has been provided to facilitate an understanding of the
key areas of difference, as well as the core drivers of ECL going forward. The Group highlights the role that unexpected 
changes in forward looking assumptions may play in driving earnings volatility, and that changes in stage distribution
could have an impact on net interest income. Exposures within certain industry sectors or products are expected to be
more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions than others, which could mean that the overall response to changes
in forward looking assumptions is driven by the relative composition of the loans and advances portfolios.

The adoption of IFRS 9 has impacted the financial and regulatory capital position of the Group, as follows:
* The Group's ECL allowance has increased from R21 899m as at 31 December 2017 to an amount of R29 703m as at
1 January 2018. This includes the provision recognised in respect of off-statement of financial position items. The ECL
allowance post the adoption of IFRS 9, as previously reported, was R27 767m. The exclusion of post write-off recoveries has
therefore increased the ECL allowance post adoption by R1 936m.
* Retained income decreased by R5 413m (net after a taxation adjustment of R2 063m and a decrease in non-controlling
interest of R328m). The impact of IFRS 9 on retained income, as at 1 January 2018, was previously reported to be 
R4 106m, with a tax adjustment of R1 572m, and a decrease in non-controlling interest of R190m). The net impact on retained
income of excluding post write-off recoveries is therefore R 1 307m.
* Other reserves decreased by R126m (previously reported R95m), owing principally to the reclassification of
investment securities from available-for-sale to amortised cost.
* The Group remains strongly capitalised notwithstanding a R3 456m decrease in CET 1 (previously reported to be 
R2 118m) and a 28 bps decrease in the CET1 ratio (previously reported 21 bps). The decrease of 28 bps is the amount 
determined before the application of the transitional arrangement elected by the Group, which will spread the CET 1 
impact over three years. This deferral reduces the impact on the CET 1 ratio on the date of initial adoption to 7 bps 
(previously reported 5 bps).

15.1.2. Key elements of the revised impairment model under IFRS 9
http://15.1.2.1. Introduction
IFRS 9 introduces an ECL impairment model that requires entities to recognise ECL based on a stage allocation
methodology, with such categorisation informing the level of provisioning required. The ECL allowance calculated on stage 1
assets reflects the lifetime losses associated with events of default that are expected to occur within 12 months of the
reporting date (12 month ECL). Assets classified within stage 2 and stage 3 carry an ECL allowance calculated based on the
lifetime losses associated with defaults that are expected to occur over the lifetime of the exposure (lifetime ECL).
The assessment of whether an exposure should be transferred from stage 1 to stage 2, is a relative measure, where the
credit risk at the reporting date is compared to the risk that existed at initial recognition. 

The stage allocation is required to be performed as follows: 
* Stage 1: Stage 1 assets comprise exposures which are performing in line with expectations at origination. Financial
assets that are not purchased or originated with a credit impaired status are required to be classified on initial
recognition within stage 1.
* Stage 2: Exposures are required to be classified within stage 2 when a significant increase in credit risk has been
observed. The factors which trigger a reclassification from stage 1 to stage 2 have been defined so as to meet the
specific requirements of IFRS 9, and in order to align with the Group's credit risk management practices. These are 
discussed further in section http://15.1.2.3.
* Stage 3: Credit exposures are classified within stage 3, when they are regarded as being credit impaired, which
aligns to the bank's regulatory definition of default. Purchased or originated credit impaired lending facilities are
classified on the date of origination within stage 3. This definition is discussed further in section http://15.1.2.3.

http://15.1.2.2. Definition of a significant increase in credit risk
The Group uses various quantitative, qualitative and back stop measures as indicators of a significant increase in
credit risk. The thresholds applied for each portfolio are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain appropriate.
Where evidence of a significant increase in credit risk is not yet available at an individual instrument level,
instruments which share similar risk characteristics are assessed on a collective basis. 

Key drivers of a significant increase in credit risk include:  
* Where the weighted average PD for an individual exposure or group of exposures as at the reporting date evidences a
material deterioration in credit quality, relative to that determined on initial recognition;
* Adverse changes in payment status, and where accounts are more than 30 days in arrears at reporting date. In certain
portfolios a more conservative arrears rule is applied where this is found to be indicative of increased credit risk
(e.g. 1 day in arrears);
* Accounts in the Retail portfolio which meet the portfolio's impairment high risk criteria; and
* The Group's watch list framework applied to the Wholesale portfolio, which is used to identify customers facing
financial difficulties or where there are grounds for concern regarding their financial health.

Stage 2 assets are considered to be cured (that is, reclassified back into stage 1), when there is no longer evidence
of a significant increase in credit risk, and a defined period of performance has been observed. The definition of high
risk is, from a credit management perspective central to controlling the flow of exposures back to stage 1 and gives
effect to any cure periods deemed necessary.

http://15.1.2.3. Definition of credit impaired assets
Assets classified within stage 3 are considered to be credit impaired, which, as discussed in section http://15.1.2.1 applies
when an exposure is in default. Whilst IAS 39 does not prescribe any alignment between the accounting and regulatory
definition of default, this has been implemented by the Group as an amendment under IFRS 9. This departure from IAS 39 has
resulted in a large increase in the number of exposures which are classified within stage 3, and accordingly within
accounting default. 

The default definition applied within Wholesale and Retail is now aligned with the regulatory definition, and
therefore assets are classified as defaulted when either:
* The Group considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations without recourse by the Group to
actions such as realising security. Elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include the following:
* The Group consents to a distressed restructuring/forbearance of the credit obligation where this is likely to
result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness of principal, interest or fees;
* The customer is under debt review, business rescue or similar protection; or,
* Advice is received of customer insolvency or death.
* The obligor is past due 90 days or more on any credit obligation to the Group.

Further, within the Retail portfolios, two additional requirements for the classification of default are applied.
These have historically been included as criteria for determining whether default exists from a regulatory perspective, 
but not from an accounting perspective under IAS 39:
* Assets within forbearance/debt counselling are treated as in default, regardless of whether the restructure has led
to a diminished financial obligation or not; and
* The Group requires an exposure to reflect 12 consecutive months of performance, in order to be considered to have
cured from default.

Defaulted assets are considered to be cured once the original event triggering default no longer applies, and the
defined probation period (that is, the required consecutive months of performance) have been met. In the Retail portfolio,
the cure definition applied, per the credit risk management policy is stringent, and assets will typically only cure from
stage 3 to stage 2, and therefore won't normally move directly from stage 3 to stage 1. In the Wholesale portfolio
assets can move from stage 3 directly to stage 1.

http://15.1.2.4. Determination of the lifetime of a credit exposure
The point of initial recognition and asset duration (lifetime) are critical judgements to be applied in determining
the quantum of lifetime losses to be recognised. The date of initial recognition reflects the date that a transaction (or
account) was first recognised on the statement of financial position. The PD recorded at this time provides the baseline
used for subsequent determination of a significant increase in credit risk.
  
In defining the period over which the entity is typically exposed to credit risk, but for which the ECL would not be
mitigated by the entity's normal credit risk management actions, the Group considers the results of collective data
modelling and the evidence accordingly provided of:
* The period over which the entity is exposed to credit risk on similar financial instruments;
* The length of time for related defaults to occur on similar financial instruments following a significant increase
in credit risk; and 
* The credit risk management actions that an entity expects to take once the credit risk on the financial instrument
has increased, such as the reduction or removal of undrawn limits.

For asset duration, the approaches which are applied (in line with IFRS 9 requirements) are:
* Term lending: the contractual maturity date, reduced for behavioural trends where appropriate (such as, expected
settlement and amortisation); and
* Revolving facilities: for Retail portfolios, asset duration is based on behavioural life and this is normally
greater than contractual life. For Wholesale portfolios, a sufficiently long period to cover expected life modelled 
and an attrition rate is applied to cater for early settlement.

http://15.1.2.5. Write-off policy
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset shall be directly reduced (that is, written off) when the entity has
no reasonable expectations of recovering it in its entirety, or a portion thereof. A write-off constitutes a
derecognition event for accounting purposes. Depending on the nature of the account, balances are written off when: 
* There has been less than one qualifying payment received within the last 12 months; or
* It is no longer economically viable to keep the debt on the statement of financial position.

A qualifying payment, for use in the write-off assessment, is defined as the minimum monthly contractual payment due.

Indicators which suggest that an account is not economically viable to retain on the statement of financial position
are as follows (but do not represent an exhaustive list):
* The exposure is unsecured i.e. there is no tangible security the Group can claim against (excluding suretyships); 
* The debt has prescribed; 
* The exposure would attract reputational risk should the Group pursue further legal action due to the valuation/
exposure ratio, for example where the exposure is low and the valuation is very high in relation to the low exposure; or
* Where the cost to recover is high in relation to the valuation of the asset, for example legal, realisation and
safe-guarding cost and rates and taxes. 

Under IFRS 9, the Group applies the write-off assumptions consistently at both an individual account level and on a
collective modelling basis. This means that the Group's LGD model includes only the present value of forecast recoveries
on a pool of loans up until the designated point of write-off. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are
recognised as an ECL gain in the statement of comprehensive income as and when the cash is received.

http://15.1.2.6. General IFRS 9 ECL parameters and modelling approach
15.1.2.6.1 Introduction
The estimate of ECL is required to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate of future losses, which
should be determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. In some cases, relatively simple modelling is considered to
be sufficient, without the need to consider the outcome under different scenarios. For example, the average credit
losses of a large group of financial instruments with shared risk characteristics may be a reasonable estimate of the
probability-weighted amount. In other situations, the identification of scenarios that specify the amount and timing of the
cash flows for particular outcomes and the estimated probability of those outcomes will be needed.  The IFRS 9 models make
use of three parameters namely PD, LGD and EAD in the calculation of the ECL allowance. 

Expert credit judgement may, in certain instances be applied to account for situations where known or expected risk
factors have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process, or where uncertain future events have not
been incorporated into the modelled approach. Adjustments are intended to be short term measures and will not be used to
incorporate any continuous risk factors. The Group has a robust policy framework which is applied in the estimation and
approval of management adjustments. 

Models are validated with the same rigor applied to regulatory models. Testing procedures assess the quality of data,
conceptual soundness and performance of models, model implementation and compliance with accounting requirements.

15.1.2.6.2 Probability of default (PD)
The PD is the likelihood of default assessed based on the prevailing economic conditions at the reporting date (that
is, at a point in time), adjusted to take into account estimates of future economic conditions that are likely to impact
the risk of default and it will not therefore equate to a long run average. For IFRS 9 purposes, two distinct PD
estimates are required:
* 12 month PD: the likelihood of accounts entering default within 12 months of the reporting date.
* Lifetime PD: the likelihood of accounts entering default during the remaining life of the asset.

15.1.2.6.3 Loss given default (LGD)
LGD is defined as the percentage loss rate suffered by a lender on a credit exposure if the obligor defaults. In other
words, even if the counterparty fails to repay the amount owed, the lender will usually succeed in recovering some
percentage of the current amount owed in the process of workout or sale of the obligor's assets. This percentage is termed
the recovery rate (RR), that is, the following relation holds: RR = 1 - LGD. LGD can be estimated on the basis of
historical data on realised losses. 

The modelling of loan behavior and cash recoveries on a collective basis has, theoretically, a risk diversification
effect which would cause the inclusion of some recoveries that would technically be defined as post write-off recoveries
at an individual account level. Due to this fact, collective data modelling has historically been considered to more
appropriately represent the forecast performance of a portfolio of loans, which is influenced by prepayments, late payments,
PD, LGD and modifications. To illustrate this point, consider the assessment of whether an individual home loan will be
prepaid. The entity may observe prepayment behaviour across its home loans portfolio, but might find it difficult to
ascribe a probability of prepayment to an individual account.

From a regulatory perspective LGD parameters are modelled by forecasting full lifetime economic losses over the
duration of the portfolio. Accordingly, the points of write-off applied at an individual account level (for example, 12 months
of no payments), would not necessarily be aligned with those incorporated into the regulatory LGD models (which would
include recoveries on a derecognised accounts received beyond the 12 month write-off period). In line with the regulatory
treatment of LGD, and in the absence of clear accounting guidance regarding the treatment under IAS 39, this approach
has historically been accepted as a more appropriate manner in which to present the accounting performance on a portfolio
of loans with similar characteristics, predominantly in the retail portfolios. 

Whilst the guidance regarding derecognition under IFRS 9 remains largely unchanged from IAS 39, IFRS 9 does specifically 
provide that write-off constitutes a derecognition event. This has prompted the Group to reconsider the treatment of
post write-off recoveries in the calculation of accounting LGD. In line with evolving IFRS 9 technical interpretation,
the Group has resolved to amend the approach historically applied to LGD modelling for accounting purposes. The Group
believes that under IFRS 9, the write-off assumptions should be consistently applied at both an individual account level
and on a collective modelling basis. The decision to exclude post write-off recoveries from the LGD models applied across
the Group's portfolios has resulted in a significant increase in the allowance for ECL recognised in the statement of
financial position, as at 1 January 2018. The ECL allowance as previously published has increased from R27 767m to a
restated amount of R29 703m (including the ECL provision on financial guarantee contracts, letters of credit and undrawn
facilities). This means that the total increase in the allowance for ECL under IFRS 9 is 36% (27% previously published)
greater than the impairment allowance under IAS 39. This has resulted in a reduction in the Group's retained income as at
1 January 2018 of R1 307m (from the previously published reduction in retained earnings of R4 106m, to a restated
reduction amount of R5 413m). 

This change does not reflect a worsening of the Group's view of credit quality, and full lifetime losses are not
expected to change with this adoption. The regulatory treatment of LGD remains unchanged.

In calculating LGD, losses are discounted to the reporting date using the EIR determined at initial recognition or an
approximation thereof. For debt instruments, such as loans and advances, the discount rate applied is the EIR calculated
on origination or acquisition date. For financial guarantee contracts or loan commitments for which the EIR cannot be
determined, losses are discounted using a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and
the risks that are specific to the cash flows (to the extent that such risks have not already been taken into account
by adjusting the cash shortfalls).

15.1.2.6.4 Exposure at default (EAD)
The EAD model estimates the exposure that an account is likely to have at any point of default in future. This
incorporates both the amortising profile of a term loan, as well as behavioural patterns such as the propensity of the client
to draw down on unutilised facilities in the lead up to a default event. 

http://15.1.2.7. Interaction of the IFRS 9 ECL model with the Basel Framework
The Group applies both the standardised approach (TSA) and advanced internal ratings-based (AIRB) approaches to
calculate its regulatory capital requirements relating to credit risk. While, the Group's operations across ARO as well as the
Edcon portfolio are subject to the TSA approach, the remaining portfolios are subject to the AIRB approach, which
applies the Group's own measures of PD, EAD and LGD. In designing IFRS 9 compliant ECL models, the Group recognised that it
could leverage, specifically within Wholesale South Africa, on the data used by the regulatory models to model IFRS 9 ECL
and encourage easier reconciliation of inputs for capital requirement and impairment calculations.

Existing Basel models were used as a starting point to develop IFRS 9 ECL parameters. The following are key
differences to the regulatory capital parameters:

http://15.1.2.8. Impact of IFRS 9 on interest
15.1.2.8.1 Impact on the statement of comprehensive income
IFRS 9 requires interest income to be calculated on stage 1 or stage 2 financial assets by multiplying the effective
interest rate (EIR) by the gross carrying amount of such assets. Hypothetically, should the EIR per IFRS 9 equal the
contractual interest rate charged, any interest income recognised will be aligned with the amount charged to the client 
as per the Group's product system. In contrast to the treatment of stage 1 and stage 2 assets, IFRS 9 requires interest
income on stage 3 financial assets to be calculated based on the net carrying value of the exposure, that is, the gross
carrying value less the ECL allowance. In order to practically give effect to this requirement, the Group first suspends 
the recognition of contractual interest, and second, multiplies the net carrying value by the EIR. Interest income
recognised on stage 3 assets will therefore be less than the amount of contractual interest charged. In principle, this means
that an exposure classified within stage 3 will realise lower interest income than that which would be recognised had it
been classified within stage 1 or stage 2 over the same period.

Cured stage 3 assets
In some instances, an entity may recover cash flows which are in excess of the cumulative interest previously
suspended over the life of the instrument. The accounting treatment to be applied when interest is recovered on a
credit-impaired financial asset which subsequently cures (that is, when it is paid in full or is no longer credit-impaired), 
prompted a significant amount of technical debate during the current reporting period. The Group elected to present such excess
interest received, amounting to R292m, within interest income, and not as a gain within ECL in its 30 June 2018 financial
results.  

The existence of diverging interpretations across the local industry prompted a formal request for clarification to be
made by SAICA to the IFRS-IC. In a meeting held on 27 November 2018, the IFRS-IC observed that the curing of the asset is a
credit recovery event and that interest previously unrecognised, should be presented as a credit impairment gain, and
not as interest income.  

Application of the revised accounting treatment observed by the IFRS-IC to be correct resulted in an amount of R608m
being presented as a gain within credit impairment losses, and accordingly, resulted in a reduction in interest income.
There is no related corresponding amount presented for 2017 as this relates to the new presentation requirements of IFRS 9
which is being applied from 1 January 2018.

15.1.2.8.2 Impact on the statement of financial position
Under IFRS 9, Interest in Suspense (IIS) is required to be presented as part of both the gross carrying value of the 
financial instrument and the related ECL allowance. Under IAS 39, cumulative suspended interest was not reflected on the 
statement of financial position at all. Accordingly, under IFRS 9, both the gross carrying value and the ECL allowance will 
be larger than it was under IAS 39, however, this amendment will not impact the net carrying value of the exposure.

Had the revised presentation requirement been applied as at 31 December 2017, the Group would have recognised a larger
gross carrying value, and a larger impairment allowance of R3 025m.

(3) 'IFRS 9 transaction adjustment' is calculated as 'Total IFRS 9 provision (including IIS)' less 'Total IAS 39
    (including IIS)'.

The measurement of the ECL allowance is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future
outcomes, which are factored into the PD and LGD models, as well as applied in determining whether a significant
increase in credit risk has occurred.

Key drivers of the ECL allowance are as follows:
* Interest in suspense: The cumulative interest which was suspended, and therefore not presented as part of the
impairment allowance as at 31 December 2017, amounted to R3 025m. As at the date of initial adoption this has been included
in the opening impairment allowance, with an equivalent increase in the gross carrying value of the financial assets.

* Removal of post write-off recoveries from LGD: The Group has adopted a revised approach to the collective data
modelling of LGD, and has specifically excluded post write-off recoveries from the forecast recoverable cash flows. This is
an amendment under IFRS 9, and has resulted in an increase in the ECL allowance as at 1 January 2018.

* Change in emergence period of stage 1 assets: The emergence period under IAS 39 was calculated as the average time
between when a loss event occurred and the impairment event was actually identified, and was typically 12 months or less.
An increase in the ECL allowance has been observed and is attributable to the period under IFRS 9 being defined as 12
months (or less if the contractual period is less than 12 months) on stage 1 assets.  

* Significant increase in credit loss for stage 2 classification: Under IAS 39, stage 2 assets were classified as
performing exposures with an impairment allowance being recognised to reflect latent risks, and calculated based on an
appropriate emergence period. Under IFRS 9, lending exposures that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk
since origination are required to carry a lifetime ECL allowance. 

* Change in default definition: The definition of credit impaired is aligned with the regulatory definition of
default, which has resulted in a larger population of credit exposures being classified within stage 3 compared to the NPL
population under IAS 39.  The differences have been discussed further in section 5 include the application of a 90 day
backstop, as well as a widening of the watch list categories included within stage 3, relative to those that were
specifically impaired under IAS 39. Further, all debt counselling and performing forbearance accounts are included in stage 3, but
were not previously classified as NPL. 

* Off-balance sheet exposures: The credit risk inherent in the undrawn component of lending facilities are managed and
monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single exposure. The exposure at default (EAD) on the
entire facility is therefore used to calculate the ECL on loans and advances. For this reason, it is not possible to
identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is
recognised in the ECL allowance for the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the
financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a provision on the face of the statement of financial position. A
provision of R426m was recognised on 1 January 2018.  

The Group presents the ECL on financial guarantees and letters of credit as a provision on the statement of financial
position. This provision has been presented as part of the IFRS 9 ECL allowance for the purposes of illustrating the
full effects of applying a revised methodology. As at 1 January 2018, the provision calculated in respect of these
exposures was R148m. 

* The calculation of ECL on other assets: Cash reserves with central banks and investment securities are included
within the scope of IFRS 9 ECL and have contributed R193m to the Group's total ECL allowance.

15.1.4. Analysis of the ECL allowance as at 1 January 2018
http://15.1.4.1. Summary of ECL coverage by segment and class of credit exposure
The following table provides an analysis of the total ECL allowance by market segment, and per stage distribution. For
credit exposures disclosed on the statement of financial position, the gross carrying value of on-statement of
financial position exposures includes only the amounts that were drawn, as at 1 January 2018, whilst the allowance for ECL
includes expected losses (EL) on committed, undrawn lending facilities. To the extent that the ECL allowance exceeds the
carrying value of the drawn exposure, a liability (provision) has been recognised in the statement of financial position.

http://15.1.5.1. Adoption of IFRS 9 and its impact on the Group's regulatory capital (unaudited)
15.1.5.1.1.  Increase in ECL provision under IFRS 9
The adoption of the revised IFRS 9 ECL model has reduced shareholders equity by R7 804m (previously reported: R5 868m) 
which is partially offset by the recognition of a net tax credit of R2 063m (previously reported: R1 572m). The tax 
credit includes current and deferred tax.

15.1.5.1.2.  Release of ECL shortfall to credit provisions
For reporting periods up to 31 December 2017, the calculation of capital took into account the regulatory expected
loss for performing assets, which was greater than the IAS 39 provision, thereby resulting in an additional deduction
against CET 1 to the extent of the shortfall in the accounting provision. Under IFRS 9, the accounting ECL allowance has
increased resulting in the elimination of the shortfall. This is reflected in the above reconciliation as a reversal of the
previous deduction and has the effect of partially reducing the negative impact of IFRS 9 ECL on regulatory capital. 

15.1.5.1.3. Recognition of a higher deferred tax asset balance
As discussed in point 15.1.5.1.1, the carrying value of the Group's deferred tax asset balance has increased, driven
by an increase in the ECL provision. The reclassification of investment securities, as discussed below in 15.1. 5.1.4
resulted in a reversal of a deferred tax liability. The net effect has been an increase in risk weighted assets (RWA) 
of R3 922m (previously reported: R3 221m), and accordingly, a decrease in the CET1 ratio.

15.1.5.1.4.  Impact on other reserves under IFRS 9
Other reserves decreased by R126m (previously reported: R95m) (net of deferred tax) primarily as a result of a reclassification
from available-for-sale to amortised cost of a small portfolio of South African CPI linked investments so as to reflect
the Group's business model of holding the instruments to collect contractual cash flows. 

15.1.5.1.5.  Release of RWA on non-performing loans 
The alignment of the definition of default for both accounting and regulatory purposes resulted in a reduction of RWA
of R14 300m (previously reported: R7 421m) due to specific provisions (stage 3) being raised for an increased population of
exposures. The methodology applied in calculating default RWA's permits a bank to reduce the LGD of the defaulted exposure by
the bank's estimate of expected loss, represented by the bank's specific accounting provision. 

15.1.5.1.6.  Tier 2 eligible provisions
Under IFRS 9, the total stage 1 and stage 2 ECL provision calculated in respect of Group's AIRB portfolio exceeds the
regulatory EL. The excess is added back to Tier 2 capital, subject to a limit of 0.6% of the AIRB credit RWA. In respect
of the Group's standardised portfolio, the IFRS 9 general provision (stage 1 and stage 2) is added back to Tier 2
capital, subject to a limit of 1.25% of the standardised credit RWA. This has resulted in an increase in total capital of 
R1 885m.

15.1.5.1.7.  Impact of IFRS 9 ECL on leverage ratio
Key drivers of change in the leverage ratio as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 were a decrease in leverage exposure
and Tier 1 capital, mainly attributable to increased ECL provisions. This was however partly offset by the release of
the EL shortfall.

15.1.6. Drivers of the impairment charge under IFRS 9
IFRS 9 impacts the timing of loss recognition, but over time, the long run expected cash losses are driven by economic
and commercial factors, independent from the accounting framework applied. 

Differences in the timing of recognition of an impairment charge under IFRS 9 versus IAS 39 are attributed to, inter
alia:
* significant increases in credit risk causing a transfer of assets to stage 2 assets;
* significant changes in forwarding looking macroeconomic conditions leading to assets moving between stages; and
* the size of new business growth.

Significant increase in credit risk: Transfers of exposures to stage 2 are driven by significant deterioration in
credit quality, although a large stage 2 balance does not necessarily mean that the exposures have a poor default grade. An
important principle under IFRS 9 is that a significant increase in credit risk constitutes a measure of relative credit
risk, requiring the absolute credit quality of an exposure on origination to be compared against the absolute credit
quality at reporting date. Exposures classified within stage 2 may actually have a better credit quality than other assets
which remain in Stage 1. Further, owing to the Group's definition of credit impaired, and the inclusion of performing
forbearance accounts within stage 3, a credit impaired exposure may have a better credit quality than an exposure in stage
2. Notwithstanding this principle, should the Group's stage 2 population start growing, this could indicate that the
credit quality across the portfolio on reporting date may be worse than management had initially anticipated. 

Changes in forward looking assumptions: IFRS 9 requires forward-looking and historical information to be used in order
to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, as well as to determine the appropriate PDs
and LGDs to be applied. Transfers between stages could be driven by a deteriorating or improving macro-economic
environment, which could make the impairment charge more susceptible to volatility.

New business growth: One of the key changes under IFRS 9 is the recognition of ECL losses in respect of all exposures
on initial recognition, or on the date that the Group becomes irrevocably committed to providing a lending facility.
This means that growth in new business will strain profitability in the short to medium term, although over time the
realised economic returns should, all else being equal, remain unchanged from IAS 39.  

15.1.7. Impact of IFRS 9 on the Group's tax position 
The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a change in the timing of the recognition of credit losses, but does not impact
the value of credit losses ultimately incurred. Accordingly, the long run tax effect of credit losses and recoveries
are unchanged by the implementation of a new accounting framework. The change in the timing of loss recognition is
accounted for through the recognition of a deferred tax adjustment, calculated based on the statutory tax rate applicable.  

In South Africa, the value of the deferred tax asset (and corresponding impact on retained earnings and other
reserves) which was recognised on adoption of IFRS 9 was impacted by both a change in the accounting recognition of losses,
as well as a change in the tax legislation. In accordance with amended tax legislation issued by the South African Revenue
Service in 2017, the deduction permitted in respect of doubtful debt balances has changed to 25% for stage 1 ECL, 40% for
stage 2 ECL and 85% for stage 3 ECL. This is a change from the previous deductions under IAS 39, which were 25% of
incurred but not reported losses, 80% for portfolio specific impairments and 100% for specific impairments. A higher
deferred tax asset has therefore been driven by an increase in the ECL provision under IFRS 9, partially offset by a 
change in the South African tax treatment of pre-existing allowances.

15.1.8. Incorporation of forward-looking information in the IFRS 9 modelling
The Group's IFRS 9 impairment models consume macroeconomic information to enable the models to provide an output that
is based on forward looking information. The macro-economic variables and forecast scenarios are sourced from one of the
world's largest research companies, and are reviewed and approved in accordance with the Group's macroeconomic
governance framework. This review includes the testing of forecast estimates, the appropriateness of variables and 
probability weightings, as well as the incorporation of these forecasts into the ECL allowance. 

The Group has adopted the use of three economic scenarios: a base scenario, a mild upside scenario, and a mild
downside scenario. IFRS 9 requires the inclusion of point-in-time forward looking assumptions, and in respect of which the
application of hindsight is prohibited. The scenarios presented below are therefore reflective of the Group's view of
forecast economic conditions as at the date of initial adoption.

http://15.1.8.1.  Base scenario
Global
Global expansion is expected to remain broad-based across sectors and synchronised in developed economies. The outlook
on emerging market growth remains solid on the back of better growth in developed economies and rising commodity
prices. Developed market central banks continue tightening their monetary policies at a gradual pace in 2018-20 but 
this is not expected to be disruptive to emerging markets.

South Africa
The economy recovered from a weak growth at the start of 2017, on the back of growing agricultural output, but the
near-term outlook still remains moderate. GDP growth is forecast to marginally increase in 2018. Positive political
developments are observed, although the consumer remains in a defensive mindset, and household spending remains relatively
muted given tax increases. Beyond 2019, growth is supported by a stronger global and domestic environment. South Africa's
fiscal fortunes and potential ratings downgrade remain a concern over the forecast period. Disappointing growth could
result in low fiscal revenue that is expected to undershoot budget targets. No further interest rate cuts over the forecast
horizon are assumed.

Africa Regions
Sub-Saharan Africa's economic recovery continues although the trajectory is not smooth across all jurisdictions.
Headwinds that could still derail growth in some markets include low fiscal buffers and political risks ahead of elections 
in key markets this year. Countries with weak fiscal positions continue to necessitate close monitoring. Economic growth
is supported largely by a recovery in the agriculture sector, improved commodity output and prices, as well as more
accommodative monetary policy stances.

http://15.1.8.2.  Mild upside scenario: Stronger near term growth
Global
The global economy grows faster than expected, and is supported by fiscal stimulus in the United States (US), and a
quick negotiation of Britain's exit (Brexit) from the European Union (EU), which boosts global business confidence. 
Commodity prices rise sharply relative to the base scenario and the global financial markets improve. Globally, investor 
and consumer sentiment rises, due to the favorable financial environment.

South Africa
It is assumed there are no further rating downgrades. Policy and political stability boosts business confidence and
private sector fixed investment. We assumed a strong rand compared to the base scenario that is driven by the sovereign
rating being unchanged and the positive global sentiment toward emerging markets. Inflation moves lower on the back of the
stronger rand and continued moderation in food price inflation. Falling inflation and diminished risk at a domestic
level gives the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) room to provide stimulus to the economy by cutting interest rates to support 
the economy. The cumulative interest rate cuts, higher commodity prices and stronger global growth boost South Africa's GDP
growth. 

Africa Regions
A stronger global economy and higher commodity prices help support growth in African commodity exports and fixed
investments. The level of output remains above the baseline scenario. Inflation moves lower as currencies appreciate on the
back of capital flows and higher commodity prices supporting exports. Easing inflation allows central banks to lower
interest rates, supporting African economic growth further. 

http://15.1.8.3.  Mild downside scenario: Moderate recession
Global
The US economy slows relative to baseline due to delays in implementing the stimulus package promised before the
elections. Business and consumer confidence falls in the US, followed by stock market indices. It is assumed Brexit
negotiations take longer than expected, increasing uncertainty on financial markets, weighing on business and consumer
confidence. As a result, euro zone growth slows compared to baseline, contributing to economic and financial stress faced 
by some of the heavily indebted countries in the region. Furthermore, slower growth in key markets affects China's exports 
and result in its GDP.

South Africa
South Africa goes into recession on the back of weaker global growth environment and falling commodity prices. As a
result, government revenue comes under pressure and the finances of state owned enterprises deteriorate. Rating agencies
downgrade South Africa's sovereign rating further, resulting in capital outflow and rand weakness. The weakening of the
rand drives inflation above the SARB's 3-6% target range in 2018-2019, resulting in the SARB hiking the repurchase rate.
The yield curve moves higher in line with the selling of South African bonds and higher short-term rates. Economic
performance recovers slowly from 2020 as the weaker exchange rate builds some export competitiveness aiding in arresting some
of the rand's decline, and spending power returns slowly to consumers as inflation abates in the middle of 2020.

Africa Regions
In Sub-Saharan Africa some economies go into recession on the back of lower global growth and commodity prices. Fiscal
positions deteriorate further and political risks increase in some markets. Capital outflows and falling exports drive
currencies weaker, pushing inflation higher. Central banks intervene by hiking interest rates to help stem the flight of
capital and protect currencies.

15.1.9. The key elements of classification and measurement requirements under IFRS 9
IFRS 9 will require financial assets to be classified on the basis of two criteria:
* The business model within which financial assets are managed, and
* Their contractual cash flow characteristics, and specifically whether the cash flows represent Solely Payments of
Principal and Interest ('SPPI').

Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to
hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows meet the SPPI requirements.

Financial assets will be measured at FVOCI if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by
both collecting contractual cash flows as well as selling financial assets and their contractual cash flows meet the SPPI
requirements.

Other financial assets are required to be measured at FVPL if they are held for the purposes of trading, if their
contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI criterion, or if they are managed on a fair value basis and the Group maximises
cash flows through sale. IFRS 9 allows an entity to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if doing so
eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (that is, an accounting mismatch).

An entity is permitted to make an irrevocable election for non-traded equity investments to be measured at FVOCI, in
which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but other gains or losses remain in equity and are not
reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition.

Adoption of the new classification and measurement rules will require a limited number of reclassifications to be
effected as at 1 January 2018, but will not require a significant adjustment to the gross carrying values of the Group's
financial assets and financial liabilities. Initial application of the new requirements resulted in a decrease in reserves
of R140m (after tax) as at 1 January 2018. Explanations of the reclassifications that will be required are provided
below:

* A portfolio of consumer price index (CPI) linked investment securities within Treasury, have been reclassified from
available-for-sale under IAS 39, to amortised cost in terms of the Groups business model of holding the instruments to
collect contractual cash flows. Had these assets not been reclassified to amortised, the fair value of the instruments
would have been R5 630m, and a fair value loss of R151m would have been recognised in OCI during the reporting period. 

* Certain financial assets, including loans and advances in CIB and investments in WIMI were designated at FVTPL under
IAS 39 as they were managed on a fair value basis. In terms of IFRS 9, these assets are now required to be measured at
FVTPL, and noted as mandatory designations. 

* Certain debt securities are held by Treasury in a separate portfolio to meet everyday liquidity needs. These were
classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39. Treasury seeks to minimise the cost of managing liquidity needs and
therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. The return consists of collecting contractual cash flows as well as
gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The business model may result in sales activity and these instruments
have therefore been classified at FVOCI under IFRS 9. 

* In a particular jurisdiction within the Africa Regions, a small portfolio of debt securities held by Treasury have
been reclassified from available-for-sale to amortised cost as there is limited evidence of an ability to sell these
securities, and the portfolio is therefore aligned to a business model with the objective of collecting contractual cash
flows.

* Commodity-linked debt instruments within CIB, were previously bifurcated and separately recognised as a loan at
amortised cost and a derivative. These are now classified as FVTPL as their cash flows do not consist of SPPI.

* Debt securities held by insurance entities within the Africa Regions, have been reclassified from available-for-sale
to amortised cost. The objective of the portfolio is to collect contractual cash flows as the securities are neither
held within a portfolio whose business model is to manage the securities and evaluate their performance on a fair value
basis, nor is it possible to evidence an adequate frequency and volume of sales.

* In October 2017, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation.  Under the
current IFRS 9 requirements, the SPPI condition is not met if the lender has to make a settlement payment in the event of
termination by the borrower (also referred to as early repayment gain). The amendment clarifies how a company would
classify and measure a debt instrument if the borrower is permitted to prepay the instrument at an amount less than the
unpaid principal and interest owed. Under the amendments, the sign of the prepayment amount is not relevant. The
calculation of this compensation payment must be the same for both the case of an early repayment penalty and the case 
of an early repayment gain. This amendment is effective on 1 January 2019 and is not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group

15.1.11. Governance
http://15.1.11.1.  Implementation of IFRS 9  
The implementation of IFRS 9 has been completed through a jointly accountable risk and finance governance programme,
with representation from all impacted departments. A parallel run of IFRS 9 and IAS 39 was initiated in February 2017,
providing oversight for both IAS 39 and IFRS 9 impairment results. This included model, process and output validation,
testing, calibration and analysis. During the course of the programme there have been regular updates provided to the 
Group Audit Compliance Committee (GACC), who have approved key judgments and decisions.

http://15.1.11.2. Ongoing governance of IFRS 9  
The Group's basic risk management framework has not been altered due to the introduction of IFRS 9. The Group Credit
Impairment Committee (GCIC) remains the key management committee responsible for the governance of impairments as well as
the oversight of the Group's impairment position. The overall credit risk appetite also remains unchanged with all the
controls in place in the business for the extension and subsequent monitoring of credit exposure. It has however, been
necessary to develop new processes and related controls to support the calculation of the Group's ECL. In particular, new
governance processes have been established to review and approve the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions.

15.2. Adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)
IFRS 15, is effective from 1 January 2018, and replaces the previous revenue recognition standards and interpretations,
including IAS 18 Revenue and IFRS-IC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 establishes a single approach for the
recognition and measurement of revenue, and requires an entity to recognise revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.
It applies to all contracts with customers except for transactions specifically scoped out, which includes interest,
dividends, leases, and insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in a change in the accounting treatment
of a loyalty programme which resulted in a reduction in retained earnings of R44m, net of tax.
 
15.3. Accounting policy amendments
15.3.1. The accounting treatment of policyholder liabilities under life insurance contracts
During the current reporting period, the Group amended its accounting policy with respect to the measurement of
policyholder liabilities, and specifically, with regards to the calculation of discretionary margins held within policyholder
reserves. This change impacts life insurance products where the present value of expected benefit payments, plus the
future expected administration expenses under a life insurance contract, is lower than the expected discounted value of the
contractual premiums to be received. Prior to the change, the Group's policy was to eliminate all negative liabilities.
The policy has been changed to allow for discretion to be applied in full or partial elimination of negative liabilities 
in order to more appropriately provide for prudent reserving and release of profits. This policy change will address
scenarios where a loss is recognised in a reporting period solely as a consequence of incurring initial acquisition costs
despite the contract being expected to be profitable over its duration. In accordance with the revised policy, negative
liabilities will still be eliminated, to avoid the premature recognition of profits, however such elimination is only
applied to the excess remaining after adjusting for the product's initial acquisition costs. The change in accounting
policy has been applied retrospectively to the extent practicable, and comparatives restated accordingly.

The effects of the retrospective application are not determinable prior to 2014 and the change in accounting policy
has been applied from the start of the 2014 financial year.

The impact of this change on the Group's condensed statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 is set out
in the following table:

15.3.2. The presentation of net interest income
As a consequence of IFRS 9, an amendment was made to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which is effective
from 1 January 2018. The amendment requires interest revenue, which is calculated using the effective interest method, 
to be presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income. This only includes interest earned on
financial assets measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI, subject to the effects of applying hedge accounting to derivatives
in designated hedge relationships. In compliance with this amendment the Group has separately presented its effective
interest income within profit or loss, but elect to present all interest which fall outside the afore-mentioned scope 
as a sub-component of 'Interest and similar income"". The Group has elected to apply the same approach in presenting
'Interest expense and similar charges' to achieve consistency in the presentation of 'Net interest income'. The revised
presentation has been applied on a retrospective basis, to ensure comparability between reporting periods.

15.4. Correction of prior period error
The Group determined that certain due for settlement accounts in respect of long and short proprietary positions with
the JSE have been incorrectly netted in prior reporting periods, notwithstanding the fact that these accounts are not
permitted to be net settled. Correction of this error did not have an impact on profit or loss, or equity, but it did
result in a gross up of other assets and other liabilities in the previous reporting period of R3 616m (2016: R2 565m).

15.5. Changes to reportable segments and business portfolios
The South Africa Banking segment (which consisted of RBB (SA) and CIB (SA) in aggregate) has been removed in the
Group's segmental disclosures to align with how the banking operations are now managed.

Rest of Africa Banking was renamed to Absa Regional Operations (ARO) in order to align to the new Absa Group.

The following business portfolio changes resulted in the restatement of financial results for the comparative period.
None of the restatements have impacted the overall financial position or net earnings for the Group.

* The Group refined its treasury allocation methodology, resulting in the following restatements:
- Net interest income from CIB South Africa of R3m and Head Office, Treasury and other operations of R124m to RBB
South Africa R121m; 
- Non-interest income from Head Office, Treasury and other operations of R92m to CIB SA of R88m and RBB SA of R4m; and
* The Group continued refining its cost allocation methodology, resulting in restatement of operating expenses from
CIB South Africa R27m, WIMI R14m and Head Office, Treasury and other operations R4m to RBB South Africa R45m.

APPOINTMENT OF INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND CHANGE TO ABSA GROUP AND ABSA BANK
BOARDS (""THE BOARDS"")

In accordance with paragraphs 3.59 (b) and (c) of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are
informed that Maria Ramos will retire from Absa Group and Absa Bank at the end of February 2019.

Maria has been Group Chief Executive for 10 years and has led the Group through significant milestones,
including the aftermath of the global financial crisis and acquiring the Barclays Africa subsidiary banks in
2013. She had indicated a desire to step down earlier, but agreed to see the Group through the separation
negotiations with Barclays PLC, the ensuing sell-down and key separation milestones, including PLC
achieving regulatory deconsolidation and refreshing Absa's brand identity. With the separation on track
and our new strategy as a standalone financial institution in place, Maria feels that this is the right time to
retire. She has chosen to retire when she turns 60 in February and is eligible to do so.

The Boards have appointed René van Wyk as the Absa Group and Absa Bank Interim Chief Executive with
effect from 1 March 2019.

René has been an independent non-executive director on the Boards since February 2017. He was
previously the Registrar of Banks within the South African Reserve Bank and retired from that position in
May 2016. René had 19 years of experience with Nedbank, including as Executive Director of Risk for the
then listed Nedcor Investment Bank. He was also Chief Executive Officer of Imperial Bank.

René will remain on the Boards and will be classified as an executive director with effect from
1 February 2019. With immediate effect, he will no longer chair the risk and credit committees, which will
be chaired by Mark Merson, who is an independent non-executive director on the Absa Group Board. René
will remain a member of these committees in his capacity as executive director and will join other
committees commensurate with the role.
We will announce a permanent appointment to the position of Group Chief Executive in due course,
following the conclusion of the ongoing, rigorous selection process and the requisite regulatory approvals.

The Boards wish to thank Maria for a decade of dedicated service to our Group and wish her all the best in
her future endeavours.

ABSA GROUP PROVIDES MEDIUM-TERM FINANCIAL TARGETS

Absa Group hereby informs the market of our medium-term financial targets. These are based on our
current expectations for economic growth in South Africa and our presence countries in the rest of Africa.


Barring any unforeseen major macroeconomic or regulatory developments, our key targets include:
1) As part of our strategy emphasising growth and regaining leadership in our core businesses, we aim
    to grow our revenue faster, on average, than the SA bank sector from 2019 to 2021, with an
    improving trend over time and within appropriate risk appetite parameters;
2) Given this growth and continued cost management, we aim to consistently reduce our normalised
    cost-to-income ratio to reach the low 50s by 2021; and
3) We aim to achieve a normalised group return on equity of 18% to 20% by 2021, while maintaining an
    unchanged dividend policy.


We also reiterate our guidance for 2018, including that our normalised return on equity is expected to
increase slightly from our 16.5% in 2017.

ABSA GROUP LIMITED – BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2018

The quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 43 of the regulations
relating to Banks and previously issued Banks Act directives as well as the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision’s Revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements issued on 29 March 2017.

This disclosure is made in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as required by Regulation 3 of
the regulations relating to Banks. IFRS results include the impact of the contribution amounts received as part of the
separation from Barclays PLC. Normalised results, which exclude the impact of contribution amounts received from
Barclays PLC, are also included.

In accordance with SARB Directive 5 of 2017 (Directive 5), Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited have elected
to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9. As required by
Directive 5, both the fully loaded and transitional impacts of IFRS 9 are disclosed.

All prescribed tables are highlighted by including the regulatory title of the table in square brackets.

Capital Adequacy

Absa Group Limited

Absa Group Limited (or the Group) remains capitalised above the minimum regulatory capital requirements.

The Group continues to optimise the level and composition of capital resources. In line with this objective, the Group
will continue to raise Basel III compliant capital instruments as and when appropriate, in the domestic and/or
international capital markets.

Total capital supply has reduced over the quarter due to the payment of the 2018 interim dividend, offset by an
increase in unappropriated profits.

 The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

     -    Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R7.9bn (Group and Absa Bank
          Limited) due to balance sheet growth in Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) and Retail and Business
          Banking (RBB).
     -    CCR & CVA: The R3.8bn CCR and R2.3bn CVA decrease in RWA are primarily due to market volatility.
     -    Market Risk: The increase of R5.8bn (Group) and R6.0bn (Absa Bank Limited) is driven by market volatility
          and business requirements.
     -    Threshold items: Increase of R7.4bn (Group) is due to a revised treatment of insurance entities.

 In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, Absa Group Limited and Absa
 Bank Limited have moved from the recognition of credit losses on an incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss
 (ECL) basis. Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited have elected to utilise the transition period of three years for
 phasing in the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5.

Leverage Ratio


The leverage ratio framework is complementary to the risk-based capital framework and is a non-risk based
contingency measure to restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking sector.

The tables below represent the leverage ratios for Absa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited at 30 September 2018
and the comparatives for the past three quarter end periods, namely 30 June 2018, 31 March 2018 and 31 December

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of
banks by ensuring that they have sufficient unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) ) to cover net cash
outflows (NCOF) to survive a prescribed stress scenario over a 30 calendar day period. The LCR became effective
on 1 January 2015, with a requirement of 60%, which is being phased in by increasing the minimum regulatory
requirement by 10% per year to reach a minimum of 100% compliance level on 1 January 2019. The requirement for
2018 is 90% (2017: 80%).

Guidance Note 5 of 2017, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Notes:
1. The 30 September 2018 figures and the 30 June 2018 comparatives are reported on an unaudited basis.
2. The IFRS view includes the contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
3. Reserves as at 30 September 2018 have already been reduced by the value of the 2018 interim ordinary dividend
    of R4.1bn for Absa Group Limited and R2.7bn for Absa Bank Limited, which were declared on 6 August 2018 and
    paid on 17 September 2018.
4. The normalised ratios exclude the impact of the separation from Barclays PLC and reflect the underlying
    performance of the Group.
5. The Board target ranges apply to statutory ratios on a normalised basis. Regulatory ratios are measured against
    regulatory minimum levels.
6. Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and
    offshore holdings.
7. The South African minimum regulatory capital requirement for 2018 of 11.13% includes the RSA minimum of 8%,
    Pillar 2a buffer of 1.25% and capital conservation buffer of 1.88% but excludes the bank-specific individual capital
    requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) add-on (excluding the Pillar
    2a and capital conservation buffers). The Pillar 2a buffer will reduce between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2019
    reaching 1.00% by 1 January 2019.
8. SA-CCR is calculated using the Current Exposure Method.
9. Numbers restated due to the IFRS 9 audit requirement as per Directive 5.
10. The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa. The D-SIB add on is not publicly disclosed.
11. For liquidity reporting purposes Absa Bank Limited represents the banking operations in South Africa.
12. The Absa Bank Limited LCR for the quarter ended 30 September 2018 is calculated on a simple average of 90
    calendar-day observations. The 30 September 2018 figures are reported on an unaudited basis.
13. The Absa Group Limited LCR for 30 September 2018 reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank Limited LCR as
    noted in (12) above with that of the non-South African banking entities, which is calculated as a simple average of
    the relevant 3 month-end data points. In addition, the surplus HQLA of non-South African banking entities in excess
    of the minimum requirement of 90% has been excluded from the calculation. The 30 September 2018 figures are
    reported on an unaudited basis.

GROUP SENS
Profit and dividend announcement
Salient features
Absa Group Limited (the Group) discloses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial
results and a normalised view, which adjusts for the financial consequences of separating from Barclays PLC.

IFRS basis
- Diluted IFRS Headline earnings per share (HEPS), which includes R1.4bn of separation costs decreased 
  4% to 877.8 cents. 
- An interim dividend of 490 cents was declared representing a 3% year-on-year increase.
- Retail and Business Banking (RBB) South Africa headline earnings grew 4% to R4.2bn, Corporate and
  Investment Bank (CIB) South Africa declined 6% to R1.7bn, Rest of Africa Banking rose 8% to R1.6bn and 
  Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance (WIMI) increased 5% to R646m.
- Return on equity (RoE) declined to 13.9%.
- Revenue grew 3% to R37.6bn.
- Operating expenses rose 8% to R22.2bn
- Pre-provision decreased 3% to R15.4bn
- Credit impairments fell 9% to R3.4bn, resulting in a 0.83% credit loss ratio from 0.96%.
- Absa Group Limited's IFRS Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio of 13.3% remains above
  regulatory requirements and our board target range.
- Net asset value (NAV) per share rose 1% to 12 829 cents

Normalised basis
- Diluted HEPS grew 3% (5% on a constant currency basis) to 949.5 cents.
- RoE increased slightly to 16.9%.
- Revenue grew 3% to R37.0bn (4% on a constant currency basis).
- Operating expenses rose 4% to R20.8bn.

Normalised reporting
Given the process of separating from Barclays PLC, the Group continues to report both IFRS compliant 
financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and 
better reflects its underlying performance. The Group will present normalised results for future periods 
where the financial impact of separation is considered material.

Normalisation adjusts for the following items: R175m of interest income on Barclays PLC's separation contribution 
(30 June 2017: R46m); hedging revenue linked to separation activities of R413m (30 June 2017: R238m); operating 
expenses of R1 364m (30 June 2017: R460m) and R76m of other expenses (30 June 2017: R325m), plus a R133m tax 
impact of the aforementioned (30 June 2017: R111m) items. In total, these adjustments added R719m to the Group's 
normalised headline earnings during the period (30 June 2017: R152m). Since normalisation occurs at a Group level, 
it does not affect divisional disclosures.

Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial information as per the JSE listing
requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of the Group's Board of directors and
is presented for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's 
financial position, changes in equity, and results in operations or cash flows.

Overview of results
The Group's IFRS headline earnings declined 4% to R7 324m from R7 650m and diluted HEPS decreased 4% to 
877.8 cents. The Group's RoE fell to 13.9% from 16.2%, largely due to the higher capital base from the 
Barclays PLC seperation contribution and costs, while its RoA declined to 1.26% from 1.38%. Net interest 
income increased 3% and non-interest income grew 5%, resulting in 3% higher total revenue. Operating 
expenses grew 8%, increasing the cost-to-income ratio to 59.0% from 56.4%. Pre-provision profit decreased 
3% to R15.4bn. The Group's NAV per share rose 1% to 12 829 cents including Barclays PLC's remaining 
separation contribution in equity. 

On a normalised basis, the Group's headline earnings grew 3% to R8 043m from R7 802m and diluted HEPS 
rose 3% to 949.5 cents from 921.5 cents. The Group's normalised RoE was 16.9% from 16.8% and its return 
on assets was 1.40% from 1.41%. Revenue grew 3% to R37.0bn, with net interest income and non-interest 
income rising 2% and 4% respectively. Revenue grew 4% on a constant currency basis. The Group's net 
interest margin (on average interest-bearing assets) decreased to 4.76% from 4.81%. Gross loans and 
advances to customers grew 8% to R811bn, while deposits due to customers rose 3% to R714bn. With 
operating expenses growing 4%, the normalised cost-to-income ratio increased to 56.2% from 55.5%, 
and pre-provision profit rose 1% to R16.2bn. The stronger rand reduced Group revenue by 1% and headline 
earnings by 2%. In constant currency, pre-provision profit grew 3% and headline earnings 5%. Credit 
impairments fell 9% to R3.4bn, resulting in a 0.83% credit loss ratio from 0.96%. The Group's 
normalised NAV per share increased 4% to 11 683 cents and it declared a 3% higher half year 
DPS of 490 cents.

RBB South Africa's headline earnings rose 4% to R4 209m primarily due to 6% lower credit impairments. 
Retail Banking South Africa headline earnings grew 5% to R3 001m, while Business Banking South Africa 
increased 1% to R1 208m. CIB South Africa's earnings declined 6%, given a 1% lower pre-provision 
profit and 79% higher credit impairments. Corporate South Africa fell 3% to R556m and Investment 
Banking South Africa decreased 7% to R1 127m. Rest of Africa Banking headline earnings grew 8% to 
R1 636m, or 20% in constant currency. RBB Rest of Africa increased 38%, or 54% in constant currency, 
while CIB Rest of Africa grew 3% and 15% in constant currency. WIMI's headline earnings increased 
5% to R646m, reflecting significant growth in Short-term Insurance.

South African earnings grew 2% to R6.4bn, while Rest of Africa rose 9% or 21% in constant currency to
account for 20% of Group earnings. 

Operating environment
Global economic recovery continued during the period with the US leading the developed economies in the 
recovery process. Economic growth in Europe and Japan slowed, but domestic fundamentals remain solid 
giving confidence that growth will improve in the second half. Inflation in developed economies 
remains muted, while emerging markets saw an uptick due to currency pressures and higher commodity 
prices. Global monetary policy is still broadly accommodative, although the broad trend is toward 
tightening.

South Africa's GDP contracted by an annualised 2.2% in the first quarter after a strong annualised 3.1% in
the last quarter of 2017. The contraction was due to weakness across key sectors including agriculture, mining,
manufacturing and construction. Private sector fixed investment declined in contrast to the strong improvement 
in business confidence in the first quarter. Headline inflation bottomed at 3.8% in March before increasing
slowly to 4.6% in June. As such, the Reserve Bank reduced interest rates 25 basis points in March, but left it
unchanged in July.

Economic growth continued to improve in a number of our key Rest of Africa countries. The strengthening
global economy, higher commodity prices and improved weather conditions supported growth, with the primary 
sector activities including mining, construction and agriculturee standing out as the main growth drivers 
in many economies. Monetary policy easing continued in our markets as inflation trended lower. Key headwinds 
include the still weak fiscal positions in Mozambique, Zambia and Kenya.

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total IFRS assets increased 9% to R1 235bn at June 2018, largely due to 8% growth in gross loans and
advances to customers and trading portfolio assets which grew by 23%. Normalised total assets increased 
8% to R1 233bn at 30 June 2018.

Loans and advances to customers
Gross loans and advances to customers increased 8% to R811bn. RBB South Africa loans rose 5% to R477bn.
Retail Banking South Africa's loans grew 5% to R407bn, reflecting 12% growth in Vehicle and Asset Finance 
(VAF), 10% higher Personal Loans and 1% growth in Home Loans, while Card and Payments increased by 1% despite 
a reduction in the store card portfolio. Business Banking South Africa's loans rose 9% to R70bn, with Term 
Loans and Agri Loans increasing 13% and 14% respectively. CIB South Africa's loans grew 14% to R235bn, 
including 13% growth in Corporate and 14% in the Investment Bank. Rest of Africa Banking loans increased 
14% to R94bn, or 10% in constant currency.

Funding
The Group's liquidity position remains strong, with liquid assets and other sources of liquidity growing 11%
to R218bn, which equates to 31% of customer deposits. The Group's three-month average liquidity coverage
ratio for the second quarter of 2018 was 109%, comfortably above the minimum regulatory hurdle of 90% during 
the first half of 2018. The Group's deposits due to customers grew 3% to R714bn. Its loans to deposit and 
debt securities ratio increased to 91.6% from 87.1%. Deposits due to customers constituted 76% of total 
funding. RBB South Africa's deposits grew 5% to R305bn, with Retail Banking South Africa up 7% to R193bn 
and Business Banking South Africa increasing 3% to R111bn. CIB South Africa's deposits were flat at R184bn. 
Rest of Africa Banking deposits increased 6% to R127bn, or 3% in constant currency.

Net asset value
The Group's IFRS NAV rose 1% to R109bn and its NAV per share grew 1% to 12 829 cents, despite a R4.2bn
reduction on adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.  During the reporting period the Group generated 
retained earnings of R7.3bn (Normalised: R8bn), from which it paid R5.0bn in ordinary dividends. Its 
foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) increased to R2.4bn from R1.8bn at the end of June 2017.

On a normalised basis, NAV rose 3% to R99bn and its NAV per share grew 4% to 11 683 cents.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) increased 6% to R771bn at 30 June 2018, mainly due to increased credit 
risk RWAs. The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum regulatory capital requirements. 
The Group's IFRS CET1 and total capital adequacy ratios were 13.3%and 16.7% respectively (from 13.7% and 
16.1%).

On a normalised basis the CET 1 and total capital adequacy ratios were 12.2% and 15.7% respectively 
(from 12.1% and 14.5%).

The Group generated 2.0% of CET1 capital internally over the past year. The day 1 impact from 
implementing IFRS 9 reduced the Group's CET1 ratio by 5 basis points, as we opted to phase it in 
over three years. Declaring a 3% higher half year DPS of 490 cents on a dividend cover of 1.9 times 
took into account the operating environment, the Group's strong capital position, internal capital 
generation, strategy and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income

Net interest income
Net interest income increased 3% to R21 363m from R20 837m (Normalised: increase of 2% to R21 188m from 
R20 791m), while average interest-bearing assets grew 3%. The Group's net interest margin (to average
interest-bearing assets) declined to 4.75% from 4.81% (Normalised: declined to 4.76% from 4.81%). Net 
interest income grew 3% on a constant currency basis.

Loan pricing reduced the Group's net interest margin by 6 bps, largely due to higher suspended interest in
RBB South Africa after implementing IFRS9. Loan composition added 2 bps to the margin, given slower growth in
Home Loans. Deposit pricing reduced the margin by 1 bp, primarily due to competitive pricing on fixed retail
deposits in South Africa. Deposit composition increased the margin by 3 bps, as wholesale funding balances were
flat. With lower interest rates in South Africa, the equity and deposit endowment reduced the Group margin by
4 bps. The structural hedge released R232m to the income statement, 3 bps more than in the prior reporting
period, to largely offset the reduced endowment contribution. Rest of Africa reduced the margin by 1 bp due 
to the stronger rand.

Non-interest income
IFRS non-interest income grew 5% to R16 267m from R15 532m to account for 43% of total revenue. On a
constant currency basis, the growth was 5%. 

On a normalised basis non-interest income grew 4% to R15 854m from R15 294m to account for 43% of 
total revenue from 42%.

Net fee and commission income grew 4% to R10 991m, which represented 68% of total non-interest income. 
Within this, cheque account fees increased 15% to R2 751m, electronic banking grew 3% to R2 576m, while 
credit cards and merchant income rose by 7% and 9% respectively. Investment, markets execution and investment 
banking fees decreased 8% to R266m.

Net trading excluding hedge accounting declined 6% to R2 510m, reflecting Markets in South Africa increasing
1%, while Rest of Africa Banking decreased 8%.

Within other operating income, sundry income increased significantly due to a non-headline gain on the
disposal of some subsidiaries.

RBB South Africa's non-interest income grew 5% to R8 763m, as Retail Banking South Africa increased 6% and
Business Banking South Africa was flat. Within Retail Banking, Transactional and Deposits rose 10%, reflecting
price increases, cheque account growth and reclassifying fee write-offs to credit impairments. CIB South
Africa increased 7% to R2 252m, with 10% growth in transactional revenue.

Rest of Africa Banking's non-interest income declined 2% to R2 427m as the impact of a stronger rand 
offset constant currency growth of 5%. In constant currency, CIB Rest of Africa increased 2% and RBB Rest 
of Africa 7%.

WIMI's non-interest income increased 11% to R2 844m, including 11% higher Life insurance net premium income,
3% growth in Short-term Insurance net premium income in South Africa and gains on the disposal of
subsidiaries.

Impairment losses
IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 on 1 January 2018, in terms of which credit impairments moved from an incurred basis
to an expected credit loss approach. The Group has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, with an adjustment to
retained earnings and other reserves as at 1 January 2018, and elected not to restate comparative periods.

Implementing IFRS 9 increased the Group's IAS 39 credit provisions and interest in suspense by R5.9bn or 
27% at 1 January 2018 to R27.8bn. Previously reported IAS 39 impairment ratios in respect of performing and
non-performing portfolios are not comparable to similar ratios under IFRS 9. At 30 June 2018 the Group's stage 
3 (defaulted) loans were 5.3% of gross loans and advances from 5.5% at 1 January 2018 and the expected credit 
loss coverage ratios on these were 42.0% and 40.7% respectively.

Credit impairments decreased 9% to R3 431m from R3 773m, which improved the Group's credit loss ratio to
0.83% from 0.96% of gross loans and advances to customers and banks.

RBB South Africa credit impairments decreased 6% to R2 728m, resulting in a 1.15% credit loss ratio from
1.28%. Retail Banking South Africa credit impairments declined 7% to R2 517m, reducing its credit loss ratio to
1.24% from 1.39%. Home Loans' charge fell 61% to R181m resulting in a 0.16% credit loss ratio from 0.41%. Card
and Payments' credit loss ratio declined to 4.23% from 5.36%, given 21% lower credit impairments of R897m.
Vehicle and Asset Finance credit impairments grew 25% to R594m, increasing its credit loss ratio to 1.14% from
1.01%. Personal Loans' charge rose 3% to R568m and its credit loss ratio improved to 5.87% from 6.21%. Business
Banking South Africa credit impairments increased 8% to R211m, in line with its loan growth, to produce a flat
credit loss ratio of 0.62%.

CIB South Africa credit impairments increased 79% to R381m from R213m, due to a large single name exposure.
Its credit loss ratio increased to 0.30% from 0.18%.

Rest of Africa Banking credit impairments fell 47% to R335m from R638m, reducing its credit loss ratio to
0.72% from 1.38%. RBB Rest of Africa's charge fell 39% to R318m, a 1.53% credit loss ratio, while CIB Rest 
of Africa decreased 91% to R11m or a 0.05% credit loss ratio.

Operating expenses
Group operating expenses grew 8% to R22 198m from R20 498m, resulting in a 59.0% cost-to-income ratio from
56.4%. Operating expenses increased 5% in constant currency. On a normalised basis operating expenses 4% to 
R20 834m from R20 038m, resulting in a 56.2% cost-to-income ratio from 55.5%.

Staff costs grew 6% and accounted for 54% of total operating expenses. Salaries and total incentives rose 
by 7% and 3%, respectively. On a normalised basis staff costs grew by 4% and accounted for 55% of total
expenses. Salaries rose by 5%, while total incentives fell 7%. Headcount decreased 1%, largely due to 
reductions in Rest of Africa and a disposal in WIMI.

Non-staff costs grew 11% (Normalised: 4%). Professional fees increased 2% to R1 033m (Normalised: fell 9% to
R717m), while telephone and postage declined 9% and printing and stationery increased 7% (Normalised: 6%).
Operating leases on properties decreased 2% to R799m and property costs increased 5% to R883m (Normalised:
decreased 1% to R834m). Marketing costs rose by 6% to R834m (Normalised: flat at R731m). Total IT-related spend
grew 13% to R3 970m and constituted 18% (Normalised: 19%) of Group operating expenses. Amortisation of intangible
assets rose 5% to R366m (Normalised: rose 4% to R363m), while cash transportation increased 14% to R612m. The
21% (Normalised: 20%) growth in depreciation reflects investment in technology and optimisation of the
corporate property portfolio and branch network.

RBB South Africa costs grew 7% to R12 593m. Retail Banking South Africa increased 7% and Business Banking
South Africa 8%, due to salary increases, investment in physical and cyber security, higher cost of cash 
and amortisation of IT infrastructure.

CIB South Africa expenses grew 10% to R3 071m, after two years of low cost growth, as it continues to invest
in systems and technology.

Rest of Africa Banking expenses increased 1%, or 7% in constant currency, to R4 333m. CIB Rest of Africa
increased 4% and RBB Rest of Africa was flat. A continued focus on optimising the branch network and enhancing
digital capabilities kept underlying cost growth below inflation.

WIMI's costs declined 3% to R1 776m, in part due to disposing of Employee Benefits. It achieved strongly
positive operating JAWS, which improved its cost-efficiency ratio to 33.6%.

Other expenses decreased 14% to R964m (Normalised: increased 12% to R888m).

Taxation
The Group's taxation expense increased 3% to R3 189m (Normalised: increased 4% to R3 322m), resulting in a
28.8% (Normalised: 27.8%) effective tax rate from 28.0% (Normalised: 27.7%).

Headline earnings increased 4% to R4 209m, due to 6% lower credit impairments, as pre-provision profits 
were flat at R9 007m. Revenue grew 4% to R21 600m, with non-interest income increasing 5%. Costs rose 7% 
to R12 593m, resulting in a 58.3% cost-to-income ratio from 56.6%. Credit loss ratio improved to 1.15%

cost-to-income ratio. RBB Rest of Africa earnings increased 38% to R463m, or 54% in constant currency, given 
positive operating leverage and 39% lower credit impairments. CIB Rest of Africa earnings grew 3%, or 15% in 
constant currency, to R1 246m as its credit impairments dropped 91%. Rest of Africa Banking accounted for 20% 
of total normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre and produced a 19.6% RoE.

WIMI
Headline earnings grew 5% to R646m, with earnings from continuing business lines increasing 8% to R636m.
Gross operating income grew 11% to R3 455m and costs fell 7% to R1 551m. Life insurance net operating income 
grew 26%, while earnings declined 4% due to a deferred tax benefit in the base. Its embedded value of new 
business increased 25% in South Africa, due to improved retail lending and sales through bank branches. 
Assets under management grew 8% to R319bn, despite declining 5% year to date. Wealth and Investment 
Management's earnings declined 15%, largely due to margin compression. Short-term Insurance earnings grew 
117%. South African underwriting margins increased to 9.8%. WIMI's South African earnings increased 3% to 
R682m, while Rest of Africa reported a loss of R36m. WIMI's RoE improved to 22.5% and it generated 8% of 
total earnings excluding the Group centre. 

Prospects
In South Africa growth prospects remain challenging given subdued business confidence and headwinds to household
spending. We forecast real GDP growth of 1.2% this year and 2.0% next year. Fiscal policy remains a challenge 
as recent tax increases might not be enough to deliver the much needed consolidation. We expect the Reserve Bank
to leave interest rates unchanged for some time.

We forecast real GDP growth of 6% in our Rest of Africa portfolio, although monetary policy easing may have
bottomed. At current levels, the rand would dampen our earnings less in the second half than it did in the
first half.

Based on these assumptions, and excluding any unforeseen major political, macroeconomic or regulatory
developments, our guidance for 2018 is largely unchanged. We expect our loan and deposit growth to improve 
in 2018, with stronger loan growth in Rest of Africa, CIB and Retail South Africa. Our net interest margin
is likely to decline slightly this year. Costs will remain well controlled and our operating JAWS should 
improve from last year's but is unlikely to be positive. We expect our credit loss ratio to improve in 2018. 
Our CET1 ratio is expected to remain above board targets, which will allow us to maintain our current 
dividend cover. Lastly, our normalised RoE should improve slightly in 2018.

(2) An amendment was made to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which is effective from 
    1 January 2018. The amendment requires interest and similar income which is calculated using 
    the effective interest method, to be presented separately on the face of the statement of 
    comprehensive income. The Group has elected to apply the same approach in presenting interest 
    expense and similar charges to achieve consistency.

IAS 33 Earnings per share prescribes that the weighted average number of shares outstanding during a
reporting period, and for all periods presented, should be adjusted for events that change the number 
of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources. The contribution of cash 
by Barclays PLC and acquisition of Absa Group Limited (AGL) shares by a subsidiary of the independent 
Absa Empowerment Trust in the previous reporting period did not result in an adjustment to the net 
asset value of the Group. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in June 2017 has been 
restated to reflect the acquisition from Barclays PLC of 12 716 260 (1.5%) AGL shares in the current 
reporting period. The acquisition of shares has been treated as treasury shares from the beginning 
of 2017, which has led to a reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purposes 
of determining the weighted average number of shares in the Headline earnings per share and Diluted 
headline earnings per share.            

(1) The net amount is reflected after taxation and non-controlling interest.

9. Related parties
There were no one-off significant transactions with related parties of Absa Group Limited during the current
reporting period.

In the prior reporting period, as part of the separation, Barclays PLC sold ordinary Absa Group Limited
shares representing 12.2% and 33.7% of issued ordinary share capital in May 2016 and June 2017 respectively.
Barclays PLC currently holds 126.2m ordinary Absa Group Limited shares representing 14.9% of issued ordinary
shares. The remaining 85.1 % of the shares are widely held on the JSE.

Barclays PLC contributed £765m to the Group, primarily in recognition of the investments required for the
Group to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested primarily in rebranding, technology 
and separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact 
of separation investments on the Group over time. 

Barclays PLC contributed cash of R1 891m to be used in the furtherance of the Group's objective of
establishing Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment structure. The cash was contributed to the independent 
Absa Empowerment Trust, whose subsidiary purchased 12 716 260 BAGL shares. In terms of the requirements 
of IFRS, these shares have been accounted for as treasury shares and eliminated against the Group's 
share capital.

CLS Group Holding AG shares were transferred to Barclays PLC for no consideration in 2005. During the
current reporting period these shares were transferred back to the Group for a nominal consideration of 
one British Pound (GBP). The shares have been recognised at a fair value of R48m. The related credit has 
been recognised in equity as a shareholder contribution.

10. Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts represent contracts where the Group undertakes to make specified payments 
to a counterparty, should the counterparty suffer a loss as a result of a specified debtor failing to 
make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. The credit risk inherent in 
the balance has led to an ECL provision being raised for such amount.

Guarantees include performance guarantee contracts and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate 
the facilities by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may 
expire without being drawn upon, the total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash 
requirements. The credit risk inherent in the undrawn component of irrevocable lending facilities are 
managed and monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single exposure. The exposure 
at default (EAD) on the entire facility is therefore used to calculate the ECL on loans and advances. 
As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the ECL allowance for the financial asset unless the total 
ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a 
provision on the face of the statement of financial position.

Legal proceedings
The Group has been party to proceedings against it during the reporting period, and as at the reporting date
the following material cases are disclosed:
- Pinnacle Point Holdings Proprietary Limited :  It is alleged that a local bank conducted itself unlawfully
  in relation to a financial product offered by it, and that Absa Bank Limited was privy to such conduct.
  Subsequent to the withdrawal of the first plaintiff's (Pinnacle Point Holdings) claim, the total claim amount 
  has been substantially reduced, however, the second to fifth plaintiffs persist with their claims for 
  damages in an amount of R47m.
- Ayanda Collective Investment Scheme (the Scheme): Absa Capital Investor Services was the trustee of the
  Scheme, in which Corporate Money Managers (CMM) managed a portfolio of assets within the Scheme. The joint
  curators of the CMM group of companies and the Altron Pension Fund (an investor in the fund) allege that the
  defendants caused damages to them arising from their alleged failure to meet their obligations in the trust 
  deed together with their statutory obligations set out in the Collective Investment Scheme Act, in respect 
  of which they seek payment of R1 157m. 

The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters, both in South Africa and a
number of other jurisdictions. It is involved in legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of
business from time to time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, 
debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering,
employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations
and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with 
(but not limited to) consumer protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale 
trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have
a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such
matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a
particular matter or matters will not be material to the Group's results of operations or cash flow for a
particular period, depending on, amongst other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) 
and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they
cannot reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter.
Provision is made for all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis has resulted in a
significant tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures, especially for companies that are 
deemed to be of systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the
operation of the banking and consumer credit industries which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation.
The nature and impact of future changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action, especially in
the areas of financial crime, banking and insurance regulation, cannot currently be fully predicted and are
beyond the Group's control. Some of these are likely to have an impact on the Group's businesses, systems and
earnings. 

The Group is continuously evaluating its programmes and controls in general relating to compliance with
regulation. The Group undertakes   monitoring, review and assurance activities, and the Group has also adopted
appropriate remedial and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and has made disclosures on material
findings as and when appropriate. 

Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Absa Group Limited, identified potentially fraudulent activities by
certain of its customers using advance payments for imports in 2014 and 2015 to effect foreign exchange transfers
from South Africa to beneficiary accounts located in East Asia, UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the Group
conducted a review of relevant activities, processes, systems and controls,  and provided information to
relevant authorities, in a process which has now largely concluded. No financial impact is anticipated.

In February 2017 the South African Competition Commission (SACC) referred Barclays PLC, BCI and Absa Bank
Limited, a subsidiary of Absa Group Limited, among other banks, to the Competition Tribunal to be prosecuted 
for breaches of South African antitrust law related to Foreign Exchange trading of South African Rand. The SACC
found from its investigation that between 2007 and 2013 the banks had engaged in various forms of collusive
behaviour. Barclays was the first to bring the conduct to the attention of the SACC under its leniency programme
and has cooperated with, and will continue to cooperate with, the SACC in relation to this matter.  The SACC
is therefore not seeking an order from the Tribunal to impose any fine on Barclays Bank PLC, BCI or Absa Bank
Limited.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions, and the calculation of the Group's tax
charge and provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There 
are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect 
of which the relevant tax authorities may have indicated disagreement with the Group's treatment, and 
accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority. 

The Group recognises provisions for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
taxes will be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate. The carrying amount of any
resulting provisions will be sensitive to the manner in which tax matters are expected to be resolved, and 
the stage of negotiations or discussion with the relevant tax authorities. There may be significant 
uncertainty around the final outcome of tax proceedings, which in many instances, will only be concluded 
after a number of years. Management estimates are informed by a number of factors including, inter alia,
the progress made in discussions or negotiations with the tax authorities, the advice of expert legal 
counsel, precedent set by the outcome of any previous claims, as well as the nature of the relevant 
tax environment.  

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting 
period in which such determination is made. These risks are managed in accordance with the Group's Tax 
Risk Framework.

15.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework
includes a Traded Risk and Valuations Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), which is
independent from the front office.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will
formally approve valuation policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation 
issues are reported to the Absa Group Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and
will therefore consider the appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC team independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant
fair value measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal 
risk areas when performing independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. 
They also assess and document the inputs obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair 
value which supports conclusions that valuations are performed in accordance with IFRS and internal 
valuation policies.

Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable
to the specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction
prices for similar properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating
the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible, the fair value of the Group's investment properties is determined through valuations
performed by external independent valuators.

When the Group's internal valuations are different to that of the external independent valuers, detailed
procedures are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC team verifies the procedures 
performed by the front office and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent 
valuations.

15.2 Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that
reflects the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are 
defined as follows:

Quoted market prices - Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active
market. Such fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions
occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
Fair values are classified as Level 2 if they have been determined using models for which inputs are
observable in an active market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active
market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to
contribute more than 10% to the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined 
based on observable inputs of a similar nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group
or pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted
market prices for similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation 
techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect 
of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group or pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted
market prices for similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable 
market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies
which, dependent on the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value
comparisons with similar companies and price:earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology
is applied consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over- the- counter (OTC). OTC derivative contracts
include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads,
equity prices and commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained
from quoted market prices, dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting
contractual cash flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation 
date) plus the originally priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated 
spread is used to reflect valuation date pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual 
cash flowprofiles, are used to determine expected cash flows where contractual cash flow profiles would 
provide an inaccurate fair value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying
rates currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded
derivatives, the embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives as detailed
above.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying
value. For other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying
value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

15.3 Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below:

Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a marketmaker mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer
prices respectively. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close-out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact
that they are managed on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a
derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by
strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as
broker data. For those assets and liabilities where the firm is a marketmaker and has the ability to transact
at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), the
mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost. 

Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on
fair value of counterparty credit risk, the Group's own credit quality, as well as the cost of funding across
all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the Group's model governance framework. This process identifies the
assumptions used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). 
Where necessary, fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation
adjustments are dependent on the size of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market 
standard and to what extent it incorporates all known risk factors. All models and model valuation 
adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis. 

15.4 Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group's assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured
at fair value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

15.6.1 Significant transfers between levels
During the 2018 and 2017 reporting periods, transfers between levels occurred because of changes in the
observability of valuation inputs, in some instances owing to changes in the level of market activity. 
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

(1) The unrealised gains and losses for loans and advances to customers for June 2017 have 
    been restated by R728m. The gains and losses from banking and trading activities on 
    loans and advances to customers has been restated to include the movement in the 
    unrealised gains relating to the base rates applicable to the assets. Previously 
    only unrealised gains relating to the unobservable credit spreads for these assets 
    were taken into account in the disclosure.
(2) The unrealised gains and losses for Investment Securities for June and December 2017 
    have been restated by R243m and R27.61m respectively. The gains and losses from banking 
    and trading activities on investment securities have been restated to include unrealised 
    gains on unlisted Private Equity investments. Previously only unrealised gains relating 
    to unobservable corporate bonds were taken into account in the disclosure.
                     
15.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs
As part of the Group's risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant 
unobservable parameters to generate a range of possible alternative valuations. The assets and 
liabilities that most impact this sensitivity analysis are those with the more illiquid and/or 
structured portfolios. The stresses are applied independently and do not take account of any 
cross correlation between separate asset classes that would reduce the overall effect on the 
valuations.

The following table reflects how the unobservable parameters were changed in order to evaluate 
the sensitivities of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities:

A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to profit or loss, 
or a change in the fair value asset or liability by more than 10% or the underlying value of the 
affected item. This is demonstrated by the following sensitivity  analysis which includes 
reasonable range of possible outcomes:

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy,
the discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered
unobservable inputs for items which mature after 5 years. However, if the items mature in less than 5 years,
these inputs are considered observable.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying
price of the market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to
the unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.

(1) The range of estimates have been disaggregated to better reflect the individual assumptions used.

The amount that has yet to be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income that relates 
to the difference between the transaction price and the amount that would have arisen, had 
valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts 
subsequently recognised, is as follows:

16. Reporting changes overview 
The financial reporting changes that have been applied in the current reporting period are as follows:
- The implementation of new IFRS:
  - IFRS 9 - The Group has applied IFRS 9 on a retrospective basis, with an adjustment to retained earnings
    and other reserves as at 1 January 2018. As permitted under IFRS 9, the Group has elected not to restate
    comparative periods.
  - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15) - The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15 using
    the cumulative effect method, under which the comparative information has not been restated. 

All other amendments to IFRS effective for the current reporting period have had no impact on the Group's
reported results(1);
- Changes in internal accounting policies:
  - A change in the valuation method applied to policyholder liabilities under the Group's life insurance
    contracts, and
  - The presentation of interest income and interest expense.

Comparative information has been restated to reflect the amendment to the Group's internal accounting
policies, and an adjustment has been recognised within retained earnings as at 1 January 2018 to reflect the 
impact of implementing new standards.

The table below summarises the total impact of the reporting changes on the Group's statement of changes in
equity.

(1) The amendments which are effective in the current reporting period relate to IAS 40 Investment
    Property, IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, as well as IFRS 2 Share-based Payment 
    Transactions (IFRS 2). The changes to IFRS 2 were however early adopted by the Group in 2016. 
    A new IFRIC Interpretation, IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration is 
    effective in the current reporting period.

16.1 Initial adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
This summarised report is extracted from audited information with the full transitional report 
'Reporting changes' included from page 152 of Absa Group Limited's Interim Financial Results 
for the reporting period ending 30 June 2018. All information marked as audited in the Reporting 
Changes section has been audited by EY who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon in terms of  
ISA 805 - Special considerations - Audits of single financial statements and specific elements, 
accounts or items of financial statement. A copy of the auditor's report on the audited sections 
of the Reporting Changes section is available for inspection at the Group's registered office, 
together with a copy of the transitional disclosures that were audited.

16.1.1 Overview and highlights
16.1.1.1 The impact of IFRS 9 on the Group
IFRS 9 is effective from 1 January 2018 and introduces significant changes to three fundamental 
areas of the accounting for financial instruments, namely:
- The classification and measurement of financial instruments;
- The scope and calculation of credit losses, which has moved from an incurred loss, to an expected 
  credit loss (ECL) approach; and
- The hedge accounting model.

Whilst the adoption of a revised classification and measurement framework has had a less material impact on
the Group, application of the IFRS 9 ECL methodology has affected both the financial and regulatory capital
position, and can be reasonably expected to impact the net profit or loss of the Group going forward. 

In accordance with the transition options allowable under IFRS 9, the Group will continue to apply the hedge
accounting requirements set out in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39). The
Group employs a governed hedging programme to reduce margin volatility associated with structural balances (i.e.
rate insensitive liabilities as well as the endowment associated with equity). Operational complexity would
be introduced by adopting the revised IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements ahead of the finalisation of the
International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB) Dynamic Risk Management project in respect of macro hedging.
The Group has accordingly elected not to adopt the revised IFRS 9 hedge requirements, but will adopt the revised
disclosures set out in the amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), which include
those relating to hedge accounting.

16.1.1.2 The impact of adopting a revised classification and measurement framework for financial instruments
A portfolio of South African consumer price index (CPI) linked investment securities have been reclassified
from available-for-sale under IAS 39, to amortised cost. This aligns the portfolio's classification with the
Group's business model of holding the instruments to collect contractual cash flows. Other less significant
reclassifications of financial assets were also recorded, although these did not have any impact on equity 
(refer to 16.1.10.). The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely unchanged, except for financial
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Gains and losses on such financial 
liabilities are required to be presented in other comprehensive income (OCI), to the extent that they 
relate to changes in own credit risk. The Group early adopted this requirement in 2017, and recognised 
a debit of R147m in OCI.

16.1.1.3 The impact of adopting a revised ECL methodology
The adoption of IFRS 9 will impact the timing of credit loss recognition, by accelerating the recognition of
losses relative to IAS 39, and potentially creating increased volatility through the incorporation of forward
looking assumptions. Total write offs, debt collections, and the long-run actual credit losses incurred by
the Group should remain unchanged. The Group dedicates considerable resources to gaining a clear and accurate
understanding of credit risk across the business and to correctly reflect the value of the assets in accordance
with applicable accounting principles. The core processes remain the measurement of exposures and concentrations, 
performance monitoring and tracking of asset quality, and the write off of assets when the whole or part of a 
debt is irrecoverable.

The implementation of IFRS 9 has been a project of strategic importance to the Group. Over the past four
years, extensive work was performed to design, build and test new models, create the necessary infrastructure and
develop data management systems that were able to facilitate a successful parallel run in the second half of
2017, and deliver a high quality implementation on 1 January 2018. The Group has had the ability to test the
sensitivity of the ECL model and its sub-components to different macroeconomic scenarios, but has not been able
to back test the scenarios themselves. This is a natural concomitant of implementing an accounting standard
which requires the inclusion of point-in-time forward looking assumptions, and in respect of which, the
application of hindsight is expressly prohibited. 

16.1.1.4 Summary of the impact of IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018
The disclosures set out within this section of the report serve to bridge the statement of financial
position of the Group as at 1 January 2018 between IAS 39 and IFRS 9. Information has been provided to 
facilitate an understanding of the key areas of difference, as well as the core drivers of ECL going 
forward. The Group highlights the role that unexpected changes in forward looking assumptions may play 
in driving earnings volatility, and that changes in stage distribution could have an impact on net interest 
income. Exposures within certain industry sectors or products are expected to be more sensitive to changes 
in macroeconomic conditions than others, which could mean that the overall response to changes in forward 
looking assumptions is driven by the relative composition of the loans and advances portfolios. 

The adoption of IFRS 9 has impacted the financial and regulatory capital position of the Group, as follows:
- An increase of R5 868m (27%) in the Group's ECL provisions (including interest in suspense), from 
  R21 899m as at 31 December 2017 to R27 767m as at 1 January 2018. Refer to 16.1.3.1. 
- A net decrease in retained earnings of R4 106m (after a taxation adjustment of R1 572m and a 
  non-controlling interest of R190m) together with a net decrease in other reserves of R95m which includes 
  the effects of reclassifying investment securities from available-for-sale to amortised cost. 
  Refer to 16.1.
- The Group remains strongly capitalised notwithstanding a R2 118m decrease in common equity tier 1 supply
  (CET1) and a 21bps decrease in the CET1 ratio. The decrease in the CET1 ratio is before the application of
  the transitional arrangement which recognises the impact over three years. This deferral reduces the impact 
  on the CET 1 ratio on the date of initial adoption to 5bps. Refer to 16.1.5.1.

16.1.2 Key elements of the revised impairment model under IFRS 9
16.1.2.1 Introduction
IFRS 9 introduces an ECL impairment model that requires entities to recognise ECL based on a stage
allocation methodology, with such categorisation informing the level of provisioning required. The ECL allowance
calculated on stage 1 assets reflects the lifetime losses associated with events of default that are expected to
occur within 12 months of the reporting date (12 month ECL). Assets classified within stage 2 and stage 3 carry
an ECL allowance calculated based on the lifetime losses associated with defaults that are expected to occur
over the lifetime of the exposure (lifetime ECL). The assessment of whether an exposure should be transferred
from stage 1 to stage 2, is a relative measure, where the credit risk at the reporting date is compared to the
risk that existed at initial recognition. 

The stage allocation is required to be performed as follows: 
- Stage 1: Stage 1 assets comprise exposures that are performing in line with expectations at origination.
  Financial assets that are not purchased or originated with a credit impaired status are required to be
  classified on initial recognition within stage 1. 

- Stage 2: Exposures are required to be classified within stage 2 when a significant increase in credit risk has 
  been observed. The factors which trigger a reclassification from stage 1 to stage 2 have been defined so as to 
  meet the specific requirements of IFRS 9, and in order to align with the Group's credit risk management 
  practices. These are discussed further in 16.1. 2.2. Stage 2 assets are considered to be cured (i.e. 
  reclassified back into stage 1), when there is no longer evidence of a significant increase in credit 
  risk. The definition of high risk is from a credit management perspective central to controlling the 
  flow of exposures back to stage 1 and gives effect to any cure periods deemed necessary. 

- Stage 3: Credit exposures are classified within stage 3, when they are regarded as being credit impaired, which 
  aligns to the bank's regulatory definition of default. This definition is discussed further in 16.1.2.3. 
  Defaulted assets are considered cured once the original default trigger event no longer applies and both 
  internal and regulatory probation periods have been met. In the Retail portfolio, assets will move from 
  stage 3 to stage 2, but not directly from stage 3 to stage 1. In the Wholesale portfolio assets can move 
  from stage 3 directly to stage 1. Purchased or originated credit impaired lending facilities are classified 
  on origination within stage 3.

16.1.2.2 Definition of a significant increase in credit risk
The Group uses various quantitative, qualitative and back stop measures as indicators of a significant
increase in credit risk. The thresholds applied for each portfolio will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure
they remain appropriate. Where evidence of a significant increase in credit risk is not yet available at an
individual instrument level, instruments that share similar risk characteristics are assessed on a collective
basis. 

Key drivers of a significant increase in credit risk include:  
- Where the weighted average probability of default (PD) for an individual exposure or group of exposures
  as at the reporting date evidences a material deterioration in credit quality, relative to that determined 
  on initial recognition; 
- Adverse changes in payment status, and where accounts are more than 30 days in arrears at reporting date.
  In certain portfolios a more conservative arrears rule is applied where this is found to be indicative of
  increased credit risk (e.g. 1 day in arrears);
- Accounts in the Retail portfolio which meet the portfolio's impairment high risk criteria; and
- The Group's watch list framework applied to the Wholesale portfolio, which is used to identify customers
  facing financial difficulties or where there are grounds for concern regarding their financial health.

16.1.2.3 Definition of credit impaired assets
Assets classified within stage 3 are considered to be credit impaired, which, as discussed in 16.1.2.1.
applies when an exposure is in default. 
Default within Wholesale and Retail is aligned with the regulatory definition, and therefore assets are
classified as defaulted when either:
- The Group considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations without recourse by the
  Group to actions such as realising security. Elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay 
  include the following:
  - The Group consents to a distressed restructuring / forbearance of the credit obligation where this is
    likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness of principal, 
    interest or fees;
  - The customer is under debt review, business rescue or similar protection; or,
  - Advice is received of customer insolvency or death.
- The obligor is past due 90 days or more on any credit obligation to the Group.
  In addition, within the Retail portfolios:
- All forms of forbearance are treated as in default, regardless of whether the restructure has led to a
  diminished financial obligation or not; and
- The Group requires an exposure to reflect 12 consecutive months of performance, in order to be considered
  to have been cured from default. 

16.1.2.4 Impact of IFRS 9 on interest recognition
Interest income is calculated on stage 1 or stage 2 financial assets by applying the effective interest rate
(EIR) to the gross carrying amount of such assets. When exposures are identified as credit impaired (stage
3), or when they are purchased or originated within stage 3, IFRS 9 requires interest income to be calculated
based on the net carrying value, which is the gross carrying value after deducting the ECL allowance. 

In order to practically give effect to this requirement for stage 3 assets, the Group follows a two-step
approach. First, the Group ceases to recognise in profit or loss the contractual interest charged on credit
impaired assets (that is to say, contractual interest is suspended). Second, the Group multiplies the net carrying
value of the impaired exposure by its EIR and recognises only this amount of interest income within profit or
loss. Simply, this means that if during a reporting period, an exposure were classified within stage 3, lower
interest income would be recognised than if it had been classified within stage 1 or stage 2 over the same
period.  

Since an ECL allowance is calculated by discounting the future cash flows expected to be recovered by the
exposure's EIR, interest income recognised on stage 3 assets reflects the financial effect of unwinding the
discount embedded in the calculation. Application of this approach results in the Group being able to
appropriately reflect in profit or loss the financial effect of the ""time value of money"", which is embedded 
within the calculation of the ECL allowance.

In principle, the approach applied by the Group to recognise interest on stage 3 assets under IFRS 9, is not
dissimilar from the manner in which the Group calculated the interest on specifically impaired financial
assets under IAS 39. The key departure from IAS 39 is however that IFRS 9 requires the balance of interest in
suspense to be presented as part of both the gross carrying value of the exposure and the related ECL allowance.
Under IAS 39, such amount was excluded from both balances. Therefore, this constitutes a change to the
presentation of the gross carrying value and ECL allowance, although it has no impact on the net carrying value 
of the exposure. Had this revised presentation requirement been applied as at 31 December 2017, the Group would 
have recognised a larger gross carrying value, and larger impairment allowance of R3 025m (refer to 16.1.3.1. 
for more detail).

The Group believes that IFRS 9 is not explicit regarding the treatment of contractual interest in suspense
which is subsequently recovered. There is only a clear prescription with regards to the recovery of contractual
interest previously unrecognised on exposures originated credit impaired, where the standard requires such
interest to be recognised as a credit impairment gain instead of interest income. There is presently diversity
in interpretation of this matter and therefore the Group has elected to make an accounting policy choice in
this regard. The Group's accounting policy is to recognise contractual interest that is recovered, but which was
previously unrecognised within net interest income, and resulted in R292m being recognised within interest
income over the current reporting period. The Group believes that this policy promotes a fairer presentation of
ECL as well as net interest income, both of which the Group believes would otherwise be understated.

16.1.3 Reconciliation of the allowance for impairment under IAS 39 to the total ECL allowance under 
IFRS 9 (continued)
The measurement of the ECL allowance is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of
possible future outcomes, which are factored into the PD and LGD models, as well as applied in determining 
whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The reconciliation has not separately presented 
the effects of macroeconomic scenarios, since these are considered to be inextricably linked to the stage 
allocations above.

Key drivers of the ECL allowance are as follows:
- Interest in suspense: The cumulative interest which was suspended, and therefore not presented as part 
  of the impairment allowance as at 31 December 2017 has been included in the opening impairment allowance, 
  with an equivalent increase in the gross carrying value of the financial assets. 
- Change in emergence period of stage 1 assets: The emergence period under IAS 39 was calculated as the 
  average time between when a loss event occurred and the impairment event was actually identified, and 
  was typically 12 months or less. 
- Significant increase in credit loss for stage 2 classification: Under IAS 39, stage 2 assets were 
  classified as performing exposures with an impairment allowance being recognised to reflect latent 
  risks, and calculated based on an appropriate emergence period. Under IFRS 9, lending exposures that 
  have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination are required to carry a 
  lifetime ECL allowance.
- Change in default definition: The definition of credit impaired is aligned with the regulatory definition 
  of default, which has resulted in a larger population of credit exposures being classified within stage 3 
  compared to the NPL population under IAS 39.  The key differences include the application of a 90-day 
  backstop, as well as a widening of the watch list categories included within stage 3, relative to those 
  that were specifically impaired under IAS 39. Further, all debt counselling and performing forbearance 
  accounts are included in stage 3, but were not previously classified as NPL. 
- Off-balance sheet exposures: The credit risk inherent in the undrawn component of lending facilities are 
  managed and monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single exposure. The exposure 
  at default (EAD) on the entire facility is therefore used to calculate the ECL on loans and advances. 
  As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the ECL allowance for the financial asset unless the total 
  ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as 
  a provision on the face of the statement of financial position. 

The Group presents the ECL on financial guarantees and letters of credit as a provision on the statement
of financial position. 

The calculation of ECL on other assets: Cash reserves with central banks and investment securities are
included within the scope of IFRS 9 ECL and have contributed to the Group's total ECL allowance.
 
16.1.4.1 Summary of ECL coverage by segment and class of credit exposure
The following table provides an analysis of the total ECL allowance by market segment, and per stage 
distribution. For credit exposures disclosed on the statement of financial position, the gross carrying 
value of on-statement of financial position exposures includes only the amounts that were drawn, 
as at 1 January 2018, whilst the allowance for ECL includes expected losses on committed, undrawn 
lending facilities. To the extent that the ECL allowance exceeds the carrying value of the drawn 
exposure, a liability (provision) has been recognised in the statement of financial position. 
This Provision is adjusted for in Head office.

(1) The Group's IFRS capital ratios decreased as follows as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9:
    - CET 1 ratio decreased by 22 bps on a fully loaded basis and 5 bps after phase-in.
    - Tier 1 ratio decreased by 22 bps on a fully loaded basis and 5 bps after phase-in.
    - Total capital ratio decreased by 3 bps on a fully loaded basis and 1 bps after phase-in.

16.1.5.1.1 Increase in ECL provision under IFRS 9
The adoption of the revised IFRS 9 ECL model has reduced shareholders equity by R5 868m which is partially
offset by the recognition of a net tax credit within retained earnings of R1 572m. The tax credit includes
current and deferred tax.

16.1.5.1.2 Release of ECL shortfall to credit provisions
For reporting periods up to 31 December 2017, the calculation of capital took into account the regulatory
expected loss for performing assets, which was greater than the IAS 39 provision, thereby resulting in an
additional deduction against CET 1 to the extent of the shortfall in the accounting provision. Under IFRS 9, 
the accounting ECL allowance has increased resulting in the elimination of the shortfall. This is reflected 
in the above reconciliation as a reversal of the previous deduction and has the effect of partially reducing 
the negative impact of IFRS 9 ECL on regulatory capital.  

16.1.5.1.3 Recognition of a higher deferred tax asset balance
As discussed in point 16.1.5.1.1, the carrying value of the Group's deferred tax asset balance has
increased, driven by an increase in the ECL provision. The reclassification of investment securities, as 
discussed below in 16.1.5.1.4 resulted in a reversal of a deferred tax liability. The net effect has 
been an increase in risk weighted assets (RWA) of R3 221m, and accordingly, a decrease in the CET 1 ratio.

16.1.5.1.4 Impact on other reserves under IFRS 9
Other reserves decreased by R95m (net of deferred tax) primarily as a result of a reclassification from
available-for-sale to amortised cost of a small portfolio of South African CPI linked investments so as 
to reflect the Group's business model of holding the instruments to collect contractual cash flows. 

16.1.5.1.5 Release of RWA on non-performing loans 
The alignment of the definition of default for both accounting and regulatory purposes resulted in a
reduction of RWA of R7 421m due to specific provisions (stage 3) being raised for an increased population 
of exposures. The methodology applied in calculating default RWA's permits a bank to reduce the LGD of the 
defaulted exposure by the bank's estimate of expected loss, represented by the bank's specific accounting 
provision. 

16.1.5.1.6 Tier 2 eligible provisions
In respect of the Group's standardised portfolio, the IFRS 9 general provision (stage 1 and stage 2) is
added back to Tier 2 capital, subject to a limit of 1.25% of the standardised credit RWA. This has resulted 
in an increase in total capital of R1 269m.

16.1.5.1.7 Impact of IFRS 9 ECL on leverage ratio
Key drivers of change in the leverage ratio as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 were a decrease in
leverage exposure and Tier 1 capital, mainly attributable to increased ECL provisions. This was however 
partly offset by the release of the EL shortfall.

16.1.6 Drivers of the impairment charge under IFRS 9
Consistent with IAS 39, loans are written off when there is no realistic probability of recovery and the
Group's write-off policy remains materially unchanged. IFRS 9 impacts the timing of loss recognition, but 
over time, the long run expected cash losses are driven by economic and commercial factors, independent from 
the accounting framework applied. 

Differences in the timing of recognition of an impairment charge under IFRS 9 versus IAS 39 are attributed
to, inter alia:
- significant increases in credit risk causing a transfer of assets to stage 2 assets;
- significant changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions leading to assets moving between 
  stages; and
- the size of new business growth. 

Significant increase in credit risk: Transfers of exposures to stage 2 are driven by significant 
deterioration in credit quality, although a large stage 2 balance does not necessarily mean that the exposures 
have a poor default grade. An important principle under IFRS 9 is that a significant increase in credit risk 
constitutes a measure of relative credit risk, requiring the absolute credit quality of an exposure on origination 
to be compared against the absolute credit quality at reporting date. Exposures classified within stage 2 may actually 
have a better credit quality than other assets which remain in stage 1. Further, owing to the Group's definition of 
credit impaired, and the inclusion of performing forbearance accounts within stage 3, a credit impaired exposure may 
have a better credit quality than an exposure in stage 2. Notwithstanding this principle, should the Group's stage 2 
population start growing, this could indicate that the credit quality across the portfolio on reporting date may be 
worse than management had initially anticipated. 

Changes in forward-looking assumptions: IFRS 9 requires forward-looking and historical information to be
used in order to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, as well as to determine
the appropriate PDs and LGDs to be applied. Transfers between stages could be driven by a deteriorating or
improving macroeconomic environment, which could make the impairment charge more susceptible to volatility.

New business growth: One of the key changes under IFRS 9 is the recognition of ECL losses in respect of all
exposures on initial recognition, or on the date that the Group becomes irrevocably committed to providing a
lending facility. This means that growth in new business will strain profitability in the short to medium term,
although over time the realised economic returns should, all else being equal, remain unchanged from IAS 39. 

16.1.7 Impact of IFRS 9 on the Group's tax position 
The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in a change in the timing of the recognition of credit losses, but does
not impact the value of credit losses ultimately incurred. Accordingly, the long run tax effect of credit
losses and recoveries are unchanged by the implementation of a new accounting framework. The change in the 
timing of loss recognition is accounted for through the recognition of a deferred tax adjustment, calculated 
based on the statutory tax rate applicable.  

In South Africa, the value of the deferred tax asset (and corresponding impact on retained earnings and
other reserves) which was recognised on adoption of IFRS 9 was impacted by both a change in the accounting
recognition of losses, as well as a change in the tax legislation. In accordance with amended tax legislation 
issued by the South African Revenue Service in 2017, the deduction permitted in respect of doubtful debt 
balances has changed to 25% for stage 1 ECL, 40% for stage 2 ECL and 85% for stage 3 ECL. This is a change 
from the previous deductions under IAS 39, which were 25% of incurred but not reported losses, 80% for 
portfolio specific impairments and 100% for specific impairments. A higher deferred tax asset has therefore 
been driven by an increase in the ECL provision under IFRS 9, partially offset by a change in the South 
African tax treatment of pre-existing allowances.

16.1.8 Incorporation of forward-looking information in the IFRS 9 modelling
The Group's IFRS 9 impairment models consume macroeconomic information to enable the models to provide 
an output that is based on forward-looking information. The macroeconomic variables and forecast 
scenarios are sourced from one of the world's largest research companies, and are reviewed and approved 
in accordance with the Group's macroeconomic governance framework. This review includes the testing 
of forecast estimates, the appropriateness of variables and probability weightings, as well as the 
incorporation of these forecasts into the ECL allowance. 

The Group has adopted the use of three economic scenarios: a base scenario, a mild upside scenario, and a
mild downside scenario. IFRS 9 requires the inclusion of point-in-time forward looking assumptions, and in
respect of which the application of hindsight is prohibited. The scenarios presented below are therefore 
reflective of the Group's view of forecast economic conditions as at the date of initial adoption.

16.1.8.1 Base scenario
Global
Global expansion is expected to remain broad-based across sectors and synchronised in developed economies.
The outlook on emerging market growth remains solid on the back of better growth in developed economies and
rising commodity prices. Developed market central banks continue tightening their monetary policies at a gradual
pace in 2018 to 2020 but this is not expected to be disruptive to emerging markets. 

South Africa
The economy recovered from a weak growth at the start of 2017, on the back of growing agricultural output,
but the near-term outlook still remains moderate. GDP growth is forecast to marginally increase in 2018.
Positive political developments are observed, although the consumer remains in a defensive mindset, and household
spending remains relatively muted given tax increases. Beyond 2019, growth is supported by a stronger global and
domestic environment. South Africa's fiscal fortunes and potential ratings downgrade remain a concern over
the forecast period. Disappointing growth could result in low fiscal revenue that is expected to undershoot
budget targets. No further interest rate cuts over the forecast horizon are assumed.

Rest of Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa's economic recovery continues although the trajectory is not smooth across all
jurisdictions. Headwinds that could still derail growth in some markets include low fiscal buffers and 
political risks ahead of elections in key markets this year. Countries with weak fiscal positions continue 
to necessitate close monitoring. Economic growth is supported largely by a recovery in the agriculture 
sector, improved commodity output and prices, as well as more accommodative monetary policy stances.

16.1.8.2 Mild upside scenario: Stronger near-term growth 
Global
The global economy grows faster than expected, and is supported by fiscal stimulus in the United States
(US), and a quick negotiation of Britain's exit (Brexit) from the European Union (EU), which boosts global
business confidence.  Commodity prices rise sharply relative to the base scenario and the global financial 
markets improve. Globally, investor and consumer sentiment rises, due to the favourable financial environment.

South Africa
It is assumed there are no further rating downgrades. Policy and political stability boosts business
confidence and private sector fixed investment. We assumed a strong rand compared to the base scenario 
that is driven by the sovereign rating being unchanged and the positive global sentiment toward emerging 
markets. Inflation moves lower on the back of the stronger rand and continued moderation in food price 
inflation. Falling inflation and diminished risk at a domestic level gives the South African Reserve 
Bank room to provide stimulus to the economy by cutting interest rates to support the economy. The 
cumulative interest rate cuts, higher commodity prices and stronger global growth boost South Africa's 
GDP growth. 

Rest of Africa
A stronger global economy and higher commodity prices help support growth in African commodity exports and
fixed investments. The level of output remains above the baseline scenario. Inflation moves lower as currencies
appreciate on the back of capital flows and higher commodity prices supporting exports. Easing inflation
allows central banks to lower interest rates, supporting the African economic growth further. 

16.1.8.3.  Mild downside scenario: Moderate recession 
Global
The US economy slows relative to baseline due to delays in implementing the stimulus package promised before
the elections. Business and consumer confidence falls in the US, followed by stock market indices. It is
assumed Brexit negotiations take longer than expected, increasing uncertainty on financial markets, weighing on
business and consumer confidence. As a result, eurozone growth slows compared to baseline, contributing to
economic and financial stress faced by some of the heavily indebted countries in the region. Furthermore, slower
growth in key markets affects China's exports and result in its GDP growth slowing. Commodity prices fall on the
back of weaker global growth.

South Africa
South Africa goes into recession on the back of weaker global growth environment and falling commodity
prices. As a result, government revenue comes under pressure and the finances of state-owned enterprises
deteriorate. Ratings agencies downgrade South Africa's sovereign rating further, resulting in capital outflow 
and rand weakness. The weakening of the rand drives inflation above the SARB's 3% to 6% target range in 2018 
to 2019, resulting in the SARB hiking the repurchase rate. The yield curve moves higher in line with the 
selling of South African bonds and higher short-term rates. Economic performance recovers slowly from 2020 
as the weaker exchange rate builds some export competitiveness aiding in arresting some of the rand's 
decline, and spending power returns slowly to consumers as inflation abates in the middle of 2020.

Rest of Africa
In Sub-Saharan Africa some economies go into recession on the back of lower global growth and commodity
prices. Fiscal positions deteriorate further and political risks increase in some markets. Capital outflows and
falling exports drive currencies weaker, pushing inflation higher. Central banks intervene by hiking interest
rates to help stem the flight of capital and protect currencies.

16.1.9. Critical judgements applied in implementing the new IFRS 9 ECL framework
16.1.9.1 Determination of the lifetime of a credit exposure
The determination of initial recognition and asset duration (lifetime) are critical judgements in
determining quantum of lifetime losses that apply. The date of initial recognition reflects the date that 
a transaction (or account) was first recognised on the statement of financial position. The PD recorded at 
this time provides the baseline used for subsequent determination of a significant increase in credit risk.  

When determining the period over which the entity is expected to be exposed to credit risk, but for which
the ECL would not be mitigated by the entity's normal credit risk management actions, the Group considers
factors such as historical information and experience about:
- the period over which the entity was exposed to credit risk on similar financial instruments;
- the length of time for related defaults to occur on similar financial instruments following a significant
  increase in credit risk; and 
- the credit risk management actions that an entity expects to take once the credit risk on the financial
  instrument has increased, such as the reduction or removal of undrawn limits.

For asset duration, the approaches which are applied (in line with IFRS 9 requirements) are:
- Term lending: the contractual maturity date, reduced for behavioural trends where appropriate (such as
  expected settlement and amortisation); and
- Revolving facilities: for Retail portfolios, asset duration is based on behavioural life and this is
  normally greater than contractual life. For Wholesale portfolios, a sufficiently long period to cover 
  expected life modelled and an attrition rate is applied to cater for early settlement.

16.1.9.2  General IFRS 9 ECL model parameters
The calculation of ECL incorporates the probability that a credit loss will occur, as well as the probability 
that no credit loss occurs, even if the most likely outcome is no credit loss. The estimate reflects an 
unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. 
In some cases, relatively simple modelling is considered to be sufficient, without the need to consider 
the outcome under different scenarios. For example, the average credit losses of a large group of financial 
instruments with shared risk characteristics may be a reasonable estimate of the probability-weighted 
amount. In other situations, the identification of scenarios that specify the amount and timing of the 
cash flows for particular outcomes and the estimated probability of those outcomes will be needed. 

The IFRS 9 models make use of three parameters, namely PD, LGD and EAD in the calculation of the ECL
allowance. 

The PD is the likelihood of default assessed on the prevailing economic conditions at the reporting date
(that is, at a point in time), adjusted to take into account estimates of future economic conditions that 
are likely to impact the risk of default; it will not equate to a long run average. For IFRS 9 purposes, 
two distinct PD estimates are required:
- Lifetime PD: the likelihood of accounts entering default during the remaining life of the asset.
- 12 month PD: the likelihood of accounts entering default within 12 months of the reporting date.

The general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models has been to leverage the Basel LGD models with bespoke IFRS 9
adjustments to ensure unbiased estimates. 

In calculating LGD, losses are discounted to the reporting date using the EIR determined at initial
recognition or an approximation thereof. For debt instruments, such as loans and advances, the discount rate 
applied is the EIR calculated on origination or acquisition date. For financial guarantee contracts or loan 
commitments for which the EIR cannot be determined, losses are discounted using a rate that reflects the 
current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows 
(to the extent that such risks have not already been taken into account by adjusting the cash shortfalls).
 
The EAD model estimates the exposure that an account is likely to have at any point of default in future.
This incorporates both the amortising profile of a term loan, as well as behavioural patterns such as the
propensity of the client to draw down on unutilised facilities in the lead up to a default event. 

Expert credit judgement may, in certain instances, be applied to account for situations where known or
expected risk factors have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process, or where uncertain
future events have not been incorporated into the modelled approach. Adjustments are intended to be short-term
measures and will not be used to incorporate any continuous risk factors. The Group has a robust policy framework
which is applied in the estimation and approval of management adjustments. 

Models are validated with the same rigour applied to regulatory models. Testing procedures assess the
quality of data, conceptual soundness and performance of models, model implementation and compliance with 
accounting requirements.

16.1.9.3 Interaction of the IFRS 9 ECL models with the Basel Framework
The Group applies both the standardised (TSA) and advanced internal ratings-based (AIRB) approaches to
calculate its regulatory capital requirements relating to credit risk. While the Group's operations across 
the rest of Africa as well as the Edcon portfolio are subject to the TSA approach, the remaining portfolios are
subject to the AIRB approach, which applies the Group's own measures of PD, EAD and LGD. In designing IFRS 9
compliant ECL models, the Group recognised that it could leverage the data used by the regulatory models to model
IFRS 9 ECL and encourage easier reconciliation of inputs for capital requirement and impairment calculations. 
Existing Basel models were used as a starting point to develop IFRS 9 ECL parameters. The following are key
differences to the regulatory capital parameters:

16.1.9.4 Retail ECL model parameters 
The Retail PD model consists of three elements, namely:
- a term structure, capturing typical default behaviour by the months since observation;
- a behavioural model which incorporates client level risk characteristics; and
- a macroeconomic model that incorporates forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios.

A further adjustment is made to incorporate an account's propensity to attrite. The PD model is used to
identify accounts that have increased significantly in credit risk since origination. The final PD is a
probability weighted average of the Group's three forecasted macroeconomic scenarios.

The LGD model estimates the loss that can be expected if an account defaults. The regulatory LGD model is
adjusted for:
- forward-looking macroeconomic adjustments; and
- future expected changes in collateral and EAD. 

The LGD model further incorporates the losses associated with re-defaults for lifetime losses.

16.1.9.5 Wholesale ECL model parameters 
Wholesale PDs and LGDs are modelled using the parameters from regulatory models as starting point.
Parameters are adjusted for differences between requirements under Basel III and IFRS 9. 
The main adjustments to PD comprise:
- a macroeconomic adjustment that changes the paradigm from a long-run average default rate to a PD that
  reflects the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, thereby adjusting the PD from a seven year historical 
  average to a PD reflective of the macroeconomic environment at the reporting date; and
- an adjustment to the regulatory PD to convert it from a PD over 12 months, to a PD over the lifetime of
  an exposure, to be able to assess significant increases in credit risk and estimate lifetime provisions 
  for stage 2. 

The main adjustments to LGD comprise a macroeconomic adjustment that changes the long-run LGD to reflect a
given macroeconomic scenario.  Lifetime projections of LGD take into account the expected balance outstanding
on a loan at the time of default, as well as the value of associated collateral at that point in time. 

16.1.10. The key elements of classification and measurement requirements under IFRS 9
IFRS 9 will require financial assets to be classified on the basis of two criteria:
- The business model within which financial assets are managed; and
- Their contractual cash flow characteristics, and specifically whether the cash flows represent Solely
  Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI).

Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective
is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows meet the SPPI
requirements.

Financial assets will be measured at FVOCI if they are held within a business model whose objective is
achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows as well as selling financial assets and their contractual 
cash flows meet the SPPI requirements.

Other financial assets are required to be measured at FVPL if they are held for the purposes of trading, if
their contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI criterion, or if they are managed on a fair value basis and
the Group maximises cash flows through sale. IFRS 9 allows an entity to irrevocably designate a financial
asset as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency 
(i.e. an accounting mismatch).

An entity is permitted to make an irrevocable election for non-traded equity investments to be measured at
FVOCI, in which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but other gains or losses remain in equity 
and are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition.

The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely unchanged, except for financial liabilities
designated at FVPTL. Gains and losses on such financial liabilities are required to be presented in OCI, to the
extent that they relate to changes in own credit risk. The Group early adopted this requirement in 2017.

Adoption of the new classification and measurement rules will require a limited number of reclassifications
to be effected as at 1 January 2018, but will not require a significant adjustment to the gross carrying
values of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities. Initial application of the new requirements
resulted in a decrease in reserves of R140m (after tax) as at 1 January 2018. Explanations of the reclassifications
that will be required are provided below:
- A portfolio of consumer price index (CPI) linked investment securities within Treasury, have been
  reclassified from available-for-sale under IAS 39, to amortised cost in terms of the Group's business model of
  holding the instruments to collect contractual cash flows. Had these assets not been reclassified to amortised, 
  the fair value of the instruments would have been R5 619m, and a fair value loss of R74m would have been
  recognised in OCI during the reporting period. 
- Certain financial assets, including loans and advances in CIB and investments in WIMI were designated at
  FVTPL under IAS 39 as they were managed on a fair value basis. In terms of IFRS 9, these assets are now
  required to be measured at FVTPL, and noted as mandatory designations. 
- Debt securities are held by Treasury in a separate portfolio to meet everyday liquidity needs. These were
  classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39. Treasury seeks to minimise the cost of managing liquidity
  needs and therefore actively manages the return on the portfolio. The return consists of collecting contractual
  cash flows as well as gains and losses from the sale of financial assets. The business model may result in sales
  activity and these instruments have therefore been classified at FVOCI under IFRS 9. 
- In a particular jurisdiction within Rest of Africa, a small portfolio of debt securities held by Treasury
  have been reclassified from available-for-sale to amortised cost as there is limited evidence of an ability
  to sell these securities, and the portfolio is therefore aligned to a business model with the objective of
  collecting contractual cash flows.
- Commodity-linked debt instruments within CIB were previously bifurcated and separately recognised as a
  loan at amortised cost and a derivative. These are now classified as FVTPL as their cash flows do not consist 
  of SPPI.
- Debt securities held by insurance entities within the rest of Africa have been reclassified from available-
  for-sale to amortised cost. The objective of the portfolio is to collect contractual cash flows as the 
  securities are neither held within a portfolio whose business model is to manage the securities and 
  evaluate their performance on a fair value basis, nor is it possible to evidence an adequate frequency 
  and volume of sales.

In October 2017, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation.
Under the current IFRS 9 requirements, the SPPI condition is not met if the lender has to make a settlement
payment in the event of termination by the borrower (also referred to as early repayment gain). The amendment
clarifies how a company would classify and measure a debt instrument if the borrower is permitted to prepay the
instrument at an amount less than the unpaid principal and interest owed. Under the amendments, the sign of the
prepayment amount is not relevant. The calculation of this compensation payment must be the same for both the
case of an early repayment penalty and the case of an early repayment gain. This amendment is effective on 1
January 2019 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.

16.1.11 Governance
16.1.11.1 Implementation of IFRS 9   
The implementation of IFRS 9 has been completed through a jointly accountable risk and finance governance
programme, with representation from all impacted departments. A parallel run of IFRS 9 and IAS 39 was initiated
in February 2017, providing oversight for both IAS 39 and IFRS 9 impairment results. This included model,
process and output validation, testing, calibration and analysis. During the course of the programme there have
been regular updates provided to the Group Audit Compliance Committee (GACC), who have approved key judgements
and decisions.

16.1.11.2 Ongoing governance of IFRS 9    
The Group's basic risk management framework has not been altered due to the introduction of IFRS 9. The
Group Credit Impairment Committee (GCIC) remains the key management committee responsible for the governance of
impairments as well as the oversight of the Group's impairment position. The overall credit risk appetite also
remains unchanged with all the controls in place in the business for the extension and subsequent monitoring of
credit exposure. It has, however, been necessary to develop new processes and related controls to support the
calculation of the Group's ECL. In particular, new governance processes have been established to review and
approve the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions.

16.2. Adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)
IFRS 15 is effective from 1 January 2018, and replaces the previous revenue recognition standards and
interpretations, including IAS 18 Revenue and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 establishes 
a single approach for the recognition and measurement of revenue, and requires an entity to recognise revenue 
as performance obligations are satisfied. It applies to all contracts with customers except for transactions 
specifically scoped out, which includes interest, dividends, leases, and insurance contracts. The adoption 
of IFRS 15 has resulted in a change in the accounting treatment of a loyalty programme which resulted in 
a reduction in retained earnings of R44m, net of tax.

16.3 Accounting policy amendments
16.3.1 The accounting treatment of policyholder liabilities under life insurance contracts
During the current reporting period, the Group amended its accounting policy with respect to the measurement
of policyholder liabilities, and specifically, with regards to the calculation of discretionary margins held
within policyholder reserves. This change impacts life insurance products where the present value of expected
benefit payments, plus the future expected administration expenses under a life insurance contract, is lower
than the expected discounted value of the contractual premiums to be received. Prior to the change, the Group's
policy was to eliminate all negative liabilities. The policy has been changed to allow for discretion to be
applied in full or partial elimination of negative liabilities in order to more appropriately provide for
prudent reserving and release of profits. This policy change will address scenarios where a loss is recognised 
in a reporting period solely as a consequence of incurring initial acquisition costs despite the contract being
expected to be profitable over its duration. In accordance with the revised policy, negative liabilities will
still be eliminated, to avoid the premature recognition of profits; however, such elimination is only applied to
the excess remaining after adjusting for the product's initial acquisition costs. The change in accounting
policy has been applied retrospectively to the extent practicable, and comparatives restated accordingly.

The effects of the retrospective application are not determinable prior to 2014 and the change in accounting
policy has been applied from the start of the 2014 financial year.

The impact of this change on the Group's condensed statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 is

16.3.2 The presentation of net interest income
As a consequence of IFRS 9, an amendment was made to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, 
which is effective from 1 January 2018. The amendment requires interest revenue, which is calculated 
using the effective interest method, to be presented separately on the face of the statement of 
comprehensive income. This only includes interest earned on financial assets measured at amortised 
cost or at FVOCI, subject to the effects of applying hedge accounting to derivatives in designated 
hedge relationships. In compliance with this amendment the Group has separately presented its 
effective interest income within profit or loss, but elect to present all interest which fall 
outside the afore-mentioned scope as a sub-component of 'Interest and similar income'. The Group 
has elected to apply the same approach in presenting 'Interest expense and similar charges' to 
achieve consistency in the presentation of 'Net interest income'. The revised presentation has 
been applied on a retrospective basis, to ensure comparability between reporting periods.

16.4 Changes to reportable segments and business portfolios
The following business portfolio changes resulted in the restatement of financial results for the
comparative period. None of the restatements have impacted the overall financial position or net earnings 
of the Group:
- The Group refined its Treasury allocation methodology, resulting in the restatement of net interest
  income, cash and cash equivalents and investment securities between and within segments. 
- The Group continued refining its cost allocation methodology, resulting in the restatement of operating
  expenses between and within segments.
- Corporate and Investment Banking South Africa (CIB SA) review of customer portfolio to be industry
  specific resulted in R16bn move of loans and advances to customers from Corporate to Investment Banking.
- The South Africa Banking segment (which consisted of RBB (SA) and CIB (SA) in aggregate) has been removed
  in the Group's segmental disclosures to align with how the banking operations are now managed.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

      -     Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R1.1bn mainly due to retail regulatory
            model updates and exposure growth in Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) and Retail and Business
            Banking (RBB). This was partially offset by the implementation of IFRS 9, which reduces the RWA’s in respect
            of non-performing assets. Portfolios subject to the Standardised Approach have decreased by R7.0bn mainly
            due to exposure decreases outside South Africa as well as exchange rate fluctuations.
      -     CCR: The decrease in CCR of R10.4bn is due to methodology refinements in relation to the duration of trades
            combined with changes in the composition of the portfolio.
      -     Market Risk: The increase in market risk of R4.4bn is due to higher levels of Value at Risk (VaR) and stressed
            Value at Risk (sVaR) in the three-month averaging period as well as due to increases in exposures measured
            under the Standardised Approach.
      -     IFRS 9 transitional arrangement: The adjustment of R5.6bn represents that portion of the total release of
            RWA’s on non-performing loans arising as a result of the implementation of IFRS 9 which is required to be
            phased in over the transition period of three years.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

     -   Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R0.2bn mainly due to retail regulatory
         model updates and exposure growth in CIB and RBB. This was partially offset by the implementation of IFRS 9,
         which reduces the RWA’s in respect of non-performing assets. The decrease in the Standardised Approach of
         R0.8bn is mainly due to a reduction in the size of the portfolio in South Africa measured on a standardised
         basis.
     -   CCR: The decrease in CCR of R10.4bn is due to methodology refinements in relation to the duration of trades
         combined with changes in the composition of the portfolio.
     -   Market Risk: The increase in market risk of R2.0bn is due to higher levels of Value at Risk (VaR) and stressed
         Value at Risk (sVaR) in the three-month averaging period as well as due to increases in exposures measured
         under the Standardised Approach.
     -   IFRS 9 transitional arrangement: The adjustment of R5.6bn represents that portion of the total release of
         RWA’s on non-performing loans arising as a result of the implementation of IFRS 9 which is required to be
         phased in over the transition period of three years.

Key Metrics [KM1]

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, Barclays Africa Group Limited and
Absa Bank Limited have moved from the recognition of credit losses on an incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss
(ECL) basis. Barclays Africa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited have elected to utilise the transition period of three
years for phasing in the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The tables below reflect the
available capital and leverage when utilising the fully loaded and transitional arrangement ECL bases.

Capital consumption of Barclays Africa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited’s portfolios subject to the Internal Models
Approach increased by R0.5bn from December 2017 to March 2018. Drivers of quarter on quarter changes in RWA
consumption are due to increased levels of sVaR driven by an increase in foreign currency net open positions and
interest rate risk held.

Leverage Ratio


The leverage ratio framework is complementary to the risk-based capital framework and is a non-risk based
contingency measure to restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking sector.

2018 and the comparatives for the past three quarter end periods, namely 31 December 2017, 30 September 2017 and

Key drivers of change in the leverage ratio quarter on quarter were mainly as a result of an increase in on-balance sheet
exposures combined with a decrease in Tier 1 capital supply due to the payment of the 2017 final dividend.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of
banks by ensuring that they have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress scenario
lasting 30 calendar days. The LCR became effective on 1 January 2015, with a requirement of 60%, which will increase
by 10% per year to 100% on 1 January 2019. The requirement for 2018 is 90% (2017: 80%).

The LCR calculation is based on the value of the total HQLA divided by the net cash outflows (NCO) over the next 30
calendar days. The HQLA represents the value of assets, which can be converted into cash, whilst the NCO are
calculated according to regulations.

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under
Guidance Note 5 of 2017, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Notes:
1. The 31 March 2018 figures are unaudited whilst the 31 December 2017 comparatives are reported on an audited
    basis.
2. The IFRS view includes the contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the Separation.
3. Reserves as at 31 March 2018 have already been reduced by the value of the 2017 year-end final ordinary dividend
    of R5bn for Barclays Africa Group Limited and R3bn for Absa Bank Limited, which were declared on 1 March 2018
    and paid on 16 April 2018.
4. The normalised ratios exclude the impact of the Separation from Barclays PLC and reflect the underlying
    performance of the Group.
5. The Board-approved target capital ranges apply to statutory ratios on both an IFRS and a normalised basis.
    Regulatory ratios are measured against regulatory minimum levels.
6. Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore
    holdings.
7. The South African minimum regulatory capital requirement for 2018 of 11.13% (2017: 10.75%) include the RSA
    minimum of 8% (2017: 8%), Pillar 2a of 1.25% (2017: 1.50%) and capital conservation buffer of 1.88% (2017:
    1.25%) but exclude the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestic systemically
    important banks (D-SIB) add-on (excluding the Pillar 2a and capital conservation buffers). The Pillar 2a buffer will
    reduce between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2019 reaching 1.00% by 1 January 2019.
8. SA-CCR is calculated using the Current Exposure Method.
9. The Absa Bank Limited LCR for the quarter ended 31 March 2018 is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-
    day observations, whilst the December 2017 quarter end was based on simple average of the relevant 3 month-end
    data points.
10. The Barclays Africa Group Limited LCR for both 31 March 2018 and 31 December 2017, reflects an aggregation of
    the Absa Bank Limited LCR as noted in (9) above and a simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points of
    the non-South African banking entities. In addition, the surplus HQLA of non-South African banking entities in
    excess of the minimum requirement of 90% has been excluded from the calculation.
11. For liquidity reporting purposes Absa Bank Limited represents the banking operation in South Africa.

WITHDRAWAL OF RESOLUTION ORIGINALLY TO BE TABLED AT ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
AND UPDATE ON NAME CHANGE TIMELINES

Shareholders are advised that the board of Barclays Africa Group has withdrawn Ordinary Resolution
1.2 dealing with the re-appointment of KPMG Inc. from consideration at the Annual General Meeting
(AGM) to be held on Tuesday, 15 May 2018.

Ordinary Resolution 1.1 relates to the re-appointment of Ernst & Young Inc. as external auditor and
remains as proposed in the Notice of AGM.

In our Notice of AGM, the board proposed that KPMG Inc. be re-appointed as one of the Group’s
external auditors for the 2018 financial year, but stated that it would continue to monitor developments
relating to KPMG. Subsequent to the release of our Notice of AGM, the ongoing and more recent
developments were evaluated by the board, which decided that it is no longer able to support the re-
appointment of KPMG Inc.

The appointment of KPMG Inc. as external auditor of the Group will cease on completion of the
statutory and regulatory audit and reporting matters relating to the 2017 financial year, which is
expected by approximately 31 May 2018.

As stated in our Notice of AGM, the board confirms that through the Group Audit and Compliance
Committee it secured additional support, enhanced quality processes and quality reviews from KPMG
Inc. and KPMG International for the 2017 audit, resulting in an audit of satisfactory quality.

It is a current requirement of the SARB that we require two external auditors acting jointly. We will,
accordingly, start a formal process to appoint a second firm of auditors. Our current auditors EY will, in
the meantime, be the sole auditors of the Group.

The withdrawal of Ordinary Resolution 1.2 from the AGM does not affect the validity of any proxy form
already submitted or to be submitted in respect of all other resolutions to be presented at the AGM.
Shareholders are referred to Special Resolution number 2 in the Notice of AGM pertaining to the
approval of the change of name from Barclays Africa Group Limited to Absa Group Limited. In this
regard, shareholders are advised of an updated name change timetable, as follows:

Consistent with our policy on incentive awards to senior employees, each annual incentive
award is deferred as to 60% thereof. Of this deferral amount, 50% is into the Share Value
Plan (SVP) and 50% into the Cash Value Plan (CVP). The individual has a choice to convert
all or part of the CVP into SVP.

The number of shares under the 2018 SVP was fixed with reference to the 20-day volume
weighted average price preceding 8 March 2018. This table sets out the deferred incentives
which were awarded into the SVP, granted to the executive directors and company secretary
off market, and have since been accepted on the dates indicated below.

Further to the deferral of incentive referred to under 1 above, 50% of an executive director’s

twelve-month holding period and will be released in March 2019.

Further Disclosure on Normalised Earnings
With the process of separating from Barclays PLC well under way, including receipt of the
R12,6bn settlement contribution in June 2017, Barclays Africa Group has reported both IFRS
compliant financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of
the separation and better reflects the Group’s underlying performance and capital adequacy
information.
Further to the disclosure in the annual results announcement released on SENS on 1 March
2018, set out below are additional relevant disclosures required in terms of the JSE Listings
Requirements (“LR”).


Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial
information as per the LR. The pro forma financial information, as disclosed in the SENS
announcement on 1 March 2018, is the responsibility of the Group’s Board of directors and is
presented for illustrative purposes only and because of its nature may not fairly present the
Company’s financial position, changes in equity, and results in operations or cash flows. An
assurance report has been prepared and issued by our joint auditors KPMG Inc. and EY Inc.
in respect of the pro forma financial information, which is available for inspection at our
registered offices.

settlement contribution in June 2017, Barclays Africa Group Limited (BAGL) has reported both IFRS 
compliant financial results and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the 
separation and better reflects the Group’s underlying performance. The Group will present normalised 
results for future periods where the financial impact of separation is considered material. Normalisation 
will adjust for the following items: endowment income on Barclays PLC’s R12,1bn separation contribution 
(2017: R325m); hedging revenue linked to separation activities (2017: R80m); operating expenses 
(2017: R1 901m) and other expenses (2017: R394m), plus the tax impact of the aforementioned (2017: R408m). 
In total, these adjustments added R1 245m to normalised group headline earnings during the period. 
Since normalisation occurs at a group level, it does not affect divisional disclosures.

Overview of results
On a normalised basis, BAGL’s headline earnings grew 4% to R15 558m from R14 980m and diluted HEPS 
rose 4% to 1 837.7 cents from 1 769.4 cents. The Group’s normalised RoE was 16,4% from 16,6% and its 
return on assets increased to 1,38% from 1,34%. Revenue grew 1% to R72,9bn, with net interest income and 
non-interest income rising 1%. Revenue growth improved to 3% in the second half. The Group’s net interest 
margin (on average interest-bearing assets) was flat at 4,95%. Loans and advances to customers grew 4% to 
R750bn, while deposits due to customers rose 2% to R690bn. With operating expenses growing 4%, the 
normalised cost-to-income ratio increased to 56,8% from 55,2%, and pre-provision profit decreased 3%
to R31,5bn. The stronger rand reduced Group revenue by 2% and headline earnings by 3%. In constant 
currency, pre-provision profit declined 1%, and grew 2% in the second half. Credit impairments fell 
20% to R7,0bn, resulting in a 0,87% credit loss ratio from 1,08%. The ratio of Non-performing loans (NPLs) 
to gross loans and advances improved to 3,7% from 3,9%, and portfolio provisions decreased to 70 basis 
points (bps) of performing loans from 79 bps, although macroeconomic overlays increased 2% to R1,4bn. 
The Group’s NAV per share increased 5% to 11 550 cents on a normalised basis and it declared a 4% higher 
full year dividends per share (DPS) of 1 070 cents. 

Excluding normalisation, BAGL’s IFRS headline earnings declined 4% to R14 313m from R14 980m and 
diluted HEPS decreased 4% to 1 716.5 cents. The Group’s RoE fell to 14.2%, largely due to the additional 
capital, and its return on assets declined to 1,27% from 1,34%. Net interest income increased 2% and 
non-interest income increased by 1% , resulting in 1% higher total revenue. Operating expenses grew 8%, 
increasing the cost to income ratio to 59,1% from 55,2% and pre-provision profit decreased 8% to R30,0bn. 
The Group’s NAV per share rose 19% to 13 018 cents, given Barclays PLC’s separation contribution in 
equity.

South Africa Banking headline earnings grew 4% to R12 200m. Within this, Retail and Business Banking 
(RBB) SA headline earnings rose 1% to R8 874m due to 16% lower credit impairments and improved second 
half revenue growth. Retail Banking headline earnings were flat at R6 546m, while Business Banking grew 
1% to R2 328m. Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) rose 16%, given 5% higher pre-provision profits 
and 44% lower credit impairments. Corporate rose 8% to R1 143m and Investment Banking increased 22% to 
R2 183m. Rest of Africa Banking headline earnings grew 7% to R2 954m, or 24% in constant currency. RBB 
Rest of Africa declined 6%, despite rising 19% in constant currency, while CIB Rest of Africa grew 8% 
and 21% in constant currency. WIMI’s headline earnings decreased 8% to R1 156m, reflecting higher 
catastrophe event claims, unwinding of a Life deferred tax asset raised in 2016 and a single client 
credit impairment in Wealth.

Operating environment
The global expansion has been broad-based across economies and sectors. US growth was the positive 
surprise in the second half, but the Euro area, Japan and China all grew at or above consensus. Global 
inflation remained muted, allowing for gradual normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies.

South Africa’s economic growth remained low for a fifth consecutive year, with real GDP rising 0.9% 
after recovering from recession in early 2017. The rebound in agriculture contributed to the improvement 
following two years of drought. However, household and business confidence remained weak due to economic 
and political uncertainty. The Reserve Bank reduced interest rates 25 bps in July, South Africa’s first 
rate cut in five years.  

Economic growth improved somewhat in a number of our key rest of Africa countries, supported by 
commodity price recovery and ongoing infrastructure investment. We expect real GDP to have grown 5.4% 
across our markets in 2017, although it varied across our portfolio. Fiscal challenges remain a key 
constraint in several markets, more notably Ghana, Mozambique and Zambia. Rates were reduced in all 
our countries besides Kenya, with sizeable cuts in Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania. 

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total assets increased 6% to R1 165bn at 31 December 2017 on a normalised basis, due to 37% higher 
trading portfolio assets and 11% growth in loans and advances to banks.

Loans and advances to customers
Net loans and advances to customers increased 4% to R750bn, or 5% on a constant currency basis. South 
Africa Banking loans rose 5% to R666bn. Retail Banking South Africa’s loans grew 2% to R383bn, reflecting 
8% growth in Vehicle and Asset Finance (VAF) and 6% higher Personal Loans, while Card and Payments declined 
1% and Home Loans remained flat. Business Banking South Africa’s loans rose 7% to R63bn. CIB South Africa’s 
loans grew 8% to R219bn, including 16% growth in Corporate and 4% in the Investment Bank. Rest of Africa 
Banking loans were flat at R78bn, despite increasing 9% in constant currency.

Funding
The Group’s liquidity position remains strong, with liquid assets and other sources of liquidity growing 
11% to R213bn, which equates to 31% of customer deposits. The Group’s  three-month average liquidity coverage 
ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 107,5%, comfortably above the minimum hurdle of 80% during 2017. 
The Group’s deposits due to customers grew 2% to R690bn or 4% in constant currency. Loans to deposit and debt 
securities ratio increased to 90,6%. Deposits due to customers constituted 77% of total funding. Retail Banking 
South Africa increased deposits 6% to R187bn and Business Banking rose 4% to R114bn, while CIB’s grew 2% to 
R177bn. Rest of Africa Banking deposits decreased 3% to R109bn, despite growing 6% in constant currency.

Net asset value
The Group’s normalised NAV rose 5% to R98bn and its NAV per share grew 5% to 11 550 cents. During the 
year it generated retained earnings of R15,1bn, from which it paid R8,8bn in ordinary dividends. Its 
foreign currency translation reserve reduced to R0.4bn from R2.4bn.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) increased 5% to R737bn at 31 December 2017, due to increased credit risk 
RWAs. The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements. The Group’s 
normalised CET1 and Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios were 12,1% and 14,9% respectively (from 12,1% and 14,8%). 
The Group generated 2,2% of CET1 capital internally during the period. The day 1 impact from implementing 
IFRS 9 accounting is expected to reduce the Group’s CET1 ratio by no more than 35 bps, which will be phased 
in over three years. Declaring a 4% higher full year DPS of 1 070 cents on a dividend cover of 1,7 times 
took into account the difficult and volatile macroeconomy, the Group’s strong capital position, internal 
capital generation, strategy and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income

The commentary below relates to normalized results

Net interest income
Net interest income increased 1% to R42 319m from R42 003m, while average interest-bearing assets grew 1%. 
The Group’s net interest margin (to average interest-bearing assets) was unchanged at 4,95%. Net interest 
income grew 3% on a constant currency basis. 

Loan pricing reduced the Group’s margin by 2 bps, primarily due to the impact of lower National Credit Act 
(NCA) caps on unsecured retail portfolios in South Africa. Loan composition reduced the margin by 3 bps, given 
a higher proportion of CIB loans. The Group’s deposit margin increased 1basis point, largely due to improved 
pricing and mix in Corporate. The structural hedge released R258m to the income statement, in line with its 2016 
contribution. Despite July’s interest rate cut in South Africa, the capital and deposit endowment benefit increased 
3 bps, as these balances grew faster than interest bearing assets. Rest of Africa reduced the Group margin by 
2 bps, mainly reflecting regulatory caps in Kenya and its lower weighting in the overall composition due to the 
stronger Rand.

South Africa Banking’s net interest margin narrowed to 3,37% from 3,47% and Rest of Africa Banking’s decreased
to 7,18% from 7,25%.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income grew 1% to R30 581m from R30 391m to account for 42% of total revenue. On a constant 
currency basis, the growth was 2%. 

Net fee and commission income grew 5% to R21 711m, which represented 71% of total non-interest income. 
Electronic banking fees and commissions increased 3% to R5 185m and cheque accounts fees rose 14% to R4 943m. 
Credit card fees and commissions increased 1% to R2 624m and savings accounts decreased 10% to R2 062m. Card 
merchant income grew 8% to R1 890m. Investment, markets execution and investment banking fees increased 42% 
to R568m. 

Net trading excluding hedge accounting declined 11% to R4 855m, reflecting lower South Africa trading revenue 
and the impact of the strong Rand.

Within other operating income, there was a non-headline foreign currency translation reserve gain of 
R320m in the first half of 2016, which did not recur. South Africa Banking’s non-interest income grew 4% to 
R21 366m, 70% of the Group total. Retail Banking South Africa increased 6% to R13 519m, as Transactional and 
Deposits grew 7% and Card and Payments 3%, including 11% growth in acquiring volumes. Business Banking’s 
non-interest income increased 4% to R3 663m, with 9% higher growth excluding equities. CIB South Africa  
declined 1% to R4 184m, with Corporate up 10% and the Investment Bank down 6% due to lower Markets revenue.

Rest of Africa Banking’s non-interest income declined 7% to R4 853m due entirely to the strong Rand, 
as constant currency growth was 3%. CIB Rest of Africa declined 6% to R2 297m, but increased 5% in constant 
currency. RBB Rest of Africa fell 8% to R2 550m, which was 1% higher in constant currency. 

WIMI’s non-interest revenue grew 6% to R5 128m, reflecting 6% higher Life Insurance net premium 
income and policyholder and reserving adjustments recognised in 2016 which did not recur.

Impairment losses on loans and advances
Credit impairments decreased 20% to R7 022m from R8 751m, which improved the Group’s credit loss ratio 
to 0,87% from 1,08% of gross customer and bank loans and advances. Credit impairments included collection 
costs of R289m. 

Group NPLs decreased 1% to R30 891m, or 3.75% of gross loans and advances from 3.94%. Total NPL 
coverage declined to 43,1% from 44,2%. Total balance sheet provisions decreased 4% to R18 874m partially 
reflecting the write-off of an exposure in CIB South Africa during 2016. Portfolio provisions declined 7% 
to R5 560m, constituting 0,70% of total performing loans from 0,79%, largely due to lower model driven 
impairments. Macroeconomic overlays grew 2% to R1,4bn.

South Africa Banking credit impairments decreased 20% to R5 605m, resulting in a 0,80% credit loss 
ratio from 1,03%. Retail Banking credit impairments declined 12% to R4 764m, reducing its credit loss 
ratio to 1.20% from 1.39%, due to the improved quality of new loans, better collection strategies and 
reduced store card sales. Home Loans’ charge fell 25% to R689m, a 0,30% credit loss ratio from 0,40%. 
Vehicle and Asset Finance’s credit impairments declined 19% to R847m, improving its credit loss ratio 
to 0.87% from 1.14%. Card credit impairments decreased 18% to R1 924m, resulting in a 4,53% credit 
loss ratio from 5,41%. Personal Loans’ charge rose 12% to R1 112m, reflecting stricter write off 
criteria, which increased Its credit loss ratio to 6,09% from 5,68%.

Business Banking South Africa credit impairments fell 53% to R274m, reflecting lower early arrears 
and improved collections. Its credit loss ratio decreased to 0,43% from 0,98%.

CIB South Africa credit impairments decreased 44% to R567m from R1 020m, due to a large single name 
exposure in 2016. Its credit loss ratio normalised to 0,24% from a high base of 0,44%. 

Rest of Africa Banking credit impairments fell 26%, or 18% in constant currency, to R1 289m from 
R1 732m. Its credit loss ratio improved to 1,34% from 1,62%. RBB Rest of Africa’s charge fell 30%, or 
23% in constant currency, to R950m reflecting increased focus on collections. CIB Rest of Africa’s credit 
impairments decreased 11%, or 3% in constant currency, due to both an adjustment to emergence periods and 
some specific exposures in the base. 

Operating expenses
Group operating expenses grew 4% to R41 403m from R39 956m, resulting in a 56,8% cost-to-income ratio 
from 55.2%. In constant currency operating expenses increased 6%.  

Staff costs grew 5% and accounted for 56% of total expenses. Salaries rose 5% or 7% in constant currency, 
while total incentives grew 4%. Headcount increased 1%, largely due to technology hires in South Africa, 
while rest of Africa declined 4%. 

Non-staff costs grew 2%. Professional fees fell 2% to R1 699m, while telephone and postage declined 
7% and printing and stationery decreased 9%. Operating leases on properties decreased 4% to R1 606m and 
property costs rose 1% to R1 731m. Marketing costs grew 8% to R1 709m, reflecting retail product campaigns 
and the Shared Growth initiative. Total IT-related spend grew 8% to R7 362m and constituted 18% of Group 
expenses. Amortisation of intangible assets rose 1% to R650m, while cash transportation increased 13% to 
R1 089m. The 19% growth in depreciation reflects investment in technology and optimisation of the corporate 
property portfolio and branch network. 

South Africa Banking costs grew 6% to R30 102m. RBB South Africa increased 7%, reflecting continued 
investment in frontline staff, marketing campaigns and retail product launches, plus digital and channels. 
CIB South Africa expenses grew 2%, reflecting efficiency initiatives.

Rest of Africa Banking expenses decreased 2% due to the strong Rand. Its costs increased 7% in constant 
currency, with CIB growing 12% and RBB rising 5%. Operating expenses increased in the second half, given 
incremental IT costs after Barclays PLC’s sell down. Excluding these, costs were contained at below 
inflation, allowing Rest of Africa Banking to maintain a stable cost-to-income ratio of 57,6%. 

WIMI’s costs grew 3% to R3 631m, with continuing line costs increasing 4%. 

Other expenses decreased 12% to R1 876m, reflecting 53% lower ‘other impairments’ to R322m and 9% higher
indirect taxation of R1 554m. 

Taxation
The Group’s taxation expense increased 7% to R6 265m, slightly above the 5% growth in pre-tax profit, 
resulting in a 27,5% effective tax rate from 26,9%. The increase largely reflects 56% growth in non-tax 
deductible expenses.

Segment performance
The segmental disclosure has changed to reflect the Group’s leadership structure and the way in which 
businesses are run along geographic rather than divisional lines. 

South Africa Banking
Headline earnings grew 4% to R12 200m, due to 20% lower credit impairments, as pre-provision profits 
declined 2% to R23 243m. Revenue grew 2% to R53 345m, with non-interest income increasing 4%. Costs grew 
6% to R30 102m, resulting in a 56,4% cost to income ratio from 54,4%. Its credit loss ratio fell to 0,80% 
from 1,03%, as all three divisions improved. South Africa Banking generated a return on regulatory capital 
(RoRC) of 20,8% and constituted 75% of total normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre. 

RBB South Africa
Headline earnings increased marginally to R8 874m, largely due to 16% lower credit impairments. Non-interest 
income grew 5%, while net interest income was flat due to margin compression. Operating expenses rose 7%, 
reflecting continued investment in systems and frontline staff. RBB South Africa accounted for 54% of normalised 
headline earnings excluding the Group centre and generated a 23.5% RoRC.

Retail Banking South Africa
Headline earnings were flat at R6 546m, as pre-provision profits declined 3%, which was offset by 12% 
lower credit impairments. However, headline earnings grew 12% in the second half, as new loan production 
and revenue improved. Although Transactional and Deposits’ non-interest income grew 7%, higher credit 
impairments and 9% cost growth resulted in earnings falling 8% to R2 470m. Home Loans’ earnings rose 5% to 
R1 715m, reflecting cost containment, strong non-interest income growth and 25% lower credit impairments. Card 
and Payments earnings grew 3% to R1 601m, largely due to lower credit impairments and growth in acquiring revenue. 
Vehicle and Asset Finance earnings grew 20% to R963m, on 19% lower credit impairments and solid non-interest 
income and loan growth. Lower costs drove the 3% rise in Personal Loans earnings to R436m. Retail Banking South 
Africa accounted for 40% of normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre and generated a 23,1% RoRC.

Business Banking South Africa
Headline earnings increased 1% to R2 328m, as credit impairments dropped 53%. Revenue growth improved in 
the second half, but pre-provision profits declined as costs grew 11% given continued investment in frontline 
staff and systems. Non-interest income rose 9% excluding equities. Business Banking South Africa generated 14% 
of overall normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre and produced a 27,7% RoRC.

CIB South Africa
Headline earnings increased 16% to R3 326m, largely due to a 44% reduction in credit impairments off a 
high base. Pre-provision profits grew 5% as 3% revenue growth exceeded 2% higher costs. Corporate earnings 
grew 8% to R1 143m as 9% revenue growth produced 15% higher pre-provision profits. Investment Bank earnings 
increased 22% to R2 183m, largely due to 60% lower credit impairments and reduced costs. CIB South Africa 
contributed 20% of total normalised headline earnings excluding the Group centre and generated a 15.9% RoRC.

Rest of Africa Banking
Headline earnings grew 7%, or 24% in constant currency, to R2 954m, due to positive constant currency 
operating Jaws and 26% lower credit impairments. Pre-provision profits increased 9% in constant currency. 
Revenue fell 3% to R15 617m, masking 8% growth in constant currency. While costs fell 2% to R9 000m, it rose 7% 
in constant currency, resulting in a 57,6% cost-to-income ratio. Credit impairments fell 26% to R1 289m, resulting 
in a 1,34% credit loss ratio from 1,62%. Rest of Africa Banking accounted for 18% of total normalised headline 
earnings excluding the Group centre and generated a 16,6% RoE.

RBB Rest of Africa
Headline earnings fell 6% to R670m, despite increasing 19% in constant currency. Constant currency revenue 
growth of 2% reflected margin compression from regulatory changes in Kenya. Costs grew 5% in constant currency, 
resulting in a 72,4% cost-to-income ratio. Credit impairments decreased 23% in constant currency, improving its 
credit loss ratio to 2,22% from 2,92%. RBB Rest of Africa contributed 4% of total normalised headline earnings 
excluding the Group centre. 

CIB Rest of Africa
Headline earnings grew 8% to R2 348m, or 21% in constant currency. Revenue increased 7% to exceed 3% 
higher costs. These grew 18% and 12% in constant currency respectively to produce a 36.5% cost-to income-ratio. 
Pre-provision profits increased 9%. Credit impairments fell 3% in constant currency. Corporate earnings grew 18% or 
32% in constant currency to R1.7bn. Rand strength reduced Investment Bank’s earnings, which declined 10% to R0,7bn, 
despite rising 2% in constant currency. CIB Rest of Africa contributed 14% of total normalised headline earnings 
excluding the Group centre. 

Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance
Headline earnings decreased 8% to R1 156m. South African earnings decreased 17% to R1 137m and Rest of Africa 
returned to profitability, with earnings of R19m. Gross operating income  grew 2% to R6 171m and costs rose 3% to 
R3 279m. Life insurance earnings fell 9% due to the unwinding of a deferred tax asset raised in the prior year. 
Embedded value of new business increased 10% from growth in risk policies written. Despite strong 16% growth in 
assets under management to R335bn, the Investment cluster earnings were impacted by margin compression resulting 
in 2% growth in earnings. WIMI earnings declined to a R49m loss due to credit impairments on a single client. 
Short-term insurance earnings grew 2%, despite experiencing significantly higher catastrophe event claims. Excluding 
these events, its underwriting margin in South Africa improved to 8.7%. WIMI’s RoE was 20,1% and it generated 7% of 
total earnings excluding the Group centre.

Prospects
In South Africa we expect a modest improvement in real GDP growth to 1.4% in 2018, with upside potential 
from fixed investment, a rebound in confidence and strong global growth, although fiscal consolidation remains 
a concern and there is downside risk for credit ratings. We believe the South African Reserve Bank will keep 
interest rates on hold for some time. 

Our latest forecast indicates slightly better GDP growth of 5.8% in our markets in the rest of Africa, 
with further monetary policy easing in a number of countries. At current exchange rates the rand could weigh 
on our rest of Africa reported growth again in 2018.    

Given these assumptions, and excluding major political, macroeconomic or regulatory developments, we expect our 
loan and deposit growth to improve in 2018. We again see stronger loan growth from the rest of Africa in constant 
currency and CIB than Retail South Africa. Our net interest margin is likely to decline slightly this year, due 
to rate cuts in the rest of Africa, regulatory costs and mix effects. Costs will remain well controlled  and our 
operating Jaws should improve from last year’s. While IFRS 9 could increase volatility, we expect a stable 
credit loss ratio. Our CET1 ratio is likely to remain above Board targets, which will allow us to maintain our 
current dividend cover. Lastly, our normalised RoE should improve slightly in 2018.

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC separation On 1 March 2016, Barclays PLC announced 
its intention to sell down its 62,3% interest in the Group. A comprehensive separation programme was initiated 
by Barclays PLC and the Group to determine possible interactions between the companies to ensure that the Group 
can operate as an independent and sustainable group without the involvement of Barclays PLC.
 
Barclays PLC currently holds 14.9% in the Group.
 
As part of its divestment Barclays PLC contributed £765m to the Group, primarily in recognition of the investments 
required for the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. Investments will be made primarily in rebranding, technology 
and separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of 
separation investments on the Group over time. The separation process will have an impact on the Group’s financial 
results for the next few years, most notably by increasing the capital base in the near-term and generating 
endowment revenue thereon, with increased costs over time as the separation investments are concluded. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require that the Barclays PLC contribution be recognised 
directly in equity, while the subsequent investment expenditure (including the depreciation or amortisation of 
capitalised assets), will be recognised in profit or loss. The aforementioned will result in a disconnect between 
underlying business performance and the IFRS financial results during the separation period.
 
The following presents the items which have been excluded from the normalised financial results:
 
* Barclays PLC contribution (including the endowment benefit)
* Hedging linked to separation activities
* Technology and brand separation projects
* Depreciation and amortisation on the aforementioned projects
* Transitional service payments to Barclays PLC
* Employee cost and benefits linked to separation activities
* Separation project execution and support cost.

Basis of presentation
The Group’s  summary consolidated annual  financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS, interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations 
Committee (IFRS-IC), the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants’ Financial Reporting Guides 
as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the 
Financial Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements and the requirements of the Companies 
Act. The principal accounting policies applied are set out in the Group’s most recent audited annual 
consolidated financial statements.

The information disclosed in the SENS is derived from the information contained in the audited annual 
consolidated financial statements and does not contain full or complete disclosure details. Any 
investment decisions by shareholders should be based on consideration of the audited annual 
consolidated financial statements, which is available on request. The presentation and disclosures 
comply with IAS 34 International Accounting Standards Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34).

The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future 
conditions. Use of available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation 
of estimates. The accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Group’s results and financial 
position, in terms of the materiality of the items to which the policies are applied, and which 
involve a high degree of judgement including the use of assumptions and estimation, are impairment 
of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, fair value measurements, impairment of available-for-sale 
financial assets, consolidation of structured or sponsored entities, post-retirement benefits, 
provisions, income taxes, share-based payments, liabilities arising from claims made under short-term 
and long-term insurance contracts and offsetting of financial assets and liabilities. 

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in preparing the summary consolidated financial statements  are the 
same as those in place for the reporting period ended 31 December 2016  except for the adoption of 
the own credit exemption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), changes to the Group’s operating 
segments and business portfolios changes between operating segments. Refer to note 15.

Standards issued not yet effective
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with 
effect from 1 January 2018.  IFRS 9 includes revised requirements for the classification and measurement
of financial assets and liabilities, the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. BAGL will 
not restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 but will provide detailed 
transitional disclosures in accordance with the amended requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. Any change in the carrying value of financial instruments upon initial application of 
IFRS 9 will be recognised in equity. 

IFRS 9 introduces a revised impairment model which requires entities to recognise expected credit losses 
(‘ECL’) based on unbiased forward-looking information. The measurement of expected loss will involve 
increased complexity and judgment including estimation of lifetime probabilities of default, loss given 
default, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of 
exposures at default and assessing increases in credit risk. 
 
The revised impairment model is expected to have a material financial impact on the existing impairment 
provisions previously recognised in terms of the requirements of IAS 39.  It is estimated that the 
increase on IAS 39 impairment stock (including contractual interest suspended) will be in the region 
of 30%, on a pre-tax basis. Based on the current requirements of Basel III, the increase in the 
accounting impairment provisions is not expected to reduce the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) 
capital ratio by more than 35bps, on 1 January 2018, before taking into account the impact of the 
regulatory transitional arrangement. Barclays Africa Group Limited has elected to utilise the
transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 has 
been considered in the Group’s capital planning. 

The reasons for the change in impairment provisions are:
* The removal of the emergence period that was necessitated by the incurred loss model of IAS 39. All 
  stage 1 assets will carry a 12 month expected credit loss provision. This differs from IAS 39 where 
  unidentified impairments were typically measured with an emergence period of between three to 
  twelve months.
* The provisioning for lifetime expected credit losses on stage 2 assets; where some of these assets 
  would not have attracted a lifetime expected credit loss measurement per IAS 39.
* The inclusion of forecasted macroeconomic scenarios into the expectation of credit losses;
* The inclusion of expected credit losses on items that would not have been impaired under IAS 39, 
  such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. 
  
On initial adoption the new classification and measurement requirements under IFRS 9 will have an 
insignificant impact on the retained income of the Group. The specific requirements of IFRS 9 relating
to the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value were early 
adopted at the beginning of the current reporting period. The effects of changes in the credit risk 
of these liabilities’ are therefore presented in other comprehensive income with the remaining effect
presented in profit or loss. The Group will continue to apply the rules under IAS 39 hedge accounting 
until the project on accounting for macro hedging is completed, if not earlier. 

IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers
Implementation efforts performed to date indicate that the adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the financial results of the Group.

Notes 
(1) The Group disposed of its controlling stake in a non-core subsidiary which was classified as held for sale.
(2) As part of the disinvestment, Barclays PLC contributed R12.1bn in recognition of the investments required for 
    the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. The contribution meets the definition of a transaction with a 
    shareholder.
(3) As part of the separation, Barclays PLC contributed cash of R 1 891m to the independent Absa Empowerment Trust 
    to allow for its subsidiary to purchase 12 716 260 BAGL shares (1.5%) in the furtherance of the Group’s objective 
    of establishing a Broad-Based Black Empowerment structure. In terms of the requirements of IFRS, these shares have 
    been accounted for as treasury shares and eliminated against the Group’s share capital.
(4) CLS Group Holding AG shares were transferred to Barclays PLC for no consideration in 2005. During the current
    reporting period these shares were transferred back to the Group for a nominal consideration of one British Pound 
    Sterling (GBP). The shares have been recognised at a fair value of R48m. The related credit has been recognised in 
    equity as a shareholder contribution.
(5) The Additional Tier 1 Capital notes represent perpetual, subordinated instruments redeemable in full at the 
    option of Barclays Africa Group Limited (the issuer) on 12 September 2022 subject to regulatory approval.  Interest 
    is paid at the discretion of the issuer and is non-cumulative. In addition, if certain conditions are reached, the
    regulator may prohibit the issuer from making interest payments. Accordingly, the instruments are classified as equity
    instruments.

Notes
(1) The excess of the purchase price over the Group’s share of net assets of Barclays Africa Limited, acquired on 
    31 July 2013, was accounted for as a deduction against share premium. The sale and purchase agreement between the 
    Group and Barclays Bank Plc allowed for the purchase price to be adjusted for certain items and in June 2016 an 
    agreement was reached on the final purchase price adjustment. As a result Barclays Bank Plc paid R66m to the Group, 
    which was recognised in equity, in line with the accounting of the original transaction.
(2) During the previous reporting period the Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life (Pty) Ltd
    which resulted in a R25m increase in non-controlling interest.

Notes
(1) These numbers have been restated. Refer to the reporting changes overview in note 15.
(2) The impairments incurred during the current reporting period mainly relates to computer software, 
    Barclays.Net which was fully impaired. The prior period impairments relate to an acquired customer 
    list which was fully impaired following an adjustment to the interest rate outlook for the related 
    business and impairment of costs previously spent on the Virtual Bank initiative. In calculating 
    the impairment to be recognised, the value in use was based on a discounted cash flow methodology. 
(3) During the current reporting period management have decided to dispose of certain property and 
    equipment resulting in an impairment of R221m.

IAS 33 Earnings per share prescribes that the weighted average number of shares outstanding during a reporting period, 
and for all periods presented, should be adjusted for events that change the number of ordinary shares outstanding without 
a corresponding change in resources. The contribution of BAGL shares from Barclays PLC did not result in an adjustment to 
the net asset value of the Group. Refer to note 8. The weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2016 has been 
restated to reflect the acquisition from Barclays PLC of 12 716 260 (1.5%) BAGL shares to the Group in the current 
reporting period. The acquisition of shares by Barclays PLC has been treated as treasury shares of the Group from the 
beginning of 2016, which has led to a reduction in the number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purposes of determining 
the weighted average number of shares in the Headline Earnings Per Share and Diluted Headline Earnings Per Share.

Note
(1) The net amount is reflected after taxation and non-controlling interest.

7. Acquisitions and disposals of businesses and other similar transactions

7.1.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period
There were no acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period.

7.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period
Apart from the businesses classified as non-current assets/liabilities held for sale and disposed of (refer to note 1) there 
were no other disposals of businesses that were finalised during the current reporting period. The cash consideration received 
on disposals included in non-current assets/liabilities held for sale was R205m.

7.2.1  Acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period
In order to continue building and shaping the Group’s predictive underwriting products, expertise and technology, the Group 
acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life Proprietary Limited, previously known as Instant Life Proprietary Limited. 
The investment had an effective acquisition date of 31 March 2016 and is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. The 
acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred amounted to R100m.

The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Goodwill 
of R20m has been recognised and includes, but is not limited to, the insurer’s workforce and the increased market share gained.

From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed revenue of R9m to the total income earned by the Group. If the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, an additional R5m would have been generated by the Group, thereby 
resulting in a total income of R14m. From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed losses after tax of R12m to total 
profits earned by the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, losses after tax of an additional 
R3m would have been incurred by the Group, thereby resulting in a total loss after tax of R15m.

                                                                           Instant Life      Group

8. Related parties
As part of the separation, Barclays PLC sold ordinary Barclays Africa Group Limited shares representing 12.2% 
and 33.7% of issued ordinary share capital in May 2016 and June 2017 respectively. Barclays PLC currently holds 
126.2m ordinary Barclays Africa Group shares representing 14.9% of issued ordinary shares. The remaining 85.1% of 
the shares are widely held on the JSE. 

Barclays PLC contributed £765 million to the Group, primarily in recognition of the investments required for the 
Group to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested primarily in rebranding, technology and 
separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of separation 
investments on the Group over time. 

Barclays PLC contributed cash of R1 891m to be used in the furtherance of the Group’s objective of establishing 
Broad-Based Black Empowerment structure. The cash was contributed to the independent Absa Empowerment Trust, whose 
subsidiary purchased 12 716 260 BAGL shares. In terms of the requirements of IFRS, these shares have been accounted 
for as treasury shares and eliminated against the Group’s share capital.

CLS Group Holding AG shares were transferred to Barclays PLC for no consideration in 2005. During the current 
reporting period these shares were transferred back to the Group for a nominal consideration of one British Pound 
(GBP). The shares have been recognised at a fair value of R48m. The related credit has been recognised in equity as 
a shareholder contribution.

   Financial guarantee contracts                           10                     10    

Financial guarantee contracts represent contracts where the Group undertakes to make specified payments to a 
counterparty, should the counterparty suffer a loss as a result of a specified debtor failing to make payment when 
due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. This amount represents the maximum off-statement of financial 
position exposure.

none of which is individually significant to the Group. Leases are negotiated for an average term of three to five years 
and rentals are renegotiated annually.

Guarantees include performance guarantee contracts and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate the facilities 
by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the 
total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Legal proceedings
The Group has been party to proceedings against it during the reporting period, and as at the reporting date the following 
material cases are disclosed:
- Pinnacle Point Holdings Proprietary Limited (PPG): New Port Finance Company and the trustees of the Winifred Trust 
  (the plaintiffs) allege a local bank conducted itself unlawfully, and that Absa Bank Limited (the Bank) was privy 
  to such conduct. They have instituted proceedings against the Bank for damages in an amount of R1 387m. Although 
  Pinnacle Point Holding’s claim has been withdrawn, the second to fifth plaintiff’s claims remain and will proceed 
  to trial. 
- Ayanda Collective Investment Scheme (the Scheme): Absa Capital Investor Services was the trustee of Ayanda Collective 
  Investment Scheme, in which Corporate Money Managers (CMM) managed a portfolio of assets within the Scheme. The joint 
  curators of the CMM group of companies and the Altron Pension Fund (an investor in the fund) allege that the defendants 
  caused damages to them arising from their alleged failure to meet their obligations in the trust deed together with their 
  statutory obligations set out in the Collective Investment Scheme Act, in respect of which they seek payment of R1 157m. 
- On June 19, 2017, the Public Protector released the final report of her office’s investigation into the Bankorp assistance 
  package provided by the SA Reserve Bank between 1985 and 1995, recommending certain remedial action. Absa acquired 
  Bankorp in April 1992, for fair value, and had the responsibility of carrying out its existing legal obligations to the 
  SARB, which were met in full by October 1995. In consequence, Absa , together with the SARB, Minister of Finance and 
  National Treasury, brought  an application to review and set aside the remedial action recommended in the Public 
  Protector’s report which was successful and the report was thus set aside.
  
The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in South Africa and a number of other 
jurisdictions. It is involved in legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, 
including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, 
trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other statutory and 
common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other 
proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection 
measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business 
activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse 
effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically 
described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters will not be material to 
the Group’s results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst other things, the amount of the 
loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they cannot reasonably be 
estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter. Provision is made for all liabilities 
which are expected to materialise.
 
Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis has resulted in a significant tightening of 
regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally and locally, especially for companies that are deemed to be of systemic 
importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking and consumer 
credit industries globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. The nature and impact of future changes in 
the legal framework, policies and regulatory action especially in the areas of financial crime, banking and insurance regulation, 
cannot currently be fully predicted and are beyond the Group’s control. Some of these are likely to have an impact on the Group’s 
businesses, systems and earnings. 

The Group is continuously evaluating its programmes and controls in general relating to compliance with regulation. The Group 
undertakes   monitoring, review and assurance activities, and the Group has also adopted appropriate remedial and/or mitigating 
steps, where necessary or advisable, and has made disclosures on material findings as and when appropriate. 

Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group Limited, identified potentially fraudulent activity by certain of its 
customers using advance payments for imports in 2014 and 2015 to effect foreign exchange transfers from South Africa to beneficiary 
accounts located in East Asia, UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the Group conducted a review of relevant activity, processes, 
systems and controls. The Group is continuing to provide information to relevant authorities as part of the Group’s ongoing 
cooperation. It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the actions described on the Group 
or what effect that they might have upon the Group’s operating results, cash flows or financial position in any particular period, 
if any.

In February 2017 the South African Competition Commission (SACC) referred Barclays PLC, BCI and Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of 
Barclays Africa Group Limited, among other banks, to the Competition Tribunal to be prosecuted for breaches of South African 
antitrust law related to Foreign Exchange trading of South African Rand. The SACC found from its investigation that between 2007 
and 2013 the banks had engaged in various forms of collusive behaviour. Barclays was the first to bring the conduct to the attention 
of the SACC under its leniency programme and has cooperated with, and will continue to cooperate with, the SACC in relation to this 
matter.  The SACC is therefore not seeking an order from the Tribunal to impose any fine on Barclays PLC, BCI or Absa Bank Limited.

Income Taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group’s tax charge and provisions for 
income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There are many transactions and calculations for which the 
ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities may have indicated disagreement with the 
Group’s treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax 
authority. 

The Group recognises provisions for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after 
taking into account external advice where appropriate. The carrying amount of any resulting provisions will be sensitive to the 
manner in which tax matters are expected to be resolved, and the stage of negotiations or discussion with the relevant tax 
authorities. There may be significant uncertainty around the final outcome of tax proceedings, which in many instances, will only 
be concluded after a number of years. Management estimates are informed by a number of factors including, inter alia, the progress 
made in discussions or negotiations with the tax authorities, the advice of expert legal counsel, precedent set by the outcome of 
any previous claims, as well as the nature of the relevant tax environment.  

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period in which such determination is made. These 
risks are managed in accordance with the Group’s Tax Risk Framework.

14.   Assets and liabilities held at fair value
14.1  Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework 
includes a Traded Risk and Valuations Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), which is 
independent from the front office.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally 
approve valuation policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are 
reported to the Barclays Africa Group Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will 
therefore consider the appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC team independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair 
value measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk 
areas when performing independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They 
also assess and document the inputs obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which 
supports conclusions that valuations are performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.


Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to 
the specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction 
prices for similar properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating 
the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible the fair value of the Group’s investment properties is determined through valuations performed 
by external independent valuators.

When the Group’s internal valuations are different to that of the external independent valuers, detailed 
procedures are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC team verifies the procedures performed 
by the front office and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent valuations.


14.2  Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects 
the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Quoted market prices – Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. 
Such fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in 
active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring 
market transactions on an arm’s length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient 
volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs – Level 2
Fair values are classified as Level 2 if they have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in 
an active market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, 
or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs – Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more 
than 10% to the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable 
inputs of a similar nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or 
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market 
prices for similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using 
inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or 
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices 
for similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, 
where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital 
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, 
dependent on the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons 
with similar companies and price:earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied 
consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). OTC derivative contracts include 
forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, equity 
prices and commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted 
market prices, dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual 
cash flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus 
the originally priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used 
to reflect valuation date pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, 
are used to determine expected cash flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair 
value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying 
rates currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded 
derivatives, the embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives as detailed 
above.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying 
value. For other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying 
value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

14.3  Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below:

Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer 
prices respectively. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact 
that they are managed on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a 
derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk 
by strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such 
as broker data. For those assets and liabilities where the firm is a market maker and has the ability to 
transact at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative 
markets), the mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost. 

Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on 
fair value of counterparty credit risk, the Group’s own credit quality, as well as the cost of funding across 
all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the Group’s model governance framework. This process identifies the 
assumptions used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). 
Where necessary, fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation 
adjustments are dependent on the size of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market 
standard and to what extent it incorporates all known risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments 
are subject to review on at least an annual basis. 

14.4  Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group’s assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at 
fair value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

14.6.1 Significant transfers between levels

During the 2017 and 2016 reporting periods, transfers between levels occurred because of changes in the 
observability of valuation inputs, in some instances owing to changes in the level of market activity. 
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

Note
   (1) The unrealised gains and losses for loans and advances to customers for 2016 have been restated by R692m to 
       include the unrealised gains relating to the base rates applicable to the assets. Previously only normalised
       gains relating to the unobservable credit spreads for these assets were taken into account in the disclosure.

14.8  Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs
As part of the Group’s risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant unobservable 
parameters to generate a range of possible alternative valuations. The assets and liabilities that most 
impact this sensitivity analysis are those with the more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The stresses 
are applied independently and do not take account of any cross correlation between separate asset classes 
that would reduce the overall effect on the valuations.

The following table reflects how the unobservable parameters were changed in order to evaluate the 
sensitivities of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities:

   Significant unobservable parameter                    Positive/(negative) variance applied to parameters    
   Credit spreads                                        100/(100) bps                                         
   Volatilities                                          10/(10)%                                              
   Basis curves                                          100/(100) bps                                         
   Yield curves and repo curves                          100/(100) bps                                         
   Future earnings and marketability discounts           15/(15)%                                              
   Funding spreads                                       100/(100) bps                                         

A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to profit or loss, or a change 
in the fair value asset or liability by more than 10% or the underlying value of the affected item. This is 
demonstrated by the following sensitivity  analysis which includes reasonable range of possible outcomes:

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, 
the discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered 
unobservable inputs for items which mature after 5 years. However, if the items mature in less than 5 years, 
these inputs are considered observable.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying 
price of the market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to the 
unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.

14.10  Unrecognised losses as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income that relates to the difference 
between the transaction price and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable 
inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is as follows:

                                                                          2017       2016

14.11  Third-party credit enhancements
There were no significant liabilities measured at fair value and issued with inseparable third-party 
credit enhancements.

15. Reporting changes overview

15.1 Accounting policy changes
The Group made the following accounting policy changes as a result of new and amended standards of IFRS, 
which had no impact on the previously reported earnings of the Group:

The Group adopted the requirement to present the effects of changes in the fair value, which relate to 
own credit, of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss in other comprehensive 
income at 1 January 2017. The impact of this change has been detailed in the statement of comprehensive 
income and has no impact on opening reserves/retained earnings. Comparatives have not been restated.
All other amendments to IFRS, and new interpretations, effective for the current reporting period had 
no significant impact on the Group’s reported results.

15.2 Changes in reportable segments
The following business portfolio changes have impacted the financial results for the comparative period. 
None of the restatements have impacted the overall financial position or net earnings of the Group:

- Barclays PLC disposed of 12,2% and 33,7% of the Group’s shares in May 2016 and June 2017, 
  respectively. As part of its divestment Barclays PLC contributed £765m, primarily in recognition of the 
  investments required for the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested 
  primarily in rebranding, technology and separation-related projects and it is expected that it will 
  neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of separation investments on the Group over time. The 
  separation process will increase the capital base of the Group in the near-term and generate endowment 
  revenue thereon, with increased costs over time as the separation investments are concluded. The Group has
  therefore included an additional reconciling stripe ‘Barclays separation’, in its segment results.
- In the second half of 2016, the Group revised its operating model with ‘geography’ and ‘customer’ as 
  primary dimensions, creating a platform for increased focus and dedicated management capacity: South Africa 
  Banking, Rest of Africa Banking and WIMI (historically reporting was by customer only i.e. RBB, CIB and WIMI). 
  The reporting changes to financial disclosures were implemented from 1 January 2017.
- The Group refined its cost allocation methodology, resulting in the restatement of operating expenses from 
  RBB South Africa (R528m), CIB Rest of Africa (R83m) and Head Office, Treasury and other operations (R7m) to 
  CIB SA R379m, WIMI R194m and RBB Rest of Africa R45m.
- Commercial Property Finance (CPF) customers with loan balances exceeding R40m of R10.9bn were moved from 
  Retail and Business Banking (RBB SA) to Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB SA) to reflect the Group’s 
  customer segmentation and coverage model.
- The Group further enhanced segmental disclosures in the second half of 2017 to provide granularity to the 
  South Africa Banking segment (which now expands to RBB SA and CIB SA levels).

HIGH COURT SETS ASIDE PUBLIC PROTECTOR’S REMEDIAL ACTIONS

Barclays Africa Group shareholders are advised that the North Gauteng High Court delivered its
judgment in the matter between Absa Bank (Absa) and the Public Protector on Friday.

As indicated on 20 June 2017, Absa applied to the High Court to set aside the Public Protector’s
final report and its remedial actions, which included recovering R1.125bn from Absa relating to
its acquisition of Bankorp in April 1992.

The High Court found in Absa’s favour by setting aside the Public Protector’s remedial actions
and awarding punitive costs against the Public Protector.

FURTHER REDUCTION BY BARCLAYS PLC (“BARCLAYS”) OF ITS SHAREHOLDING IN BARCLAYS AFRICA
TO 14.9% AND SECTION 122 NOTICE



1. FURTHER REDUCTION BY BARCLAYS OF ITS SHAREHOLDING IN BARCLAYS AFRICA TO 14.9%

On 1 June 2017, shareholders were advised that Barclays had reduced its total interest in Barclays Africa
to 23.4% from 50.1%, in addition to which:
     - 1.5% would be contributed by Barclays to a broad-based black economic empowerment (“B-
        BBEE”) scheme in due course; and
     - 7.0% would be taken up by the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (“PIC”) on a deferred
        completion, subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals by the PIC,
following which Barclays’ total interest in Barclays Africa would be approximately 15%.

On 4 September 2017, a transaction was effected in which the 1.5% stake in Barclays Africa was
transferred from Barclays to an interim B-BBEE structure which was established by Barclays Africa, and
accordingly Barclays’ total interest in Barclays Africa was reduced to 21.9%. The intention is that these
shares will be held in the interim B-BBEE structure for a period before ultimately being applied towards
a new Barclays Africa B-BBEE scheme. Further details will be announced in due course.

As noted above, the transfer of the 7.0% stake in Barclays Africa to the PIC is subject to regulatory
approval. Pending receipt of such approvals, pursuant to an agreement between Barclays, the PIC and
the local subsidiaries of two international financial institutions (the “Financial Institutions”), Barclays
transferred (subject to settlement) the 7.0% stake in Barclays Africa to the Financial Institutions on 30
November 2017. This agreement is broadly a continuation of the previous agreement between Barclays
and the PIC and was therefore concluded at a price of R136.09 per share. The intention is:
    - for the Financial Institutions to hold 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively, in Barclays Africa (at which
        level, no regulatory approval is required); and
    - for the PIC to ultimately take ownership of the 7.0% stake in Barclays Africa from the Financial
        Institutions, subject to it receiving all necessary regulatory approvals .
Following the contribution to the interim B-BBEE structure and the transfer to the Financial Institutions,
Barclays’ total interest in Barclays Africa is at 14.9%. Barclays has indicated that this represents its
desired long term shareholding in Barclays Africa and that no further sales are planned at this time.

2. SECTION 122 NOTICE

Pursuant to the above and in accordance with section 122 (3)(b) of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008
(“the Companies Act”) and section 3.83(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, Barclays
Africa shareholders are advised that Barclays Africa has received formal notification from Barclays that
its total interest in Barclays Africa has been reduced to 126,145,303 ordinary shares (14.9%) from
185,487,851 ordinary shares (21.9%).

As required in terms of Section 122 of the Companies Act, the required notice will be filed with the
Takeover Regulation Panel.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

      -     Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R12bn as a result of exposure growth in
            Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB). Portfolios subject to the SA have increased by R6.5bn mainly due to
            asset growth outside of South Africa as well as exchange rate fluctuations.
      -     CCR: The decrease in CCR of R0.7bn is in line with market volatility, specifically exchange rate fluctuations.
      -     Market risk: The decrease in market risk of R8.3bn is due to lower levels of Value at Risk (VaR) and Stressed
            Value at Risk (sVaR) in the three-month averaging period.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption quarter on quarter were as follows:

         -      Credit risk: Portfolios subject to the AIRB approach have increased by R11.2bn as a result of exposure growth
                in CIB. The decrease in the SA of R1.1bn is mainly due to a reduction in the size of the portfolio in South Africa
                measured on a standardised basis.
         -      CCR: The decrease in CCR of R0.9bn is in line with market volatility, specifically exchange rate fluctuations.
         -      Market Risk: The decrease in market risk of R6.7bn is due to lower levels of VaR and sVaR in the three-month
                averaging period.

Approach decreased by R6.9bn from June 2017 to September 2017. Drivers of quarter on quarter changes in RWA

4)   Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of
banks by ensuring that they have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress scenario
lasting 30 calendar days. The LCR became effective on 1 January 2015, with a requirement of 60%, which will increase
by 10% per year to 100% on 1 January 2019. The requirement for 2017 is 80%.

The LCR is calculated as the value of HQLA divided by total net cash outflows. HQLA represents the value of assets that
can be easily and immediately converted into cash. Net cash outflows are calculated according to regulations.

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under
Guidance Note 6 of 2016, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Notes:
1. The 30 September figures and 30 June 2017 comparatives are unaudited.
2. The IFRS view includes the contribution amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
3. Reserves as at 30 September 2017 have already been reduced by the value of the 2017 interim ordinary dividend of
   R4.0bn for Barclays Africa Group Limited and R4.0bn for Absa Bank Limited, which were declared on 28 July 2017
   and paid on 11 September 2017 respectively.
4. The normalised ratios exclude the impact of the separation from Barclays PLC and reflect the underlying
   performance of the Group.
5. Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore
   holdings.
6. The South African minimum regulatory capital requirement of 8% (excluding the Pillar 2a and capital conservation
   buffers).
7. SA-CCR is calculated using the Current Exposure Method.
8. The capital conservation buffer is phased-in between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2019 reaching 2.5% by 1 January
   2019.
9. The 2017 minimum regulatory capital requirements of 10.75% include the RSA minimum of 8%, Pillar 2a of 1.50%
   and capital conservation buffer of 1.25% but exclude the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-
   on) and the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) add-on. The Pillar 2a buffer will reduce between 1
   January 2016 and 1 January 2019 reaching 1.00% by 1 January 2019.

10. The leverage ratio including unappropriated profits for Barclays Africa Group Limited and Absa Bank Limited at 30
    September 2017, on a normalised basis, was 7.0% (30 June 2017: 7.2%) and 5.6% (30 June 2017: 5.9%)
    respectively.
11. The LCR of Barclays Africa Group Limited represents an aggregation of the relevant individual net cash outflows and
    HQLA portfolios of all the banking entities which form part of the group. Where non-South African banking entities
    have an excess of HQLA above the minimum required by the LCR, this excess has been excluded from the
    calculation.
12. The values disclosed represent the simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points.
13. Absa Bank Solo consists of only the South African banking operation.

MOODY’S ASSIGNS RATINGS TO ABSA BANK’S AND BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP’S DOMESTIC
MEDIUM TERM NOTE (DMTN) PROGRAMMES

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Moody’s
Investors Service “Moody’s) has, on 10 August 2017, assigned provisional senior unsecured local
currency rating of (P)Baa3 to the ZAR60 billion Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) Programme of
Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank), and (P)Ba1 to the ZAR30 billion DMTN programme of Barclays Africa
Group Limited (BAGL). Both ratings are in line with Absa Bank’s Baa3 (negative) long term deposit rating
and BAGL’s BA1 (negative) long term issuer rating.

Absa Bank Limited’s ZAR60 billion DMTN programme

The (P)Baa3 local currency rating assigned to the senior unsecured class of notes of Absa Bank’s
existing DMTN programme is aligned with its Baa3 long-term deposit rating, reflecting the fact that the
senior instruments issued under the programme will be direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and
unsecured obligations of Absa Bank and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of Absa Bank.

Barclays Africa Group Limited’s ZAR30 billion DMTN programme

The (P)Ba1 local currency rating assigned to the senior unsecured class of notes of BAGL’s existing
DMTN programme is aligned with its Ba1 long-term issuer rating, reflecting the fact that the senior
instruments issued under the programme will be direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured
obligations of BAGL and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of BAGL.

Overview of results 
With the process of separating from Barclays PLC under way, including receipt of the R12bn settlement contribution 
from Barclays PLC in June 2017, Barclays Africa Group Limited (BAGL) has started both IFRS compliant financial results 
and a normalised view. The latter adjusts for the consequences of the separation and better reflects the Group’s 
underlying performance. It will present normalised results for all future periods where the financial impact of 
separation is considered to be material. Normalisation will adjust for the following items: endowment income on 
Barclays PLC’s R12bn separation contribution (1H17: R46m); hedging revenue linked to separation activities 
(1H17: R238m); operating expenses (1H17: R460m) such as change spend, including depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment (1H17: R325m on Barclays.Net), and Transitional Services Agreement costs; plus the tax impact 
of the aforementioned (1H17: R111m). In total, these adjustments added R152m to normalised group headline 
earnings during the period under review. Since normalisation occurs at a group level, it does not affect 
divisional disclosures. 

On a normalised basis, BAGL’s headline earnings grew 7% to R7 770m from R7 252m and diluted HEPS rose 7% to 917,7
cents from 856,7 cents. The Group’s normalised RoE increased to 16,8% from 16,1% and its return on assets increased to 
1,40% from 1,29%. Net interest income and non-interest income both declined 1%. The Group’s net interest margin (on average
interest-bearing assets) reduced to 4,93% from 5,01%. Loans and advances to customers grew 2% to R729bn, while deposits
due to customers increased 3% to R696bn. With operating expenses increasing 3%, the normalised cost-to-income ratio
increased to 55,6% from 53,4%, and pre-provision profit decreased 6% to R16,0bn. Rand strength reduced the Group’s revenue 
by 3% and headline earnings by 4%. In constant currency, pre-provision profit declined 3%. Credit impairments fell 27%
to R3,8bn, resulting in a 0,96% credit loss ratio from 1,29%. The ratio of NPLs to gross loans and advances improved to
3,7% from 3,8%, and portfolio provisions increased to 76 basis points (bps) of performing loans from 72 bps. The Group’s
NAV per share increased 4% to 11 261 cents on a normalised basis. 

Excluding normalisation, BAGL’s headline earnings increased 5% to R7 618m from R7 252m and diluted HEPS rose 5% to
899,7 cents. The Group’s RoE was stable at 16,1% and its return on assets increased to 1,37% from 1,29%. Net interest 
income declined 1% and non-interest income was flat, resulting in 1% lower total revenue. Operating expenses grew 5%,
increasing the cost to income ratio to 56,4% from 53,4%, and pre-provision profit decreased 7% to R15,8bn. The Group’s 
NAV per share increased 17% to 12 644 cents, reflecting Barclay PLC’s R12bn separation contribution in equity. 

South African Banking headline earnings increased 6% to R5 969m. Within this, RBB SA headline earnings fell 9% due to
negative operating Jaws. Retail Banking fell 10% to R3 092m, while Business Banking decreased 5% to R1 113m. CIB grew
76%, given 81% lower credit impairments. Corporate rose 35% to R558m and Investment Banking increased 105% to R1 206m.
Rest of Africa Banking headline earnings grew 19%, or 50% in constant currency. RBB Rest of Africa declined 18% to 
R336m as a result of the strong Rand, while CIB Rest of Africa rose 30%, reflecting positive operating Jaws and lower 
credit impairments. WIMI’s headline earnings decreased 8% to R574m, largely due to higher claims on two natural disasters.

South Africa’s headline earnings grew 2% to R6 149m, and Rest of Africa rose 19% to R1 469m, to account for 19% of
group earnings from 17%. 

Operating environment
The global economy and markets were generally well supported in the first half. US monetary policy continued on its
gradually tightening trajectory, and the evolution of the UK’s new relationship with the EU remained at an early stage.

South Africa’s economy shrank 0,7% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, pulling the economy into recession. 
Credit rating agencies downgraded South Africa’s sovereign ratings in response to this economic slowdown, concerns over
governance and financial performance in state-owned enterprises, and greater uncertainty in economic policy.  Though
there is evidence of agriculture recovering in many parts of the country from the drought conditions that persisted in late
2015 and much of 2016, other sectors of the economy are taking strain. Household incomes are under pressure, with a poor
job market and weak consumer confidence contributing to weak underlying demand. Business sector surveys continue to
point to very weak confidence and a concern over the lack of clarity on economic policy. The prime rate was flat in the
first half, as the Reserve Bank balanced a better inflation outlook with concern of the potential that the downgrade of the
country’s credit ratings could trigger higher inflation. Economic performance in the Group’s presence markets in the
rest of Africa was mixed, with generally improving outcomes in countries like Ghana, Mozambique and Uganda and somewhat
weaker trends in countries like Kenya, Zambia and Botswana.

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total assets decreased marginally to R1 138bn at 30 June 2017, due to 24% lower loans and advances to banks. On a
normalised basis, excluding the R12bn contribution from Barclays PLC, total assets declined 1% to R1 126bn. 

Loans and advances to customers
Net loans and advances to customers increased 2% to R729bn, or 3% on a constant currency basis. South African Banking
loans rose 3% to R644bn. Retail Banking South Africa’s loans grew 1% to R377bn, reflecting 6% growth in Vehicle and
Asset Finance (VAF) and 3% higher Personal Loans, while Home Loans and Card declined 1% and 3% respectively. Business
Banking South Africa’s loans rose 7% to R62bn. CIB South Africa’s loans grew 6% to R205bn. Rest of Africa Banking loans
decreased 4% to R79bn, despite increasing 8% in constant currency.
            
Funding
The Group’s liquidity position remains strong. Deposits due to customers grew 3% to R696bn. The Group’s loans to
deposit and debt securities was flat at 87,1%. Deposits due to customers constituted 78,6% of total funding from 75,2%, 
due to a reduction in deposits from banks. Retail Banking South Africa maintained its leading market share and increased
deposits 7% to R181bn. Business Banking South Africa’s deposits grew 2% to R109bn. CIB’s deposits grew 4% to R183bn,
including 8% higher cheque account deposits. Rest of Africa Banking deposits decreased 3% to R120bn, despite increasing 
9% in constant currency including CIB growing 14%. 

Net asset value
The Group’s NAV rose 17% to R107bn and its NAV per share grew 17% to 12 644 cents. On a normalised basis, both
increased 4%. During the half it generated profits of R7,4bn, from which it paid R4,8bn in ordinary dividends. 
Its foreign currency translation reserve reduced from R2,4bn to R1,8bn.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) increased 4% to R725bn at 30 June 2017, due to increased credit risk RWAs. The Group
remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements. The Group’s CET1 and Tier 1 capital
adequacy ratios were 13,7% and 14,0% respectively (from 12,1% and 12,6%). On a normalised basis, its CET1 was 12,1%. 
The Group generated 1,0% of CET1 capital internally during the period. Its total normalised capital adequacy ratio was 
14,5%. Declaring a 3% higher DPS of 475 cents on a dividend cover of 1,9 times took into account the difficult and 
volatile macro economy, the Group’s strong capital position, internal capital generation, strategy and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income
Net interest income
Net interest income decreased 1% to R20 837m (or R20 791m on a normalised basis) from R21 093m, while average
interest-bearing assets grew 1%. Normalised net interest income grew 3% in constant currency, excluding the impact of 
the strong Rand.  

The Group’s net interest margin (to average interest-bearing assets) narrowed to 4,93% from 5,01%. Loan pricing had a
5 bps negative impact, primarily due to the impact of lower National Credit Act (NCA) caps on unsecured retail 
portfolios in South Africa and a suspended interest on NPL. Loan composition reduced the Group’s margin by 3 bps, 
due to a higher proportion of CIB loans.

The Group’s deposit margin declined 1 bp, as higher wholesale liquidity premiums and the negative mix impact of
increased wholesale funding offset improved pricing in Business Banking and Corporate.

Higher South African interest rates resulted in a 7 bps greater endowment benefit on deposits and equity. Despite
releasing R97m to the income statement, the benefit from structural hedging declined 3 bps. Rest of Africa reduced 
the Group margin by 4 bps, reflecting regulatory caps in Kenya and its lower weighting in the overall composition 
due to the stronger Rand. 

South Africa’s net interest margin narrowed to 4,47% from 4,50% and Rest of Africa’s decreased to 7,15% from 7,29%. 

Non-interest income
Non-interest income was largely flat at R15 487m from R15 415m to account for 43% of total revenue. On a normalised
basis, excluding a R238m separation-related hedging gain, non-interest income declined 1% to R15 249m. On a constant
currency basis, normalised non-interest income increased 1%. 

Net fee and commission income grew 3% to R10 618, which represented 68% of total non-interest revenue. Electronic
banking fees and commissions increased 3% to R2 512m and cheque accounts rose 11% to R2 391m. Credit cards fees and 
commissions fell 1% to R1 256m and savings accounts decreased 4% to R1 067m. Card merchant income grew 5% to R889m. 
Investment, markets execution and investment banking fees increased 195% to R357m. Retail Banking South Africa fees 
and commissions increased 3% to R6 128m. 

Net trading declined 2% to R2 646m, reflecting a reduction in South Africa trading revenue and the effect of the
strong Rand. 

Within other operating income, there was a R320m foreign currency translation reserve gain from the group’s London
branch in the first half of 2016, which did not recur. This item was excluded from headline earnings.   

South Africa Banking’s non-interest income grew 3% to R10 452m, 69% of the Group total. Retail Banking South Africa
increased 4% to R6 512m, as Transactional and Deposits grew 2% and Card 3%, including 10% growth in acquiring volumes.
Business Banking’s non-interest income grew 4% to R1 832m, composed of 9% growth excluding equities and 48% lower 
equities non-interest income due to reduced revaluation gains in the portfolio. CIB South Africa was flat at 
R2 108m, with Corporate up 16% and the Investment Bank down 6% due to lower Markets revenue. 

Rest of Africa Banking’s non-interest income declined 7% to R2 469m due to the strong Rand, which outweighed 9% growth
in constant currency. CIB Rest of Africa increased 3% to R1 214m, or 21% in constant currency, given strong growth in
trading revenue. RBB Rest of Africa fell 14% to R1 257m, or by 1% in constant currency, due to lower fees on
transactional accounts. 

WIMI’s non-interest revenue was flat at R2 509m, despite Life Insurance net premium income growing 5%, as Short-term
Insurance net premium income declined 9%. 
 
Non-interest income in South Africa grew 2% to R12 828m, or 83% of the total, while Rest of Africa fell 5% to 
R2 659m, despite growing 10% in constant currency. 
            
Impairment losses on loans and advances
Group credit impairments decreased 27% to R3 773m from R5 197m, producing a 0,96% credit loss ratio from 1,29% of
customer loans and loans to banks. Credit impairments included collection costs of R142m. 

Group NPLs decreased 4% to R30 252m, or 3,7% of gross loans and advances from 3,8% (and 3,9% at 31 December 2016). 
Total NPL coverage was largely flat at 43,5% from 43,8%. Total balance sheet provisions decreased 2% to R19 067m. 
Portfolio provisions increased 4% to R5 908m, constituting 0,76% of total performing loans from 0,72%.
This includes 11% higher macroeconomic impairments of R1 457m.

South Africa Banking credit impairments decreased 28% to R3 124m, resulting in a 0,91% credit loss ratio from 
1,28%. RBB South Africa’s charge fell 9% to R2 911m. 

Retail Banking credit impairments declined 6% to R2 716m, improving its credit loss ratio to 1,39% from 1,48%. 
Home Loans’ charge reduced 8% to R466m, a 0,41% credit loss ratio from 0,44%. Mortgage NPL cover reduced to 20,9% 
from 21,9%, reflecting an improved legal portfolio construct, while its performing loan portfolio provision was 
flat at 0,55%. Vehicle and Asset Finance’s credit impairments decreased 6% to R477m, reducing its credit loss 
ratio to 1,01% from 1,13%. Card credit impairments decreased 12% to R1 141m, due to a reduction in the store 
card book and lower early arrears, resulting in a 5,38% credit loss ratio from 5,95%. Personal Loans credit 
impairments rose 10%, reflecting stricter write off criteria, which increased its credit loss ratio to 6,23% 
from 5,85%. 

Business Banking South Africa credit impairments fell 41% to R195m, reflecting lower early arrears across all its
portfolios and improved collection capabilities. Its credit loss ratio decreased to 0,62% from 1,12%. 

CIB South Africa credit impairments decreased 81% to R213m from R1 101m. The first half 2016 base included two large
single name exposures and increased portfolio provisions. Its credit loss ratio reduced to 0,18% from a high prior year
base of 0,97%. CIB’s watchlists continue to improve, with reduced early and late stage arrears.  

Rest of Africa Banking credit impairments decreased 31%, or 21% in constant currency, to R638m from R928m. Its credit
loss ratio decreased to 1,38% from 1,68%. RBB Rest of Africa’s charge fell 19%, or 6% in constant currency, to R522m
reflecting an improved portfolio construct and increased focus on collections. CIB Rest of Africa’s credit impairments
decreased 59%, or 54% in constant currency, off a high base that included an adjustment to emergence periods and some
specific exposures. 
 
Operating expenses
Group operating expenses grew 5% to R20 498m from R19 487m, resulting in a 56,4% cost-to-income ratio from 53,4%. 
On a normalised basis, excluding R460m of separation-related costs, expenses increased 3% to R20 038m and the 
cost-to-income ratio was 55,6%. Normalised operating expenses increased 6% in constant currency, adjusting for 
the stronger Rand.     

Staff costs grew 4% and accounted for 55% of total expenses. Salaries rose 3% or 5% in constant currency excluding
Barclays PLC separation costs. Bonuses increased 13%, while deferred cash and share-based payments grew 24% as new 
schemes were introduced. 
 
Non-staff costs grew 6%, with property-related costs flat at R1 654m and depreciation up 14% to R937m. Total IT spend
grew 7% to R3 836m and constituted 19% of Group expenses. Professional fees increased 23% to R1 015m, due entirely to
separation-related consultancy and IT development costs, since business as usual professional fees fell 5%. Marketing grew
29% to R785m, including an element of separation costs, plus retail product campaigns and the Group’s Shared Growth
initiative. Amortisation of intangible assets increased 11% due to investment in digital, data and automation capabilities.

South Africa Banking costs grew 6% to R14 435m. RBB South Africa increased 7%, reflecting continued investment in
frontline staff, marketing campaigns and retail product launches, and in digital and channels. CIB South Africa expenses
grew below inflation at 4%, as efficiency initiatives allowed continued investment in technology, which increased 15%.  

Rest of Africa Banking expenses decreased 11% due to the strong Rand. Its costs increased 3% in constant currency,
with CIB growing 8% and RBB rising 2%. Rest of Africa Banking’s cost-to-income ratio improved from 58,9% to 55,8%, 
which is similar to the 55,0% of South Africa Banking. 

Other expenses decreased 12% to R1 120m, reflecting 40% lower ‘other impairments’ to R376m and 15% higher indirect
taxation of R744m. On a normalised basis, other expenses decreased 38%, excluding a R325m computer software impairment 
on Barclays.Net, which the Group will no longer use following the separation from Barclays PLC.    

Taxation
The Group’s taxation expense increased 3% to R3 080m, slightly less than the 4% growth in pre-tax profit, resulting in
a 28,0% effective tax rate from 28,3%. Adjusting for the R111m effect of separation, taxation rose 6% to R3 191m on a
normalised basis. 

Segment performance
The Group’s segmental disclosure has changed to align with how the banking operations are now run along geographic
rather than divisional lines.      
 
South Africa Banking
Headline earnings grew 6% to R5 969m, due to 28% lower credit impairments, as its pre-provision profit declined 5% to
R11 795m. Revenue grew 1% to R26 230m, with non-interest income increasing 3%. Costs grew 6% to R14 435m, which
increased the cost-to-income ratio to 55,0% from 52,3%. The credit loss ratio improved to 0,91% from 1,28%, as all the 
divisions improved. South Africa Banking constituted 74% of total normalised headline earnings (excluding the Group 
centre) and generated an RoRC of 20,8%.

Retail Banking South Africa
Headline earnings decreased 10% to R3 092m, as pre-provision profits declined 7%, partially offset by 6% lower credit
impairments. Transactional and Deposits earnings dropped 14% to R1 204m, given negative operating Jaws as costs grew
11%. Home Loans’ earnings fell 9% to R764m, largely due to 5% lower net interest income as loans declined 1% and its 
margin narrowed because of increased interest suspended. Card earnings decreased 7%, reflecting 3% lower loans and 
margin compression as a result of the reduced NCA caps.  

Vehicle and Asset Finance earnings rose 5%, largely due to 6% loan growth and 6% lower credit impairments. Personal
Loans earnings fell 16%, given 10% higher credit impairments and margin pressure due to the NCA caps. Retail Banking 
South Africa accounted for 38% of total earnings, excluding the Group centre.  

Business Banking South Africa
Headline earnings declined 5% to R1 113m, due to negative operating Jaws. Higher funding costs reduced net interest
income and costs grew 9%, reflecting continued investment in frontline staff and systems. Credit impairments dropped 41%.
Business Banking South Africa generated 14% of overall earnings excluding the Group centre.

CIB South Africa
Headline earnings increased 76% to R1 764m, largely due to an 81% reduction in credit impairments off a high base.
Pre-provision profits grew 6% as 5% revenue growth exceeded 4% higher costs. Corporate earnings grew 35% to R558m due to
11% revenue growth and 54% lower credit impairments. Investment Bank earnings increased 105% to R1 206m, largely due to
83% lower credit impairments. CIB South Africa accounted for 22% of total earnings excluding the Group centre.

Rest of Africa Banking
Headline earnings grew 19%, or 50% in constant currency, to R1 512m, due to positive operating Jaws and 31% lower
credit impairments. Pre-provision profit increased 1%, or 20% in constant currency, to R3 391m. Revenue fell 6% to 
R7 670m, masking 10% growth in constant currency. While costs fell 11% to R4 279m, it increased 3% in constant 
currency, still well below inflation across the portfolio. Its cost-to- income ratio declined to 55,8% from 58,9%. 
Credit impairments fell 31% to R638m, resulting in a 1,38% credit loss ratio from 1,68%. Rest of Africa Banking 
accounted for 19% of total earnings excluding the Group centre and generated a 17,4% RoE from 13,5%. 

RBB Rest of Africa
Headline earnings fell 18% to R336m, although it increased 5% in constant currency. Revenue declined 15%, or 1% in
constant currency reflecting margin pressure due to regulatory changes in Kenya and 12% lower loans (down 1% in constant
currency). Costs fell 12% (increased 2% in constant currency), resulting in a 70,9% cost-to-income ratio from 68,9%.
Credit impairments decreased 19% (6% in constant currency), improving its credit loss ratio to 2,49% from 2,72%. 
RBB Rest of Africa contributed 4% of total earnings excluding the Group centre.

CIB Rest of Africa
Headline earnings grew 30% to R1 206m, or 60% in constant currency. Revenue grew 9% (or 28% in constant currency) 
to exceed 6% lower costs (up 8% in constant currency) and produced 19% higher pre-provision profits. Its cost-to-income
ratio fell to 35,0% from 40,5%. Credit impairments dropped 59% (54% in constant currency), resulting in a 0,60% credit 
loss ratio from 1,34%. CIB Rest of Africa contributed 15% of total earnings excluding the Group centre. 

WIMI
Headline earnings decreased 8% to R574m, with continuing business lines declining 6%. South African earnings from
continuing lines decreased 4% to R616m, while the losses in Rest of Africa increased 48% to R43m. Gross operating income
from continuing lines grew 1% to R3 061m, while costs rose 5% to R1 668m. Life insurance earnings were flat at R384m,
impacted by a decrease in single premium investment fees, higher claims and new business strain. WIMI’s earnings were 
also flat at R234m, although its assets under management grew 4% to R295bn. Short-term insurance earnings in South Africa
declined 15% to R82m, reflecting claims on two natural disasters. Excluding these events, its underwriting margin improved 
to 7,4%. WIMI’s return on equity declined to 19,3% from 21,1% and it generated 7% of total earnings excluding the Group
centre.

Prospects
The economic cycle is currently more consistent across major economies than it has been for some time, providing some
confidence that the favourable global economic backdrop is likely to continue in the near term. For 2017 as a whole the
global economy is expected to grow by 3,8%, slightly faster than in recent years.

We have cut our GDP growth forecast for South Africa to just 0,3% in 2017, on a par with 2016’s outcome. Inflation,
already well within the Reserve Bank’s target, is likely to moderate further as the weak economic environment heightens
price competition among retailers and a bumper harvest in staple commodities helps bring food inflation down further.
Responding to this combination of a weaker economy and a more comfortable inflation performance, the prime rate was reduced
by 25 bps in July, the first rate cut in five years. We currently see potential for another 25 bps rate cut in September,
which our stuctural hedging programme will provide some protection against. Key risks facing South Africa in the second 
half include heightened political and policy uncertainty in the run up to the ruling party’s December elective conference, 
the potential for the country’s sovereign credit rating to be downgraded further, and for weak business and consumer 
confidence to lead to a longer, more protracted recession. For the Group’s Rest of Africa economies the outlook looks 
somewhat stronger and for the full year GDP is expected to expand by 5,3% in 2017, slightly ahead of 2016’s growth.

Against this backdrop, and barring any unforeseen regulatory and macroeconomic developments, we continue to expect 
low to mid-single digit loan growth, with CIB growing faster than RBB and South Africa below the Rest of Africa in 
constant currency. The Group’s net interest margin is expected to decline slightly this year. Slower revenue growth, 
in part due to regulatory changes, is likely to produce negative Jaws near-term, despite continued cost management. 
However, the Group’s credit loss ratio should improve in 2017, in part due to the large single name provision in 
the base, while the reduction in retail early delinquencies in South Africa also bodes well. The Group’s CET1 ratio 
is likely to remain above board targets and its normalised RoE should be broadly similar to 2016’s. While separating 
from Barclays PLC will impact our near-term returns, we still believe that our stated longer-term targets currently 
remain appropriate for our group. Lastly, we continue to expect that the Group’s dividend cover is likely to 
increase slightly in the medium term.

Basis of presentation 
The Group’s unaudited condensed interim financial results have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), interpretations issued by the IFRS
Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC), the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants’ Financial Reporting Guides as 
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements and the requirements of the Companies Act. The principal accounting 
policies applied are set out in the Group’s most recent audited annual consolidated financial statements.

The accounting policies applied in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial results comply
with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, except for internal reclassifications and business portfolio changes. Refer to
note 15. 

The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future conditions. Use of
available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. The accounting policies
that are deemed critical to the Group’s results and financial position, in terms of the materiality of the items to
which the policies are applied, and which involve a high degree of judgement including the use of assumptions and
estimation, are impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, fair value measurements, impairment of available-
for-sale financial assets, consolidation of structured or sponsored entities, post-retirement benefits, provisions, income 
taxes, share-based payments, liabilities arising from claims made under short-term and long-term insurance contracts and
offsetting of financial assets and liabilities.

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial results are the
same as those in place for the reporting period ended 31 December 2016 except for the adoption of the own credit exemption
of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), changes to the Group’s operating segments and business portfolio changes
between operating segments. Refer to note 15 for further information.

Standards issued not yet effective

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2018 and is
expected to have a significant impact on how the group accounts for its financial instruments. IFRS 9 includes requirements
for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, impairment of financial assets and hedge
accounting. 

Based on analysis performed to date, the Group does not expect the effects of the new classification and measurement
requirements under IFRS 9 to have a significant impact, although the final measure of impact is dependent on the
Statement of Financial Position composition on the date of initial adoption. The requirements of IFRS 9 relating to the
presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value were adopted during the current reporting
period. As a result, the effects of changes in those liabilities’ credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income
with the remaining effect presented in profit or loss. In accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRS 9,
comparatives have not been restated. 

The impairment requirements will lead to significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments. The
introduction of the revised impairment model is expected to have a material financial impact, with impairment charges 
expected to be more volatile in the future.

The Group has a jointly accountable risk and finance implementation and governance programme with representation from
all impacted departments. The parallel run of IFRS 9 and IAS 39 impairment models commenced in February 2017, which
includes model, process and output validation, testing, calibration and analysis.The key focus of the programme is on
finalising processes, governance and controls in preparation for initial application in 2018. It will not be practical to
disclose reliable financial impact estimates until the implementation programme and validation and testing are further
advanced.

The Group expects to exercise the accounting policy choice to continue IAS 39 hedge accounting and is therefore not
planning to change existing hedge accounting application. It will, however, implement the revised hedge accounting
disclosures required by the related amendments to Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7).

The Group will not restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 but will provide detailed
transitional disclosures in accordance with the amended requirements of IFRS 7. Any change in the carrying value of
financial instruments and related taxation upon initial application of IFRS 9 will be recognised in equity. 

Based on the current requirements of Basel III, the expected increase in the accounting impairment provision would
reduce Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital but this impact would be partially mitigated by the ‘excess of expected losses
over impairment’ included in the CET1 calculation. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has provided
national discretion to country regulators to consider transitional rules which may mitigate or spread capital impacts 
from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 is considered in the Group capital planning. 

IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
Implementation efforts performed to date indicate that the adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a significant
impact on the financial results of the group.

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC separation
On 1 March 2016, Barclays PLC announced its intention to sell down its 62,3% interest in the Group. A comprehensive
separation programme was initiated to focus on the future state of Barclays PLC, the Group and possible interaction
between the companies to ensure that the Group can operate as an independent and sustainable group without the involvement 
of Barclays PLC.

Barclays PLC disposed of 12,2% and 33,7% of the Group's shares on 5 May 2016 and 1 June 2017, respectively. Barclays PLC 
has forward-sold 7% of the afore-mentioned 33,7% shares to the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with transfer pending 
receipt by PIC of regulatory approvals in Kenya, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Barclays PLC has agreed to contribute a 
further 1,5% of the Group's shares to a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) scheme which will be implemented 
in due course, leaving Barclays PLC with a residual holding of 14,9%. 

As part of its divestment Barclays PLC contributed £765 million to the Group in June 2017, primarily in recognition of
the investments required for the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested primarily in
rebranding, technology and separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash
flow impact of separation investments on the Group over time. 

The separation process will have an impact on the Group’s financial results for the next few years, most notably by
increasing the capital base in the near-term and generating endowment revenue thereon, with increased costs over time as
the separation investments are concluded. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) requires that the Barclays
PLC contribution be recognised directly in equity, while the subsequent investment expenditure (including the
depreciation or amortisation of capitalised assets), will be recognised in profit or loss. The afore-mentioned will result 
in a disconnect between underlying business performance and the IFRS financial results during the separation period. 
Normalised financial results will therefore also be disclosed while the underlying business performance is materially 
different from the IFRS financial results. The extent of normalisation will be limited to the Barclays PLC contributions. 
Adjustments are included under  Barclays separation financial results” on page 12. The normalised results have been 
presented for illustrative purposes only, and the information presented is the responsibility of the Group’s directors.

The directors are not aware of any events after the reporting date of 30 June 2017 and the date of authorisation of
these consolidated financial statements (as defined per IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period (""IAS 10"")).

Notes
(1) The excess of the purchase price over the Group's share of net assets of Barclays Africa Limited, acquired on 
    31 July 2013, was accounted for as a deduction against share premium. The sale and purchase agreement between the 
    Group and Barclays Bank PLC allowed for the purchase price to be adjusted for certain items and in June 2016 an 
    agreement was reached on the final purchase price adjustment. As a result Barclays Bank PLC paid R66m to the Group, 
    which was recognised in equity , in line with the accounting of the original transaction.
(2) The Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life (Pty) Ltd which resulted in a R25m increase in
    non-controlling interest.

     Note   
     (1) The impairment incurred during the current reporting period mainly relates to computer software, Barclays.Net.
         Following the separation from Barclays PLC the software will no longer be used. The prior period impairments 
         relate to an acquired customer list which was fully impaired following an adjustment to the interest rate 
         outlook for the related business and impairment of costs previously spent on the Virtual Bank initiative. 
         In calculating the impairment to be recognised, the value in use was based on a discounted cash flow methodology.

7.   Acquisitions and disposals of businesses and other similar transactions

7.1.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period
      There were no acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period.

7.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period
      Apart from non-current assets/liabilities held for sale disposed of (refer note to 1) no other disposals of 
      businesses occurred during the current reporting period.

7.2.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period
      In order to continue building and shaping the Group's predictive underwriting products, expertise and 
      technology, the Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life Proprietary Limited, previously 
      known as Instant Life Proprietary Limited. The acquisition of the investment had an effective acquisition 
      date of 31 March 2016 and is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. The acquisition date fair 
      value of the consideration transferred amounted to R100m.

      The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable 
      net assets. Goodwill of R20m has been recognised and includes, but is not limited to, the insurer's workforce 
      and the increased market share gained.

      From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed revenue of R9m to the total income earned by 
      the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, an additional R5m would have 
      been generated by the Group, thereby resulting in a total income of R14m. From the date of acquisition, Absa 
      Instant Life contributed losses after tax of R12m to total profits earned by the Group. If the combination 
      had taken place at the beginning of the year, losses after tax of an additional R3m would have been incurred 
      by the Group, thereby resulting in a total loss after tax of R15m.

      Financial guarantee contracts represent contracts where the Group undertakes to make specified payments to a
      counterparty, should the counterparty suffer a loss as a result of a specified debtor failing to make payment 
      when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. This amount represents the maximum off-statement 
      of financial position exposure.

      The Group has capital commitments in respect of 
      computer equipment and property development. 
      Management is confident that future net revenues 
      and funding will be sufficient 
      to cover these commitments.

      The operating lease commitments comprise a number of separate operating leases in relation to property 
      and equipment, none of which is individually significant to the Group. Leases are negotiated for an 
      average term of three to five years and rentals are renegotiated annually.

Guarantees include performance guarantee contracts and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate the
facilities by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may expire without 
being drawn upon, the total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Legal proceedings
The Group has been party to proceedings against it during the reporting period, and as at the reporting date the
following material cases are disclosed:
- Pinnacle Point Holdings Proprietary Limited (PPG): New Port Finance Company and the trustees of the Winifred Trust
  (the plaintiffs) allege a local bank conducted itself unlawfully, and that Absa Bank Limited (the Bank) was privy 
  to such conduct. They have instituted proceedings against the Bank for damages for an amount of R1 387m. Although 
  Pinnacle Point Holding's claim has been withdrawn, the second to fifth plaintiff's claims remain and will proceed 
  to trial. 
- Ayanda Collective Investment Scheme (the Scheme): Absa Capital Investor Services was the trustee of Ayanda
  Collective Investment Scheme, in which Corporate Money Managers (CMM) managed a portfolio of assets within the 
  Scheme. The joint curators of the CMM group of companies and the Altron Pension Fund (an investor in the fund) 
  allege that the defendants caused damages to them arising from their alleged failure to meet their obligations 
  in the trust deed together with their statutory obligations set out in the Collective Investment Scheme Act, 
  in respect of which they seek payment of R1 157m. 
- On June 19, 2017, the Public Protector released the final report of her office's investigation into the Bankorp
  assistance package provided by the SA Reserve Bank between 1985 and 1995, recommending certain remedial action. 
  Absa acquired Bankorp in April 1992, for fair value, and had the responsibility of carrying out its existing legal 
  obligations to the SARB, which were met in full by October 1995. As such, it is Absa's firm position that it has 
  no continuing obligations in respect of the transaction and accordingly launched an application to review, and 
  where appropriate set aside, the remedial action recommended in the Public Protector's report. In this respect 
  Absa will join issue with the SARB and Minister of Finance in applications seeking similar relief, in which 
  it has also been cited.

The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in South Africa and a number of
other jurisdictions. It is involved in legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to
time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, 
fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other 
statutory and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal
and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer
protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking
and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a
material adverse effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the
matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters
will not be material to the Group's results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst
other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of income otherwise reported for the
reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they cannot
reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter. Provision is made for
all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis is resulting in a significant
tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally, especially for companies that are deemed to be of
systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking
and consumer credit industries globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. The nature and impact of
future changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action cannot currently be fully predicted and are
beyond the Group's control, but especially in the area of banking and insurance regulation, are likely to have an impact on
the Group's businesses, systems and earnings. 

The Group is continuously evaluating its programmes and controls in general relating to compliance with regulation.
The Group undertakes monitoring, review and assurance activities, and the Group has also adopted appropriate remedial
and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and has made disclosures on material findings as and when
appropriate. 

Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group Limited, identified potentially fraudulent activity by
certain of its customers using advance payments for imports in 2014 and 2015 to effect foreign exchange transfers from South
Africa to beneficiary accounts located in East Asia, UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the Group conducted a review of
relevant activity, processes, systems and controls. The Group is continuing to provide information to relevant
authorities as part of the Group's ongoing cooperation. It is not currently practicable to provide an estimate of the financial
impact of the actions described on the Group or what effect that they might have upon the Group's operating results, cash
flows or financial position in any particular period, if any.

In February 2017 the South African Competition Commission (SACC) referred Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and Absa Bank
Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group Limited, among other banks, to the Competition Tribunal to be prosecuted for
breaches of South African antitrust law related to Foreign Exchange trading of South African Rand. The SACC found from its
investigation that between 2007 and 2013 the banks had engaged in various forms of collusive behaviour. Barclays was the
first to bring the conduct to the attention of the SACC under its leniency programme and has cooperated with, and will
continue to cooperate with, the SACC in relation to this matter. The SACC is therefore not seeking an order from the
Tribunal to impose any fine on Barclays Bank PLC, BCI or Absa Bank Limited. 

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group's tax charge and
worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There may be transactions
and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities may
have indicated disagreement with the Group's treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account expert external advice where
appropriate. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period in which
such determination is made. The risks are managed in accordance with the Group's Tax Risk Framework.

14. Assets and liabilities held at fair value
14.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
     Financial assets and financial liabilities
     The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The 
     framework includes a Traded Risk and Valuations Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), 
     which is independent from the front office.

     The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally
     approve valuation policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are reported to the
     Barclays Africa Group Audit and Compliance Committee.

     The Traded Risk and Valuations Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will
     therefore consider the appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.
     
     The IVC team independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair value
     measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk areas when
     performing independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They also assess and document the
     inputs obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which supports conclusions that valuations are
     performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.

     Investment properties
     The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to the
     specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
     properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating the fair value of the
     properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.
     
     Where possible the fair value of the Group's investment properties is determined through valuations performed by
     external independent valuators.
     
     When the Group's internal valuations are different to that of the external independent valuers, detailed procedures
     are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC team verifies the procedures performed by the front office
     and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent valuations.

14.2 Fair value measurements
     Valuation inputs
     IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects
     the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
     
     Quoted market prices - Level 1
     Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. Such
     fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
     markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market
     transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency
     to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

     Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
     Fair values are classified as Level 2 if they have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in an
     active market.

     A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if
     there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

     Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
     Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based on
     observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 10% to
     the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar
     nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

     Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
     The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

     Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
     These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
     pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for similar
     instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using inputs derived from
     observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

     Equity instruments
     Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
     pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for
     similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant,
     assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

     Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
     organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, dependent 
     on the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons with similar
     companies and price: earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied consistently over time.

     Derivatives
     Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). OTC derivative contracts include
     forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, equity prices and
     commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices, dealer
     price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

     Loans and advances
     The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual cash
     flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus the originally
     priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used to reflect valuation date
     pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, are used to determine expected cash
     flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair value.

     Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
     Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying rates
     currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded derivatives, the
     embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives as detailed above.

     The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value. For
     other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying value because the
     instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

14.3 Fair value adjustments
     The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below:
     Bid-offer valuation adjustments
     For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices
     respectively. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact that they are managed
     on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will
     generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with
     hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data. For those assets and liabilities
     where the firm is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for
     certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), the mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a
     transaction cost. 

     Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
     A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair
     value of counterparty credit risk, the Group's own credit quality, as well as the cost of funding across all asset classes.

     Model valuation adjustments
     Valuation models are reviewed under the Group's model governance framework. This process identifies the assumptions
     used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). Where necessary, fair
     value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation adjustments are dependent on the size
     of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all
     known risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis. 
     
14.4 Fair value hierarchy                                                                          
     The following table shows the Group's assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair value 
     and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on the lowest level input

14.6.1 Significant transfers between levels 
       During the 2017 and 2016 reporting periods, transfers between levels occurred because of changes in the observability
       of valuation inputs, in some instances owing to changes in the level of market activity. Transfers have been reflected
       as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

14.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs                                              
     As part of the Group's risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant unobservable parameters to 
     generate a range of possible alternative valuations. The assets and liabilities that most impact this sensitivity 
     analysis are those with the more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The stresses are applied independently and do 
     not take account of any cross correlation between separate asset classes that would reduce the overall effect 
     on the valuations.                                              
                                                   
     The following table reflects how the unobservable parameters were changed in order to evaluate the sensitivities of 
     Level 3 financial assets and liabilities:

     A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to profit or loss, or a change in the 
     fair value asset or liability by more than 10% or the underlying value of the affected item. This is demonstrated 
     by the following sensitivity analysis which includes reasonable range of possible outcomes:

     For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the discounted 
     cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered unobservable inputs for 
     items which mature after 5 years. However, if the items mature in less than 5 years, these inputs are considered observable.     

     For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying price of the 
     market traded instrument.       

     The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to the unobservable 
     inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.

15.   Reporting changes overview
15.1  Accounting policy changes
      The Group made the following accounting policy changes as a result of new and amended standards of IFRS, 
      which had no impact on the previously reported earnings of the Group:
      - The requirements of IFRS 9 relating to the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at
        fair value were adopted during the current reporting period. As a result, the effects of changes in those liabilities'
        credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income with the remaining effect presented in profit or loss. 
        In accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRS 9, comparatives have not been restated.
      - All other amendments to IFRS, and new interpretations, effective for the current reporting period had no significant
        impact on the Group's reported results.

15.2  Changes in reportable segments
      The following business portfolio changes have impacted the financial results for the comparative period. None of the
      restatements have impacted the overall financial position or net earnings of the Group:
      - Barclays PLC disposed of 12.2% and 33.7% of the Group's shares on 5 May 2016 and 1 June 2017, respectively. As part of
        its divestment Barclays PLC contributed £765m to the Group in June 2017, primarily in recognition of the
        investments required for the Group to separate from Barclays PLC. This contribution will be invested primarily in rebranding,
        technology and separation-related projects and it is expected that it will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of
        separation investments on the Group over time. The separation process will increase the capital base of the Group in
        the near-term and generate endowment revenue thereon, with increased costs over time as the separation investments are
        concluded. The Group has therefore included an additional reportable segment, 'Barclays separation' in its segment
        results.
      - In the second half of 2016, the Group revised its operating model with 'geography' and 'customer' as primary
        dimensions, creating a platform for increased focus and dedicated management capacity: South Africa Banking, Rest of Africa
        Banking and WIMI (historically reporting was by customer only i.e. RBB, CIB and WIMI). The reporting changes to financial
        disclosures were implemented from 1 January 2017.
      - The Group refined its cost allocation methodology, resulting in the restatement of operating expenses between and
        within segments.
      - Commercial Property Finance (CPF) customers with loan balances exceeding R40m were moved from Retail and Business
        Banking (RBB) to Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) to reflect the Group's customer segmentation and coverage model.

BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP: INAUGURAL ISSUER CREDIT RATING ASSIGNED BY MOODY’S
INVESTORS SERVICES (“MOODY’S”)

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Moody’s has,
on 17 July 2017, assigned a first time long and short-term issuer rating of Ba1/Not-prime, and a
Aa3.za/P-1.za national scale issuer rating to Barclays Africa Group. The outlook on the long-term issuer
rating is negative.

Moody’s states that the rating captures BAGL’s good capital buffers with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
ratio of 11.8% as of March 2017 and an equity-to-assets ratio of 9.3% as of December 2016; its solid
profitability metrics with reported return on equity of 16.6%; rising liquidity buffers; and the Group’s
extensive sub-Saharan Africa operations that provide diversification benefits and growth potential.

BAGL’s Ba1 issuer rating is positioned one notch below the adjusted baseline credit assessment (BCA)

RESPONSE TO PUBLIC PROTECTOR’S FINAL REPORT


The Public Protector released a final report on Monday (“the report”) regarding her investigation into the
assistance provided by the South African Reserve Bank to Bankorp between 1985 and 1995. Bankorp was
acquired by Absa in 1992.

Barclays Africa and Absa Bank shareholders are advised that Absa has decided to approach the High Court
in order to have the report reviewed and set aside. This is due to numerous misrepresentations and factual
inaccuracies which form the basis of the Public Protector's findings, and what we submit are the irrational and
unreasonable legal conclusions in the report. The misconceptions and inaccuracies in the report are profound
and damaging to Absa’s reputation.

We have accordingly instructed our lawyers to immediately prepare an application to the High Court to have
the report and its remedial actions set aside.

We deny that Absa received R1,125bn by way of unlawful assistance and we firmly maintain our position that
all of Absa’s obligations to the South African Reserve Bank were met in full by October 1995.

We will update shareholders on this matter as appropriate.

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES

In accordance with paragraph 3.63 of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are
informed of dealings by Barclays Africa executive directors and the company secretary, as set
out below.

1.      Restricted period

Following the announcements made by Barclays Africa to the market pertaining to the
separation from Barclays PLC and the related sell-down Barclays PLC's shareholding in
Barclays Africa, certain employees were restricted from accepting the 3 March 2017 share
award grants (as detailed below). Following the finalisation of the sell-down process and the
announcements to the market on 31 May and 1 June 2017 respectively, these employees are
now permitted to accept the 3 March 2017 grants.

Shareholders should accordingly note that the awards disclosed below are not new awards,
and were disclosed as part of the executive directors’ variable remuneration awards in
Barclays Africa’s 2016 remuneration report, but could not previously be accepted, given the
restricted period mentioned above.

2.      Grant of Deferred Award

Consistent with our policy on incentive awards to senior employees, each annual incentive
award is deferred as to 60% thereof. Of this deferral amount, 50% is into the Share Value Plan
(SVP) and 50% into the Cash Value Plan (CVP). The individual has a choice to convert all or
part of the CVP into SVP.

The number of shares under the 2017 SVP was fixed with reference to the 20-day volume
weighted average price up to 3 March 2017, being the grant date but as a result of the
restrictions could only be accepted in June 2017. This table sets out the deferred incentives
which were awarded into the SVP and granted to the executive directors and company
secretary off market. These awards have since been accepted on the dates indicated below.

50% of an executive director’s non-deferred annual incentive is delivered as shares (the SIA)
around the time the non-deferred cash incentive award is paid. The SIA is subject to a
six-month holding period and will be released in September of the same year.

The number of shares under the 2017 SIA was fixed with reference to the 20-day volume
weighted average price up to 3 March 2016, being the grant date but as a result of the
restriction could only be accepted in June 2017. These awards have since been accepted on
the dates indicated below.

The share awards in respect of the SIA were granted to the executive directors off market as
set out in the table below. These shares will be released to the individuals six months after the
award.

PLACING BY BARCLAYS PLC OF APPROXIMATELY 286 MILLION (33.7%) ORDINARY SHARES IN
BARCLAYS AFRICA AND SECTION 122 NOTICE

Barclays Africa shareholders are referred to the announcement released by Barclays PLC in relation to the
results of the placing of approximately 286 million ordinary shares in Barclays Africa. The Barclays PLC
RNS announcement is set out below:

“PLACING OF 286 MILLION ORDINARY SHARES IN BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP LIMITED (“BAGL”)

Further to the announcement released on 31 May 2017, due to strong investor demand, Barclays has
decided to increase the size of the placing (the ""Placing""). Accordingly, pursuant to the Placing, Barclays
has agreed to sell 285,691,979 ordinary shares (note 2) in the capital of BAGL (the ""Placing Shares"")
(representing 33.7% of BAGL’s issued share capital) at a price of ZAR 132.0 per share, raising aggregate
gross sale proceeds of approximately ZAR 37,711 million (£2,224 million - note 1). The Placing is expected
to result in a pro forma increase of approximately 27 basis points to the Group’s 31 March 2017 CET1 ratio,
from 12.5%.

Following completion of the Placing, the Barclays group (the ""Group"") will hold 139 million ordinary shares
in BAGL (16.4% of BAGL’s issued share capital), of which 12.7 million ordinary shares will be contributed to
a black economic empowerment scheme in due course, leaving a residual holding of approximately 15%.
The Placing results in accounting deconsolidation of BAGL from the Group. It is estimated that, when full
regulatory deconsolidation of BAGL from the Group is achieved, this will result in 73bps accretion to the
Group’s CET1 ratio, including the increase resulting from the Placing.

Separation contributions equal to £0.8 billion, including the contribution to a black economic empowerment
scheme, will be made following execution of the separation agreements and completion of the Placing. As a
result of the Placing and related separation arrangements, the Group’s tangible net asset value would have
increased by £0.2 billion pro-forma as at 31 March 2017.

Completion of the Placing and the associated accounting deconsolidation would result in an estimated loss
of £1.2 billion, calculated pro forma on the 31 March 2017 financial statements (largely due to a loss of
                                                                                               Page 1 of 3
approximately £1.2 billion as a result of the recycling of currency translation reserve to the income
statement, owing to the weakening of the Rand since initial consolidation of BAGL in 2005; the recycling of
currency translation reserve will have no effect on the Group’s net asset value or CET1 ratio). The actual
loss will be recognised in the income statement in Barclays Q2 2017 financial statements, presented within
discontinued operations.

All of the remaining ordinary shares in BAGL held by Barclays PLC or its subsidiaries (excluding the 1.5%
which Barclays has agreed to contribute towards the establishment of a black economic empowerment
scheme and any shares held by BAGL and its subsidiaries) not sold in the Placing are now subject to a
lock-up restriction, which applies until 90 days after settlement. During this period, the lock-up restriction
may be waived with the consent of the Co-Global Co-ordinators (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

The proceeds of the Placing are payable in cash on usual South African settlement terms, and settlement of
the Placing is expected to occur on a T+3 basis on 6 June 2017, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
certain customary conditions. As previously announced, the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited
(""PIC"") has agreed to be an anchor investor in the Placing, however it requires certain regulatory approvals
before it can take up its allocation of the Placing Shares. Delivery in respect of the Placing Shares to be
taken up by PIC is expected to occur at a later date following receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

The net proceeds of the Placing will be used for general corporate purposes of the Group.

PROPOSED PLACING BY BARCLAYS PLC OF APPROXIMATELY 187 MILLION (22%) ORDINARY
SHARES IN BARCLAYS AFRICA AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Barclays Africa shareholders are referred to the announcement released by Barclays PLC in relation to the
launch of a proposed placing of approximately 187 million ordinary shares in Barclays Africa. The Barclays
PLC RNS announcement is set out below:

“PROPOSED PLACING OF APPROXIMATELY 187 MILLION ORDINARY SHARES IN BARCLAYS
AFRICA GROUP LIMITED (""BAGL"")

Further to the announcement today, confirming that Barclays has received the necessary regulatory
approvals to further sell down its position in BAGL and enter into agreements with BAGL governing the
terms on which separation will occur, Barclays today announces its intention to sell approximately 187
million ordinary shares (the ""Placing Shares"") in BAGL (the ""Placing""), representing approximately 22% of
BAGL's issued share capital. This follows the initial placing that Barclays undertook on 5 May 2016 of 103.5
million shares representing 12.2% of the issued share capital of BAGL.

As previously announced, Barclays’ intention is to divest its shareholding in BAGL to a level which will
permit Barclays to de-consolidate BAGL from a regulatory perspective and, prior to that, from an accounting
perspective. This Placing further progresses Barclays’ intentions in both these respects. Barclays’ target
long-term shareholding in BAGL is around 15%.

The Placing Shares are being offered to institutional investors by way of an accelerated bookbuild placing,
which is open with immediate effect. The Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (""PIC"") has confirmed
its participation as an anchor investor in the Placing for approximately 59 million shares, representing 7% of
BAGL's issued share capital. The terms of the PIC commitment reflect PIC’s requirement for regulatory
approvals in certain African jurisdictions. Delivery of the Placing Shares to be taken up by PIC is expected
to occur at a later date following receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its investment bank (""Barclays Investment Bank"") is acting as lead
global coordinator (the “Lead Global Co-ordinator”). Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG,
                                                                                                 Page 1 of 2
London branch, and UBS Limited are acting as co-global coordinators (the “Co-Global Co-ordinators”) and
J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan Cazenove)
and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc are acting as joint bookrunners (together with the Lead Global
Co-ordinator and the Co-Global Co-ordinators, the “Joint Bookrunners”). BNP Paribas and Société
Générale Corporate & Investment Banking are acting as co-bookrunners (the “Co-Bookrunners” and,
together with the Joint Bookrunners, the “Banks”).

All of the remaining ordinary shares in BAGL held by Barclays PLC or its subsidiaries (excluding the 1.5%
which Barclays has agreed to contribute towards the establishment of a black economic empowerment
scheme and any shares held by BAGL and its subsidiaries) not sold in the Placing will be subject to a lock-
up restriction from today until 90 days after settlement. During this period, the lock-up restriction may be
waived with the consent of the Co-Global Co-ordinators (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

The final number of Placing Shares to be placed and the price per Placing Share will be agreed by Barclays
and the Banks at the close of the bookbuild process, and the results of the Placing will be announced as
soon as practicable thereafter.”

Withdrawal of cautionary announcement

Barclays Africa shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcement released on SENS earlier today
and are advised that as the information disclosed above deals with all material outstanding matters, caution
is no longer required to be exercised when dealing in Barclays Africa securities.

TERMS OF SEPARATION WITH BARCLAYS SIGNED

Background

Barclays PLC (“Barclays”, including, where required by the context, its relevant subsidiaries)
announced on 1 March 2016 that it intended, over a two- to three-year period, to reduce its
shareholding in Barclays Africa Group Limited (“BAGL”, including, where required by the
context, its relevant subsidiaries) to a level which will permit Barclays to de-consolidate
BAGL from a regulatory perspective and, prior to that, from an accounting perspective.

On 23 February 2017, BAGL announced that the terms of the transitional services
arrangements and the separation payments (the “Separation Arrangements”) had been
agreed with Barclays. These were submitted to relevant regulators as part of a request for
approval by Barclays to sell down its holding in BAGL to below 50%.

Regulatory approval

As announced earlier today, Barclays and BAGL have now received the required regulatory
approvals from the Minister of Finance in South Africa for Barclays to reduce its holding in
BAGL to below 50%.

Key separation agreement terms

Furthermore, Barclays and BAGL have today entered into the agreements governing the
terms on which the separation will occur. The key terms of these agreements are as follows:

Separation contribution and timing

As announced on 23 February 2017, the separation terms include contributions from
Barclays to BAGL, which BAGL will use to separate from Barclays, totalling £765 million and
comprising:
-   £55 million to cover separation-related expenses, of which £27.5 million was paid in
    December 2016, with the remaining £27.5 million (ZAR465 million) (note 1) to be paid on
    the date on which Barclays’ holding in BAGL falls to 50% or below (“Initial Sell Down
    Date”);
-   £515 million (ZAR8,293 million) (note 2) to provide additional capital to BAGL to allow it
    to make investments required to separate, including in respect of technology, rebranding
    and other separation projects. The contribution is to be made 30% on signing of the
    agreements and 70% on Initial Sell Down Date; and
-   £195 million (ZAR3,295 million) (note 1) for terminating the existing Master Services
    Agreement between Barclays and BAGL, which governs the provision of services by
    Barclays to the BAGL subsidiaries acquired from Barclays in 2013 (the “MSA”), which
    will be contributed on the Initial Sell Down Date.

The expectation is that the financial contributions will neutralise the capital and cash flow
impact of separation investments on BAGL over time. However, the separation process will
have an impact on BAGL’s financial statements for the next few years, most notably by
increasing the capital base in the near term and generating endowment revenue thereon,
with increased costs likely over time as the separation investments are concluded.
Consequently, BAGL will start to report normalised results that better reflect the underlying
performance of the business once the contributions have been received.

Black economic empowerment contribution

In addition, Barclays will contribute the equivalent of 1.5% of BAGL’s market capitalisation,
equating to approximately ZAR1,856 million (note 3), towards the establishment of a broad-
based black economic empowerment (“BBBEE”) scheme. Further details on the proposed
BBBEE scheme will be communicated in due course.

Intra-group agreements

Subject to certain limited exceptions, the current intra-group arrangements between Barclays
and BAGL, including the MSA and the intra-group framework agreement (the “IGFA”), will
terminate on the Initial Sell Down Date. The Separation Arrangements include a transitional
services agreement (the “TSA”) to replace the existing MSA and IGFA. The TSA will be
effective from the Initial Sell Down Date. The term of the TSA will be determined by the
timeframes specified for the individual services provided, which range from three months to
three years, subject to extension(s).

Governance framework and protective covenants

A governance framework will apply during the separation. Certain protective covenants
(including non-compete arrangements and non-solicit obligations) will apply to Barclays, in
respect of the countries BAGL operates in, from today until three years from the Initial Sell
Down Date. These protective covenants are subject to certain agreed carve-outs and it is
expected that Barclays and BAGL will continue to cooperate for the benefit of mutual clients,
where appropriate.
Brand and trademarks

The Separation Arrangements also include a Transitional Trade Mark Licence agreement
(“TTML”), which will be effective from the Initial Sell Down Date, to replace the existing
trademark licence agreements between Barclays and BAGL. In terms of the TTML, BAGL
will continue to use the Barclays brand for up to 12 months in South Africa and for up to
three years in other BAGL presence countries, subject to limited exceptions. Further details
on rebranding will be communicated in due course.

Indemnities

Under the Separation Arrangements, Barclays has agreed to indemnify BAGL against
certain potential losses suffered by BAGL, including as a result of (i) the business of
Barclays, untrue statements or omissions contained in any document issued by Barclays in
connection with any placing or marketing of BAGL shares under the proposed sell-down of
BAGL shares, and any failure by any Barclays company to discharge any liability in respect
of taxation for which Barclays is primarily liable (the “Perimeter Indemnity”); or (ii) BAGL
having adhered to any Barclays policy which is not compliant with the laws for which that
policy was designed (the “Policy Indemnity”). Barclays’ liability under the Perimeter
Indemnity is uncapped and under the Policy Indemnity is capped at £614.7 million
(ZAR10,385 million) (note 4).

 BAGL’s overall RWA’s increased by R1.2bn from December 2016 to March 2017 mainly due to an increase in credit
 risk as a result of exchange rate movements for entities outside South Africa as well as loan growth in Corporate
 and Investment Banking (CIB). This was offset by a decrease in CCR primarily as a result of settlements and market
 movements specific to foreign currency and interest rate swaps and market risk driven by a decrease in Daily Value
 at Risk (DVaR) and Stressed Value at Risk (sVaR) due to the decreased market volatility over the period of
 observation in the internal models DVaR and sVaR measure for the South African business.

Absa Bank Limited’s overall RWA’s decreased by R2.8bn from December 2016 to March 2017 mainly due to an
increase in credit risk as a result of loan growth in CIB. This was offset by a decrease in CCR primarily as a result of
settlements and market movements specific to foreign currency and interest rate swaps as well as market risk
driven by a decrease in DVaR and sVaR due to the decreased market volatility over the period of observation in the
internal models DVaR and sVaR measure for the South African business.

Capital consumption of BAGL and Absa Bank’s portfolios subject to the Internal Models Approach decreased by
R2.4bn from December 2016 to March 2017. Drivers of quarter on quarter changes in RWA consumption are
summarised as follows:
      o     Value at Risk (VaR) and Stressed Value at Risk (sVaR): Market Risk capital requirements noted a
            decrease over the quarter, largely driven by a decrease in the VaR and sVaR capital adequacy as a result of
            larger values of the measure (caused by the increased market volatility noted over the last quarter of
            2016) falling off the three-month averaging period.

3)    Leverage ratio

The leverage ratio framework is complementary to the risk-based capital framework and is a non-risk based
contingency measure to restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking sector.

4)   Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile
of banks by ensuring that they have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress
scenario lasting 30 calendar days. The LCR became effective on 1 January 2015, with a requirement of 60%, which
will increase by 10% per year to 100% on 1 January 2019. The requirement for 2017 is 80%.

The LCR is calculated as the value of HQLA divided by total net cash outflows. HQLA represents the value of assets
that can be easily and immediately converted into cash. Net cash outflows are calculated according to regulations.

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under
Guidance Note 6 of 2016, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Notes:
1. The 31 March 2017 figures are unaudited whilst the 31 December 2016 comparatives are reported on an
    audited basis.
2. Reserves as at 31 March 2017 have already been reduced by the value of the 2016 year-end final ordinary
    dividend of R4.8bn for BAGL and R2.1bn for Absa Bank Limited, which were declared on 23 February 2017 and
    paid on 10 April 2017. This was the main contributor to the reduction in the CET1 ratio from 12.1% to 11.8%
    over the quarter.
3. Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and
    offshore holdings.
4. The 2017 minimum regulatory capital requirements are calculated at the BIS minimum regulatory capital
    requirement of 8%.
5. SA-CCR is calculated using the Current Exposure Method.
6. The Capital conservation buffer is phased in between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2019 reaching 2.5% by 1
    January 2019.
7. The 2017 minimum regulatory capital requirements of 10.75% (2016: 10.375%) include the RSA minimum of
    8%, Pillar 2a of 1.50% (2016: 1.75 %) and capital conservation buffer of 1.25% (2016: 0.625%) but exclude the
    bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the domestic systemically important banks
    (D-SIB) add-on.
8. The LCR of Barclays Africa Group Limited represents an aggregation of the relevant individual net cash outflows
    and HQLA portfolios of only the banking entities. HQLA holdings in excess of the minimum LCR requirement
    have been excluded from the aggregated HQLA number for all non-South African banking entities.
9. The values disclosed represent the simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points.
10. Absa Bank Solo includes the South African banking operation.

REFERENCE TO BARCLAYS PLC FIRST QUARTER 2017 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are advised that Barclays PLC (“PLC”) released its first quarter 2017 results
today.

Their announcement included abridged pound sterling results for an Africa Banking segment,
disclosed as discontinued operations, which reflects Barclays PLC’s stake in Barclays Africa
Group. The reporting of Africa Banking within the PLC accounts is impacted by various cost
and other overlays, consolidation and other adjustments, including increased minority interests
following PLC's reduced shareholding in the second quarter of 2016. Of particular note, in Africa
Banking’s operating expenses in the first quarter of this year, PLC included an £884m
impairment of its holding in the Group, allocated to goodwill, largely due to the decline in
Barclays Africa Group’s share price from 31 December 2016 to 31 March 2017.

Many of our second half 2016 trends were again evident in the first quarter. Revenue growth
slowed, reflecting ongoing economic weakness. The rand was stronger for the first quarter,
resulting in a 4% drag on our year-on-year revenue growth. As guided, our net interest margin
declined year on year, due to the impact of reduced National Credit Act lending caps in South
Africa, regulatory changes in Kenya and a higher proportion of Corporate and Investment Bank
(CIB) lending. Overall balance sheet growth remains moderate, with CIB still growing faster
than Retail and Business Banking (RBB) lending. Within non-interest revenue in South Africa,
retail net fee and commission income growth remained low, while CIB’s growth was strong.
Costs remain well managed, although pre-provision profit declined slightly. Credit impairments
decreased noticeably year on year, particularly in rest of Africa banking and CIB in South Africa.
Consequently, our return on equity improved somewhat year on year. CIB in South Africa and
rest of Africa banking continued to drive group earnings growth, while RBB in South Africa and
Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance declined.

Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We continue to expect low to mid-single digit loan growth,
with CIB growing faster than RBB and South Africa lagging the rest of Africa’s growth in
constant currency. Our net interest margin is expected to decline slightly. Slower revenue
growth is likely to produce negative Jaws in the near term, despite continued cost containment.
We expect regulatory pressures and the strong rand to dampen growth in the first half. Our
credit loss ratio should improve, in part due to the large single name provision in the base. Our
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is likely to remain above board targets and our return on equity
should be broadly similar to 2016’s.
The financial information on which this trading update is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Group’s auditors.

BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP LIMITED AND ABSA BANK LIMITED: CREDIT RATING ACTION BY
STANDARD & POOR’S RATINGS SERVICES

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that Standard and
Poor’s (S&P) has on 5 April 2017 downgraded the ratings of seven South African financial institutions
following similar action on the South African Sovereign, which was downgraded on 3 April 2017.

S&P do not rate financial institutions above the foreign currency rating of the sovereign, and accordingly
lowered the national scale ratings on Absa Bank and Barclays Africa Group as part of this ratings action.
BAGL’s national scale rating was lowered to 'zaBB+/zaB' from 'zaA/zaA-2’, while Absa Bank’s national
scale rating was lowered to 'zaA' from 'zaAA-'.

S&P pointed out that South African banks remain resilient despite South Africa’s economic obstacles.
“The sector's average return on assets improved to 1.3% in 2016 from 1.1% the previous year, while total
capital adequacy increased to 15.7% from 14.2%”.

Furthermore, S&P stated that “Outside a sovereign action, we see positive or negative rating actions on
these four banks as a remote possibility in the next 12 months, unless there is significant deterioration of
the economy, due for example to weaker investor confidence.”

BAGL has a balance sheet in excess of R1 trillion which is diversified by business and geography. BAGL
remains well capitalised in light of its strategy, risk appetite, risk profile, business activities and the
macroeconomic environment in which it operates. BAGL’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital position
as at 31 December 2016 remained strong at 12.1% - above the board target range of 9.5% to 11.5% and
well above the regulatory minimum of 6.9%.

A sovereign ratings downgrade has been anticipated for some time, and steps have been taken by BAGL
in order to ensure that it is prepared for such an event.

BAGL has increased its capital base from R88bn at the end of 2013 to R105bn by the end of 2016.
Equally, BAGL increased its liquidity sources from R154bn at the end of 2013 to R239bn at the end of
2016.

Stress testing is also regularly conducted to ensure that our capital and liquidity positions remain robust
subsequent to a stress event such as a sovereign ratings downgrade.

Financial Institutions Lowered Following Similar Action On Sovereign”.

UPDATE ON BARCLAYS PLC SELL-DOWN AND SEPARATION

Since 1 March 2016, when Barclays PLC announced its intention to reduce its shareholding in
BAGL to achieve accounting and regulatory deconsolidation, we have worked jointly to ensure
the best outcome for all of our stakeholders.

Shareholders are advised that Barclays PLC has submitted an application to the South African
Reserve Bank for approval to reduce its shareholding in the Group to below 50%. The
application, which also requires the approval of the Minister of Finance, based on the advice
from the Registrar of Banks, includes the terms of the separation payments and transitional
services arrangements, which have been agreed between Barclays PLC and BAGL.

The agreed terms provide for contributions by Barclays PLC to BAGL totaling £765 million
(ZAR12.8 billion) (see note 1), primarily in recognition of the investments required for the Group
to separate from Barclays PLC. These contributions, comprise:
    - £515 million (ZAR8.6 billion) (see note 1) in recognition of the investments required in
       technology, rebranding and other separation projects;
    - £55 million (ZAR0.9 billion) (see note 1) to cover separation related expenses, of which
       £27.5 million was received in December 2016; and
    - £195 million (ZAR3.3 billion) (see note 1) to terminate the existing service level
       agreement between Barclays and BAGL, relating to the Rest of Africa operations
       acquired in 2013.

As part of the agreed terms, from the date on which Barclays PLC reduces its shareholding in
BAGL to below 50%:
   - BAGL can continue to use the Barclays brand in the rest of Africa for three years; and
   - BAGL will receive certain services from Barclays on an arms’ length basis for a
       transitional period, typically up to three years.

The expectation is that the financial contributions will neutralize the capital and cash flow impact
of separation investments on the Group over time. However, the separation process will have
an impact on BAGL’s financial statements for the next few years, most notably by increasing the
capital base in the near-term and generating endowment revenue thereon, with increased costs
likely over time as the separation investments are concluded. Consequently, BAGL will start to
report normalized results that better reflect the underlying performance of the Group once the
contributions have been received.

In addition, Barclays PLC has agreed to contribute an amount equivalent to 1.5% of BAGL’s
market capitalization (ZAR2.1 billion) (see note 2) towards the establishment of a larger broad-
based black economic empowerment scheme. Further details on this will be communicated in
due course.

Overview of results
Barclays Africa Group Limited’s headline earnings increased by 5% to R14 980m from R14 287m. Diluted HEPS also grew by
5% to 1 769.4 cents from 1 686.2 cents. The Group’s RoE decreased to 16.6% from 17.0%, due to higher credit
impairments, and its return on assets (RoA) declined to 1.34% from 1.37%. Barclays Africa Group Limited declared a 3% 
higher ordinary DPS of 1 030 cents. Its Net asset value (NAV) per share increased by 4% to 10 980 cents.

Pre-provision profit increased by 10% to R32.4bn, which drove earnings growth. Non-interest income grew by 6% and net
interest income by 9%, as the Group’s net interest margin (on average interest-bearing assets) improved to 4.92% from
4.81%. Loans and advances to customers grew by 2% to R720bn, while deposits due to customers decreased by 2% to R675bn.
The Group’s cost-to-income ratio improved to 55.2% from 56.0% as operating expenses rose 6%. The weaker average rand 
added 1% to the Group’s revenue, costs, and headline earnings growth. Credit impairments grew by 26%, largely due to 
higher charges in Retail Banking and Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) in South Africa and Retail and Business 
Banking (RBB) Rest of Africa. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose to 3.94% from 3.47% of gross loans and advances, while 
portfolio provisions increased to 79 basis points (bps) of total gross performing loans from 65 bps.

RBB’s headline earnings decreased by 3% to R9 313m, with 7% cost growth exceeding 6% higher revenues and credit
impairments rising 21%. Retail Banking South Africa’s headline earnings declined by 4% and RBB Rest of Africa by 
3%, while Business Banking South Africa increased by 1%. Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance (WIMI)’s headline 
earnings decreased by 4% to R1 399m, despite 11% growth in South Africa continuing business lines, which was offset 
by Rest of Africa losses. CIB grew by 27% to R5 098m, driven by Corporate which  increased by 44% while the Investment 
Bank rose 13%.  

Revenue from the Rest of Africa grew by 16% and headline earnings rose 17% to R2 778m, to contribute 23% and 19% of
the Group’s revenue and headline earnings respectively.

Operating environment
The global economy finished 2016 on a stronger footing despite the heightened policy uncertainty in some developed
economies. Global GDP growth for 2016 is projected to be 3.2%. Fears of a significant slowdown in China’s economy
diminished following new stimulus. Into year end the US dollar strengthened, commodity prices firmed up somewhat 
and global equity markets generally rallied.

South Africa’s economic growth is expected to have slowed to 0.4% in 2016, in part due to the severe drought.
Households faced a weak employment environment, higher inflation and tight credit conditions, while businesses 
reduced investment spending given a more volatile policy environment and weak domestic demand. South Africa’s prime 
interest rate increased 0.75% to 10.5% during the year. Although on average through the year the rand was weaker 
than the Group’s Rest of Africa currencies, it appreciated noticeably during the year and closed stronger than at 
the end of 2015. Consequently, it slightly enhanced the Group’s income statement growth, but reduced its balance 
sheet growth.

Economic growth in the Group’s presence markets in the rest of Africa slowed to the weakest level since 2002 as
economies were impacted by tighter liquidity conditions, weak commodity prices impacted current account and fiscal 
receipts, and inflationary pressures impacted households.

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total assets decreased by 4% to R1 101bn at 31 December 2016, predominantly due to loans and advances to banks and
trading portfolio assets declining by 42% and 30% respectively. Excluding these, assets grew by 4%, with customer 
loans and advances increasing by 2%. Rand appreciation against the Group’s rest of Africa (ROA) currencies reduced 
assets by 2%. 

Loans and advances to customers
Loans and advances to customers grew by 2% to R720bn, or by 4% excluding rand appreciation. Retail Banking South
Africa’s loans were flat at R375bn, reflecting 4% growth in Vehicle and Asset Finance (VAF) and 7% higher Personal 
Loans, while Home Loans declined by 2% and Card by 4%. Business Banking South Africa’s loans rose 9% to R69bn 
including solid growth in Agri loans and commercial property finance. RBB Rest of Africa’s loans declined by 11% 
to R40bn, despite growing by 2% in constant currency (CCY). CIB’s loans rose 7% to R229bn, given 13% growth in 
South Africa and 1% CCY growth in the rest of Africa. 

Funding
Deposits due to customers declined by 2% to R675bn, which increased the loans to deposit and debt securities 
ratio to 88.4%. Deposits due to customers constituted 77.8% of total funding from 78.2%. Retail Banking South 
Africa grew deposits by 7% to R177bn, while Business Banking South Africa’s deposits declined by 1% to R109bn, 
largely due to a sector-wide reduction in local and provincial government deposits. RBB Rest of Africa’s deposits 
grew by 2% in CCY, but fell by 14% due to currency translation. CIB’s total deposits by declined 7%, with Rest 
of Africa down 20% (or 7% in CCY) due to the strong rand and lower inflows. CIB’s South Africa deposits decreased 
by 2%, after losing a large, low margin client. The Group’s liquidity position remains strong, with liquid assets 
and other sources of liquidity growing by 20% to R239bn. Absa Bank’s 3 month average liquidity coverage ratio for 
the fourth quarter of 2016 was 98%, well above the regulatory minimum hurdle of 70%. While net stable funding 
ratios only become effective on 1 January 2018, the Group is expected to comply with the 100% minimum. Lastly, 
long-term funding increased slightly to 21.4% of total funding.

Net asset value
The Group’s NAV rose 4% to R93bn and its NAV per share grew by 4% to 10 980 cents. During the year it generated
profits of R14.7bn, from which it paid R8.5bn in dividends. The foreign currency translation reserve reduced 
by R4.1bn to R2.4bn.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) increased marginally to R704bn at 31 December 2016, slightly ahead of its 4% 
lower asset growth, in part due to higher counterparty risk. The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably 
above minimum regulatory requirements. Its CET1 and Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios were 12.1% and 12.6% respectively 
(from 11.9% and 12.6%). The Group generated 2.1% of CET1 capital internally during the period. Its total capital 
adequacy ratio was 14.8%. Declaring a 3% higher DPS of 1 030 cents on a dividend cover of 1,7 times took cognisance 
of the challenging operating environment, the Group’s strong capital position, internal capital generation, strategy 
and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income
Net interest income

Net interest income increased by 9% to R42 003m from R38 407m, with average interest-bearing assets growing by 7%. 
The Group’s net interest margin improved to 4.92% from 4.81%.

Loan pricing and mix had a 3 bps impact, due to regulatory changes, higher interest suspended and lower margins in
VAF, plus the mix impact of strong CIB loan growth. These outweighed improved Home Loans and Personal Loans margins. 
The deposit margin increased by 2bps, due to improved Retail Banking and Corporate pricing offsetting higher wholesale
liquidity premiums and the negative mix impact of increased wholesale funding. Higher South African interest rates 
resulted in an endowment increase on deposits and equity of 10 bps. Despite releasing R268m to the income statement, 
the benefit from structural hedging declined by 11 bps. 

Rest of Africa’s net interest margin improved by 23 bps, which added 10 bps to our Group margin. However, the impact
of lower rates, rand strength and regulatory changes were evident in the second half. Lastly, the basis benefit of a 
75 bps increase in the South African prime rate in the first half and a substantial reduction in loans to banks added 
3 bps to our margin, outweighing the cost of higher borrowed funds and liquid asset holdings.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased by 6% to R30 391m from R28 791m accounting for 42% of total revenue. South Africa
increased by 5% to R24 969m, while Rest of Africa grew by 10% or (6% CCY) to R5 422m.Net fee and commission income 
rose 3% to R20 723m, with growth in credit cards and electronic banking of 20% and 3% respectively.

RBB’s non-interest income grew by 5% to R19 134m, 63% of the Group’s total. Retail Banking South Africa increased by
4% to R12 819m largely due to card growth offsetting flat customer numbers, sub-inflation fee increases and continued
migration to bundled products and electronic channels. Card non-interest income grew by 11%, with 13% growth in merchant
acquiring volumes. Business Banking’s non-interest income rose 5% to R3 543m, largely due to 6% growth in electronic
banking and cheque account income. RBB Rest of Africa’s non-interest income grew by 6% to R2 772m from growth in 
active customers, rand depreciation and a strong increase in card acquiring and bancassurance. 

WIMI’s non-interest income decreased by 2% to R4 848m, as the Rest of Africa declined by 41% due to revised reserving
requirements, lower investment returns and new business strain. However, net insurance premiums income grew by 10% on
continuing lines and  embedded value of new business grew 21%. 

CIB’s non-interest income increased by 13% to R6 679m, largely due to improved trading. Overall Markets revenue rose
by 25% to R5 149m as rest of Africa grew by 26% and South Africa 25%, with Fixed Income and Credit up 51% and Foreign
Exchange and Commodities increasing by 21%.

Impairment losses on loans and advances
Credit impairments increased by 26% to R8 751m from R6 920m, resulting in a 1.08% credit loss ratio from 0.92%. The
Group changed its credit loss ratio disclosure to use gross customer loans and loans to banks, rather than customer 
loans. On the previous basis, its credit loss ratio increased to 1.23% from 1.05%. Group NPLs increased 11% to R31.1bn, 
or 3.9% of gross loans and advances from 3.5%. Total NPL coverage increased to 44.2%, due to increases across most 
portfolios. Balance sheet portfolio impairments increased by 19% to R6.0bn, or 79 bps of total performing loans from 
65 bps. This includes an additional R0.3bn of macroeconomic overlays to R1.4bn.

RBB’s credit impairments grew by 21% to R7.4bn, a 1.46% credit loss ratio from 1.24%. Retail Banking South Africa’s
charge increased by 14% to R5.4bn, as NPLs grew by 11% to R20.2bn. While Home Loans’ charge grew by 34% to R922m, its
credit loss ratio remains relatively low at 0.40% from 0.30%. VAF’s credit loss ratio rose to 1.14% from 0.97%, as its 
NPL and performing loan coverage increased. Card credit impairments were flat at R2.4bn, a 5.41% credit loss ratio from
5.38%, despite reduced recoveries in Absa Card.  Personal Loans credit impairments increased by 23%, resulting in a 5.68%
credit loss ratio from 5.16%.

Business Banking South Africa’s credit impairments grew by 7% to R581m, resulting in a 0.86% credit loss ratio from
0.85%. Its NPLs were flat at R3.3bn. RBB Rest of Africa’s credit impairments rose by 73% to R1.3bn, increasing its credit
loss ratio to 2.96% from 1.93%. However, its NPLs decreased by 12% to R3.1bn, while its performing loan cover increased
to 2.14% from 1.12%. CIB’s credit impairments increased by 77% to R1.4bn, largely due to a single name impairment in the
first half. This resulted in a 0.53% credit loss ratio from 0.37%. CIB’s unidentified impairments expense grew by 63% 
to R413m.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses grew by 6% to R39 956m from R37 661m. South Africa’s 5% growth in operating expenses was below
inflation, while Rest of Africa costs rose by 11%, or 8% in CCY. Staff costs grew 6% and accounted for 55% of total
expenses. Salaries rose by 5% to R17.9bn due to higher wage increases for entry level employees, while bonuses and 
deferred cash and share-based payments also grew by 5% to R2.7bn. 

Structural cost programs continued to produce efficiency gains that enable investment in strategic initiatives.
Property consolidation contained the increase in property costs and operating leases to 5%, while a reduction in 
sponsorships decreased marketing costs by 9%. Professional fees fell by 8%, given less reliance on external service 
providers for development and testing activity. The Group continued to invest in technology, with total IT spend up 
by 17% to R7.4bn, accounting for 19% of costs. Amortisation of intangibles grew by 35%, but remains relatively low. 

RBB and WIMI’s operating expenses increased by 7% and 11% respectively. Retail Banking South Africa’s operating
expenses grew by 6%, reflecting increased staff costs and investment in digital channels, and Business Banking 
South Africa’s also rose by 6%. RBB Rest of Africa’s operating expenses increased by 11%, or 7% in CCY, reflecting 
inflationary pressures in some countries and investment in IT. CIB’s costs grew by 2% without reducing investment in 
systems and technology.

Taxation
The Group’s taxation expense increased by 1% to R5 835m, slightly less than the 2% growth in pre-tax profit due to the
recognition of deferred tax assets and an increase in non-taxable income. This resulted in a 26.9% effective tax rate
from 27.7%.

Segment performance
Retail Banking South Africa
Headline earnings declined by 4% to R6 406m, largely due to 14% higher credit impairments, since pre-provision profits
grew by 1%. Transactional and Deposits earnings increased by 1% to R2 690m, given 12% higher net interest income on 7%
deposit growth. Despite improved margins, Home Loans’ earnings decreased by 8% to R1 602m due to 15% higher costs and a
34% increase in credit impairments (off a low base). Card earnings increased by 3% to R1 671m, given 11% non-interest
income growth and flat credit impairments. VAF earnings declined by 25% to R800m, as margin pressure saw its revenue
reduce and credit impairments rose by 23%. Personal Loans earnings grew by 10% to R384m, reflecting 16% higher net 
interest income. Losses in the ‘Other’ segment decreased by  1% to R741m, given lower costs. Retail Banking South 
Africa accounted for 41% of total earnings, excluding the Group centre.

Business Banking South Africa
Headline earnings grew by 1% to R2 138m, given 5% higher pre-provision profits. Loan growth improved to 9%, increasing
its revenue growth to 6%, in line with the rise in costs, resulting in a flat 61% cost-to-income ratio. Deposits
declined by 1%, largely due to the reduction in public sector funds industry-wide. Credit impairments grew by 7% 
although its credit loss ratio was largely unchanged at 0.86%. Business Banking South Africa generated 14% of overall 
earnings excluding the Group centre.

Retail and Business Banking Rest of Africa
Headline earnings declined by 3% or 15% in CCY to R769m, despite 23% higher pre-provision profits. Revenue grew by
15%, or 9% in CCY, with net interest income rising by 19% as its net interest margin improved to 9.06%. Costs grew by 
11% or 7% in CCY, so cost-to-income ratio improved to 67.9%. However, credit impairments grew by 73% due to higher 
personal loan provisions and its coverage for performing loans almost doubling. Loans and deposits fell by 11% and 12% 
respectively, despite both growing by 2% in CCY. RBB Rest of Africa contributed 5% of total earnings excluding 
Head Office, Treasury and Other (the Group centre).

Corporate and Investment Bank
Headline earnings rose by 27% to R5 098m, as pre-provision profits increased by 34%. CIB earnings grew by 18% in South
Africa and 43% in the rest of Africa, or 35% in CCY. CIB in the rest of Africa accounted for 44% of CIB’s earnings from
29% in 2013. Revenue grew by 17%, with Rest of Africa increasing by 24% and South Africa 13%. Markets revenue rose by
25% to R5 149m, with rest of Africa up 26% and South Africa 25%, as fixed income and credit grew by 51% and foreign exchange
and commodities by 21%. Credit impairments rose by 77% due to a single name impairment in the first half and increased
portfolio provisions. Costs increased by 2%, despite continuing to invest in systems and technology. Corporate earnings
grew by 44% to R2 672m, as 18% revenue growth exceeded 6% higher costs and credit impairments declined by 8%. Investment
Bank earnings rose 13% to R2 426m, despite 16% revenue growth and 2% lower costs, as credit impairments increased by
228%. CIB’s loan growth slowed to 7%, in part due to the strong rand, although average balances were 23% higher. CIB’s
return on regulatory capital improved to 19.9% from 17.4%. It contributed 32% of total earnings excluding the group centre.

Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance
Headline earnings declined by 4% to R1 399m, with continuing business lines down by 1%. However, South African
earnings from continuing business lines grew by 11% to R1 537m, with Life Insurance up 19%, due to 10% net premium 
income growth, 43% higher income from shareholder funds and recognising a R55m deferred tax asset (net impact). 
Short-term Insurance in South Africa grew earnings by 17%, with a 4.3% underwriting margin and well contained costs, 
while reinsurance limited the rise in claims. Wealth and Investments’ earnings grew by 5%, with assets under management 
increasing by 5% to R288bn on R13bn of net inflows. Rest of Africa lost R112m from a profit of R49m, given higher 
reserving, increased claims and substantially higher new business costs due to integrating First Assurance in Kenya 
and investing in our expansion strategy. WIMI’s return on equity decreased slightly to 23.9% and it generated 9% of 
total earnings excluding the Group centre.

Prospects
In South Africa, we expect modest economic recovery and forecast GDP growth of 1.0% for 2017. Inflation should return
to within the South African Reserve Bank’s target band in the second quarter, resulting in flat interest rates. We
expect 4.5% average GDP growth in our other presence countries in Africa. Note that the current rand strength would 
be a drag on rest of Africa’s contribution this year, particularly in the first half of the year.

Against this backdrop, and barring any unforeseen regulatory and macro-economic developments, we continue to expect
low to mid-single digit loan growth, with CIB growing faster than RBB and South Africa lagging the rest of Africa’s growth
in constant currency. Our net interest margin is expected to decline slightly this year. Slower revenue growth, in part
due to regulatory changes, is likely to produce negative Jaws in the near term, despite continued cost containment. We
expect the strong rand and regulatory pressures to dampen our growth in the first half. However, our credit loss ratio
should improve in 2017, in part due to the large single name provision in the base, while last year’s reduction in our
retail early delinquencies in South Africa also bodes well. Our CET1 ratio is likely to remain above board targets and our
RoE should be broadly similar to 2016’s. While separating from Barclays PLC will impact our near-term returns, we still
believe that our stated longer-term targets currently remain appropriate for our Group including an 18% RoE and low 50s
cost to income ratio.  Lastly, we continue to expect that our dividend cover is likely to increase slightly in the
medium term.

The Group will release an update on its separation from Barclays PLC later this morning.

Notes
(1) The excess of the purchase price over the Group’s share of net assets of Barclays Africa Limited, acquired on 
31 July 2013, was accounted for as a deduction against share premium. The sale and purchase agreement between the 
Group and Barclays Bank Plc allowed for the purchase price to be adjusted for certain items and in June 2016 an 
agreement was reached on the final purchase price adjustment. As a result Barclays Bank Plc paid R66m to the Group, 
which was recognised in equity, in line with the accounting of the original transaction.
(2) During the current reporting period the Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life (Pty) Ltd
which resulted in a R25m increase in non-controlling interest.

Notes
(1) The movement is largely due to the elimination of treasury shares in the share incentive trust. These shares were
acquired by the trust as part of the conversion of the cash-settled share-based payment schemes to the equity-settled
share-based payment schemes.
(2) The Group acquired a 63% shareholding in First Assurance Holdings Limited.
(3) The Group disposed of part of its interest in National Bank of Commerce (NBC), reducing its interest from 
66% to 55%.

Notes
(1) During the current year, two of the Group’s intangible assets were impaired. An acquired customer list was fully
impaired following an adjustment to the interest rate outlook for the related business. The second impairment relates to
the costs previously spent by the Group on the Virtual Bank initiative. In calculating the impairment to be recognised,
the Group determined the value in use based on a discounted cash flow methodology.
(2) The net amount is reflected after taxation and non-controlling interest.

7. Acquisitions and disposals of businesses and other similar transactions
7.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period
In order to continue building and shaping the Group’s predictive underwriting products, expertise and technology, 
the Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life Proprietary Limited, previously known as Instant Life
Proprietary Limited. The acquisition of the investment had an effective acquisition date of 31 March 2016 and is a 
business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred 
amounted to R100m.

The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Goodwill of R20m has been recognised and includes, but is not limited to, the insurer’s workforce and the 
increased market share gained.

The transaction is currently being evaluated in terms of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). The initial accounting
considerations include the valuation of intangible assets (identified in terms of IFRS3 - i.e. Value of business 
acquired and software system) and share-based payments.

From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed revenue of R9m to the total income earned by the Group. If
the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, an additional R5m would have been generated by the Group,
thereby resulting in a total income of R14m. From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed losses after
tax of R12m to total profits earned by the Group. If the combination taken place at the beginning of the year, losses
after tax of an additional R3m would have been incurred by the Group, thereby resulting in a total loss after tax 
of R15m.

7.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period
There were no disposals of businesses during the current reporting period.

7.2.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period
The Group acquired 63% of the issued ordinary share capital of First Assurance Company Limited (FACL), 
an East African insurer, with operations in both Kenya and Tanzania. The acquisition of the investment 
in FACL had an effective acquisition date of 30 October 2015, and is a business combination within 
the scope of IFRS 3.

The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Goodwill of R164m has been recognised mainly attributable to intangible assets 
that do not qualify for recognition on the basis that they are not separable. The Purchase Price Allocation 
(PPA) for the transaction has been finalised with no differences to the provisional amounts published in 
the previous reporting period being noted. From the date of acquisition, FACL contributed R26m to the total 
income of the Group in 2015. Had the acquisition taken place at the beginning of 2015, the total income for 
the Group would have increased by R152m for 2015 year end reporting. From the date of acquisition, FACL 
contributed R9m to profit after tax of the Group in 2015. Had the acquisition taken place at the beginning 
of 2015, profit after tax for the Group would have increased by R37m for 2015 year end reporting.

The Group also purchased additional shares in a non-core joint venture which resulted in an increase in the Group’s
effective shareholding from 50% to 67% and a business combination in terms of IFRS 3. The acquisition occurred on 
18 November 2015. A bargain purchase gain of R4m was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

7.2.2 Disposals of businesses during the previous reporting period
National Bank of Commerce Limited (NBC) was recapitalised through a rights issue to all its shareholders 
during 2013. As the Government of Tanzania (GoT) was unable to subscribe to their rights at the time, an 
option was granted to GoT providing it with the right to purchase its pro rata portion of the shares from 
the Group within a period of two years after the rights issue. The GoT exercised their option during the 
previous reporting period which resulted in a decrease of the Group’s shareholding from 66% to 55%.

8. Related parties
Barclays Bank PLC sold 12,2% of its Barclays Africa Group Limited shareholding for R13,1bn on 5 May 2016

Financial guarantee contracts represent contracts where the Group undertakes to make specified payments 
to a counterparty, should the counterparty suffer a loss as a result of a specified debtor failing to make 
payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. This amount represents the maximum 
off-statement of financial position exposure.

The operating lease commitments comprise a number of separate operating          
leases in relation to property and equipment, none of which is individually      
significant to the Group.                                                        
Leases are negotiated for an average term of three to five years and

The South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) announced in August 2014 that Africa Bank Limited (a subsidiary of 
Africa Bank Investments Limited) would be placed under curatorship. A consortium of six South African banks 
(including Barclays Africa Group Limited) and the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) had underwritten R5bn 
respectively. In the current financial reporting period, African Bank Holdings Limited (that is, the holding 
company of “Good Bank”, African Bank Limited) was successfully capitalised, with BAGL subsidiary for a 
portion of the issued ordinary shares. The investment is recognised within Investment Securities, and the 
remaining commitment which was underwritten by Barclays Africa Group Limited, but guaranteed by the SARB, 
has been extinguished during the current reporting period.

Guarantees include performance guarantee contracts and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate the
facilities by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may expire without being drawn
upon, the total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Note
(1) The presentation of commitments for 2015 has been revised following the reallocation of an amount of R740m from
Commitments to Letters of Credit (within Contingencies) so as to more appropriately reflect the substance of the item.

Legal proceedings
The Group has been party to proceedings against it during the reporting period, and as at the reporting date the
following material cases are disclosed:

* Pinnacle Point Holdings Proprietary Limited (PPG): New Port Finance Company and the trustees of the Winifred Trust
  (“the plaintiffs”) allege a local bank conducted itself unlawfully, and that Absa Bank Limited (the Bank) was privy
  to such conduct. They have instituted proceedings against the Bank for damages for an amount of R1 387m. Although
  Pinnacle Point Holding’s claim has been withdrawn, the second to fifth plaintiff’s claims remain and will proceed 
  to trial. 
* Ayanda Collective Investment Scheme (the Scheme): Absa Capital Investor Services was the trustee of Ayanda
  Collective Investment Scheme, in which Corporate Money Managers (CMM) managed a portfolio of assets within the Scheme. 
  The joint curators of the CMM group of companies and the Altron Pension Fund (an investor in the fund) allege that the
  defendants caused damages to them arising from their alleged failure to meet their obligations in the trust deed 
  together with their statutory obligations set out in the Collective Investment Scheme Act, in respect of which they 
  seek payment of R1 157m. 

The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in South Africa and a number of
other jurisdictions. It is involved in legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, 
including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, 
trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other statutory 
and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal
and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer
protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking
and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a
material adverse effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the
matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters
will not be material to the Group’s results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst
other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of income otherwise reported for the
reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they cannot
reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter. Provision is made for
all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis is resulting in a significant
tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally, especially for companies that are deemed to be of
systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking
and consumer credit industries globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. The nature and impact of
future changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action cannot currently be fully predicted and are
beyond the Group’s control, but especially in the area of banking and insurance regulation, are likely to have an impact on
the Group’s businesses and earnings. 

The Group is continuously evaluating its compliance programmes and controls in general. As a consequence of these
compliance programmes and controls, including monitoring and review activities, the Group has also adopted appropriate
remedial and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and made disclosures on material findings as and when
appropriate. 

Absa Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group Limited, has identified potentially fraudulent activity by
certain of its customers using import advance payments for imports in 2014 and 2015 to effect foreign exchange transfers
from South Africa to beneficiary accounts located in East Asia, UK, Europe and the US. As a result, the Group has been
conducting a review of relevant activity, processes, systems and controls. The Group is keeping relevant authorities
informed as to the status of this matter and is providing information to these authorities as part of its on-going
cooperation. It is not currently possible to estimate the financial impact of the actions described on the Group, if any. 
 
In February 2017 the South African Competition Commission (SACC) referred Absa Bank Limited, among other banks, to
the Competition Tribunal to be prosecuted for breaches of South African competition law related to Foreign Exchange
trading of South African Rand. The SACC found from its investigation that, between 2007 - 2013, the respondents had 
engaged in various forms of collusive behaviour. Absa Bank Limited and its parent Barclays PLC brought the conduct to 
the attention of the SACC under its leniency programme and have cooperated with, and will continue to cooperate with, 
the SACC in relation to this matter. The SACC is therefore not seeking an order from the Tribunal to impose any 
administrative fine on Absa Bank Limited.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group’s tax charge and
worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There may be transactions
and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities may
have indicated disagreement with the Group’s treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account expert external advice where
appropriate. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period in which
such determination is made. The risks are managed in accordance with the Group’s tax Risk Framework.

Note
(1) Some overdrafts were reallocated to term loans to align to the way the products are utilised by the customers. The
restatement effected resulted in a decrease of R821m (2015: R555m) in “Overdrafts” with corresponding increase in “Term
loans”. 

14. Assets and liabilities held at fair value

14.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework includes
a Valuation Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), which is independent from the front office.

The Valuation Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally approve valuation
policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Barclays Africa Group
Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Valuation Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will therefore consider the
appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair value
measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk areas when performing
independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They also assess and document the inputs
obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which supports conclusions that valuations are
performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.

Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to the
specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating the fair value of the
properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible the fair value of the Group’s investment properties is determined through valuations performed by
external independent valuators.

When the Group’s internal valuations are different to that of the external independent valuers, detailed procedures
are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC verifies the procedures performed by the front office and
considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent valuations.

14.2 Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects
the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Quoted market prices - Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. Such
fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm’s length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and 
frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
A Fair values classified as Level 2 have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in an active
market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if
there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 10% to
the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar
nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for 
similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using inputs derived from
observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for
similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant,
assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, dependent on
the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons with similar
companies and price:earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded OTC. OTC derivative contracts include forward, swap and option
contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices or
indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices, dealer price quotations,
discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual cash
flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus the originally
priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used to reflect valuation date
pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, are used to determine expected cash
flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying rates
currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded derivatives, the
embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives as detailed above.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value. For
other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying value because the
instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

14.3 Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below:

Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices
respectively. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact that they are managed
on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will
generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with
hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data. For those assets and liabilities
where the firm is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for
certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), the mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a
transaction cost. 

Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair
value of counterparty credit risk, the Group’s own credit quality, as well as the cost of funding across all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the firm’s model governance framework. This process identifies the assumptions
used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). Where necessary, fair
value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation adjustments are dependent on the size
of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all known
risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis. 

14.4 Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group’s assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair
value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

14.6.1 Significant transfers between levels
During the 2016 and 2015 reporting periods, transfers between levels occurred because of changes in the 
observability of valuation inputs, in some instances owing to changes in the level of market activity. 
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

14.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs
As part of the Group’s risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant unobservable parameters
to generate a range of possible alternative valuations. The assets and liabilities that most impact this sensitivity
analysis are those with the more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The stresses are applied independently and do

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, 
the discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered 
unobservable inputs for items which mature after five years. However, if the items mature in less than five 
years, these inputs are considered observable.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying price 
of the market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to the
unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.

difference between the transaction price and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using 
unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is as follows:

15. Reporting changes overview
The following business portfolio changes have impacted the financial results for the comparative period ended 31
December 2015. None of the restatements have impacted the overall financial position or net earnings of the Group.

* Statutory liquid assets allocations in loan portfolios that were moved from WIMI to Retail and RBB in previous
  reporting periods were reassessed and resulted in a restatement of Interest and similar charges of R6m between 
  WIMI and RBB.
* The Group refined its transfer pricing and allocation of endowment methodologies, resulting in a restatement 
  of Net interest income of R53m from CIB to RBB (R31m) and WIMI (R22m).
* The Group reassessed its cost allocation methodology, resulting in the restatements of operating expenses of 
  R328m from RBB to CIB (R38m) and Head Office, Treasury and other operations (R290m).

  Net interest income of R41m from Head Office, Treasury and other operations to CIB.

  Treasury and other operations, resulting in a restatement of net interest expense of R7m and operating expenses 
  of R311m.
* Africa Corporate Development (previously reported in CIB Private Equity) was moved from CIB to Head Office, 
  Treasury and other operations to better align the management thereof. This resulted in a restatement of operating 
  expenses of R4m between these segments. 
* Cheque income and the associated costs were moved from CIB to RBB to better align the ownership of the product 
  and the management thereof. This resulted in a restatement between CIB and RBB of Fee and commission income of 
  R36m as well as Operating expenses of R21m.
* Integrated Processing Solutions was moved from RBB to Head office, Treasury and other operations to better 
  align the ownership of the investment and the management thereof and resulted in a restatement of Investments in

ABSA BANK IN MEDIA REPORTS BASED ON PUBLIC PROTECTOR’S PROVISIONAL REPORT




Barclays Africa Group notes media reports today regarding a provisional report by the Public Protector (12 of
2016/17) dealing, in part, with the financial assistance Bankorp received from the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) from 1985 to 1995.

Shareholders are advised that we have co-operated fully with the Public Protector’s investigation and will
continue to do so.

As this is a confidential provisional document released to a limited number of parties for comment and further
input, it may change materially following further submissions. We have informed the Public Protector that we
accept her invitation to make further submissions within the deadline of 28 February 2017, which will correct
several factual and legal inaccuracies contained in the provisional report.

It is regrettable that the provisional report was leaked before further submissions and the finalisation thereof,
because in its current form it creates the incorrect view that Absa Bank Limited (Absa), a subsidiary of the
Group, received undue benefits by virtue of the SARB assistance to Bankorp.

Bankorp started receiving SARB assistance in 1985. Absa acquired Bankorp at fair value in April 1992. All
the obligations pertaining to the SARB’s assistance were discharged in full by October 1995.

The Davis Panel of Experts appointed by the SARB Governor in June 2000 found that Absa’s shareholders
did not derive any undue benefit from the SARB’s intervention and, as such, no claim of restitution could be

pursued against Absa. We agree with this finding. The full Davis Panel report is available at:

Shareholders will be updated as appropriate.

3)   Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks by
ensuring that they have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar
days. The LCR requirement, from 1 January 2015, was 60% and will increase by 10% per year to 100% on 1 January 2019.
The requirement for 2016 is 70%.

The LCR is calculated as the value of HQLA divided by total net cash outflows. HQLA represents the value of assets that can
be easily and immediately converted into cash. Net cash outflows are calculated according to regulations.

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under guidance
note 8 of 2014 and 5 of 2015, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

REFERENCE TO BARCLAYS PLC QUARTER 3 2016 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are advised that Barclays PLC released its third quarter 2016 results today.

Their announcement included abridged pound sterling results for the Africa Banking segment
disclosed under Discontinued Operations, which reflects Barclays PLC’s stake in Barclays
Africa Group. While Africa Banking is impacted by various cost overlays, consolidation and
other adjustments, including increased minority interests following Barclays PLC’s reduced
shareholding, it still provides some indication of Barclays Africa Group’s performance for the
period ended 30 September 2016.

Our revenue growth slowed slightly in the third quarter, reflecting low economic growth and
regulatory changes. While our net interest margin widened year on year, it declined slightly
from the first half largely due to the impact of National Credit Act lending caps in South Africa.
Loan growth slowed slightly from the first half, given flat retail lending in South Africa, while
Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) loan growth remains strong. Deposit growth in
South Africa was modest despite solid retail growth, as CIB deposits declined. Within
non-interest revenue, trading growth remains strong, although the fourth quarter of 2015
presents a relatively high base. Our revenue growth in the rest of Africa continues to exceed
South Africa’s, despite Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance experiencing a drag
from its operations outside South Africa.

Our pre-provision profit growth remained robust, as revenue growth exceeded the growth in
operating expenses, despite costs incurred in planning for the separation of the Group from
Barclays PLC. Overall costs continue to be well managed. Our credit loss ratio improved
noticeably from the first half, reflecting the usual seasonality in our retail books in South Africa
and a substantial decline in CIB’s charge.

In the first nine months of the year our return on equity declined slightly, as a result of higher
credit impairments. We continue to expect low to mid-single digit loan growth. Our net interest
margin should increase, although the recent implementation of interest rate caps and floors in
Kenya will impact our margin in the fourth quarter. Revenue momentum in Retail and Business
Banking South Africa is slowing in the second half. However, our revenue growth should
exceed the growth in our operating costs. Our credit loss ratio is expected to exceed our
through-the-cycle level slightly, given CIB’s substantial first half charge. Consequently, the
Group’s return on equity is likely to be lower than last year’s 17.0%.

Barclays PLC’s results announcement also contained the following statement regarding its
proposed sell down of its shareholding in Barclays Africa Group Limited (BAGL):
“On 5 May 2016, Barclays executed the first tranche of the sell down of the Group’s interest in
BAGL with the sale of 12.2% of BAGL’s issued share capital. Following completion of this first
tranche, Barclays’ holding represents 50.1% of BAGL’s issued share capital. Barclays continues
to explore opportunities to reduce its shareholding to a level that would permit regulatory
deconsolidation. Barclays also continues to work closely with BAGL management on
arrangements for operational separation of the two businesses, including the terms of
transitional services arrangements and related separation payments.”

The financial information on which this trading update is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Group’s auditors.

Overview of results
Barclays Africa Group Limited’s (the Group's) headline earnings increased 7% to R7 252m from R6 755m. Diluted HEPS also 
grew 7% to 856,7 cents from 797,0 cents. The Group’s RoE decreased to 16,1% from 16,4%, primarily because of higher 
credit impairments, and its return on assets declined to 1,29% from 1,33%. The Group declared a 2% higher ordinary DPS 
of 460 cents. Its net asset value (NAV) per share increased 9% to 10 788 cents.

Pre-provision profit increased 19,1% to R17,0bn, which drove earnings growth. Non-interest income grew 10% and net
interest income 14%, as the Group’s net interest margin (on average interest-bearing assets) improved to 4,97% from 
4,70%. Loans and advances to customers grew 9% to R715bn, while deposits due to customers increased 4% to R677bn. 
The Group’s cost-to-income ratio improved to 53,4% from 55,9% as operating expenses rose 7%. Rand weakness added 3% to 
the Group’s revenue, cost and headline earnings growth. Credit impairments grew 46%, largely due to higher charges in 
Home Loans, Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) and Retail and Business Banking (RBB) Rest of Africa. The non-performing 
loans (NPLs) ratio rose to 3,8% from 3,5%, while portfolio provisions increased to 72 basis points (bps) of performing 
loans from 65 bps. 

RBB’s headline earnings increased 10% to R4 911m, as revenue grew 10% and costs rose 8%. Retail Banking South Africa
grew headline earnings 8%, while Business Banking South Africa and RBB Rest of Africa increased 4% and 63% respectively.
Wealth Investment Management and Insurance’s (WIMI’s) headline earnings decreased 8% to R691m, despite 13% growth in
Life Insurance in South Africa, while CIB grew 7% to R1 992m, as 41% higher Corporate earnings offset 20% lower Investment 
Bank earnings.

Revenue from the Rest of Africa grew 27% and headline earnings rose 33% to R1 326m, to contribute 23% and 18% of the
Group respectively.

Operating environment
The global economy and markets were volatile in the first half, with wide swings in risk sentiment and asset prices,
and big quarterly variations in the growth of many large economies. Advanced economy growth slipped to an estimated 1,6%
in the half, while emerging markets grew 4,4%. Soft demand depressed prices for many commodities, while evolving views
on the outlook for US monetary policy impacted global markets more broadly.

South Africa’s economy shrank 1,2% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, given drought conditions and poor
mining output. A poor job market, weak consumer confidence, rising rates and higher inflation placed greater strain on
households. For the business sector, low confidence coincided with reduced investment spending. Despite low levels of
economic activity, inflation rose beyond the Reserve Bank’s 6% upper target, prompting a further 75 bps increase in rates.
Growth in the Group’s presence markets in the rest of Africa moderated further, due to lower commodity prices, the adverse
external environment and fiscal consolidation efforts in some markets.  

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total assets increased 10% to R1 142bn at 30 June 2016, predominantly due to 9% higher loans and advances to customers
and 25% growth in trading portfolio assets.

Loans and advances to customers
Loans and advances to customers increased 9% to R715bn, or 7% excluding rand depreciation. Retail Banking South
Africa’s loans rose 1% to R375bn, reflecting 3% growth in Vehicle and Asset Finance (VAF) and 14% higher Personal Loans, while
Home Loans declined 1% and Card 2%. Business Banking South Africa’s loans rose 5% to R67bn, including 6% growth in
mortgages. RBB Rest of Africa’s loans increased 16% to R42bn, or 3% in constant currency. CIB’s loans grew 26% to R225bn,
largely due to 32% higher term loans.

Funding
The Group’s liquidity position remains strong. Deposits due to customers grew 4% to R677bn, which increased its
loans to deposit and debt securities ratio to 87,1% from 85,5%. Deposits due to customers constituted 75% of total funding from 79%. 
Retail Banking South Africa maintained its leading market share and increased deposits 9% to R170bn. Business Banking South Africa’s
deposits grew 4% to R106bn, with 3% higher cheque account deposits. CIB’s deposits were flat at R234bn, as 6% lower
cheque account deposits offset 10% higher fixed deposits.

Net asset value
The Group’s NAV per share grew 9% to 10 788 cents from June 2015. During the half it generated profits of R7,0bn, from which it 
paid R4,6bn in dividends. Its foreign currency translation reserve reduced by R2,1bn to R4,3bn.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (RWAs) increased 8% to R699bn at 30 June 2016, in line with its asset growth. However, RWAs
decreased 1% year to date due to rand depreciation. The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum
regulatory requirements. The Group’s CET1 and Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios were 12,1% and 12,6% respectively (from 11,7%
and 12,3%). The Group generated 1,1% of CET1 capital internally during the period. Its total capital adequacy ratio was
14,6%. The dividend of 460 cents per share on a dividend cover of 1,9 times recognises the internal capital generation capability, 
our strategy, and growth plans while having regard to the difficult and volatile macro economy.

Statement of comprehensive income
Net interest income
Net interest income increased 14% to R21 093m from R18 463m, with average interest-bearing assets growing 8%. The Group’s net 
interest margin improved to 4,97% from 4,70%.

Loan pricing had a 5 bps positive impact, as improved pricing in Home Loans offset compression in VAF. A lower proportion 
of mortgages had a positive composition impact, partly offset by CIB’s growth. The Group’s deposit margin increased, due 
to improved Retail Banking and Corporate pricing offsetting higher wholesale liquidity premiums and the negative mix impact 
of increased wholesale funding.
 
Higher South African interest rates resulted in an endowment contribution on deposits and equity of 6 bps. Despite
releasing R224m to the income statement, the benefit from structural hedging declined 10 bps. Rest of Africa added 13 bps
to the Group margin, as its margin improved by 35 bps and its weighting in the overall composition increased. The basis
reset benefit from prime increasing relative to JIBAR in South Africa added another 6 bps.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased 10% to R15 415m from R13 960m accounting for 42% of total revenue. Rest of Africa grew
22% to R2 794m, or 9% in constant currency, while South Africa increased 8% to R12 621m. Net fee and commission income
rose 5% to R10 305m, with growth in credit cards and electronic banking of 27% and 6% respectively.
RBB’s non-interest income grew 7% to R9 483m, 62% of the Group total. Retail Banking South Africa increased 5% to 
R6 252m with customer growth and sub-inflation fee increases dampened by continued migration to bundled products and
electronic channels. Card non-interest income increased 13%, with 14% growth in acquiring volumes. Business Banking’s
non-interest income grew 6% to R1 769m, largely due to fair value adjustments in its equity portfolio and 6% growth in electronic
banking income. RBB Rest of Africa’s 22% higher non-interest income of R1 462m reflects rand depreciation and
increased transaction volumes, particularly in card and foreign exchange.

WIMI’s non-interest income was flat at R2 502m, as South Africa grew 2% and the Rest of Africa declined 21% due to
revised reserving requirements, lower investment returns and new business strain. However, net insurance premiums
income grew 16% on continuing lines. 

CIB’s non-interest income increased 18% to R3 282m, largely due to improved trading. Its overall Markets revenue rose
31% to R2 725m as rest of Africa grew 26% and South Africa 33%, with Fixed Income and Credit up 57% and Foreign Exchange
and Commodities increasing 28%.
 
Impairment losses on loans and advances
Credit impairments increased 46% to R5 197m from R3 550m, resulting in a 1,29% credit loss ratio from 0,97%. The Group
changed its credit loss ratio disclosure to use gross customer loans and loans to banks, rather than customer loans. On
the previous basis, its credit loss ratio increased to 1,48% from 1,11%. Group NPLs increased 17% to R31,4bn, or 3,8% of gross 
loans and advances from 3,5%. Total NPL coverage was flat at 44%. Balance sheet portfolio impairments increased 18,2% to 
R5,7bn, or 0,72% of total performing loans from 0,65%. This includes 41% higher macroeconomic impairments of R1,3bn.
 
RBB’s credit impairments grew 21% to R3,9bn, a 1,48% credit loss ratio from 1,27%. Retail Banking South Africa’s
charge increased 13% to R2,9bn. 

Home Loans’ charge grew 77% to R505m, a 0,44% credit loss ratio from 0,25%, with NPLs rising 4% year to date. VAF's
credit loss ratio rose to 1,13% from 1,09%, as its retail charge increased due to growth in debt counselling and legal.
Commercial asset finance’s credit loss ratio improved due to low new defaults. Card credit impairments decreased 3% to 
R1 297m, a 5,95% credit loss ratio from 6,21%, despite increased delinquencies and debt counselling inflows in Absa Card
and Woolworths Financial Services. Personal Loans credit impairments increased 22%, largely reflecting book growth and a 
present value adjustment in the second half of the prior reporting period. Its credit loss ratio rose to 5,85% from 5,43%. 

Business Banking South Africa’s credit impairments grew 32% to R332m, resulting in a 0,99% credit loss ratio from
0,79%. Its NPLs were flat at R3,2bn. RBB Rest of Africa’s credit impairments rose 58% to R646m, increasing its credit loss
ratio to 1,98% from 1,41%. Its NPLs increased 19% to R3,4bn, while performing loan cover increased to 1,76% from 1,08%.
CIB’s credit impairments increased significantly to R1,4bn, largely due to specific impairments in the consumer and
resources sector, resulting in a 1,05% credit loss ratio from 0,23%. Its portfolio provisions increased to 0,43% of
performing loans.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses grew 7% to R19 487m from R18 129m. South Africa’s 5% cost growth was below inflation, while Rest of
Africa costs rose 17%, or 6% in constant currency. Staff costs grew 8% and accounted for 56% of total expenses.
Salaries rose 9% due to higher wage increases for entry level employees and hiring in specialist staff. Incentives were flat,
as bonuses rose 6% and share-based payments fell 12%.

Non-staff costs grew 7%, as structural cost programmes produced efficiency gains that enabled continued investment in
growth initiatives. Property-related costs grew 1%, reflecting continued portfolio optimisation. Total IT-related costs
increased 17% and constituted 19% of overall costs. Depreciation rose 8% and amortisation of intangible assets increased
37% due to investment in new channels. Marketing costs fell 16% after some sponsorships were terminated. Professional
fees increased 14% to assist with group projects and implementing regulatory changes. 

RBB and WIMI’s operating expenses increased 8% and 12% respectively. Retail Banking South Africa’s operating expenses
grew 6%, reflecting increased staff costs and investment in digital channels, and Business Banking South Africa’s rose
6%. RBB Rest of Africa’s operating expenses grew 17%, or 6% in constant currency, despite inflationary pressures in some
countries. CIB’s costs grew 5% without reducing investment in systems.

Taxation
The Group’s taxation expense increased 3% to R2 997m, slightly less than the 4% growth in pre-tax profit, resulting in
a 28,3% effective tax rate from 28,6%.

Segment performance
Retail Banking South Africa
Headline earnings grew 8% to R3 402m, as 8% higher pre-provision profits offset 13% higher credit impairments.
Transactional and Deposits earnings grew 14% to R1 395m, given 17% higher net interest income and 4% cost growth. Home Loans’
earnings fell 7% to R825m, largely due to 77% higher credit impairments. Card earnings increased 23% to R762m, as 6%
revenue growth exceeded 4% higher costs and credit impairments decreased 3%. VAF earnings declined 15% to R411m, given lower
revenue and 8% higher credit impairments. Personal Loans earnings grew 81% to R199m, reflecting 17% revenue growth
combined with 6% lower costs. “Other” segment grew 9% to R190m, due to increased technology, enhancement of digital channels
and regulatory costs. Retail Banking South Africa accounted for 45% of total earnings, excluding the Group centre.

Business Banking South Africa
Headline earnings increased 4% to R1 070m, reflecting 4% growth in its core franchise and a 7% smaller loss in the
non-core equity portfolio. Pre-provision profits grew 11% as 8% revenue growth exceeded 6% higher costs, while its credit
loss ratio increased to 0,99%. Business Banking South Africa generated 14% of overall earnings excluding the Group
centre. 

Retail and Business Banking Rest of Africa

increase pre-provision profits 48% and reduce its cost to income ratio to 67,7%. Credit impairments increased 58%,
resulting in a 1,98% credit loss ratio. RBB Rest of Africa contributed 6% of total earnings excluding the Group centre.

Corporate and Investment Bank
Headline earnings rose 7% to R1 992m, due to 45% higher pre-provision profits and 5% lower taxation. Revenues grew
23%, with Rest of Africa increasing 34% and South Africa 17%. Markets revenue rose 31%, with South Africa up 33% while Rest
of Africa grew 26%. Costs rose 5%, reflecting continued investment in systems and technology. Credit impairments
increased by R1 145m, due to specific impairments in the consumer and resources sector and higher portfolio provisions.

CIB’s return on regulatory capital declined to 15,9% from 17,4%, due to higher credit impairments. It contributed 26% of
total earnings excluding the Group centre.

Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance
Headline earnings fell 8% to R691m due to higher actuarial reserving in Mozambique and Kenya and reduced income on
shareholder funds. Excluding these items WIMI’s earnings grew 9%. Life Insurance in South Africa grew 13% on the back of
12% higher net premium income. The embedded value of new business increased 21%. Short-term insurance in South Africa grew
its continuing line earnings 28%, despite higher claims. Wealth and Investment Management’s earnings grew 11% given 10%
revenue growth, as net assets under management increased 4% to R284bn. Fiduciary Services earnings fell 10%, while
Distribution returned to profitability. Headline earnings for the ""Other"" segment declined by R82m which includes the WIMI
shareholder investment portfolios which were adversely impacted by currency and market movements. Rest of Africa made a
R29m loss due to revised reserving requirements and lower investment returns. WIMI’s RoE decreased to 23,2% from 25,4%
and it generated 9% of earnings excluding the Group centre. 

Prospects
The UK Brexit vote and its potential for broader implications reduced our 2016 global growth forecast to 3,1%. 

We have cut our GDP growth forecast for South Africa to -0,2% in 2016. Inflation is expected to remain high in the
second half, given the impact of drought on food inflation while the recent recovery in the rand has only a temporary
moderating impact. We forecast inflation will average 6,7% in 2016 and we expect a further 25 bps rate increase towards the
end of the year. Key risks facing South Africa include further weakness in the global economy, and the potential for its
sovereign credit rating to be downgraded. The outlook is similarly challenging across our presence countries in the rest
of Africa, and we expect economic growth of 4,7% for 2016, the region’s lowest growth since 2002. 

Against this challenging and volatile backdrop, we expect low to mid-single digit loan growth, with CIB growing faster
than RBB and rest of Africa growth exceeding South Africa. The Group’s net interest margin should be largely in line with 
2015, despite a higher proportion of CIB lending and the National Credit Act caps. Continued focus on revenue growth
and cost management should improve the Group’s cost-to-income ratio. Its credit loss ratio should improve from the first
half, given usual seasonality, but remain above through-the-cycle levels. As a result, the Group’s RoE is likely to be
slightly lower in 2016.
 
Following Barclays PLC’s announcement on 1 March 2016, Barclays PLC continues to explore strategic and capital market 
options to reduce its shareholding in Barclays Africa Group to achieve regulatory deconsolidation. Barclays Africa Group 
continues to work with Barclays PLC, including planning for the operational separation of the two businesses in order to 
preserve value for all stakeholders. Barclays Africa Group and Barclays PLC continue to engage with regulators as the
divestment process is subject to all relevant regulatory approvals. Shareholders will be updated in due course.

Notes
(1) The excess of the purchase price over the Group's share of the net assets of Barclays Africa Limited, acquired on 31 July 2013, was  
accounted for as a deduction against share premium. The sale and purchase agreement between the Group and Barclays Bank PLC allowed for the
purchase price to be adjusted for certain items and in June 2016 an agreement was reached on the final purchase price adjustment. As a result
Barclays Bank PLC paid R66m to the Group, which was recognised in equity, in line with the accounting of the original transaction.
(2) The Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life (Pty) Ltd, previously known as Instant Life (Pty) Ltd which resulted in
a R25m increase in non-controlling interest.

Notes
(1) The impairment of intangible assets was incurred in RBB and Head Office. The impairment in RBB (R283m) was mainly
due to the impact of the interest rate outlook on the fair value of customer list. The impairment in Head Office (R300m)
is due to a decision to fully impair costs spent on our Virtual Bank work even though we continue to explore
opportunities in this regard.
(2) The net amount is reflected after taxation and non-controlling interest.

6. Acquisitions and disposals of businesses
6.1.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period
In order to continue building and shaping the Group’s predictive underwriting products, expertise and technology, the
Group acquired a 75% controlling stake in Absa Instant Life (Pty) Ltd, previously known as Instant Life (Pty) Ltd. The
acquisition of the investment had an effective acquisition date of 31 March 2016 and is a business combination within the
scope of IFRS 3. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred amounted to R100m.

The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. A goodwill of R20m has been recognised through the purchase of the online insurer. The goodwill mentioned 
includes but is not limited to the insurer’s workforce and the increased market share gained.

The transaction is currently under Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) consideration. The initial accounting
considerations include the valuation of intangible assets (identified in terms of IFRS3 - i.e. Value of business 
acquired and Software system) and Share-based payments.

From the date of acquisition, Absa Instant Life contributed losses after tax of R4m to total profits earned by the
Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, losses after tax of an additional R3m would have
been incurred by the Group.

6.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period
There were no disposals of businesses during the current reporting period.

6.2.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the previous reporting period
The Group acquired 63% of the issued ordinary share capital of First Assurance Company Limited (FACL), an East
African insurer, with operations in both Kenya and Tanzania. The acquisition of the investment in FACL had an 
effective acquisition date of 30 October 2015, and is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. 

The non-controlling interest below was measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. A goodwill of R164m has been recognised mainly due to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate 
recognition.

The transaction is still under Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) consideration. The initial accounting considerations
include the valuation of intangible assets (identified in terms of IFRS3 - i.e. Brand Names and Distribution Force),
Premium debtors, Investment Properties and the Valuation of Policyholder liabilities. 

From the date of acquisition, FACL contributed R9m to profit after tax of the Group. If the combination had taken
place at the beginning of the year, profit after tax for the Group would have increased by R37m.

The Group also purchased additional shares in a non-core joint venture which resulted in an increase in the Group’s
effective shareholding from 50% to 67%. The acquisition occurred on 18 November 2015. A Bargain Purchase of R4m was 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

6.2.2 Disposals of businesses during the previous reporting period
National Bank of Commerce Limited (NBC) was recapitalised through a rights issue to all its shareholders during 2013.
As the Government of Tanzania (GoT) was unable to subscribe to their rights at the time, an option was granted to GoT
providing it with the right to purchase its pro rata portion of the shares from the Group within a period of two years
after the rights issue. The GoT exercised their option during the reporting period which resulted in a decrease of the
Group’s shareholding from 66% to 55%.

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) announced in August 2014 that African Bank Limited (a subsidiary of African 
Bank Investments Limited) would be placed under curatorship. A consortium of six South African banks (including 
Barclays Africa Group Limited) and the Public Investment Corporation had underwritten R5bn respectively. In the 
current financial reporting period, African Bank Holdings Limited (that is, the holding company of “Good Bank”, 
African Bank Limited) was successfully capitalised, with BAGL subscribing for a portion of the issued ordinary shares.
The investment is recognised within Investment Securities, and the remaining commitment which was underwritten by 
Barclays Africa Group Limited, but guaranteed by the SARB, has been derecognised.

Guarantees include performance and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right to terminate the
facilities by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. Since commitments may expire without 
being drawn upon, the total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Legal proceedings
The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters both in South Africa and a number of
other jurisdictions. It is party to legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, 
including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, 
trusts, client assets, competition, data protection, money laundering, employment, environmental and other statutory and 
common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal
and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer
protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking
and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged.

At the present time, the Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a
material adverse effect on its financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the
matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters
will not be material to the Group’s results of operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, amongst
other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of income otherwise reported for the
reporting period.

The Group has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these matters either because they cannot
reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the outcome of the matter. Provision is made for
all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis is resulting in a significant
tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally, especially for companies that are deemed to be of
systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking
and consumer credit industries globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. The nature and impact of
future changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action cannot currently be fully predicted and are
beyond the Group’s control, but especially in the area of banking and insurance regulation, are likely to have an impact on
the Group’s businesses and earnings. The Group is continuously evaluating its compliance programmes and controls in
general. As a consequence of these compliance programmes and controls, including monitoring and review activities, the Group
has also adopted appropriate remedial and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and made disclosures on
material findings as and when appropriate.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group’s tax charge and
provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. There are many transactions
and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities
may have indicated disagreement with the Group’s treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined
until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account expert external advice
where appropriate. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,
such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period in
which such determination is made. These risks are managed in accordance with the Group’s Tax Risk Framework.

13. Assets and liabilities held at fair value
13.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework includes
a Valuation Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (IVC), which is independent from the front office.

The Valuation Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally approve valuation
policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Barclays Africa Group
Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Valuation Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will therefore consider the
appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair value
measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk areas when performing
independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They also assess and document the inputs
obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which supports conclusions that valuations are
performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.

Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to the
specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar
properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating the fair value of the
properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible the fair value of the Group’s investment properties is determined through valuations performed by
external independent valuators. When the Group’s internal valuations are different to that of the external independent
valuers, detailed procedures are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC verifies the procedures performed
by the front office and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external independent valuations. 

13.2 Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects
the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows.

Quoted market prices - Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. Such
fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm’s length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency
to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
Fair values classified as Level 2 have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in an active
market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if
there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. 

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 10% to
the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar
nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for 
similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using inputs derived 
from observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices for
similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, where relevant,
assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, dependent on
the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons with similar
companies and price:earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over the counter (OTC) derivatives. OTC derivative contracts
include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, equity 
prices and commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market 
prices, dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual cash
flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus the originally
priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used to reflect valuation date
pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, are used to determine expected cash
flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying rates
currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded derivatives, the
embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value. For
other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying value because the
instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

13.3 Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described as follows:

Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid-prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices
respectively unless the relevant mid- prices are reflective of the appropriate exit price as a practical expedient given the
nature of the underlying instruments. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives,
the fact that they are managed on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a
derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and
term in accordance with hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data. For
those assets and liabilities where the Group is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than,
mid-price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), the mid-price is used, since the
bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost.

Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair
value of counterparty credit risk, as well as the cost of funding across all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the Group’s model governance framework. This process identifies the assumptions
used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). Where necessary, fair
value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation adjustments are dependent on the size
of the portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all
known risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis.

13.4 Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group’s assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair
value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

13.6.1 Significant transfers between levels
During the prior reporting period, it was determined that significant transfers between levels of the liabilities held
at fair value occurred. 

Transfers out of Level 3 and into Level 2 arise where the maturities on debt securities decreased to less than 
5 years. 

Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

In the previous reporting period transfers out of level 3 and into level 2 arose where unobservable inputs became
observable and/or unobservable inputs were no longer considered to be significant to the valuation of an instrument.

13.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs
As part of the Group’s risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant unobservable parameters
to generate a range of potentially possible alternative valuations. The assets and liabilities that impact this
sensitivity analysis most are those with the more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The stresses are applied 
independently and do not take account of any cross correlation between separate asset classes that would reduce the 
overall effect on the valuations.

The following table reflects how the unobservable parameters were changed in order to evaluate the sensitivities of
Level 3 financial assets and liabilities:

Significant unobservable parameter              Positive/(negative) variance applied to parameters

Basis curves                                    100/(100) bps                                         
Yield curves and repo curves                    100/(100) bps                                         
Future earnings and marketability discount      15/(15)%

A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to the profit or loss, or a change in
the fair value asset or liability of more than 10% or the underlying value of the affected item. This is demonstrated by
the following sensitivity analysis which includes a reasonable range of possible outcomes:

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy, the discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market 
curves are considered unobservable inputs for items which mature after five years. However, if the 
items mature in less than five years, these inputs are considered observable.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the 
underlying price of the market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant 
changes to the unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact 
on fair values.

14. Reporting changes overview 
Reclassification changes
The following changes have impacted the financial results for the comparative periods ended 30 June 2015 and 
31 December 2015.

1) Internal reclassifications
 In terms of the Group’s policy, financial assets with a maturity of less than three months should be reported as
“Cash, cash balances and balances with central banks”, while financial assets with a maturity of longer than 
three months are reported as “Investment securities”. Based on an analysis performed on the maturity periods of 
treasury bills in Rest of Africa, it was established that some treasury bills’ maturity period extended beyond 
three months and had been reported as “Cash, cash balances and balances with the central banks”. These items are 
now being reported as “Investment securities”. This resulted in a restatement from cash, cash balances and 
balances to central banks to investment securities of R9bn and R11bn for the reporting periods ended 30 June 2015 
and 31 December 2015, respectively.

The impact of these changes on the statement of financial position is as follows:

2) Business portfolio changes
- Statutory liquid assets allocations in loan portfolios that were moved from Wealth Investment Management 
  and Insurance (WIMI) to Retail and Business Banking (RBB) in previous reporting periods were reassessed and 
  resulted in the restatement of statutory liquid assets between WIMI and RBB.
- The Group refined its transfer pricing and allocation of endowment methodologies, resulting in restatements 
  between segments.
- The Group reassessed its cost allocation methodology, resulting in the restatements of operating expenses 
  between and within segments.
- South African Reserve Bank (SARB) cash and central exchange balances were moved from Corporate and Investment
  Banking (CIB) to Head Office, Treasury and other operations.
- Interest rates on internal cash balances were aligned to market related rates, resulting in the restatement of
  interest between CIB and Head Office, Treasury and other operations.
- Certain shared services operations that were previously conducted by RBB were transferred to Head office, 
  Treasury and other operations, resulting in the restatement of income and costs.
- Africa Corporate Development (previously reported within CIB Private Equity) was moved from CIB to Head 
  Office and cheque income and associated costs were moved from CIB to RBB to better align the ownership of 
  the products and the management thereof.

1) One Africa Long-Term Incentive Plan
The One Africa LTIP is a cash-based plan with awards vesting after three years, subject to a
balanced scorecard of performance conditions. Awards under the plan were allocated in 2012.
The award vested at 23% of the maximum, with 50% being released in cash in 2015 and with the
remaining 50% being restricted in the form of a share award until 2016 (the original awards and
the vesting were disclosed in the Barclays Africa Group 2014 and 2015 Integrated Report).

The number of shares that have been allocated in terms of the restriction referred to above was
determined having regard to the 20-day volume-weighted average of a Barclays Africa Group
share to 14 June 2015. The plan used to facilitate the allocation of these shares is the Barclays
Africa Group Share Value Plan (the SVP).

2) Barclays Africa Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Absa LTIP is a share-based plan with awards vesting after three years, subject to a balanced
scorecard of performance conditions. Awards under the plan were allocated in 2012. The 2012
allocation vested at 10% (plus accumulated dividend equivalents) of the maximum, with 50%
being released in 2015 and the remaining 50% being restricted until 2016 (The original awards
and the vesting were disclosed in the Barclays Africa Group 2014 and 2015 Integrated Report).
The mandatory restriction has now been lifted and the shares are therefore released to the
participants by virtue of the rules of the schemes, with the tax liability being settled automatically,
and no decision thereon being made by the participants.

3)   Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The objective of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks by
ensuring that they have sufficient high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar
days. The LCR requirement, from 1 January 2015, was 60% and will increase by 10% per year to 100% on 1 January 2019.
The requirement for 2016 is 70%.

The LCR is calculated as the value of HQLA divided by total net cash outflows. HQLA are the value of assets that can be
easily and immediately converted into cash. Net cash outflows are calculated according to the scenario parameters outlined by
regulations.

Absa Bank Limited successfully applied for a committed liquidity facility from the South African Reserve Bank under guidance
note 8 of 2014 and 5 of 2015, which is included in HQLA for LCR purposes from January 2016.

Further to the announcement released on 4 May 2016, Barclays has sold 103,592,491 ordinary shares in
the capital of Barclays Africa (representing 12.2% of Barclays Africa’s issued share capital) at a price of

conditions.

PROPOSED PLACING BY BARCLAYS PLC OF 103.6 MILLION (12.2%) ORDINARY SHARES IN
BARCLAYS AFRICA

Barclays Africa shareholders are referred to the announcement released by Barclays PLC in relation to the
launch of a proposed placing of 103.6 million ordinary shares in Barclays Africa. The Barclays PLC RNS
announcement is set out below:

“PROPOSED PLACING OF 103.6 MILLION ORDINARY SHARES IN BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP
LIMITED (“BARCLAYS AFRICA”)
4 May 2016

On 1 March 2016, as part of a set of strategic initiatives, Barclays announced its intention to divest part of
its 62% shareholding in Barclays Africa over the next two to three years, to a level which will permit
Barclays to de-consolidate Barclays Africa from a regulatory perspective and, prior to that, from an
accounting perspective.

Following on from that announcement, Barclays announces its intention to sell 103.6 million ordinary shares
(the ""Placing Shares"") in the capital of Barclays Africa (the “Placing”). The Placing Shares represent
approximately 12.2% of Barclays Africa’s issued share capital.

The Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (“PIC”) has confirmed its intention to be an anchor investor
in the Placing for up to 10.3 million shares, representing up to 1.2% of Barclays Africa’s issued share
capital, the maximum permitted without regulatory approvals.

The Placing Shares are being offered to institutional investors by way of an accelerated bookbuild placing,
which is open with immediate effect. Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its investment bank (“Barclays
Investment Bank”) is acting as sole global coordinator and joint bookrunner, together with Citigroup Global
Markets Limited, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking activities as
J.P. Morgan Cazenove) and UBS Limited (the “Managers”) who, together with Barclays Investment Bank,
are acting as joint bookrunners on the Placing (together, the “Joint Bookrunners”).

All of the remaining ordinary shares in Barclays Africa held by Barclays PLC or its subsidiaries (excluding
Barclays Africa and its subsidiaries) not sold in the Placing will be subject to a 90 day lock-up restriction
from settlement. During this period, the lock-up restriction may be waived with the consent of the Managers
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The final number of Placing Shares to be placed and the price per Placing Share will be agreed by Barclays
and the Joint Bookrunners at the close of the bookbuild process, and the results of the Placing will be
announced as soon as practicable thereafter.
                                                                                                 Page 1 of 2
Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays, commented:

“This is an important first step as we seek to reduce our shareholding in Barclays Africa to a level that
achieves accounting and regulatory deconsolidation. As we said at our Q1 results, we continue to explore
opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options. Barclays Africa is
an important partner, and we are working closely with local management, including planning for the
operational separation of the two businesses in a way that will preserve value for shareholders in both the
Barclays and Barclays Africa groups.””

REFERENCE TO BARCLAYS PLC QUARTER 1 2016 RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT

Barclays Africa Group shareholders are advised that Barclays PLC released its first quarter 2016 results
yesterday, a public holiday in South Africa.

Barclays PLC disclosed pound sterling results for an African Banking segment, which includes Barclays
Africa Group and various cost overlays, consolidation and other adjustments. Barclays PLC provided a
view of the performance for the three months ended 31 March 2016, which maintained a number of
operating trends that Barclays Africa Group showed in 2015.

Our revenue momentum continued to improve and growth in the rest of Africa remained well above South
Africa. Net interest income growth reflected a wider margin and high single digit loan growth, while the
weaker rand remained a noticeable feature during the quarter. Our net interest margin increased due to
higher interest rates in several markets, including South Africa. Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB)
loan growth continued to exceed Retail and Business Banking (RBB). Revenue growth remains solid in
target areas, including Retail Banking South Africa, Markets in the rest of Africa, Corporate, Card
acquiring and Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance, particularly outside South Africa.

Pre-provision profit growth remained robust, as our revenue growth exceeded the growth in operating
expenses, which continue to be well managed. This further improved our cost to income ratio.

Although our non-performing loans were flat year to date, our credit loss ratio increased noticeably, due to
higher portfolio provisions and increased impairments in the rest of Africa, CIB and Business Banking
South Africa. Consequently, our first quarter return on equity was marginally below a high base in the first
quarter 2015.

Despite further reducing our economic growth expectations for South Africa and our other markets, we
reiterate our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect low single digit loan growth, with rest of Africa
growing faster than South Africa. Our net interest margin should decline slightly, as a higher proportion of
CIB lending, a reduced contribution from our structural hedging programme and the introduction of lower
National Credit Act caps in May, should offset the endowment benefit of higher interest rates. Our credit
loss ratio is expected to increase, as arrears are rising and we believe NPLs have bottomed. However,
continued focus on growing revenue and managing costs should improve our cost to income ratio further,
and our return on equity is likely to be similar to 2015’s.

The financial information on which this trading update is based has not been reviewed or reported on by
the Group’s auditors.

Barclays PLC’s results announcement also contained the following statement regarding its proposed sell
down of its shareholding in Barclays Africa Group Limited:

“On Africa, we continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding to a level that achieves
regulatory deconsolidation, including capital market and strategic options, and we are pleased with the

BARCLAYS PLC CIRCULAR TO BARCLAYS PLC SHAREHOLDERS REGARDING
PROPOSED SELL DOWN OF BARCLAYS AFRICA GROUP


Barclays Africa Group shareholders are advised that Barclays PLC has posted a circular to
Barclays PLC shareholders relating to the proposed sell down of Barclays PLC's
shareholding in the Barclays Africa Group.

The Barclays PLC Circular is available on the Barclays PLC website hosted at
home.barclays/gm.

An extract from the Barclays PLC RNS statement issued today is set out below:

“On 1 March 2016, as part of a set of strategic initiatives, Barclays PLC (“Barclays”)
announced its intention to sell down its sixty two per cent. shareholding in BAGL over the
next two to three years, to a level which will permit Barclays to de-consolidate BAGL from a
regulatory perspective and, prior to that, from an accounting perspective, subject to
shareholder and regulatory approvals if and as required.

Barclays continues to consider various options, both strategic and capital markets led, to
implement the proposed sell down. As part of this process, and to give Barclays flexibility to
implement capital markets transactions (“On-market Disposals” as described below), prior
approval of shareholders is being sought for any such transactions which would result in the
accounting de-consolidation of BAGL at a General Meeting of Barclays to be held on 28 April
2016 immediately following Barclays’ 2016 Annual General Meeting. Accounting de-
consolidation, which is expected to take place when a transaction results in the Company no
longer having control over BAGL (a “De-consolidating Transaction”), requires Barclays
shareholder approval as a Class 1 transaction under the Listing Rules.

An On-market Disposal may be effected in accordance with the JSE Rules and through any
of the central order book of the JSE Limited equities trading system (where the counterparty
would not be known in advance of the transaction and the price would be determined by
reference to the prevailing market price on that system), a bought deal or, for larger On-
market Disposals, via an accelerated bookbuilt offering. Should Barclays choose to
undertake a disposal of its holding which does not constitute a De-consolidating Transaction,
that disposal would not require shareholder approval.

A circular, containing a notice convening the General Meeting (the “Circular”), has been
posted to shareholders today. Further details of the disposal authority to be sought from
shareholders, together with a brief Barclays trading update (as set out below and as required
by the Listing Rules) are set out in the Circular, which also includes the Board's unanimous
recommendation that shareholders vote in favour of the proposed disposal authority.”

Consistent with our policy on incentive awards to senior employees, each annual incentive award is
deferred as to 60% thereof. Of this deferral amount, 50% is into the Share Value Plan (SVP) and 50% into
the Cash Value Plan (CVP). The individual has a choice to convert all or part of the CVP into SVP.

The number of shares under the 2016 SVP was fixed with reference to the 20-day volume-weighted
average price up to 4 March 2016, being the grant date. This table sets out the deferred incentives which
were awarded into the SVP and granted to the executive directors and company secretary off market.

A third of the shares granted under the 2015 SVP vested on 4 March 2015 and were released to the
participants as a result thereof. The release price was set in reference to the closing market price on the
day before vesting. Sufficient shares were sold on the market by the Barclays Africa Group Employee
Incentive Trust to cover the employee tax obligation (and the Trustee’s withholding obligation). The table

Executive Directors’ 2015 SVP is subject to an additional 6 month holding period and will therefore be

Following the announcement by Barclays Bank PLC earlier today of its intention to reduce its shareholding in

Barclays Bank PLC boards with immediate effect, to ensure that no conflicts of interest exist as a result of her
being a member of these boards as well as the Chairman of the BAGL Board. Wendy’s status will therefore be

BARCLAYS PLC ANNOUNCEMENT ON SHAREHOLDING IN BARCLAYS AFRICA
GROUP AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


Shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcement released at 07h05 (SAST) on
Monday, 29 February 2016. In its results announcement today at approximately 07h00 (BST)
time (09h00 SAST), Barclays PLC made the following statement regarding their shareholding
in BAGL:

“Proposed selldown of BAGL

We are today announcing our intention to sell down our 62.3% interest in our African
business, BAGL, over the coming two to three years, to a level which will permit us to
deconsolidate it from an accounting and regulatory perspective, subject to shareholder and
regulatory approvals if and as required.

BAGL is a well-diversified business and a high quality franchise. However the stake in BAGL
presents specific challenges to Barclays as owners, such as the level of capital held in
respect of BAGL, the international reach of the UK Bank Levy, the GSIB buffer, and
MREL/TLAC and other regulatory requirements. BAGL is today reporting a 17% return on
equity for 2015 in its standalone local currency results versus the 8.7% return reported for
Africa Banking in Barclays’ results.“

The BAGL Board notes that it is clear from this announcement that Barclays PLC is reducing
its shareholding in BAGL due to recently introduced regulatory burdens specific and particular
to Barclays PLC as a UK headquartered and globally significant financial institution. These
regulations significantly decrease BAGL’s standalone returns for Barclays PLC.

We will now actively engage with Barclays PLC and our regulators to ensure that this process
has an appropriate and satisfactory outcome for all our stakeholders.

The cautionary announcement dated 29 February 2016 is hereby withdrawn.

Overview of results
Barclays Africa Group Limited's headline earnings increased 10% to R14 287m from R13 032m. Diluted headline earnings 
per share (""HEPS"") also grew 10% to 1 686 cents from 1 538 cents. The Group's Return on Equity (""RoE"") improved to 
17,0% from 16,7%, comfortably above its 13,75% Cost of Equity (""CoE"") for 2015, due to its return on assets rising 
to 1,37% from 1,33%. Barclays Africa Group declared a 8% higher full year ordinary Dividend per share (""DPS"") of 
1 000 cents, given its strong Common Equity Tier (""CET1"") ratio and internal capital generation capacity. Net 
asset value (""NAV"") per share increased 8% to 10 558 cents.

Pre-provision profit increased 8% to R29.5bn, which drove earnings growth. Non-interest income grew 5% and net
interest income 8%, as the Group's net interest margin (on average interest-bearing assets) improved to 4,81% from 
4,65%. Loans and advances to customers grew 11% to R703bn, while deposits due to customers increased 10% to R688bn. 
The Group's cost-to-income ratio improved to 56,0% from 56,8% as operating expenses rose 5%. Credit impairments grew 
10%, as Non-performing loans (""NPL"") cover rose marginally and portfolio provisions increased to 0,73% of performing 
loans from 0,70%. NPLs declined to 3,9% of gross loans and advances to customers from 4,2%.

Retail and Business Banking (""RBB"") headline earnings increased 14% to R9,7bn, as revenue grew 6% and costs rose 4%, 
with Home Loans and Card earnings growing 15% and 25% respectively. Wealth, Investment Management and Insurance 
(""WIMI"") headline earnings increased 11% to R1,5bn, with 14% growth in Life Insurance, while Corporate Investment Bank
(""CIB"") grew 6% to R3,9bn, including 16% higher Corporate earnings.

Revenue from Rest of Africa grew 14% and headline earnings rose 17% to R2,3bn, to contribute 21% and 16% of the 
total Group respectively.

Operating environment
Global markets saw heightened financial volatility, renewed pressure on commodity prices and concerns about growth. 
We expect global growth of 3,1% in 2015, supported by consumption in advanced economies. Emerging market growth 
slowed largely led by China, Brazil and Russia. The Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time since 2006. 
Conversely, monetary policy was eased in the euro area during the year.
 
South Africa's growth slowed under the pressure of drought, continued electricity supply challenges and falling
commodity prices. Weak consumer confidence and rising interest rates weighed on household spending. Economic 
growth is forecast to have slowed to 1,3% in 2015 from 1,5% in 2014. The rand lost a quarter of its value against major 
currencies during the year.  Growth in the Barclays Africa Group markets in the rest of Africa moderated further 
due to lower commodity prices and an adverse external environment. Fiscal and current accounts deteriorated, 
putting pressure on African currencies and inflation. 

Group performance
Statement of financial position
Total Group assets increased 15% to R1 145bn at 31 December 2015, predominantly due to 11% higher loans and 
advances to customers, while trading portfolio assets grew 52% and loans and advances to banks rose 19%.

Loans and advances to customers
Loans and advances to customers increased 11% to R703bn, or to 7% excluding rand depreciation and growth in reverse 
repurchase agreements. Retail Banking South Africa's loans rose 2% to R375bn, given 6% growth in Vehicle and Asset
Finance (""VAF"")and 8% higher Personal Loans, while Home Loans was flat. Business Banking South Africa's loans rose 4% to 
R64bn, including 15% higher term loans and 9% growth in agriculture loans. RBB Rest of Africa's loans increased 26% 
to R45bn,in part due to rand depreciation. CIB's loans increased 29% to R214bn, given strong growth in term loans, 
preference shares and reverse repurchase agreements.

Funding
The Group maintained its strong liquidity position, growing deposits due to customers 10% to R688bn and improving 
its loans-to-deposit ratio to 86% from 87%. Deposits due to customers contributed 78% to total funding from 80%. 
Retail Banking South Africa maintained its leading market share and increased deposits 10% to R166bn. Business 
Banking South Africa's deposits grew 9% to R110bn, with 19% higher savings and transmission deposits. RBB's 12% 
deposit growth reduced the proportion of more expensive wholesale funding. CIB's deposits increased 6% to R242bn, 
given 10% higher cheque account deposits and 8% lower fixed deposits.

Net asset value
The Group's NAV rose 8% to R89,3bn, as it generated profits of R14,3bn in the period, from which it paid R8,2bn 
in dividends. Its foreign currency translation reserve grew by R3,0bn to R6,5bn. The Group's NAV per share also 
grew 8% to 10 558 cents.

Capital to risk-weighted assets
Group risk-weighted assets (""RWA(s)""?) increased 13% to R703bn at 31 December 2015, in line with its asset growth. 
The Group remains well capitalised, comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements. Barclays Africa Group 
Limited's CET1 and Tier 1 capital adequacy ratios were 11,9% and 12,6% respectively (from 11,9% and 12,7%). The 
Group generated 2,1% of CET1 capital internally during the period. Its total capital adequacy ratio was 14,5%, 
at the top end of the board target range of 12,5% to 14,5%. Declaring an 8% higher DPS of 1 000 cents - a 
dividend cover of 1,7 times - was well considered, based on the Group's strong capital position, internal capital 
generation, strategy and growth plans.

Statement of comprehensive income
Net interest income
Net interest income increased 8% to R38 407m from R35 601m, with average interest-bearing assets growing 4%. The
Group's net interest margin improved to 4,81% from 4,65%.

Loan pricing had an 8 basis points (""bps""?) positive impact, as improved pricing in Home Loans and Personal Loans
offset compression in Vehicle and Asset Finance. The deposit margin was unchanged, as compression in Business 
Banking offset improved retail spreads and the mix benefit of less wholesale funding.
 
Higher South African interest rates resulted in an endowment contribution on deposits and equity of 3 bps. Despite
releasing R1 110m to the income statement, the benefit from structural hedging declined by 6 bps. The cash flow 
hedging reserve relating to the structural hedging programme decreased to a R2,1bn debit after tax from a R0.4bn 
credit. Rest of Africa added 4 bps to the Group margin, as its margin improved by 10 bps and its weighting in the 
overall composition increased. Changing the funding model for foreign currency loans within CIB added 8 bps to the 
total margin, partly offset by higher liquid assets.

Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased 5% to R28 791m from R27 524m accounting for 43% of total income. Rest of Africa 
grew 18% to R4 933m, with strong WIMI and RBB growth, to exceed South Africa's 2% increase to R23 858m. Net fee 
and commission income rose 8% to R20 155m, with strong growth in credit cards and electronic banking of 37% and 
12% respectively, while merchant income decreased 7% to R1 731m due to reduced industry interchange rates.

RBB's non-interest income grew 7% to R18 238m, 63% of the total. Retail Banking South Africa increased 5% to 
R12 282m with 2% growth in customer numbers offsetting continued migration to bundled products and electronic 
channels. Card non-interest income grew 9%, with 14% growth in acquiring volumes, despite new interchange rules 
reducing revenue by R300m. Business Banking's non-interest income grew 5% to R3 336m, largely due to 14% higher 
cheque account income and 10% growth in electronic banking income. Enhanced digital functionality and reclassifying 
cash-handling device-related costs to non-interest income reduced cash-related transaction income growth by 3%, 
while cheque payment volumes fell 21%. RBB Rest of Africa's 21% higher non-interest income of R2 620m reflects 
increased transaction volumes, particularly in card and foreign exchange.

WIMI's non-interest income increased 7% to R4 962m, with improved growth in South Africa of 6% and a 24% rise in 
the Rest of Africa. Net insurance premiums grew 8% and Wealth and Investments by 10% on higher assets under 
management. 
 
CIB's non-interest income decreased 9% to R5 926m, largely due to a change in its funding model for foreign 
currency loans that reduced trading revenue and R202m of negative revaluations in Private Equity. Overall Markets 
net revenue (revenue including credit impairments) decreased 3% to R4 106m with a 23% decline in Fixed Income and 
Credit and 19% lower Foreign Exchange and Commodities revenue in South Africa, offset by 23% and 21% growth in 
Rest of Africa Markets and Equities and Prime Services respectively. 

Impairment losses on loans and advances
Credit impairments increased 10% to R6 920m from R6 290m, resulting in a 1,05% credit loss ratio from 1,02%. Total 
NPL cover improved to 43,2% from 43,0%. Balance sheet portfolio provisions increased 15% to R5,0bn, or 0,73% of 
performing loans from 0,70%. Group NPLs declined to 3,9% of gross customer loans and advances from 4,2% while 
increasing 2,2% to R28,0bn.

RBB's credit impairments grew 1% to R6,1bn, a 1,29% credit loss ratio from 1,32%. Retail Banking South Africa's 
charge declined 2% to R4,8bn, as lower mortgage credit impairments outweighed a 6% rise in VAF.

Home Loans' charge decreased 20% to R689m, a 0,30% credit loss ratio, given improved collections processes and the
high quality of new business written in recent years. Mortgage NPLs fell 11% to R9,3bn, 4,0% of gross loans. NPL 
cover in mortgages decreased to 22,1% from 25,3%, as aged NPLs were written off. VAF's credit loss ratio improved 
to 0,98% from 1,01%. Instalment credit agreements NPLs increased to 2,2% of gross loans and its NPL cover declined 
to 38,8%, due to accelerating write-offs of aged legal accounts, which reduced the NPL book's average age.

Credit card's charge increased 4% to R2 344m, a 6,07% credit loss ratio from 6,19%. The Edcon portfolio's charge
declined 15% to R893m, a 10,18% credit loss ratio. The credit loss ratio for the remainder of the Card book 
increased 20% to R1 451m, reflecting the operating environment and seasoning of recent growth. Personal Loans' 
credit loss ratio improved to 5,64% from 6,06% reflecting lending to lower risk existing customers and enhanced 
collections.

Business Banking South Africa's credit impairments grew 4% to R548m, a flat 0,87% credit loss ratio. A 70% lower
charge for Commercial Property Finance (""CPF"") and mortgages was the driver, while term loan impairments 
increased significantly. NPLs fell 16% to R3 306m or 5,1% of gross loans. Performing loan cover increased further 
to 1,07%. RBB Rest of Africa's credit impairments rose 21% to R777m, increasing its credit loss ratio to 2,07% 
from 1,95%. Its NPLs increased 9% to R3 573m, while performing loan cover increased to 1,12% from 0,95%. CIB's 
credit impairments increased 220% off a low base to R793m, reflecting maturation of its loan growth and 
deterioration in some sectors. NPLs rose 72% to R2 834m, while portfolio provisions increased to 0,36% of 
performing loans.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses grew 5% to R37 661m from R35 848m. South Africa's 4% cost growth was below inflation, while 
Rest of Africa costs rose 9%, reflecting continued investment spend. Staff costs rose 8% to R20 902m to account 
for 56% of total expenses. Salaries grew 8% due to higher wage increases for entry level employees and hiring in 
specialist areas such as Information Technology (""IT""). Incentives rose 5%, as bonuses rose 11% and share-based 
payments fell 8%. 

Non-staff costs grew 1,5% to R16 759m, as structural cost programmes produced efficiency gains that enabled 
continued investment in growth initiatives. Property-related costs decreased 1% to R5 209m, reflecting portfolio 
optimisation and lower dilapidation costs. Total IT-related costs increased 7% to R6 675m, 18% of overall costs. 
Depreciation declined 3% and amortisation of intangible assets decreased 6% due to impairments recognised in 2014. 
Marketing costs grew 8% to R1 740m, given increased product advertising. Professional fees increased 18% reflecting 
strategic growth projects. Barclays Bank PLC spent approximately GBP30m on IT in the rest of Africa, which will 
continue for another two years. Other costs fell 18%, largely due to reduced fraud losses. 

RBB and WIMI's operating expenses increased 4% to R28 168m and 4% to R3 018m respectively. Retail Banking South
Africa's operating expenses grew 3%, driven by operational efficiencies and managing discretionary costs. Despite 
investing in relationship managers and systems, Business Banking South Africa's cost growth was contained to 4%. 
RBB Rest of Africa's operating expenses grew 7% despite strategic investments and inflationary pressures. CIB's 
cost grew 9% to R7 436m, reflecting higher IT spend.

Taxation
The Group's taxation expense increased 6% to R5 899m, slightly less than the 8% growth in pre-tax profit, 
resulting in a 27,7% effective tax rate from 28,3%. The decline was largely due to reducing expenses that were

Prospects
While the risks of a global recession have abated, a meaningful acceleration in growth is unlikely. We forecast 3,3%
global growth in 2016, but the outlook remains fragile, with risks tilted to the downside. Global monetary policy is
expected to diverge, with tightening in the US while the euro area and China will continue to ease. In South Africa, 
weak confidence points to low investment and consumption spending in 2016. Inflation is expected to rise sharply, 
averaging 6,4% due to food inflation and a weaker rand. We forecast a further 75bps of interest rate increases this 
year and expect GDP growth to slow to 0,9%. Key risks facing South Africa include continued electricity supply 
disruptions and a potential credit ratings downgrade. Africa's medium-term outlook remains challenging given global 
and domestic factors. Overall, we expect economic growth of 5,1% in our presence countries in the rest of Africa.

Against this backdrop, we expect low single digit loan growth, with rest of Africa growing faster than South Africa.
The Group's net interest margin should decline slightly as a higher proportion of CIB lending, a lower contribution 
from our hedging programme and introducing the National Credit Act caps in May 2016, offset the endowment benefit of 
higher interest rates. The credit loss ratio is expected to increase, as arrears are rising and we believe NPLs have 
bottomed. However, continued focus on revenue growth and cost management should improve the Group's cost-to-income 
ratio further. The balance sheet is well positioned for a potential deteriorating economic environment given its 
high level of portfolio provisions and low NPLs, as well as strong capital ratios and liquidity.

Note
(1) All movements are reflected net of taxation. 
    The movement during the current reporting period is largely due to the elimination of treasury shares
    in the share incentive trust. Thes shares were acquired by the trust as part of the conversion of the
    cash settled share based payment schemes to the equity settled share based payment schemes.
(2) During the current reporting period the Group acquired a 63% shareholding in First Assurance Holdings
    Limited.
(3) The Group disposed of part of its interest in National Bank of Commerce (""NBC"") reducing its interest
    from 66% to 55%.

Summary notes to the consolidated financial results
for the reporting period ended 31 December
1. Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held for sale
The following movements in non-current assets held for sale were effected during the current financial reporting
period:
- CIB transferred investment securities with a carrying value of R 1 282m.
- Disposals of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale occurred in RBB (including Commercial Property
  Finance (""CPF"")). The profit on disposal of the non-current assets held for sale has been recognised in other 
  operating income in the statement of comprehensive income.
- Other assets and liabilities disclosed remain classified as non-current assets held for sale as the Group has
  assessed that the sales remain highly probable.
The following movements in non-current assets held for sale were effected during the previous financial reporting
period:
- RBB transferred investment securities with a carrying value of R29m.
- The Head Office and other operations segment transferred property and equipment with a carrying value of R3m.
- RBB transferred investment properties with a carrying value of R376m.
- The CPF Equity division in RBB disposed of a non-core subsidiary with investment property with a carrying value 
  of R1 315m. Other disposals of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale occurred in the RBB, WIMI and 
  Head Office and other operations segments.
- The General Fund was amalgamated with the Absa Select Equity Fund and WIMI, and therefore ceased to exist as an
  independent fund. This resulted in the derecognition of the related financial assets of R2 324m and liabilities 
  of R973m of the Absa General Fund, previously classified as non- current assets and liabilities held for sale 
  in the 2013 financial reporting period.
  

2. Borrowed funds
During the reporting period the significant movements in borrowed funds were as follows: R4 870m (2014: R531m) of
subordinated notes were issued and R2 455m (2014: R4 966m) were redeemed.

6. Acquisitions and disposals of businesses
6.1 Acquisitions of businesses during the current reporting period
The Group recently acquired 63% of the issued ordinary share capital of First Assurance Company Limited (""FACL""), an
East African insurer, with operations in both Kenya and Tanzania. The acquisition of the investment in FACL had an
effective acquisition date of 30 October 2015, and is a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3.
 
The non-controlling interest mentioned below was measured at its proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable
net assets. Goodwill of R164m has been recognised mainly due to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate
recognition.

The transaction is currently under Purchase Price Allocation (""PPA"") consideration as the due diligence is currently
under way to finalise the contractual net asset value (""NAV"") and to agree the final NAV between purchaser and seller.
The initial accounting considerations include the valuation of intangible assets (identified in terms of IFRS 3 - i.e.
Brand Names and Distribution Force), Premium debtors, Investment Properties and the Valuation of Policyholder 
liabilities. From the date of acquisition, FACL contributed R9m to profit after tax of the Group. If the combination 
had taken place at the beginning of the year, profit after tax for the Group would have increased by R37m.

The Group also purchased additional shares in a non-core joint venture which resulted in an increase in the Group's
effective shareholding from 50% to 67%. The profit share that the Group is entitled to is 74%. The acquisition 
occurred on 18 November 2015. A Bargain Purchase amount of R4m was recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income.

6.1.2 Disposals of businesses during the current reporting period
National Bank of Commerce Limited (""NBC"") was recapitalised through a rights issue to all its shareholders during
2013. As the Government of Tanzania (""GoT"") did not wish to subscribe to its rights at the time, an option was 
granted to GoT providing it with the right to purchase its pro rata portion of the shares from the Group within a 
period of two years after the rights issue. The GoT exercised its option during the reporting period which 
resulted in a decrease of the Group's shareholding from 66% to 55%.

determined with reference to the respective underwriter's proportion of total Tier 1 capital of the

Guarantees include performance and payment guarantee contracts.

Irrevocable facilities are commitments to extend credit where the Group does not have the right 
to terminate the facilities by written notice. Commitments generally have fixed expiry dates. 
Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total contract amounts do not 
necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Legal proceedings
The Group is engaged in various litigation proceedings involving claims by and against it, which 
arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of any 
proceedings, to which the Group is party, to have a significant adverse effect on the financial 
statements of the Group. Provision is made for all liabilities which are expected to materialise.

Regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging and the global financial crisis is resulting in 
a significant tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally, especially 
for companies that are deemed to be of systemic importance. Concurrently, there is continuing 
political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking and consumer credit industries 
globally which, in some cases, is leading to increased regulation. The nature and impact of future 
changes in the legal framework, policies and regulatory action cannot currently be fully predicted 
and are beyond the Group's control, but especially in the area of banking and insurance regulation, 
are likely to have an impact on the Group's businesses and earnings. The Group is continuously 
evaluating its compliance programmes and controls in general. As a consequence of these compliance 
programmes and controls, including monitoring and review activities, the Group has also adopted 
appropriate remedial and/or mitigating steps, where necessary or advisable, and made disclosures 
on material findings as and when appropriate.

Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group's tax 
charge and worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and 
judgement. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain 
or in respect of which the relevant tax authorities may have indicated disagreement with the Group's 
treatment and accordingly the final tax charge cannot be determined until resolution has been reached 
with the relevant tax authority. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account expert external 
advice where appropriate. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities in the reporting period in which such determination is made. These risks are managed 
in accordance with the Group's Tax Risk Framework.

Notes
(1) Operational changes, management changes and associated changes to the way in which the Chief Operation Decision
    Maker (""CODM""?) views the performance of each business segment, have resulted in the reallocation of earnings, 
    assets and liabilities between operating segments. For details on business portfolio changes, refer to note 1.21
    of the audited annual consolidated and separate financial statements approved on 29 February 2016.

13. Assets and liabilities held at fair value
13.1 Fair value measurement and valuation processes
Financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The framework includes
a Valuation Committee and an Independent Valuation Control team (""IVC""), which is independent from the front office.

The Valuation Committee, which comprises representatives from senior management, will formally approve valuation
policies and any changes to valuation methodologies. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Barclays Africa 
Group Audit and Compliance Committee.

The Valuation Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation control process and will therefore consider the
appropriateness of valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement.

The IVC independently verifies the results of trading and investment operations and all significant fair value
measurements. They source independent data from external independent parties, as well as internal risk areas when 
performing independent price verification for all financial instruments held at fair value. They also assess and 
document the inputs obtained from external independent sources to measure the fair value which supports conclusions 
that valuations are performed in accordance with IFRS and internal valuation policies.

Investment properties
The fair value of investment properties is determined based on the most appropriate methodology applicable to the
specific property. Methodologies include the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for 
similar properties, discounted cash flows and income capitalisation methodologies. In estimating the fair value of 
the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is taken into account.

Where possible the fair value of the Group's investment properties is determined through valuations performed by
external independent valuators. When the Group's internal valuations are different to that of the external 
independent valuers, detailed procedures are performed to substantiate the differences, whereby the IVC verifies 
the procedures performed by the front office and considers the appropriateness of any differences to external 
independent valuations. 
 
13.2 Fair value measurements
Valuation inputs
IFRS 13 requires an entity to classify fair values measured and/or disclosed according to a hierarchy that reflects
the significance of observable market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows.

Quoted market prices - Level 1
Fair values are classified as Level 1 if they have been determined using observable prices in an active market. Such
fair values are determined with reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and 
frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2
Fair values classified as Level 2 have been determined using models for which inputs are observable in an active
market.

A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, 
or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. 

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3
Fair values are classified as Level 3 if their determination incorporates significant inputs that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs). An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 
10% to the fair value of an item. Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of 
a similar nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.

Judgemental inputs on valuation of principal instruments
The following summary sets out the principal instruments whose valuation may involve judgemental inputs:

Debt securities and treasury and other eligible bills
These instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices 
for similar instruments or, in the case of certain mortgage-backed securities, valuation techniques using inputs 
derived from  observable market data, and, where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Equity instruments
Equity instruments are valued, based on quoted market prices from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group or
pricing service, where available. Where unavailable, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices 
for similar instruments or by using valuation techniques using inputs derived from observable market data, and, 
where relevant, assumptions in respect of unobservable inputs.

Also included in equity instruments are non-public investments, which include investments in venture capital
organisations. The fair value of these investments is determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which, 
dependent on the nature of the investment, may include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons 
with similar companies and price:earnings comparisons. For each investment, the relevant methodology is applied 
consistently over time.

Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or traded over the counter (""OTC""?) derivatives. OTC derivative contracts
include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit spreads, 
equity prices and commodity prices or indices on these instruments. Fair values of derivatives are obtained from 
quoted market prices, dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow and option pricing models.

Loans and advances
The disclosed fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers is determined by discounting contractual 
cash flows. Discount factors are determined using the relevant forward base rates (as at valuation date) plus the 
originally priced spread. Where a significant change in credit risk has occurred, an updated spread is used to 
reflect valuation date pricing. Behavioural cash flow profiles, instead of contractual cash flow profiles, are 
used to determine expected cash flows where contractual cash flow profiles would provide an inaccurate fair value.

Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds
Deposits, debt securities in issue and borrowed funds are valued using discounted cash flow models, applying rates
currently offered for issuances with similar characteristics. Where these instruments include embedded derivatives, 
the embedded derivative component is valued using the methodology for derivatives.

The fair value of amortised cost deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value. 
For other financial liabilities at amortised cost the disclosed fair value approximates the carrying value because 
the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.

13.3 Fair value adjustments
The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described as follows:
Bid-offer valuation adjustments
For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid-prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices
respectively unless the relevant mid- prices are reflective of the appropriate exit price as a practical expedient 
given the nature of the underlying instruments. Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for 
derivatives, the fact that they are managed on a portfolio basis. The methodology for determining the bid-offer 
adjustment for a derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the 
bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy. Bid-offer levels are derived from market 
sources, such as broker data. For those assets and liabilities where the Group is a market maker and has the ability 
to transact at, or better than, mid-price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets), 
the mid-price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost.

Uncollateralised derivative adjustments
A fair value adjustment is incorporated into uncollateralised derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair
value of counterparty credit risk, as well as the cost of funding across all asset classes.

Model valuation adjustments
Valuation models are reviewed under the Group's model governance framework. This process identifies the assumptions
used and any model limitations (for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew). Where necessary, 
fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account. Model valuation adjustments are dependent 
on the size of the portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it 
incorporates all known risk factors. All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least 
an annual basis.

13.4 Fair value hierarchy
The following table shows the Group's assets and liabilities that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair
value and are analysed by valuation techniques. The classification of assets and liabilities is based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

13.6.1 Significant transfers between levels
During the prior reporting period, it was determined that significant transfers between levels of the assets and
liabilities held at fair value occurred. Treasury bills of R18,5bn were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2, as these are
held in an inactive market.

Transfers out of Level 3 and into Level 2 arise where unobservable inputs become observable and/or unobservable inputs
are no longer considered to be significant to the valuation of an instrument.
 
Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

13.8 Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs
As part of the Group's risk management processes, stress tests are applied on the significant unobservable parameters
to generate a range of potentially possible alternative valuations. The assets and liabilities that impact this
sensitivity analysis most are those with the more illiquid and/or structured portfolios. The stresses are applied 
independently and do not take account of any-cross correlation between separate asset classes that would reduce the 
overall effect on the valuations.

The following table reflects how the unobservable parameters were changed in order to evaluate the sensitivities of
Level 3 financial assets and liabilities:

A significant parameter has been deemed to be one which may result in a charge to the profit or loss, or a change in
the fair value asset or liability of more than 10% or the underlying value of the affected item. This is demonstrated 
by the following sensitivity analysis which includes a reasonable range of possible outcomes:

For assets or liabilities held at amortised cost and disclosed in levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the
discounted cash flow valuation technique is used. Interest rates and money market curves are considered unobservable inputs
for items which mature after five years. However, if the items mature in less than five years, these inputs are
considered observable.

For debt securities in issue held at amortised cost, a further significant input would be the underlying price of the
market traded instrument.

The sensitivity of the fair value measure is dependent on the unobservable inputs. Significant changes to the
unobservable inputs in isolation will have either a positive or negative impact on fair values.
                                 
13.10 Unrecognised gains/(losses) as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income that relates to the difference between 
the transaction price and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on 
initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is as follows:

14. Reporting changes overview 
Reclassification changes
In terms of the Group's policy, financial assets with a maturity of less than three months should be reported as""Cash, 
cash balances and balances with central bank""?, while financial assets with a maturity of longer than three months are 
reported as ""Investment securities""?. Based on an analysis performed on the maturity periods of treasury bills, in the 
Rest of Africa, it was established that some treasury bills' maturity period extended beyond three months and had been 
reported as ""Cash, cash balances and balances with central banks""?. These items are now being reported as ""Investment 
securities"".

The impact of these changes on the statement of financial position is as follows:

“Barclays PLC notes the recent press speculation regarding a potential sale of its
shareholding in Barclays Africa Group Limited (“BAGL”). The Board continues to evaluate its
strategic options in relation to its BAGL shareholding and expects to update the market at the
time of its 2015 Full Year Results Announcement on 1 March 2016.” (end of quote)

  CONVERSION OF PHANTOM SHARE VALUE PLAN (SVP) AWARDS INTO EQUITY SHARE PLAN

  The following information is provided in accordance with paragraph 3.63 of the JSE Listings
  Requirements.

  Eligible employees of Barclays Africa Group were historically granted phantom Share Value Plan
  (SVP) awards which tracked the share price but were delivered as cash, however following
  approval of the SVP at the AGM on 19 May 2015, awards are now delivered in equity. Employees
  with unvested phantom awards were offered the opportunity to surrender the awards in place
  of equity shares through the SVP to simplify the administration of shares.

  The executive directors elected to take up this opportunity on 14 December 2015 and the
  replacement equity awards granted to them off market are accordingly set out in the table
  below. The replacement equity awards will take effect from 21 December 2015.

  This does not constitute a new award. The number of shares is fixed based on the number of
  unvested phantom awards using the initial grant price, save that the number of shares has been
  grossed up to include brokerage fees.
