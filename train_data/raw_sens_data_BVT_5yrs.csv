Introduction   
This financial year has been unprecedented. Never has the world, our country, Group and our 
people been tested to such an extent. But the true Bidvest spirit shone through. Numerous 
cost containment, liquidity preservation and strategic steps were implemented in rapid 
response to considerable demand changes. Various wellness and support interventions were 
rolled out to assist our employees and communities as their livelihoods were severely 
impacted. At the same time, innovation within our businesses ramped up to continue to add 
value to our customers. The Bidvest family is proud of what has been achieved, providing a 
solid platform to ensure that we are capable of #EmergingStronger. 

The Group implemented various measures to lessen the impact of COVID-19 infections on its 
employees, communities and operations. Prevention and treatment interventions were 
rolled-out across the Group to manage health, safety and recovery during this time. Our 
sincerest condolences go to the families, friends and colleagues of the 35 Bidvest employees 
that sadly succumbed to the COVID-19 virus. 

Highlights 
The Group delivered a credible financial performance during the financial year which ended 
on 30 June 2020, considering the already significantly constrained South African economy 
pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic's impact on the last quarter. Post the complete national 
lockdown in April, monthly trading results have progressively improved. 

At the onset of the lockdown, Bidvest proactively bolstered its liquidity position by securing 
R4.5 billion additional general credit facilities with South African banks, taking committed 
general banking facilities to a total of R11.6 billion. An intensified focus on cash generation 
and working capital management, together with rapid and decisive cost containment 
measures, resulted in R2.5 billion more cash generated from operations to total R9.2 billion. 
As a consequence, the Group had no need to access the additional credit facilities secured, a 
truly remarkable result and testament to Bidvest's long-standing cash generation focus. 

The acquisition of PHS Group (PHS), a leading hygiene service provider in the United Kingdom 
(UK), Ireland and Spain, for GBP495 million was concluded and funded with a GBP-denominated 
bridge facility. Despite adding this significant amount of debt on the balance 
sheet, the net debt/ EBITDA remained well within the Group's gearing tolerance.

Exceptional cost discipline and improved gross profit margin were highlights in a very 
challenging year. Trading profit declined 19.9% after taking account of R1.6 billion in 
COVID-19 related charges. Almost two-thirds of profit originated from the services businesses, 
comprising the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, and provided a defensive 
underpin. 

Bidvest family 
An imperative during this crisis is to protect and provide for the safety, health and well-being 
of employees who are, collectively, the backbone of our businesses. 

Bidvest established a R400 million Bidvest COVID-19 Fund (""Fund""), to assist our South African 
employees not working due to the lockdown restrictions. The 30% salary and fee sacrifice by 
the executive management team and board members respectively, during the last quarter, 
was added to the Fund. Various other employee and family support initiatives, such as a 
Groupwide comprehensive employee wellness support programme, COVID-19 testing and 
bursary extensions for children of those retrenched were rolled out. 

Applications to the UIF on behalf of our employees for the COVID-19 TERS benefit were made 
and are ongoing. Furlough support programmes by the governments of the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland are comprehensive in supporting the livelihoods of our employees in these 
countries. 

During the most stringent lockdown periods, approximately 75,000 of our employees were 
not working. Today, 91% of our employees are back at work.

Bidvest is also contributing to the social needs of the broader stakeholder community in the 
country, including a donation to the Solidarity Fund, a donation of PPE, cleaning and hygiene 
products and decontamination services to 2 800 schools as part of a nationwide school 
readiness project. 

In addition, we sponsored the launch of the Woza Matric of 2020 campaign, a free-to-air 
television initiative aimed at grade 12 learners, in partnership with the SABC and 
Department of Education. We are also in the process of distributing food hampers in low-
income communities across three provinces, to reach a total of 20 000 households once the 
project is completed.

*  Normalised headline earnings, which excludes acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts,
   fair value uplift of Adcock's inventory, includes an adjustment for Bidvest's share of Comair's SAA impairment 
   and COIVD-19 pandemic charges, is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business performance 
   of the continuing operations. 
** Normalised HEPS is normalised headline earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. 
 
Revenue from continuing operations was R76.5 billion (2019: R76.1 billion). On a comparable 
basis, the impact of the national lockdown on trading was broadly neutralised by the maiden 
consolidation of Adcock Ingram (""Adcock"") and two months of PHS.  

Gross profit margin improved from 29.6% to 30.6%. Operating expenses increased by 9.6%. 
Cost containment received extra attention, particularly at the onset of the pandemic. 
Excluding the impact of material acquisitions, IFRS 16 and COVID-19 related expenses, as a 
direct result of actions taken, expenses declined by 6.3%.

Services delivered a good overall result, with an excellent performance from Noonan while 
the SA profitability was negatively impacted by no travel- and hospitality-related activity in 
the last quarter. Freight delivered a resilient result on lower trade activity through South 
Africa's ports. Branded Products' result was a combination of a solid Adcock performance 
while the balance of the division bore the brunt of lower demand and trade restrictions during 
lockdown. The results from Commercial Products and Automotive mirrored the latter. In 
Financial Services the negative impact of a complete drop-off of foreign exchange demand in 
the last quarter and fleet contracts rolling off, more than outweighed higher investment 
income. 

Acquisition costs of R178.2 million relate mainly to the acquisition of PHS and other corporate 
actions. 

Net capital items of R2.0 billion were recognised, R1.1 billion of which is attributed directly to 
COVID-19. Property, plant and equipment as well as goodwill and intangible assets of certain 
Brandcorp businesses and automotive dealerships in SA and Namibia, amongst others, were 
impaired by R1.0 billion as a result of lower forecast cash flows impacted by COVID-19, the 
expected slowdown in economic activity as well as higher discount rates. The losses 
recognised on the closure and disposal of Glenryck, Mansfield Group, Bidvest Wits and others 
totalled R247.2 million. Net negative adjustments of R485.7 million were made to the 
investment values of Adcock and Comair prior to the former becoming a subsidiary and the 
latter being put into business rescue. The balance of the charge relates to the insurance 
receipts on damaged Freight equipment. 

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, net finance charges were 7.4% higher at R993.3 million 
(2019: R924.6 million). Additional borrowings were raised to fund acquisitions. Despite the higher 
commitment fees and spreads over base rates, the decrease in interest rates and addition of 
cheaper offshore funding, lowered the Group's average cost of debt to 5.7% pre-tax (2019: 6.7%). 

Share of losses from associates resulted from the operating losses incurred by Comair prior 
to going into business rescue as well as the impairment of the full outstanding SAA settlement. 
Adcock was accounted for as an associate for only one month compared to a full year 
previously. 

The Group's taxation expense decreased by 40.5% to R851.6 million (2019: R1.4 billion). The 
effective tax rate of 65.7% (2019: 27.1%) was impacted by non-tax deductible associate, 
goodwill and Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) impairments, losses on disposal of 
businesses, no deferred tax assets raised on closed operations Bidair Services, Commuter 
Handling Services and Voltex Namibia and other items. 

Normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) from continuing operations, a metric utilised 
by management to assess the underlying business performance excluding acquisition costs 
and amortisation of acquired customer contracts, fair value uplift of Adcock's inventory, 
Bidvest's share of Comair's full impairment of the outstanding SAA settlement as well as 
COVID-19 expenses, declined by 22.9%. 

Bidvest's HEPS from continuing operations decreased by 59.5% to 553.2 cents per share. Basic 
earnings per share from continuing operations decreased from 1 133.8 cents to 49.8 cents 
mainly due to impairments, business closures and disposals together with the contraction in 
the share prices of associates. 

Bidvest net debt increased from R7.8 billion to R19.2 billion, largely due to the acquisition of 
PHS for GBP495 million, effective 1 May 2020. Strong free cash flow generation resulted in 
Bidvest remaining within bank covenants of 3.0x net debt / EBITDA and greater than 3.5x 
interest cover, despite the disproportionate amount of debt versus EBITDA added and the 
lost trading in the fourth quarter. Net debt / EBITDA was 2.1x (2019: 0.9x). 

The PHS acquisition is funded with a GBP-denominated bridge facility, repayable in December 
2021. Following the downgrade of South Africa to junk status, and the resultant impact on 
the Bidvest credit rating, as well as the deterioration in the country's macroeconomic 
position, indicative credit spreads have widened considerably. This makes the initial decision 
to replace the bridge facility with a foreign-denominated bond less viable. The geographic mix 
of debt is also misaligned relative to trading profit. Management therefore embarked on a 
process to review the capital structure and evaluate all alternatives. As a consequence, the 
following steps have been taken to date to part-settle the bridge funding: R4.0 billion debt is 
in the process of being raised from local banks and offshore cash of R2.5 billion has been 
earmarked. Expected proceeds from the MIAL disposal and normal free cash generation in 
the business, will go a long way in settling the bridge funding. Further steps are being 
contemplated. 

Total assets increased by 46.6% to R90.9 billion as Adcock and PHS was consolidated and 
right-of-use assets recognised under IFRS 16. The acquisition of PHS brought about R11.7 
billion of goodwill which represent long-standing customer contracts and a leading brand, 
from which Bidvest expects to derive significant future value. NAV is R68.16 per share 
(2019: R75.71). 
 
Cash generated by operations at R9.2 billion, was 38.2% higher than the R6.6 billion generated 
in the prior year. This is boosted by the adoption of IFRS 16 (positive R1.5 billion impact). The 
Group released R0.9 billion of working capital in the current year compared to an absorption 
of R1.3 billion in the prior year. The main impact, year-on-year, was from lower trade 
receivables on the back of lower activity levels. Free cash flow after leases increased by 
R1.4 billion to R3.7 billion. 

Normalised return on funds employed (ROFE), which excludes COVID-19 charges, declined 
marginally from 23.2% to 23.0% as asset management remains a core focus, particularly in 
these challenging times. ROIC was 12.9% (2019: 18.4%) which is still in excess of the 
Group's weighted cost of capital. 

Corporate action 
The acquisition of PHS became effective on 1 May 2020. PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 
and today service more than 120,000 customers. More than half its customers have 
long-standing relationship with PHS. Advance billings and high retention rates result in 
significant revenue visibility and attractive operational cash conversion. During the due 
diligence, management identified five areas of synergy and cost saving to achieve an improved 
margin, which is more in line with industry peers. Work has started to bring this into effect. 

The hygiene market is increasingly resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers 
such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging 
population, to name a few. The global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly 
heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene. This is expected to 
accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally. 

As previously reported, the R3.2 billion Eqstra transaction was terminated. Three bolt-on 
acquisitions were concluded in Services, the most notable being Future Cleaning which 
augmented the footprint of Noonan's UK operations. 

Following a detailed strategic review of all Bidvest businesses, a decision was taken to divest 
of Bidvest Car Rental and Bidair Services. Formal disposal processes were kicked off and have 
progressed since year-end. Our preference is to sell the businesses in order to preserve as 
many jobs as possible. Bidvest Car Rental was disclosed as a discontinued operation.

The disposal of our stake in MIAL has been extremely frustrating and embroiled in litigation. 
A reduced offer was accepted given the deteriorated financial position of the airport as a 
result of the pandemic. Parties have agreed to cooperate in order to expedite the execution 
of the transaction.  

Dividend 
In light of the extraordinary levels of uncertainty as it relates to the economies and 
environments in which we operate and the restructuring actions taken, the board believes 
that the decision to not declared a final dividend balances the interests of all stakeholders. 
This leaves the total dividend for the year at 282 cents per share, 53% lower year on year. 

Prospects 
Bidvest recognises that the pandemic will result in socio-economic shifts and consequently 
long-term structural changes to the economy and business in general. In the recent weeks, 
Bidvest right-sized operations to make sure that our operating models remain relevant and 
future-fit, reinforce competitive positions, and ensure that the businesses have sufficient 
scale for growth. This unfortunately led to retrenchments across all six divisions. 

Industries that are under incremental pressure include travel and tourism related activities, 
while out-of-home hygiene offers good structural growth opportunities. Affected Bidvest 
businesses have taken account of this in their planning. 

Overall, we expect the uncertain and fragile operating environment to persist. Bidvest's 
basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges should stand it in good stead, 
especially when coupled with an innovative, value-adding mindset. In recent weeks, we have noted 
anecdotal market share gains across many of our Commercial Products businesses as we have 
stock available to trade. Our flagship liquid petroleum gas (LPG) storage project is expected 
to be commissioned during September 2020. The acquisition of PHS leapfrogged our hygiene 
exposure and this will be leveraged going forward. 

South Africa's need for real GDP growth to create employment and prosperity for all, is 
undeniable. Bidvest is actively participating in workstreams incorporating labour, government 
and private sector to achieve this.

Bidvest will continue to invest strategically to generate sustainable profits for the long term. 
The Group remains alert to opportunities both locally and internationally to further its 
strategy to expand into niche areas but will remain steadfast in our capital allocation 
disciplines. 

Bidvest is well positioned to participate in pockets of activity and opportunities. Disciplined 
asset management, cost control and an agile business approach should yield good results. We 
remain confident in our overall resilience and ability to deliver consistent, sustainable growth 
over the long-term.

THE BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED
(“Bidvest” or “The Group”)
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
(Registration number 1946/021180/06)
JSE Share code: BVT
ISIN: ZAE000117321

TRADING STATEMENT

The Group delivered a credible trading profit performance during the financial year which ended on
30 June 2020, considering the already significantly constrained South African economy pre-COVID-19 and the
pandemic’s impact on the last quarter. Post the complete national lockdown in April, monthly trading results
have progressively improved.

At the onset of the national lockdown, Bidvest proactively bolstered its liquidity position by securing
R4.5 billion additional general banking facilities with South African banks, taking committed facilities to a total
of R11.6 billion. An intensified focus on cash generation and working capital management, together with rapid
and decisive cost containment measures, resulted in strong operational cash flow. As a consequence, the
Group had no need to access the additional credit facilities secured.

As indicated previously, the acquisition of PHS utilised a meaningful portion of the financial headroom that
existed on the Group’s balance sheet. Strong free cash flow generation resulted in Bidvest remaining within
bank covenants of 3.0x net debt / EBITDA and greater than 3.5x interest cover, despite the disproportionate
amount of debt versus EBITDA added and the lost trading in the fourth quarter.
Updated guidance

In accordance with Section 3.4(b) (i) of the JSE Listings Requirements, listed companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.
Since the trading update issued on 1 June 2020, Bidvest took the decisions to divest of Bidvest Car Rental and
Bidair Services. The former will be disclosed as a discontinued operation. Impairments totalling R1.0 billion were
also recognised as a result of lower forecast cash flows impacted by COVID-19, the expected slowdown in
economic activity as well as higher discount rates.
The Group incurred R1.6 billion of COVID-19 charges including higher trade receivables and inventory provisions
made, additional costs incurred to comply with health and safety protocols, the R400 million Bidvest COVID-19
Fund, a reduced offer accepted for our stake in the Mumbai International Airport Limited and once-off
restructuring charges resulting from a strategic business review. The Group reviewed all Bidvest businesses and
right-sized operations to make sure that the operating models remain relevant and future-fit.
As in the past, the Group will present normalised headline earnings. The impact of COVID-19 will be excluded
in addition to the acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts and adjustment for Bidvest’s
share of Comair’s SAA impairment. This is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business
performance of the continuing operations.

Shareholders are advised that:
-   Normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) is expected to be 22% to 24% lower compared to the prior
    year (FY19: 1 334 cents), translating into normalised HEPS of between 1 014 cents and 1 040 cents.
-   HEPS from continuing operations, which includes Comair’s operating loss and the impairment of its SAA
    settlement claim totalling R201 million, a fair value adjustment to Adcock Ingram’s inventory in terms of
    IFRS 3 as well as the COVID-19 charges, is expected to be between 59% and 61% lower than the prior year
    (FY19: 1 366 cents), translating into a range of between 533 cents and 560 cents.
-   Group HEPS is expected to be between 70% and 72% lower compared to the prior year (FY19: 1 352 cents),
    translating into a range of between 379 cents and 406 cents. The operational losses recognised for the
    discontinued Bidvest Car Rental negatively impacted Group HEPS.
-   Basic earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations is expected to be between 95% and 97% lower
    than the 1 134 cents reported in FY19, translating into a range of 34 cents and 57 cents EPS. This is the result
    of the items described under HEPS as well as the R218 million negative Adcock Ingram remeasurement
    impact, the R241 million capital impairment recognised for Comair and R1.2 billion in capital impairments
    and business disposals.
-   Group EPS is expected to be more than a 100% lower, translating into an EPS loss of between 130 cents and
    150 cents, when compared to the previous year profit of 1 119 cents. The operational losses and
    impairments recognised for the discontinued Bidvest Car Rental negatively impacted Group EPS.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the Group’s auditors. The Group expects its results to 30 June 2020 to be released on SENS on
14 September 2020.

BIDVEST TRADING UPDATE FOR THE TEN MONTHS TO 30 APRIL 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT

Bidvest shareholders were informed at the time of the release of the Group’s interim results (2 March 2020),
that trading conditions were challenging due to low business confidence in South Africa, constrained consumer
demand and an overall weak economic environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the economic and social environment becoming more demanding and
uncertain, and has created significant operational disruptions, both on the demand and supply side of our
economy. The impact on Bidvest’s trading businesses is significant and the services businesses are also being
disrupted.

In response to the crisis, South Africa was placed under a complete national lockdown between 27 March 2020
and 30 April 2020 (“Lockdown”) to adequately prepare medical and healthcare facilities, and reduce the
spread of the virus. The Lockdown was subsequently extended as part of a risk adjusted, phased approach for
a responsible return to economic activity. We support government’s focus on reducing the spread of the
pandemic and flattening the curve, however the impact of the Lockdown has resulted in the closure of many
South African businesses and placed many others in distressed situations.
Partial lockdown arrangements in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland also resulted in reduced
activity.

Considering the South African economy was already significantly constrained pre-COVID-19, and remembering
that the pandemic impacted mainly the April month, the Group delivered a credible trading profit performance
for the ten months, albeit at a much slower growth pace compared to the interim result. The Group’s financial
position remains solid, which provides a level of comfort in these challenging and uncertain times.

Trading result

Two distinct periods have emerged over this ten-month period:

1) Nine months to 31 March 2020

Pre-Lockdown (to end March), activity in South Africa slowed further from the levels reported on for the first
six months of the year.

Within the services related activities, which include the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, the
offshore operations delivered a strong result, augmented by the maiden contribution from recently acquired,
Future Cleaning. The annuity income and take-or-pay businesses reported trading profit growth in line with
recent history. In the lead up to the Lockdown, demand for hygiene products and services was very high.
Lower cargo volumes, together with no maize shipments, negatively impacted on the rest of the Freight
businesses. For some time, and especially since the start of the calendar year, demand has been very weak in
hospitality, travel and aviation related services, adversely impacting the relevant businesses in both Services,
Financial Services and Automotive. Bidvest Bank’s solid advances and deposits growth continued, but the
insurance businesses remained under pressure. The investment income gains made earlier in the financial year
reversed into losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets.

The majority of the trading and distribution activities, which include the Commercial Products, Branded
Products and Automotive divisions, continued to face very tough trading conditions. In Commercial Products,
the Trade as well as the Warehousing clusters traded reasonably well. The DIY/Tool/Workwear cluster
reported a particularly strong March month as demand for personal protective equipment increased.
Restructuring efforts at Renttech are yielding benefits. Branded Products continued to benefit from the
consolidation of Adcock Ingram (“Adcock”). In the lead up to the Lockdown, there was high demand for Adcock
OTC, Consumer and Critical Care products. Excluding Adcock, trading profit contracted further. Most
businesses held their own except for those exposed to consumer retail where profits were materially
impacted. The weak demand for new vehicles is well known, based on published monthly NAAMSA statistics.
To date, cost control and rightsizing measures more than offset top-line pressures, albeit to a diminishing
degree.

2) Month of April 2020

During the Lockdown, activity was very limited with a particularly devastating impact on Bidvest’s trading and
distribution activities. During April, only half the revenue was generated compared to this time last year, and
the Group broke-even in terms of profitability. Four of the six trading divisions generated a profit for the
month, albeit at much reduced levels.

Demand was limited, even for those Bidvest businesses registered as essential services during the Lockdown.
Revenue from the annuity income contracts were mixed while all the take-or-pay contracts were honoured.
General cargo, hospitality, travel and aviation related volumes and demand were virtually non-existent. Full
maintenance lease revenue and insurance premiums were earned, while net interest income reduced in line
with the interest rate cuts. The trading and distribution businesses were closed with limited trading in only G
Fox, Electrical and Plumblink. Adcock held its own.

The Bidvest teams delivered essential services to the Group’s normal high standard, putting measures in place
to make sure businesses can withstand a prolonged period of disruption and, at the same time, being prepared
to restart at short notice. Albeit, that the trading environment remains extremely fluid and uncertain.

People

An important imperative during this crisis is to protect and provide for the safety, health and well-being of
employees who are, collectively, the enablers of our businesses. During the Lockdown period, we initiated a
work-from-home policy wherever possible and relevant.
Bidvest established a R400 million, Bidvest COVID-19 Fund (“Fund”), to assist our South African employees that
have not been working during the Lockdown. Bidvest is also contributing in other ways to the broader
humanitarian efforts in the country, including the Solidarity Fund. Additionally, the 30% salary and fee sacrifice
by the executive management team and board members, respectively, for the quarter, will be added to the
Fund.

Applications to the UIF on behalf of our employees for the COVID-19 TERS benefit have been made and are
ongoing. We commend the UIF for facilitating, processing and paying out claims in such a short period of time.
Furlough support by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are comprehensive in
supporting the livelihoods of our employees.

Liquidity, solvency and gearing

Bidvest has proactively enhanced its liquidity position by securing R4.5 billion additional general credit facilities
with South African banks. The Group’s committed general banking facilities now total R11.0 billion. Initiatives
are ongoing to evaluate options to strengthen and optimise the capital structure further for the medium term.
The upcoming debt maturity of R0.5 billion in June 2020 has been factored into cash flow projections.
The PHS transaction closed on 28 April 2020. Bidvest paid the GBP495 million purchase price from the 24-
month bridge funding secured in the same currency. The MIAL disposal process is delayed due to the Indian
courts being closed.

The construction of the R1 billion LPG terminal in Richards Bay recommenced post the Lockdown. At this stage,
the terminal is expected to be operational in September 2020. The outstanding capital commitment, as at 30
April 2020,was R115 million. All other capital expenditure, apart from stay-in-business and contractual capex,
is under review.

Bidvest’s focus on cash flow and working capital management is receiving even greater attention in the current
environment. We strive to balance the challenging short-term commercial realities with our shared
responsibility to the South African economy, and all stakeholders. We are ensuring that the Group remains
financially viable, while maintaining relationships with our customers and suppliers as we navigate these
uncertain times. We will continue to work towards pragmatic solutions that will deliver the best possible
outcome for all.

Traditionally Bidvest generates stronger cash from operations in the second half of the financial year. This has
not been the case to date, due to both a reduction in trading and lower trade receivable receipts.
Despite the higher commitment fees and spreads over the base rates, the decrease in interest rates lowered
Bidvest’s average cost of debt by 10bps from the pre-tax 6.5% reported at interim end.

Bidvest’s debt covenants remain unchanged at 3.0x net debt / 12-month rolling EBITDA, pre IFRS16, and
greater than 3.5x interest cover. As indicated previously, the acquisition of PHS will utilise a meaningful portion
of the financial headroom that exists on the Group’s balance sheet. Currency volatility could exacerbate the
situation further. Management expects the Group to be within bank covenants.
As at 30 April 2020, the Group’s net debt was R12.5 billion, compared to R10.0 billion as at 31 December 2019.
This excludes IFRS16 lease liabilities.

PHS

Following the transaction close, PHS will be consolidated from 1 May 2020. The performance for the financial
year, which ended 31 March 2020, was in line with expectations at the time of negotiating the transaction.
PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 and today serves more than 120,000 customers. More than half of its
customers have had an association in excess of ten years with PHS, while the average contract term is three- to
five-years. Advance billings and high retention rates result in significant revenue visibility and attractive
operational cash conversion.
During the due diligence, management identified five areas of synergy and cost saving to achieve an improved
margin, which is more in line with industry peers.
The hygiene market is increasingly resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers such as urbanisation,
hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging population, to name a few. The global outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene.
This is expected to accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally.

Eqstra

The initial Eqstra transaction long-stop date of 31 March 2020 was extended, in terms of the Sale and Purchase
Agreement, to 4 May 2020. The only outstanding condition precedent was approval from the South African
Reserve Bank. This was not obtained by close of business on 4 May 2020 and the R3.2 billion transaction
terminated.

Comair

On 5 May 2020, Comair was placed into business rescue and as a consequence, the share was suspended on
the JSE. The business rescuer will be formulating a proposed plan that will hopefully result in the long-term
viability of this airline. In light of this, Bidvest believed it prudent to fully impair its investment in Comair. As a
consequence, Bidvest will also no longer equity account Comair.

During FY2020, Bidvest will therefore recognise a capital impairment of R232.2 million (gross) and its share of
Comair operating losses of R209.7 million. This compares to a mark-to-market loss of R332.0 million and share
of associate profit of R257.3 million in the prior year. The net impact year-on-year is a significant negative
swing of R373.7 million on attributable earnings and R467.0 million in headline earnings (9.9% and 10.2% of
FY2019 attributable earnings and headline earnings, respectively).

The way forward

Bidvest recognises that the pandemic will result in long term socio-economic shifts and consequently long-
term structural changes to the economy and business in general. The Group will strategically review all Bidvest
businesses and right-size operations to make sure that our operating models remain relevant and appropriate
for the level of demand. This may lead to retrenchments across all six divisions in order to reinforce their
competitive positions in the future, and ensure that the businesses have the potential of sufficient scale.
Industries that are under incremental pressure include travel, and related activities, while out-of-home
hygiene offer good structural growth opportunities.

In the near-term, management is focused on restarting operations, in a phased, flexible and cost-efficient
manner, and within the parameters set by government. Specifically, we are fully aligned to all safety, health
and hygiene protocols for all stakeholders that are impacted by our businesses.

The expected impact of a peak in COVID-19 infections on our employees, and our ability to deliver products
and services to our customers, is being carefully considered.
The operating environment remains very uncertain for the balance of financial year and forecasting is
impractical. The decision to declare a final dividend will only be taken by the board at the time of finalising the
year end results.

Trading statement

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, Bidvest’s financial results for the financial year to 30 June
2020 have been and will continue to be impacted by COVID-19, weak macro conditions and business
rightsizing, Comair entering business rescue, the decline in the Adcock share price between 30 June 2019 and
31 July 2019 as well as the adverse impact of the adoption of IFRS16.
Shareholders are advised that headline earnings per share and earnings per share for the financial year to 30
June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower compared to the previous year.

A further trading statement will be issued to provide specific guidance once there is reasonable certainty of
this information.

NOTICE IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) OF THE COMPANIES ACT OF 2008 AS AMENDED

Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting of Bidvest held on 28 November 2019,
shareholders approved and passed a special resolution in terms of Section 45 of the Companies act of
2008, as amended (“the Act”) authorising the Company to provide financial assistance to among
others, related or inter-related companies or corporations of the Company.

Section 45(5) of the Act requires a company to provide written notice to shareholders of the adoption
of a board resolution to provide financial assistance, if the value and/or obligations of the financial
assistance so contemplated together with any previous such resolutions during the financial year,
exceeds one-tenth of 1% of the company’s net worth at the time of the resolution.

In order to give effect to the treasury requirements of the Bidvest Group from time to time, guarantees
and suretyships are issued to third parties for finance and other facilities granted by those third parties
to Group subsidiary companies.

Accordingly, the Bidvest board has adopted a resolution authorising the Company to provide direct or
indirect financial assistance pursuant to the Suretyship signed with Investec Limited for the provision
of general banking facilities to certain group subsidiary companies to the maximum value of
R1 300 000 000. The Surety given replaces and supersedes previous Sureties given.

The board has confirmed that, after considering the reasonable foreseeable financial circumstances
of the Company, it is satisfied that, immediately after providing such financial assistance, the Company
would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test, as contemplated in terms of Section 4 of the Act and that
the terms under which such financial assistance was given were fair and reasonable to the Company.

ACQUISITION OF PHS CONFIRMED

Further to the SENS announcement published on 24 December 2019, shareholders are advised that the
remaining conditions precedent relating to the acquisition of 100% of the PHS Group (“the transaction”;
“PHS”), the leading hygiene services provider in the United Kingdom, The Republic of Ireland and Spain, have
been fulfilled.

The transaction has accordingly become unconditional. Settlement of the GBP495 million acquisition
consideration will take place within nine business days. Bidvest will fully fund the transaction through
committed third-party external GBP-denominated debt.
The acquisition of PHS is in line with Bidvest’s stated strategic intent to expand its presence beyond South
Africa in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from the Group’s capabilities and expertise. The PHS
service offering and geographic presence are complementary to Bidvest’s Services division. The hygiene
market is resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety
standards as well as a growing and aging population, to name a few. The global outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic has undoubtedly heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene. This is expected
to accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally.

“Bidvest’s foray into hygiene services dates back to 1991 when it acquired Steiner. Since then, Bidvest Steiner
quadrupled its reach organically to become the no 1 hygiene service provider in South Africa, competing
against global players. The acquisition of PHS marks another important step in Bidvest’s internationalisation,
even more so during this time of heightened hygiene awareness,” commented Lindsay Ralphs, Bidvest chief
executive.

 -  Trading profits margin improved 81bps to 9.2% 
 -  Strong balance sheet maintained with 1.1x net debt / EBITDA  
 -  ROFE up to 24.8%

 -  Normalised HEPS of 610.9 cents 
 -  Unchanged interim dividend of 282 cents per share 
 
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
 
Trading profit increased by 19.8% to R4.0 billion, off 9.2% revenue growth to R43.7 billion, enhanced by the consolidation of Adcock. 

During the six months to December 2019, Bidvest's domestic operations held their own in a tough trading environment characterised by 
low business confidence and constrained consumer demand culminating in lower volumes. Offshore service businesses performed well. 
Our services businesses, comprising the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, grew trading profit by 6.5%. 

Exceptional cost management and good capital discipline resulted in improved margins. Post working capital, cash generated 
from operations increased almost three-fold to R3.8 billion. 

The impact of accounting for Adcock as an associate for one month and consolidating it from 1 August 2019, was neutral on headline earnings. 

The balance sheet remains strong. Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) improved from 22.8% to 24.8%. ROIC of 16.3% is well above 
the Group's weighted cost of capital. 

Acquisitions and investment in our businesses continued. The Bidvest balance sheet remains healthy. Net asset value grew by 
3.4% to R77.10 per share. 

In December, we announced the acquisition of PHS, the largest hygiene services provider in the UK and Spain, for GBP495 million. 
This is in line with Bidvest's strategic intend to expand internationally in niche, asset light annuity income businesses that will 
benefit from Bidvest's capabilities and expertise. 

Normalised HEPS is a measurement used by management to assess the underlying business performance. The Group delivered a 
slightly improved result, as reflected in pro forma normalised HEPS(1) of 636.5 cents. The non-cash impact of IFRS 16 (4.1%) and 
Bidvest's share of Comair's impairment of the SAA settlement (5.8%) represents the differential to the reported 10.5% decline in 
HEPS (563.2 cents). Basic EPS declined 27.7% to 476.9 cents due to the contraction in the share prices of associates compared to 
material share price increases in the prior period. 

The Group declared an interim dividend of 282 cents per share, in line with the prior period. 

(1)  Normalised HEPS, which excludes acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts and includes an adjustment 
     for Bidvest's share of Comair's SAA impairment, is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business performance. 
 
PROSPECTS  
 
The core competencies and drivers of the Bidvest business remain firmly intact. The diverse portfolio of businesses and extensive 
reach allow the Group to weather challenging times. Our basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges enable the 
Group to support and add value to all its stakeholders. Innovation to disrupt ourselves, and the industries in which we operate, 
remains a core focus alongside disciplined asset management and cost control. 

We anticipate the economic conditions experienced during the interim period to persist for the remainder of the financial year. 
Bidvest remains well positioned to participate in pockets of activity and opportunities while creating value for its extensive 
stakeholder base. 

Bidvest will continue to carefully consider strategic investments in South Africa and internationally to generate sustainable 
profits for the long term, particularly in those sectors where we can capitalise on structural growth drivers including out-of-
home hygiene, urbanisation, health and wellness awareness and outsourcing. 

The Group remains cognisant of making growth decisions for capital investment in long-dated relevant infrastructure assets 
backed by take-or-pay contracts, such as the LPG storage project in Richards Bay. This thinking has also led to a decision to 
establish an inland LPG storage terminal, which was recently approved. 

The funding for the acquisitions of PHS and Eqstra will absorb a meaningful portion of the financial headroom that exists on the 
Group's balance sheet today. The resulting gearing ratio will, however, remain comfortably below bank covenants. Strong free 
cash generation and a robust balance sheet will continue to support the Group's strategy of growth in its existing markets, as well 
as continuing to acquire bolt-on businesses. This will also enable Bidvest to pursue expansion internationally in the chosen niche 
areas of Services and Commercial Products.  
 
DIVIDEND DECLARATION  
 
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 282 cents (225.6000 cents net 
of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share for the six months ended 31 December 2019 to those members 
registered on the record date, being Friday, 27 March 2020. The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend 
withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders who are not exempt.

TRADING STATEMENT

In accordance with Section 3.4(b) (i) of the JSE Listings Requirements, listed companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.
The remeasurement of associates' fair value based on Adcock Ingram and Comair share prices, which is of a
capital nature, contracted since 30 June 2019 compared to material increases in the prior period. This
negatively impacted attributable income. Adcock Ingram was revalued as at 31 July 2019, subsequent to which
it became a subsidiary. Comair was marked-to-market as at 31 December 2019.
As a result, basic earnings per share (EPS) for the six months to 31 December 2019 is expected to be between
23% and 28% lower, translating into EPS of between 475 cents and 502 cents, when compared to the previous
interim period (1HFY19: 660.0 cents).
During the six months to December 2019, Bidvest's domestic operations held their own in a tough trading
environment characterised by low business confidence and constrained consumer demand culminating in
lower volumes. Offshore service businesses performed well. Operational cash generation has been good and
the balance sheet remains strong. The impact of accounting for Adcock Ingram as an associate for one month
and consolidating it from 1 August 2019, was neutral on headline earnings.
The adoption of IFRS16 had a modest positive impact on the trading profit, however, the resulting higher
interest charge had a net adverse impact of 4% on attributable income and headline earnings, in line with our
expectations and guidance in the 30 June 2019 Annual Financial Statements.
As per the trading statement issued on 19 February 2020, Comair expects to report a loss for the six months to
December 2019, the result of increased operational costs and the impairment of the full outstanding SAA
settlement. This once-off impairment negatively impacted Bidvest's headline earnings by 6%. As Bidvest
excluded its share of the unpaid portion of Comair's SAA claim in normalised headline earnings as at 30 June
2019, this does not impact Bidvest's normalised headline earnings during the current reporting period.

Shareholders are advised that:
*     Excluding the impact of IFRS16, normalised headline earnings per share(1) (HEPS) is expected to be 1% higher
      to 1% lower compared to the prior period (1HFY19: 635.7 cents).
*     The normalised HEPS for the six months to 31 December 2019 is expected to be 2% to 5% lower than the
      prior interim period, translating into normalised HEPS of between 604 cents and 636 cents.
*     The HEPS for the six months to 31 December 2019, which includes the SAA impairment, is expected to be
      between 6% and 11% lower than the prior interim period (1HFY19: 629.1 cents), translating into HEPS of
      between 560 cents and 591 cents.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the Group's auditors. The Group expects its interim results to 31 December 2019 to be released on SENS on or
about the 2nd of March 2020.

BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa
Registration number: 1946/021180/06
ISIN: ZAE000117321
“Bidvest” or “the Company”

ACQUISITION OF PHS BY BIDVEST AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Introduction
Bidvest is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the
PHS Group (“PHS” or the “business”) from Anchorage Capital Group, L.L.C. for and on behalf
of funds managed and advised by it and funds managed by M&G Investments (“the
Acquisition”).

The Acquisition is for an enterprise value consideration of GBP495million, approximately
R9.1 billion.

Overview of PHS
PHS is the number one hygiene service provider in the United Kingdom (UK) and also holds
top positions in the Republic of Ireland (Ireland) and Spain. It offers a comprehensive range
of hygiene services as well complementary services such as consumable supplies, laundry and
rental of textiles and dust control mats.

PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 and today serves more than 120,000 customers. More
than half of its customers have been customers in excess of ten years while the average
contract term is three- to five-years. Advance billings and high retention rates result in
significant revenue visibility and attractive operational cash conversion.

The hygiene market is resilient and continues to grow supported by structural growth drivers
such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging population,
to name a few. In the UK, the provision of sanitary and nappy bins is legislated by the
Environmental Protection Act of 1990. External industry research forecasts the hygiene
market to grow at 1.5-2.0 times GDP.

PHS has undergone several ownership and management changes over the past two decades.
Aggressive M&A in non-hygiene areas diverted focus and negatively impacted performance
of the core business. A simplification and refocus drive was then put in place, followed more
recently, by initiatives to leverage the scalable hygiene platform.

Rationale for the Acquisition
The Acquisition of PHS is in line with Bidvest’s stated strategic intent to expand its presence
beyond South Africa in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from Bidvest’s
capabilities and expertise.

The Acquisition satisfies the following specific criteria:
-   Meaningful player in the territory – No. 1 hygiene market position in the UK and Spain and
    No. 2 in Ireland;
-   A competent management team – senior management has extensive experience in
    operating service businesses;
-   Annuity income – the combination of essential services and long average client tenure;
-   Strong growth prospects – established scalable platforms in the UK, Ireland and Spain in
    a structurally growing industry; and
-   Attractive, sustainable returns and strong cash conversion.

Bidvest believes that the PHS service offering and geographic presence will be complementary
to Bidvest’s Services division. Several learnings can be shared, and enhanced, thereby
improving the overall service offering. The geographic footprint allows for growth optionality
into Europe and further afield.

Salient terms of the Acquisition
The Acquisition will be made through Bidvest Services (UK) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary
of The Bidvest Group (UK) Limited, which in turn is wholly owned by Bidvest.

Bidvest is conservatively geared at 0.9x net debt / EBITDA (as at 30 June 2019) and has an
investment grade rating from Moody’s, which is evidence of its strong credit quality as well
as its significant borrowing capacity in both Europe and South Africa. Accordingly, Bidvest will
fully fund the Acquisition through committed third-party external GBP-denominated debt
funding.

PHS management has signed service contracts in support of the Acquisition and remains
committed to the business.

The transaction is expected to be completed mid-2020, subject to fulfilment of the below
mentioned conditions precedent.

Conditions precedent
The Acquisition is subject to fulfilment and/or waiver of the following conditions precedent:
- South African Reserve Bank approval;
- all necessary anti-trust approvals being granted; and
- all necessary approvals or consents from the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance
   with Part XII of the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2000.

Financial information
The Acquisition will be concluded on a debt-free cash-free basis. When the Acquisition is
executed all debt and debt-like items will be extinguished.

In the financial year to March 2019, PHS generated earnings before interest, tax and
amortisation (EBITA) of GBP37.5 million. The reported loss for the year was GBP60.2 million
post servicing the significant shareholder loans and third party debt. PHS reported negative
NAV of GBP189.1 million. The NAV subject to the Acquisition totalled GBP348 million.
In the table below, the key financial metrics from the statutory financial statements of PHS
for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 are summarised.

(i) the provision of PHS’ memorandum of incorporation does not frustrate Bidvest’s

compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE: Four months ending 31 October 2019

At Bidvest's Annual General Meeting (AGM) held today, 28 November 2019, the Group provided an update on
its performance for the first four months, ended 31 October 2019, of the financial year (FY20).

Bidvest has delivered a resilient organic operational performance in a challenging market. Domestically,
demand is lacklustre in an environment plagued by low business confidence and constrained consumer
demand. Cost and capital discipline together with improved margins were highlights. Acquired businesses
delivered in line with expectations.

Effective 1 July 2019, the Group restructured from seven divisions into six. This mainly impacted Office and
Print and Commercial Products divisions. The former has been renamed Branded Products and now includes
Adcock Ingram (consolidated from 1 August 2019) and Home of Living Brands. The Electrical operations now
form part of Commercial Products.

The Services and Automotive divisions delivered good results, while Commercial Products and Financial
Services held their own. The lack of yellow maize export volumes at the start of the period impacted the
Freight division's results, while the lower margin and volumes on the significant Treasury contract put pressure
on Branded Products' performance. Underlying trends are similar to that experienced towards the end of
FY19.

The adoption of IFRS16 impacted the trading profit positively, while a larger interest expense resulted in a net
negative impact on attributable income.

Bidvest still awaits the closing of the Eqstra transaction. Various acquisitions are being pursued. The disposal of
Bidvest's 6.75% stake in the Mumbai International Airport is progressing. Management remains committed to
disposing of Glenryck, Taeuber & Corssen as well as The Mansfield Group.

Bidvest Freight's R1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) project in Richards Bay is progressing well. The arrival
of the world's largest LPG storage tanks and the establishment of the terminal was celebrated at the end of
October 2019. Approval has been given for a further R205 million investment in an inland LPG terminal. Work
on this will start once the Richards Bay terminal is operational.

Asset management remains a core focus across the Group. In line with historic seasonal patterns and
considering the strain in the local economy, the Group expects working capital absorption at the end of the
interim period. Net debt /EBITDA remains healthy, despite continued corporate action and capital investments
in South Africa.

In October 2019, Bidvest successfully raised two long-term bonds, totalling R1.5 billion, in a significantly
oversubscribed process. This extended the term of Group debt.

Group ROFE improved year on year.
Additional operational commentary:

Services

Services returned a good result in a challenging and price sensitive market. Noonan continued to perform very
well and Bidvest Facilities Management secured a material contract, effective 1 April 2020. In SA, the results
reflect the predominant annuity nature of the operations. Contract churn at a few businesses is receiving
focused attention. Travel continues to be plagued by downtrading and a high cost base. The bolt-on
acquisitions made during FY19 contributed in line with expectations. Effective 1 July 2019, Noonan acquired
Future Cleaning, a niche cleaning service provider, to expand its footprint in the United Kingdom.

Freight

An excellent performance from Bidvest Tank Terminals, the continuation of good manganese and chrome
volumes and improved bulk volumes in Bidvest SACD did not, unfortunately, offset the lack of yellow maize
export volumes, the continued decline in warehouse and transport volumes as well as weak trading in
Namibia. OnTime delivered a flat result. The DSV Panalpina transaction came into effect, and as a
consequence, Bidvest announced the tie-up with a new international network partner, EMO Trans. Bidvest
Panalpina Logistics has been renamed Bidvest International Logistics. Overall, the divisional performance to
date has been satisfactory.

Branded Products

The divisional performance was significantly impacted by the consolidation of Adcock Ingram, effective 1
August 2019. The overall performance has also been impacted by the lower margins and volumes generated
from the Treasury contract in Konica Minolta. Silveray, Lithotech and Cecil Nurse delivered solid performances.
The packaging division benefitted from the acquisition of Aluminium Foil Converters and the move to paper
packing solutions, specifically to replace plastic. Waltons are preparing for the important back-to-school
period. Asset management, rightsizing of businesses and driving top-line growth remain key focus areas.

Commercial Products

The division held its own despite depressed industrial, manufacturing and construction demand as well as
delayed contract work. Electrical, Plumblink and Bidvest Materials Handling delivered strong results. This was
neutralised by weak trading in the DIY/Workwear/Tools cluster on the back of lower demand that negatively
impacted factory production and manifested in margin pressure. Pockets of activity are evident in the
electrical businesses. Management is focused on bedding down this restructured division with specific
attention given to poor performing operations. Balance sheet management remains a core focus.

Bidvest Bank delivered a solid result with pleasing growth in net interest income as well as good cost control.
FinGlobal continued its good performance. FMI continued its strong growth in gross written premiums,
Compendium performed well but Bidvest Insurance felt the impact of lower vehicle demand and the closure of
its commercial line. The listed equity portfolio returns declined in line with market volatility. One of the key
challenges is the declining leased asset book. Roll out of the Transnet heavy commercial vehicle contract
should accelerate into the balance of the financial year. Closing of the Eqstra transaction is expected in Q1 of
2020.

Automotive

The Automotive division reported a good result notwithstanding the subdued trading environment. Luxury
sales remain weak with gross margin under pressure. Cost containment due to the rationalisation of non-
profitable dealerships, both in SA and Namibia, in the prior year contributed significantly to the improved retail
performance. Bidvest Car Rental delivered a strong result driven by increased volumes and improved fleet
utilisation. Management focus remains on rightsizing the business for current activity levels.
Retirement of executive director

The Bidvest Group announces the retirement of Anthony Dawe. Anthony did not put himself up for re-election
as executive director at today's AGM. Anthony's retirement comes after spending 26 years with the Group. He
joined the Freight division as an internal auditor and was appointed the Freight CEO in 2006. He was appointed
to the Bidvest board as executive director on 28 June 2006. The board and the Bidvest family thank Anthony
for his years of service and dedication and wish him well in his retirement.

Wiseman Madinane will succeed Anthony as the Freight CEO, effective 31 December 2019. Wiseman brings to
the role experience from various industries prior to joining Bulk Connections.

Conclusion

Bidvest intends issuing its results for the six-months ending 31 December 2019 on Monday, 2 March 2020.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information relating to the 2020 financial year has not been
audited, reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors and that this update does not constitute a forecast.

NOTICE IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) OF THE COMPANIES ACT OF 2008 AS AMENDED

Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting of Bidvest held on 28 November 2018,
shareholders approved and passed a special resolution in terms of Section 45 of the Companies act of
2008, as amended (""the Act"") authorising the Company to provide financial assistance to among
others, related or inter-related companies or corporations of the Company.

Section 45(5) of the Act requires a company to provide written notice to shareholders of the adoption
of a board resolution to provide financial assistance, if the value and/or obligations of the financial
assistance so contemplated together with any previous such resolutions during the financial year,
exceeds one-tenth of 1% of the company's net worth at the time of the resolution.

In order to give effect to the treasury requirements of the Bidvest Group from time to time, guarantees
and suretyships are issued to third parties for finance and other facilities granted by those third parties
to group subsidiary companies.

Accordingly, the Bidvest board has adopted a resolution authorising the Company to provide direct or
indirect financial assistance pursuant to the Suretyship signed with Nedbank Limited for the provision
of general banking facilities to certain group subsidiary companies to the maximum value of
R3 455 000 000.

The board has confirmed that, after considering the reasonable foreseeable financial circumstances
of the Company, it is satisfied that, immediately after providing such financial assistance, the Company
would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test, as contemplated in terms of Section 4 of the Act and that
the terms under which such financial assistance was given were fair and reasonable to the Company.

AUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

SALIENT FEATURES
- Trading profit up 3.5% to R6.7 billion
- Both gross and trading profit margins improved
- Strong earnings growth in associate companies
- Headline earnings increased to R4.6 billion
- HEPS increased by 9.8% to 1 352.1 cents
- Normalised HEPS increased by 5.2%
- 23.3% ROFE and 18.4% ROIC
- Strong balance sheet maintained with conservative gearing
- R7.1 billion cash generated from operations
- R5 billion spend on acquisitions and capex
- Final dividend declared of 318 cents per share, up 5.6%
- More than 50% of individual businesses achieved Level 1 to 2 B-BBEE rating

HIGHLIGHTS
Bidvest delivered a credible result in a market characterised by weak economic growth as well as significant business and
fiscal uncertainty and volatility. Exceptional cost and capital discipline as well as improved margins were highlights
against the volatile trading backdrop. The combined services businesses, comprising the Services, Freight and Financial
Service divisions, representing two-thirds of profit, grew trading profit by 6.4% while the profit from trading and
distribution businesses contracted slightly.

A strong focus on clients, solutions, innovation and wholesaling the right product at the appropriate price point as well
as several bolt-on acquisitions in the Services and Office and Print divisions culminated in acceptable growth. Bidvest
Corporate benefited from a strong performance in the property division as well as a fair value adjustment on MIAL.

Strong profitability gains were achieved at Adcock Ingram while Comair recognised the successful claim awarded against SAA,
which increased Bidvest's share of profits from these associate companies.

The trading profit grew by 3.5%. Services delivered a strong organic result, buoyed further by bolt-on acquisitions. Noonan
delivered an outstanding result. Freight delivered a good result on higher bulk and liquid commodity volumes handled through
South Africa's ports. Office and Print's result was excellent considering the significant challenges in this sector. The
results from the Commercial Products and Electrical results were somewhat disappointing while Automotive held its own.
Financial Services faced the headwinds of fleet contracts rolling off as well as poor insurance claim experiences and
insurance investment portfolio returns. Namibia produced poor results.

Good operational cash flow ensured that, despite acquisitions and continued investment in our businesses, the Bidvest
balance sheet remains robust (NAV +6,4% to R75.71 per share). Normalised HEPS grew 5.2% and EPS declined 1.6% due to the
contraction in the share prices of associates.

PROSPECTS
The core competencies and drivers of the Bidvest business remain firmly intact. The diverse portfolio of businesses and
extensive reach allow the Group to weather challenging times. Our basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges
enable the Group to support and add value to all its stakeholders. Innovation to disrupt ourselves, and the industries in
which we operate, remains a core focus alongside disciplined asset management and cost control.

South Africa needs real GDP growth in order to create employment and prosperity for all. This is both the public and private
sectors' responsibility. Government's ability to credibly address the precarious financial position of several SOEs,
initiation of development programmes and ongoing maintenance in key entities and facilities remains critical to kick-start
the South African economy.

Private sector needs to invest to establish and grow productive and efficient businesses and industries.

Bidvest will continue to strategically invest to generate sustainable profits for the long term, while remaining cognisant
of suitable timing for embarking on large scale investments.

Sufficient headroom exists to continue the Group's strategy of growth in its existing markets, as well as continuing to
acquire divisional bolt-on businesses, and to pursue larger, value adding opportunities locally. Internationally, we target
expansion in the chosen niche areas of Services and Commercial Products. Adcock Ingram will be consolidated from 1 August
2019. The acquisition of Eqstra is expected to close by end 2019.

Bidvest is well positioned to participate in pockets of activity and opportunities. Management, therefore, expects that
continued growth will be achieved and shareholder value created in the current financial year.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 318 cents (254.4000 cents
net of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share for the year ended 30 June 2019 to those members
registered on the record date, being Friday, 20 September 2019.

This brings the total dividend for the year to 600 cents per share (2018: 556 cents), an increase of 7.9%. The dividend has
been declared from income reserves. A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders who are not
exempt.

BIDVEST GROUP - BUSINESS UPDATE FOR THE TEN MONTHS TO APRIL 2019

Bidvest executive management are briefing stakeholders, including shareholders and financial
analysts, on Friday, 7 June 2019 with regards to the performance of the Group for the ten months
ended 30 April 2019.

Overall, the year to date operating performance has been acceptable. The constrained trading
environment persisted as activity levels were markedly lacklustre in the run-up to the national
elections in May. This is evident in the GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2019.

Against this backdrop, Bidvest's trading profit continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than that
reported in December 2018. The annuity-type businesses continue to deliver growth while those
trading businesses, which are focused on industrial and infrastructure-related sectors, find trading
challenging. Agricultural volumes are well off the 2018 peak while bulk commodity volumes handled
have grown. Tight expense control and numerous other actions taken to remain relevant and
competitive have resulted in margins being maintained across the Group.

The Group's strong financial position has allowed it to conclude several bolt-on acquisitions, while it
continues to invest in its existing businesses. A few larger sized acquisitions are currently being
pursued. The R1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) project is progressing well and is within
budget. The management team remains committed to ensuring an acceptable shareholder return is
generated. Bidvest's growth and investment aspirations, both locally and internationally, remain
unchanged and well-supported by a solid balance sheet. Net debt / EBITDA is broadly unchanged at
1x.

Operational cash generation and asset management remain a core focus. An improved working
capital position, from interim end, is expected but last years' exceptional performance is unlikely to
repeat. Lower activity levels and a slowdown in bank deposits are contributing factors.

Bidvest continues to maintain strong B-BBEE credentials. The need for inclusive economic growth
and transformation encourages strong, strategic partnerships with customers. Innovative SMME
solutions is a key focus area.

The delisting and take-over offer for Bidvest Namibia has been accepted by minorities. The
integration back into the South African operations will now commence.

The disposal of the 6.75% interest in Mumbai International Airport is taking longer than originally
anticipated. Bidvest remains confident in the ultimate consummation of this divestment.

The Adcock BEE scheme, which was put in place in July 2015, matures in July 2019. As per the AdBEE
SENS announcement dated 31 May 2019, Bidvest's holding in Adcock is likely to increase in July
2019. This, together with ongoing challenges to secure a buyer whilst also facilitating local
empowerment, has led to a strategic re-evaluation of Bidvest's options to maximise shareholder
value.
Additional operational commentary:

Freight
The benefit from Bidvest Tank Terminals' investments in liquid fuel and multi-purpose tanks during
the 2017 and 2018 financial years continues to flow through in higher trading profit despite lower
product volumes. Year to date, Bulk Connections and Bidfreight Port Operations have handled more
bulk commodity volumes. South Africa Bulk Terminals handled less agricultural volumes, particularly
since November 2018. Airfreight and import volumes have contracted, negatively impacting the
general freight activities. The damaged Bulk Connections berth became operational in April 2019.
The cyclones in Mozambique have caused disruption but fortunately all operations were restored
quickly, and all employees returned to duty. The LPG project is on track for July 2020 commissioning.
In light of the pending acquisition of Panalpina by DSV, management is strategically assessing its
options with regards to its forwarding activities which are owned by Bidvest but making use of the
Panalpina network under an agency agreement.

Services
The South African Services businesses delivered good results with the exception of Travel. The
Facilities Management and Security clusters navigated the price sensitive, stagnant market well.
Focus on cost recovery and margin management have been top of mind. Travel results have been
negatively impacted by lower volumes, downtrading and margin pressure. The bolt-on acquisitions,
Click-On and Aquazania, are performing well. UDS, a drone solutions business, was acquired
recently. Noonan is posting an outstanding performance in Ireland, delivering on their niche focus
and country-wide footprint. The UK market is challenging and competitive. The additional two
months of trading augmented the divisions' growth. Management remains focused on delivering
value-adding, customised solutions. The introduction of technology and alternative products and
services keep the business relevant.

Commercial Products
The overall trading performance has softened in the recent months. The consumer facing businesses
continue to perform better than the industrial focused operations. Home of Living Brands,
Interbrand, Moto Quip, Burncrete and G Fox delivered good results. Delayed industrial projects and
little manufacturing activity continue to weigh on the results. Investment in facilities and capacity is
currently a drag on profitability but positions the activities well for the future. Focus is on margin
management and ensuring relevant product and price points.

Office & Print
The pleasing year-to-date result is the culmination of well managed gross profit margins, strong cost
control and continued efforts at improving business efficiencies. Konica Minolta is bedding down the
more onerous, lower margin Treasury Contract where delays were experienced in its finalisation.
Operationally, office products are performing well in a challenging market. Product innovation and
ranging in trusted brands are standing this area in good stead. The furniture interests improved from
a slow start but industry conditions are subdued. The data, print and packaging businesses delivered
good overall results assisted by select bolt on acquisitions. The prior year contained results from the
Zonke low pay-out machine monitoring business which was closed when the national contract was
lost.
Financial Services
Bidvest Bank is rolling out additional fleet under the recently secured heavy commercial vehicle
Transnet contract. Business and Personal Banking are showing pleasing results. Bidvest Insurance
has had a challenging year in the commercial sector. Bidvest Life's strong sales growth continue to
create new business strain on the income statement. Year-to-date, due to weak, volatile equity
markets, the investment portfolios have delivered lower returns. Management's focus is on growing
the core niches of fleet management and foreign exchange products.

Automotive
New vehicle sales volumes continued to decline, particularly in the luxury segment. Used vehicle and
aftermarket gross margins are under pressure. Bidvest Car Rental has successfully implemented two
much needed system transitions. Car rental trading profit is back to normalised levels on improved
utilisation and modest rate increases. Vehicle industry volumes are expected to remain under
pressure and management continue to focus on rationalisation and greater efficiency.

Electrical
Not surprisingly, this division is feeling the impact of the challenging conditions in the building,
construction and mining industries. The traditional electrical wholesale businesses are maintaining
market share in a very competitive market. Project-type businesses are depressed as key
programmes have stalled. Given the widespread strain in the industry, management of the debtor's
book is critical.

Namibia
Bidvest Namibia recorded improved results off a weak base. The take-over offer has been accepted
by 99% of the minorities. We will proceed with the squeeze out of the remaining minorities. The
core activities of Bidvest Namibia will be incorporated back into the South African operations.

Conclusion
Bidvest intends issuing its results for financial year to 30 June 2019 on Monday, 2 September 2019.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information relating to the 2019 financial year has not
been audited, reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors and that this update does not
constitute a forecast.

A recording of the stakeholder briefing will be available on www.bidvest.com shortly after the event.

BIDVEST APPOINTS CHIEF EXECUTIVE - DESIGNATE

Bidvest's 30-year growth story is testament to the long-term success of its strategy: To acquire
homegrown South African businesses and develop entrepreneurial leaders to run the
decentralised operating model that generates wealth, creates jobs and makes meaningful
contributions to society. This long-term thinking extends to good governance in planning the
future leadership at Bidvest.

With this in mind, the Bidvest board has deemed it timeous and appropriate to today appoint
Mpumi Madisa as Chief Executive – designate. This is consistent with a comprehensive
succession plan that was developed and has been executed over the past several years to
specifically mentor and continue her preparation for the CE role.

Lindsay Ralphs will continue as the Group Chief Executive until the 2021 financial year, and
Mpumi will work closely with Lindsay to ensure a smooth transition.

Mpumi first joined Bidvest in 2003 and has, over the past number of years, held several key
and strategic leadership roles at subsidiary, divisional and Group level. Mpumi is an Executive
Director on the Bidvest Group board and holds other external non-executive director roles,
including at Adcock Ingram and Business Leadership SA.

Lindsay Ralphs commented, ""I am delighted that Mpumi has accepted this role. One of our
key priorities is developing the next generation of leaders and Mpumi is the perfect example
of this. Her exceptional leadership skills and depth of experience will ensure continuity for all
Bidvest stakeholders and the Bidvest family"".

The board congratulates Mpumi on her appointment.

Introduction
Bidvest is a leading business-to-business trading, distribution and services group, operating through seven
divisions: Services, Freight, Automotive, Office and Print, Commercial Products, Financial Services and Electrical.
The Group owns 66.0% of Bidvest Namibia and a significant Bidvest-occupied property portfolio. Bidvest continues
to hold investments in Adcock Ingram (38.5%), Comair (27.2%) and Mumbai Airport (6.75%) (MIAL), as well as other
listed and unlisted investments.

Highlights
Bidvest has produced a good result despite a frail economic backdrop as well as significant business and political
uncertainty. The value of a diversified portfolio and the quality of the underlying businesses continue to manifest in
the financial performance. Gross profit margin growth was pleasing, augmented by strong cost discipline as well as
good capital management.

Trading profit grew by 6.3% off flat revenue. The Services, Freight and Office and Print divisions delivered stand-
out performances. Some bolt-on acquisitions were concluded but have not fully contributed as yet. Difficult equity
markets have impacted the results, specifically within the Financial Services division.

Bidvest's headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 9.6% to 629.1 cents (H1 2018: 574.0 cents).

Progress has been made on the non-core asset divestments. Our associate, Adcock Ingram, delivered strong
results and secured a significant portion of the Government's ARV tender. Although Comair's profits contracted, a
recent claim awarded against SAA should go some way in closing our value gap expectation.

The financial position of the Group remained very strong with net debt at R8.9 billion, representing net debt to rolling
EBITDA cover of 1.1x, despite working capital absorption, continued corporate action and capital investment. Cash
management has been good, as evidenced by flat net finance costs.

The Group has declared an interim dividend of 282 cents, 10.6% higher than last year and payable on 25 March
2019. The dividend per share is based on normalised HEPS.

Financial overview
Group revenue remained flat at R40.0 billion in growth constrained economies. The gross profit margin improved by
120bps to 29.3%, despite the mix impact of lower-margin Noonan and the fierce price competition in the market.
A more meaningful evaluation is at divisional level. Operating expenses were well managed, increasing by only 4.7%.

Income from investments improved to R86.5 million (H1 2018: R24.9 million). This was as a result of the profit
realised on the disposal of Bidcorp shares, an exchange rate revaluation gain on MIAL and unrealised losses on
other smaller investments. The returns on the insurance investment portfolios were negative as at 31 December
2018, a negative swing of R85.6 million year-on-year.

Trading profit grew by 6.3% to R3.3 billion (H1 2018: R3.1 billion), with a higher trading margin of 8.4%
(H1 2018: 7.9%). Services' trading profit broke through the R1.0 billion mark with strong growth, both locally and
internationally, underscoring their annuity nature. Office & Print's result was pleasing given the structural decline of
the industry in which it operates. Freight delivered a strong result off a high base benefitting from greater volumes
handled and capacity investments made. Commercial Products posted a mixed result while a reasonable underlying
result in Financial Services was dragged down by the investment portfolios' returns. Both Electrical and Automotive
reported lower trading profit, both operating in challenging industries. Properties benefitted from rentalisation of
projects and low vacancies. Results from continuing operations in Namibia improved off a depressed base.

Net capital items of R112.5 million resulted from positive adjustments of R123.2 million to the investment values of
mainly Adcock Ingram and Comair compared to negative adjustments last year. The balance relates to the insurance
receipts on storm-damaged Freight assets as well as closure costs.

Share of profit from associates decreased by 7.4% due to the decline in Comair profits as a result of the higher
aviation fuel price, which offset a strong performance from Adcock Ingram.

Net finance charges were largely unchanged at R524.0 million (H1 2018: R523.5 million), reflecting solid cash
generation during the period despite continued bolt-on acquisitions and capital expenditure. In November 2018,
Bidvest successfully raised three long-term bonds, totalling R1.3 billion, which were significantly oversubscribed,
at attractive rates. The Group's average cost of funding is 6.6%.

The implied tax rate was influenced by capital items, the non-taxable MIAL mark-to-market gain and a lower
corporate tax rate in the foreign operations.

Bidvest's headline earnings increased by 10.0% to R2.1 billion (H1 2018: R1.9 billion). Normalised HEPS (HEPS
excluding acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired customer contracts), a metric used by management to
assess the underlying business performance, is 635.7 cents. Basic earnings per share increased by 17.7% to
660.0 cents (H1 2018: 560.6 cents) mainly due to the increase in the share prices of the associate companies,
compared to share price decreases in the prior period.

R4.1 billion cash was generated by the businesses, up from R3.9 billion in the prior year. Seasonally, working capital
is absorbed during the first half of the financial year. During the six months to December 2018, the R3.1 billion
working capital absorption was exacerbated by significantly lower disbursements as well as a slowdown of bank
deposits. Strategically, Electrical and Office and Print stocked up on certain key inventory lines.

Progress on Bidvest Freight's R1.0 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas project is on schedule. Civil work is complete and
construction started in preparation for the arrival of the storage tanks toward the middle of 2019. Commissioning is
still targeted for the middle of 2020.

Return on funds employed (ROFE) was maintained at 22.8% on a 4.9% higher average asset base. Divisional ROFE
was 34.0%, slightly down from 34.7% previously. ROIC was 16.0%.

New accounting requirements in terms of IFRS15 and IFRS9, which are effective 1 July 2018, have had no material
impact on the Group's results.

Corporate action
The Group concluded bolt-on acquisitions mostly in Services as well as Office & Print, while minorities were bought
out in Glassock (Financial Services) and Glenryck (in Namibia). Sebenza was merged into Bidvest Panalpina
Logistics (BPL), which forms part of Freight. Services' acquisition of Aquazania for R390.0 million was concluded
post interim end. Several opportunities were assessed, some of which are still being considered. We remain
steadfast in our disciplines when evaluating and responding to opportunities.

The remaining 1.3 million Bidcorp shares were disposed of this period. The disposal of our stake in MIAL is
progressing.

Management remains committed to non-core asset disposals, but only at fair value.

As announced by Bidvest Namibia on Friday 1 March 2019, Bidvest made a N$10.50 per share take-over offer for
the shares we do not already own, conditional on the delisting approved by minority shareholders. Bidvest Namibia
formed an independent board committee to deliberate this offer.

Prospects
The core competencies and drivers of Bidvest remain firmly intact and we expect that continued growth will be
achieved in the financial year. Pockets of activity and opportunities exist across the economy and the Group is well
positioned to participate in these.

At Bidvest, governance is in our DNA, and it is the way we do business, every day. As custodians of significant financial, social, human,
intellectual and natural capital we are aware of our responsibilities toward all stakeholders. We continue to strive to
deliver industry-leading returns and consistent growth while at the same time committing vast resources to support
many different corporate and social initiatives, both within and outside the Group.

Economic growth, industrial activity and consumer spend are expected to remain lacklustre until certainty
emerges post the national election in May 2019. The economic damage caused by corruption will take time to
remedy. Government's ability to drive infrastructural spending, initiation of development programmes and ongoing
maintenance in key entities and facilities remains critical to kick-start the economy.

The Group's financial position allows sufficient headroom to advance the Group's strategy, both locally and
internationally, ensure growth in existing markets, continue to acquire bolt-on businesses, and pursue other
strategic opportunities in our chosen niche areas.

Divisional review

Services
The Services division performed well over the six-month period with trading profit increasing by 13.0% to
R1.1 billion. This included an additional two months of trading from Noonan in comparison to the previous interim
period. The South African businesses increased trading profit by 7.6%, despite a challenging and price sensitive
market in which higher fuel costs added pressure. Strong results were delivered by Steiner, Facilities Management,
Protea Coin, BidAir and Allied Services. Disappointingly, Travel delivered a poor result. Downtrading and the loss of
a few large customers were not neutralised by the technology investment and cost management efforts. Noonan
continues to perform better than expected particularly on the back of integrated solutions in Ireland and cleaning in
the United Kingdom. New contract wins to date are encouraging.

The Services division has sustained its expansion programme, acquiring ClickOn, an electronic visitor and resident
access control system, in October 2018. Post period-end, Aquazania, a supplier of a range of bottled water coolers
and dispensers, was acquired. Other opportunities in South Africa and offshore are continually being assessed and
certain possibilities are being advanced.

Freight
The Freight division's trading profit of R700.1 million increased by 8.6% compared to the prior period. Freight
volumes were buoyant for the first four months, but slowed over the latter two months. This was particularly evident
in maize export volumes handled by the South African Bulk Terminals business. Bidvest Tank Terminals (BTT) again
delivered a good result, while BPL experienced a slow-down in warehousing volumes in the last two months of the
period. BTT's multi-purpose tanks in Richards Bay are operating as planned. Bidfreight Port Operations delivered
good growth as a result of strong fertilizer and other commodity volumes. Bidvest SACD was negatively affected
by reduced imports, while Bulk Connections had a very good period and handled higher chrome and manganese
ore tonnages. The Freight division has assumed responsibility for the UK-based, OnTime business. OnTime is
experiencing some growth.

Wheat import volumes have resumed and other commodities, specifically iron ore, manganese, coal and chrome ore
remain positive.

Commercial Products
Bidvest Commercial Products delivered a satisfactory result culminating in a flattish trading profit. The Consumer
division performed above expectations but those gains were neutralised by a difficult trading environment
experienced by certain of the industrial focused businesses. Strong results were delivered by Burncrete, G Fox,
Home of Living Brands, Interbrand, Moto Quip and Yamaha. Some market share gains, brand repositioning and a
shift to trusted and supported brands contributed to this. Minimal industrial, agricultural and project work impacted
Afcom, Renttech and Vulcan. The focus remains firmly on improving margins and ensuring relevant product and
price points. Operational cash generation was good despite Academy Brushware and Plumblink in the Western
Cape moving to new modern distribution centres which augurs well for productivity improvements going forward.

Office and Print
This division continues to deliver pleasing results. Despite the loss of the Zonke business, which was largely as
a result of losing the national contract for the monitoring of limited pay-out machines, trading profit rose 8.3%
to R436 million. Konica Minolta performed exceptionally well, while all other businesses contributed strongly.
Waltons has faced a difficult few years, but revenue has stabilised, costs are well controlled and gross margins
are being maintained. A shift from house brands together with product innovation drove good growth in Silveray.
Kolok volumes were down but market share was gained. The print segment's growth was pleasing. The data
and packaging sectors delivered acceptable growth. Cecil Nurse had a slow start. A few bolt-on acquisitions, to
augment the product range, were concluded in the recent months. An enviable 40% ROFE was achieved.

Financial Services
Due to weak equity markets, the Financial Services division's investment portfolios were the largest contributor to
the R75.9 million decline in trading profit to R242.9 million. The trading profit for Bidvest Bank grew 8.3% despite
a lower contribution from Leasing and the growth strategy in Personal and Business Banking is starting to gain
momentum. Bidvest Bank has secured new fleet contracts, including the Transnet heavy commercial vehicle
contract. Bidvest Insurance achieved only modest growth in premiums and underwriting profit as its commercial
book performed below expectations. Strategic initiatives are in place to enhance the Insurance business. Bidvest
Life's strong sales growth continues to cause new business strain on the income statement. Compendium managed
to grow marginally despite a hardening of the insurance market. Bidvest Wealth and Employee Benefits, previously
Glassock, has turned the corner and is positioned for future growth.

Automotive
The South African vehicle retail sector continues to contract, particularly in the luxury segment. Total new vehicle
dealer sales declined 2.2% over the six months under review. This led to the division's overall trading profit being
down 5.5% at R323.9 million. Bidvest McCarthy's new vehicle sales remain the dominant contributor, and a strategy
is underway to balance this with used car sales and aftermarket services. New vehicle sales were flat and used
vehicle sales higher. Aftermarket revenue and margin declined. Bidvest Car Rental returned to a normalised trading
profit. The strategic initiatives to lower operating costs and right-size the division are advancing, with some success
already evident.

NAAMSA is expecting a modest decline in new vehicle sales for the 2019 year.

Electrical
Not surprisingly, trading profit for the Electrical division declined 18.6% to R120.0 million. The division remains
fundamentally rooted in the construction, mining and infrastructural development sectors, and remains substantially
affected by the current, dismal, environment. Various initiatives are underway to future-fit the businesses, specifically
lowering the cost of doing business through technology and efficiency improvements. Despite the market
challenges, the core Voltex wholesale business managed to deliver a solid performance in what has become a very
competitive market. Circumstances within the cable market are challenging. Atlas proactively purchased cable
and wire ahead of the widely publicised supply disruptions. Businesses focused on infrastructure and construction
projects were hard hit. The value-added operations delivered reasonable results with pleasing orderbooks.

The industry outlook remains uncertain with financial strain very evident in the customer base.

Other investments

Bidvest Namibia (66% share)
Bidvest Namibia's trading profit from continuing operations rose 50.5% to R29.5 million off a very low base. Results
have been mixed as all businesses experienced pressure on revenue due to the recession in Namibia. Freight &
Logistics bucked the trend on the back of certain Oil and Gas project activities. Strategically, the disposal of the last
fishing assets should be concluded in the coming months.

Bidvest Properties and Corporate
Bidvest Properties performed well with a 15.8% increase in trading profit to R269.8 million. This was the result of
new projects rentalised, reasonable rental escalations and very low vacancies.

Early in the period under review, Bidvest sold its remaining shares in Bidcorp and recognised a profit. The weaker
Rand resulted in a positive mark-to-market adjustment on the Mumbai International Airport investment.

Normalised headline earnings per share
Normalised headline earnings per share is a measurement used by the chief operating decision maker. The calculation of normalised
headline earnings per share excludes acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired customer contracts and is based on the normalised
headline profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the
period. The presentation of normalised headline earnings is not an IFRS requirement.

by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting, as well as the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices
Committee, and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and the Companies Act of
South Africa, and the JSE Listings Requirements. Selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are
significant to an understanding to the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2018.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2018.

Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these interim condensed financial statements are the same as those applied in the Group's
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ending 30 June 2018, except as detailed below:

The Group has adopted the following new accounting standards as issued by the IASB, which were effective for the Group from
1 July 2018:

- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15)
- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)

The application of both IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 has had no material impact on the Group's results.

Retained earnings as at 1 July 2018 has been restated as follows:

Adoption of and transition to IFRS 15
In transitioning to IFRS 15 the Group applied the cumulative effect method and retained prior period figures as reported under the
previous standards, recognising the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity
as at the date of initial application (beginning of current reporting period).

The Group principally generates revenue from providing a wide range of goods and services through its seven core trading operations,
Services, Freight, Commercial Products, Office and Print, Financial Services, Automotive and Electrical.

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced
IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount
that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for transferring goods and services to a customer. Revenue
is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third
parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over products or services to a customer.

On conclusion of a detailed assessment the Group identified the following impact of the change in accounting policy, the prior period
financial effects of which are detailed in the table above.

-  Bill-and-hold arrangements. Upon review of the IFRS 15 requirements for satisfaction of performance obligations and
   acceptable measures of progress, management concluded that the Group did not fully satisfy the performance obligations at
   inception of the contracts. Following adoption of IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at the point in time when control transfers to the
   customers.

-  Performance obligations satisfied over time. Upon review of the IFRS 15 requirements for satisfaction of performance
   obligations and acceptable measures of progress, management concluded that the Group did not fully satisfy the performance
   obligations at inception of the contract. Following adoption of IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at the point in time when control
   transfers to the customer.

-  Customer acceptance. Upon review management has concluded that these sales meet the IFRS 15 requirements to recognise
   revenue when control transfers, and although customer acceptance is required, the other determinants of control in IFRS 15
   indicate that revenue should be recognised prior to customer acceptance. Therefore revenue for these services will be recognised
   earlier under IFRS 15.

Given the diverse nature of the business management believes the condensed segmental revenue analysis presents the nature and
amount of Group revenue streams with sufficiently different characteristics not obscured by insignificant detail, and therefore fulfills the
disaggregation disclosure requirements of IFRS 15.

Adoption of and transition to IFRS 9
As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 the Group changed from the incurred credit loss model detailed in IAS 39 to the expected
credit loss (ECL) model to calculate impairments of financial instruments. IFRS 9 also resulted in a change in the classification of the
measurement categories for financial instruments. In transitioning to IFRS 9 the Group has applied the changes retrospectively but has
elected not to restate comparative information.

Impairment
Applying the incurred loss model, the Group assessed whether there was any objective evidence of impairment at the end of each
reporting period. If such evidence existed the allowance for credit losses in respect of financial assets at amortised cost was calculated
as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and its recoverable amount.

Following the adoption of IFRS 9 the Group calculates allowance for credit losses as ECLs for financial assets measured at amortised
cost, debt investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and contract assets. ECLs are a probability weighted
estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls, the difference between the cash
flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. ECLs are discounted
at the original effective interest rate of the financial asset. The Group applies the simplified approach to determine the ECL for trade
receivables, contract assets and lease receivables (collectively, accounts receivable). This results in calculating lifetime expected credit
losses for these receivables. ECL for accounts receivable is calculated using a provision matrix.

The Group operates a decentralised structure and the provision matrix is deployed for each operating entity's accounts receivable as
follows: ECLs are calculated by applying a loss ratio to the aged balance of accounts receivable at each reporting date. The loss ratio is
calculated according to the ageing/payment profile of sales by applying historic write-offs to the payment profile of the sales population.
In instances where there was no evidence of historical write-offs, management used a proxy write-off. Accounts receivable balances
have been grouped so that the ECL calculation is performed on groups of receivables with similar risk characteristics and ability to pay.
Similarly, the sales population selected to determine the ageing/payment profile of the sales is representative of the entire population
and in line with future payment expectations. The historic loss ratio is then adjusted for forward looking information to determine the
ECL for the portfolio of accounts receivable at the reporting period to the extent that there is a strong correlation between the forward
looking information and the ECL.

In determining the ECL for its financial assets Bidvest Bank applies the three stage general approach, which is based on changes
in credit quality since initial recognition. ECLs are calculated using, a probability of default, a loss given default and the exposure at
default. Both forward-looking macro-economic information and historical data are considered in the assessment of ECL.

The financial impact on prior periods of changing from an incurred loss model to an ECL model has been detailed in the table above.

Classification, initial recognition and subsequent measurement
IFRS 9 introduces new measurement categories for financial assets. The measurement categories of IFRS 9 and IAS 39 are illustrated
in the comparative table below. From 1 July 2018, the Group classifies financial assets in each of the IFRS 9 measurement categories
based on the Group's business model for managing the financial asset and the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

IAS 39 category                                                     IFRS 9 category

Available for sale                                                  Investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)*

Held to maturity

* This includes both debt and equity instruments. The biggest change is that on derecognition of equity instruments gains and losses
  accumulated in OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss.

On initial recognition of equity investments not held for trading the Group may elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other
comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Fair value gains or losses on these instruments
will not be recycled to profit and loss when sold, but rather transferred within equity.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

Comparatives
During the period, certain operations were reclassified between segments as a result of an internal reporting restructure. The
comparative period's segmental information has been amended to reflect these insignificant changes. No comparative information has
been changed following the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.

Significant commitments
Bidvest Freight is in the process of constructing an LPG tank farm in the port of Richards Bay. To 31 December 2018, R308 million has
been spent with an additional R629 million committed to the project, the estimated completion date is July 2020. Bidvest Properties
and Bidvest Bank are parties to the development of a property in the Sandton CBD and have a combined commitment of R250 million.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Group's investments of R2 822 million (H1 2018: R3 442 million) include R11 million (H1 2018: R34 million) recorded at amortised
cost, R1 706 million (H1 2018: R2 455 million) recorded and measured at fair values using quoted prices (Level 1) and R1 105 million
(H1 2018: R953 million) recorded and measured at fair value using factors not based on observable data (Level 3). Fair value gains on
Level 3 investments recognised in the income statement total R45 million (H1 2018: R43 million loss).

The Group's effective beneficial interest in the Indian based Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL) is included in unlisted
investments held-for-trade, where the fair value is not based on observable market data (Level 3). The carrying value of this investment
at 31 December 2018, based on the directors' valuation of 30 June 2018, is R1 036 million (US$72 million) (H1 2018: R892 million
(US$72 million)). The valuation of MIAL is fair value less cost to sell. The calculation used the actual operating results for MIAL based
on its most recent financial statements and a discounted median multiple for the peer group which is in a range of 12,5 and 14,1x
EBITDA. A 1% change in the multiple or EBITDA will result in US$1,4 million change in the value.

MIAL is a foreign based asset and the ruling period end exchange rate, US$1 = R14.39 (H1 2018: US$1 = R12.38), is a further factor
that affects the carrying value.

The carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of borrowings of R14 105 million
whose carrying value is R14 098 million.

Net disposal of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments
During the period the Group disposed of its entire shareholding in Al Jaber Coin Security Company LLC (Al Jaber), a security services
company domiciled and operating in the UAE, and it's 50% share of Gerlan Properties (Pty) Ltd (Gerlan).

The Group made a number of small bolt-on acquisitions during the period. These acquisitions were funded from existing cash
resources.

The final accounting for all the acquisitions had not been completed at the time these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements were issued, in each case the final accounting will be completed within 12 months of the acquisition date, as allowed by

Goodwill arose on the acquisitions as the anticipated value of future cash flows that were taken into account in determining the
purchase consideration exceeded the net assets acquired at fair value. The acquisitions have enabled the Group to expand its range of
complementary products and services and, as a consequence, has broadened the Group's base in the market place.

The small bolt-on acquisitions did not contribute materially to the Group's revenue or operating profit for the period under review. 

Subsequent events
Subsequent to half year-end Pureau Fresh Water Company Proprietary Limited, 82% owned by the Group, acquired 100% of the
ordinary share capital of Zanihold Proprietary Limited (Aquazania), holding company of Aquazania Proprietary Limited and Aquazania
Africa Proprietary Limited for R390 million. Aquazania supplies a range of bottled water coolers and plumbed in water dispensers
(bottleless water coolers) to households and to a wide variety of corporate customers. The acquisition was funded using existing
facilities.

Bidvest made a take-over cash offer of N$10.50 to the minority shareholders of Bidvest Namibia, conditional on a delisting from the
Namibian Stock Exchange.

Unaudited results
These results have not been audited or reviewed by the Group's auditors. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared under supervision of the Chief Financial Officer, MJ Steyn BCom CA (SA), and were approved by the board of
directors on 1 March 2019.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE: Four months to October 2018


At Bidvest’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) held today, 28 November 2018, the Group provided an update on
its performance for the first four months, ended 30 October 2018, of the financial year (FY19).

The operating performance, year to date, has been solid notwithstanding sluggish economic growth, political
instability and waning business confidence in South Africa. Almost all divisions achieved trading result growth,
with a strong focus remaining on cash generation and ensuring an acceptable shareholder return.

Bidvest Chief Executive, Lindsay Ralphs, commented, ""We are pleased with our year to date performance, and
we remain confident that our resilient business model, tight expense control, the measures we have taken to
ensure we remain relevant and competitive, as well as increased volumes in certain sectors and acquisitions,
will enable us to deliver acceptable growth in FY19. Our sound financial position and strong balance sheet
provides adequate headroom to support our growth and investment aspirations, both locally and
internationally.""

The trading operations delivered an acceptable trading result, which was assisted by the acquisition of Noonan
(effective September 2017). Given the broad reach of our activities, Bidvest has benefitted from the
continuation of good agricultural volumes, the investment and capacity increase in liquid storage tanks,
growing demand for branded everyday essential consumer products as well as the annuity-type nature of
many of its operations. Businesses exposed to the infrastructure, construction and manufacturing sectors
witnessed further contraction in demand.

Several small bolt-on acquisitions have been concluded since year end, with a few larger bolt-on transactions
being finalised. Management continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, both locally and internationally.

Progress on Bidvest Freight’s ZAR1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) project is on schedule and civil work is
progressing well. A sod-turning ceremony, with key local stakeholders, was held in September 2018. The
commissioning of the last six multi-purpose tanks in Richards Bay will be complete by the end of 2018.

The strategic assessment with regards to Bidvest’s non-core assets continues. Post year-end, Bidvest sold its
remaining Bidcorp shares at R320 per share, for a total sum of R407mn. In Namibia, proceeds have been
received from the Bidfish disposal and for most of the Angolan assets.

Asset management remains a core focus. Management of debtors remain critical in these challenging times
and management regards the current profile as acceptable. Strategically, inventory was increased in certain
businesses. In line with historic seasonal patterns and considering the strain in the local economy, the Group
expects working capital absorption at the end of the interim period. Net debt /EBITDA remains healthy,
despite continued corporate action and capital investments in South Africa.

In November, Bidvest successfully raised three long-term bonds, totalling R1.3 billion, in a significantly
oversubscribed process. This extended the term of Group debt after the cumulative redeemable preference
shares, to the value of R1.0 billion, were settled early.

Group ROFE improved year on year.

Additional operational commentary:

Services

Services returned a credible result in a challenging and price sensitive market, boosted by the additional two-
month contribution from Noonan. In SA, the results reflect the largely, annuity nature of the operations. The
high fuel costs are a challenge across the division. Contract churn was slightly elevated and margin pressure
remains a feature, while customised solutions continue to gain traction culminating in new contracts. Bidvest
Facilities Management and BidAir performed strongly and management’s interventions in Travel are starting to
yield benefit. Noonan exceeded expectations. Management continues to pursue potential acquisitions, both
locally and internationally.

Freight

The benefit from investment in multipurpose liquid tanks, continuation of good agricultural volumes and
strong fertilizer volumes, more than offset lower chemical and edible fats and oils volumes and continued
sluggish discretionary consumer product imports. Bidvest Panalpina benefitted from new contract growth.
Berth capacity remains constrained in Bulk Connections and is only expected to be resolved towards the end of
Q3FY19. The UK operations, OnTime and the Mansfields Group, which are included in this division from 1 July
2018, showed steady improvement. Overall, the result to date has been satisfactory.

Commercial Products

A strong performance from the consumer-related businesses was largely neutralised by the weak trading
environment experienced by the industrial focused businesses. The overall trading margin was somewhat
affected by pricing pressure and a change in business mix. Home of Living Brands, Academy Brushware and
Interbrand produced good results. Depressed industrial and manufacturing activity, delayed contract work and
pricing pressures all contributed to a less robust start to the financial year.

Office & Print

The overall performance has been good despite constrained revenue and the closure of Zonke in December
2017. Konica Minolta, Kolok and Silveray reported strong results on the back of improved margins while Data,
Print and Packaging delivered solid results. Furniture had a slow start. Waltons is preparing for the important
back-to-school period. Asset management and rightsizing of businesses continue to be key focus areas.

Financial Services

Pleasingly, Bidvest Bank has secured new fleet contracts, including the Transnet heavy commercial vehicle
business. This contract will be delivered during the course of 2019. Business banking activities reported
improved results and new customer growth in various areas was encouraging. The remainder of the division
traded well, considering the negative business drag from the fast-growing life insurance activities. The
insurance investment portfolios are coupled with local and international equity and bond markets, and
material negative mark-to-market adjustments were recognised given recent market volatility.

Automotive

The automotive retail operations are holding their own while Bidvest Car Rental reported an improved
performance. Luxury vehicle sales remained weak but overall margins were slightly better on new vehicle
sales. Used vehicle volumes were subdued and aftermarket margins remained under pressure. Car rental
volumes grew and fleet utilisation improved. Expense management and efficiency gains are key focus areas,
across the division.
Electrical

The continued lack of infrastructure investment and virtual collapse of the building and construction industries
made for very difficult trading conditions. Trading operations were focused on retaining market share, but this
came at the expense of gross margin. Several of the speciality businesses secured good orders. Project work
remains scarce and timing uncertain. Efficient expense management and modernisation efforts alleviated
some of the margin pressure. Working capital management remains a key focus area.

Conclusion

Bidvest intends issuing its results for the six-months ending 31 December 2018 on Monday, 4 March 2019.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information relating to the 2019 financial year has not been
audited, reviewed or reported on by the Group’s auditors and that this update does not constitute a forecast.

CHANGE IN EXTERNAL AUDITOR; UPDATE TO ORDINARY RESOLUTION 3 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING NOTICE

In June 2017, the Independent Regulatory Board of Auditors published a rule prescribing that auditors of public
interest entities in South Africa must comply with mandatory audit firm rotation whereby audit firms shall not
serve as the appointed auditor of a public interest entity for more than 10 consecutive years, with effect from 1
April 2023. Given the aforementioned, increasing shareholder pressure, prevailing market practice and that fact
that Deloitte & Touche (Deloitte) has been Bidvest's external auditors for 11 years, the board mandated the
audit committee to recommend a new external auditor.

The board and audit committee wish to inform shareholders that, following a comprehensive tender process,
PWC, with Mr Craig West as the designated registered audit partner, has been nominated as the new external
auditor effective 28 November 2018. This appointment is subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual
General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for 28 November 2018. Consequently, Deloitte will not be re-appointed as
the Company’s external auditor.

Bidvest wishes to thank Deloitte for their services to the Group over the past 11 years.

Given the above and as communicated in the Notice of Annual General Meeting (""Notice"") sent to shareholders
on Tuesday 30 October 2018, we have updated Ordinary Resolution Number 3 in the Notice. The updated Notice
can be found on the Bidvest website and the updated Ordinary Resolution Number 3 is detailed below for ease
of reference.

Ordinary Resolution Number 3:
Appointment of independent auditor
Ordinary Resolution 3 is to vote on the appointment of PWC as the independent auditor of the Company, to
hold office from the end of this AGM to the end of the next AGM. The audit committee has concluded that the
appointment of PWC will comply with the requirement of section 90 of the Act and the Regulations. The auditor
will be reappointed automatically, without any resolution being passed, if none of the circumstances set out in
section 90(6) of the Act apply as at the date of the AGM.

It is noted that Mr Craig West is the individual registered auditor who will undertake the audit for the financial
year ended 30 June 2019, being the designated auditor.

Message to shareholders

Introduction

Bidvest is a leading business-to-business trading, distribution and services group, operating through seven
divisions: Services, Freight, Automotive, Office and Print, Commercial Products, Financial Services and Electrical.
The Group owns 52.0% of Bidvest Namibia and a significant Bidvest property portfolio, occupied largely by Bidvest
companies. Bidvest continues to hold investments in Adcock Ingram (38.5%), Comair (27.2%) and Mumbai Airport
(6.75%), as well as other listed and unlisted investments.

Highlights

Bidvest delivered a strong result in a volatile market characterised by weak economic growth and consumer spend, as well
as significant business and political uncertainty. The value of a diversified portfolio and the quality of
the underlying businesses continues to manifest in the performance of the South African trading operations. Five
of Bidvest's seven divisions, as well as Bidvest Properties, delivered growth in trading profit. Exceptional cost and
capital disciplines, as well as good cash generation, were highlights against a volatile trading backdrop.

The trading operations delivered an improved result with trading profit increasing by 10.8% against revenue growth
of 8.9%. The results were bolstered by a strong focus on clients and solutions, as well as the successful maiden
offshore acquisitions of Noonan (effective September 2017) and Ultimate Security Services (USS) (effective October
2017) in the Services division and smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the Office and Print and Financial Services
divisions. Bidvest Namibia continued to be impacted by a virtual collapse of the fishing industry and a recessionary
macroeconomic environment in that country. The fishing operations have been sold. Bidvest Corporate benefited
from a strong performance in the property division, a turnaround in the UK operations of Mansfield and Ontime and
mark-to-market fair value adjustments on its various investments. 

Strong profitability gains were achieved at Adcock Ingram and Comair, which increased Bidvest's share of profits from 
these associate companies. The profitability did not translate into higher market values for these investments. 
Bidvest's headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 11.1% to 1 231.6 cents (2017: 1 108.2 cents).

Normalised HEPS (HEPS excluding acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired customer contracts), a metric
used by management to assess the underlying business performance, grew by 12.5%. The Group declared a final
dividend of 301 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 556 cents, up 13.2%.

Financial overview

Group revenue increased by 8.4% to R77.0 billion (2017: R71.0 billion), with R5.2 billion of the increase attributable
to the acquired international services businesses. On a comparable basis, revenue was flat.

Gross profit margin was broadly stable at 28.9% (2017: 29.1%). The inclusion of the lower margin Noonan reset
the overall margin lower. The distribution-type businesses maintained margin, despite input cost volatility and fierce
competition.

Operating expenses increased by 7.1%. Continued, strong focus on cost containment increased like-for-like
expenses by a modest 3.4%.

The trading result was higher by 9.6%. Freight delivered a record result on higher volumes handled through South
Africa's ports. Office and Print's result was particularly pleasing given the structural decline in the industry and
a significant contract handed over to a new operator. A good organic result was delivered by Services while the
Commercial Products division posted a mixed result. Financial Services faced the headwinds of fleet contracts
rolling off. The Electrical division, while not growing profits, managed to perform ahead of a very challenging market.
Automotive results were disappointing mainly due to Bidvest Car Rental and Bidvest Namibia again suffered another decline. 
Acquisitions performed to expectation. 

Income from investments decreased by R68.0 million to R142.8 million. This was the result of a range of realised
and unrealised gains and losses during the year in both the listed and unlisted investments. The insurance
investment portfolio yielded strong growth.

Group trading profit grew 8.2% to R6.5 billion (2017: R6.0 billion), with a stable trading margin of 8.5%.
Net capital items contributed losses of R352.0 million in 2018, relative to profits of R1.0 billion in the prior year.
This included net negative adjustments of R248.7 million to the investment values of mainly Adcock Ingram and
Comair compared to positive adjustments of R1.2 billion for the 2017 financial year. The balance of the charge
relates to the insurance receipts on damaged Freight assets as well as the losses on the disposal and closure of
businesses, including the fishing operations in Namibia.

Net finance charges were 3.7% lower at R1.0 billion (2017: R1.1 billion). Good operational cash generation offset the
additional borrowing to fund acquisitions. There was also a cumulative 50-basis point reduction in the South African
prime lending rate. The Group's average cost of funding is now 6.7%.

Share of profit from associates increased by 11.7%, due to the substantially improved performances in Adcock Ingram 
and Comair.

Bidvest's headline earnings increased by 11.9% to R4.1 billion (2017: R3.7 billion) and HEPS by 11.1% to
1 231.6 cents per share, due to the increased number of weighted average shares in issue. Organic HEPS growth
was 8.0%. Basic earnings per share decreased by 20.5% to 1 137.3 cents (2017: 1 430.3 cents) mainly due to the
contraction in the share prices of our associates compared to material share price increases in the prior year.

Bidvest continues to maintain a conservative approach to gearing and net debt levels are considered acceptable
at R6.3 billion (2017: R5.6 billion). A stable net debt to EBITDA metric at 0.8 times (2017: 0.7 times) and EBITDA 
interest cover of 8.0 times (2017: 7.2 times), are both comfortably above the Group's conservative targets, providing  
ample capacity for further expansion.

Cash generated by operations at R9.4 billion was higher than the R6.9 billion generated in the prior year. The Group
released R1.5 billion of working capital in the current year compared to an absorption of R368 million in the prior
year. Non-financial services had strong and improved cash conversion and Bidvest Bank was successful in raising
deposits.

Return on funds employed (ROFE) improved from 22.3% to 22.9% as asset management remains a core focus,
particularly in these challenging times.

Corporate action

Bidvest's EUR175 million acquisition of Noonan became effective 1 September 2017. The bolt-on acquisition of
USS followed shortly thereafter. Both these businesses traded in line with expectations.

The Group also concluded bolt-on acquisitions in Office and Print and Financial Services. Several opportunities
were assessed during the year, some of which are still being considered. We remain steadfast in our disciplines
when evaluating and responding to opportunities. Buying into the wrong business and management team or the
right business at the wrong price is not in the best interest of our stakeholders.

Over the last year, Bidvest's divisional management critically evaluated all businesses and discontinued various
smaller operations in a portfolio clean-up exercise. The fishing and related operations in Namibia were sold. Security
businesses in West-Africa and the Middle-east were sold, Zonke was closed after the national contract for the
monitoring of limited pay-out machines was handed over to a new operator and some industrial service businesses
exited.

Management remains committed to the disposal of non-core assets, but only at fair value.

Prospects

The core competencies and drivers of Bidvest remain firmly intact and we expect that continued growth will be achieved. 
There is, however, an expectation that economic growth and a return to more robust consumer spending in the current financial 
year will be lacklustre until policy and political certainty emerges post the national election in 2019. The main concern 
remains government's ability to drive infrastructural spending and the ongoing maintenance at certain key 
entities and facilities. It is incumbent on the State to initiate larger programmes of development to kick-start the 
South African economy.

Bidvest is actively advancing its various infrastructural development projects, specifically in liquid gas storage.
Pockets of activity and opportunities exist across the economy and the Group will participate in these. The overall 
projection is for continued growth in trading profit, cash generation and the dividend.

Sufficient headroom exists to advance the Group's strategy of growth in its existing markets, as well as continuing
to acquire divisional bolt-on businesses, and to pursue larger, value adding opportunities locally. Internationally, 
we target expansion in the chosen niche areas of Services and Commercial Products.

On November 1st, we will be celebrating Bidvest's 30th birthday. Since formation, the objective has been to invest
in South African trading, services and distribution businesses and deliver above-average shareholder returns on an
annual basis. Through the ups and downs of economic life, the Bidvest people have transformed a group of homegrown 
South African businesses into industry leaders. This is South African resolve at its best and has served
stakeholders well. We remain committed to this course whilst being Proudly Bidvest and proudly South African.

Divisional review

Services

This is a large and diverse division operating in numerous areas of service. Trading profit rose by 26.3% to
R2.0 billion. The South African businesses delivered an increase of 8.3% in trading profit. The offshore businesses,
Noonan and USS, performed in line with expectations with good volumes of new business secured in the last
quarter. The core annuity income businesses delivered good results with a strong performance from Facilities
Management, BidAir, Allied Services, Steiner and Protea Coin. Both Protea Coin and Prestige have noted some
insourcing and margin pressures, signs of the challenging economy. Management is responding with a sharp focus
on expenses and service innovation. Our travel cluster had another tough year of lower rebate rates and numerous
system changes. The project-based industrial business, TMS, had a poor year and the potential sale of the business
is being negotiated.

Freight

The Freight division had an excellent performance with trading profit up 21.8% on revenue growth of 14.6%. 
Higher agricultural, bulk commodity and liquid volumes drove greater utilisation and therefore operating leverage. 
The investment in liquid fuel and multi-purpose tanks during 2017 and 2018 contributed to the growth. Grain import and
export volumes were exceptional and mineral export flow was steady. Despite three debilitating incidents to berths
and equipment, Bulk Connections performed well. Airfreight volumes remained depressed. Bidvest Panalpina Logogistics (BPL) 
secured new contracts which resulted in a better second half. Project related work was significantly reduced in 
BPL and Bidfreight Port Operations. ROFE remains healthy despite considerable long-dated capital expenditure in 
Bidvest Tank Terminals.

Commercial Products

The division produced a satisfactory result with an increase in revenue of 11.2% and a resultant trading profit
increase of 3.2%. The results include twelve months' trading from Brandcorp vs nine months in the prior year.
Excluding Brandcorp, revenue increased by 5.9% and trading profit by a commendable 7.8%, in a tough trading
environment. Industrial activities represent approximately two-thirds of the trading profit. Excellent results were
achieved by Berzacks, Plumblink, Bidvest Materials Handling (BMH), Academy Brushware and Vulcan. Yamaha
operated in a constrained consumer environment and Renttech's trading profit was significantly down due to
reduced project work. Whilst pricing pressure in the consumer division was relentless, much work was done on
sourcing and price relevance in the market place which ensured the trading margin within the consumer business
was steady. Capex was spent within the industrial businesses to ensure future growth prospects would be met and
will also result in efficiencies going forward.

Office and Print

Revenue declined by 3.8% while trading profit grew by 6.5%. Year-on-year comparisons are distorted by the non-
recurrence of the Tanzanian voter registration project, the closure of Zonke in December 2017 and the net result of
some corporate action. Pressure on the top line was evident, particularly, in office products. Initiatives to simplify
businesses, improve efficiencies and tight cost control were the main contributors to this very pleasing result.
Konica Minolta had a record year while data, print and packaging held its own despite no election work, ongoing
migration from print to post to electronic products and pricing pressure in packaging. After a slow start, Kolok
finished the year stronger and Silveray delivered a good result, driven by innovation and further factory efficiencies.
Tough trading conditions continued at Waltons but ongoing management actions are bearing fruit. Cecil Nurse
delivered another good result. Operating cash generation and asset management was excellent.

Financial Services

Bidvest Bank and the Insurance cluster reported a flat result with trading profit up by 1.0%. Fleet contract roll-off,
the termination of a major short-term rental contract and the negative new business drag from the fast growing life
insurance activities were material headwinds to both revenue and trading profit. The investment portfolio performed
strongly.

No big public sector fleet contracts were secured during the year despite a promising pipeline as decision-making
was postponed. Merchant acquiring, business banking, trade finance and treasury related businesses 
delivered growth. The Bank's corporate advances increased by 13% and deposits grew by 27%. The leased assets
declined by 1%. The Bank also delivered improvements in key banking ratios, with the Credit Loss ratio improving
by 40 basis points to negative 0.2%, the Capital Adequacy ratio increasing by 70 basis points to 20.7% and the Net
Stable Funding ratio improving from 102% to 141%. The cost to income ratio deteriorated somewhat to 64.9%.

Bidvest Insurance delivered a strong result after cleaning up some of the product lines. The balance of the financial
services businesses delivered a reasonable result, boosted by bolt-on acquisitions to broaden the product offering.

Automotive

Bidvest Automotive delivered a disappointing result. Revenue grew by 2.1% but trading profit declined by
R61.2 million to R602.1 million. New vehicles sold by McCarthy outpaced the industry but margins were under
strain. Significant pressure in the luxury segment, in which McCarthy has a leading market share, and reduced
parts activity was largely neutralised by good fleet business, solid activity in the volume brands and the benefit from
closing non-performing dealers in the previous year. The used vehicle segment softened recently as aggressive new
vehicle incentives pose a challenge. Bidvest Car Rental revenue, cost control and fleet management have been
disappointing, resulting in a significant decline in trading profit. This business is currently being reviewed.

Electrical

Considering the challenging conditions in the building and construction industry and the severe downturn that the
larger construction companies are experiencing, Electrical performed commendably. Project-type businesses
were depressed as key programmes stalled. Revenue was broadly flat while trading profit contracted by 14.3%.
Voltex held its own while further entrenching its position as the pre-eminent electrical distributor in South Africa.
Voltex MV LV and Cabstrut delivered strong results while Solid State Power, Electech and the lighting businesses
had a slow year. Initiatives to improve efficiencies and consolidate the solution activities should deliver benefits for
the division. The very significant Waco relocation to a state of the art facility will bring many additional efficiencies
and strategic value to this critical business in our supply chain. Management remains steadfast in its vision to
broaden Bidvest's electrical offering into niche markets which will add value going forward.

Other investments

Bidvest Namibia (52% share)

Namibia delivered a disappointing result with revenue and trading profit 10.9% and 12.9% lower, respectively.
Bidfish recorded an operating loss on a reduction in volumes, poor size mixes, a significant decline in prices,
increased taxes and levies as well as forex losses. The disposal of various parts of the business cloud this year's
result. The food distribution business performed poorly amidst a complete business shakeup and Automotive
trading profit declined sharply as the vehicle market contracted 14%. Freight and Logistics activities delivered a
good result while Industrial and Commercial Products and Services held their own. The trading conditions are not
expected to ease in the short term. The bulk of the corporate action in Fishing is now complete.

Bidvest Corporate
Bidvest Properties performed well with an 11.0% increase in trading profit. A negative mark-to-market adjustment
in Bidcorp, no change to the Mumbai International Airport Limited USD valuation (refer to Fair value of financial
instruments on page 17 for further detail) and good improvement in the UK businesses of
Mansfield and Ontime impacted the result. The weaker Rand against the major currencies also played a role.

Normalised headline earnings per share

Normalised headline earnings per share is a measurement used by the chief operating decision maker. The calculation of
normalised headline earnings per share excludes acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired customer contracts and is
based on the normalised headline profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year. The presentation of normalised headline earnings is not an IFRS requirement.

The Group's effective beneficial interest in the Indian-based Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL)
is included in unlisted investments held for trade, where the fair value is not based on observable market data (level 3).
The carrying value of this investment at 30 June 2018, based on the directors' valuation of 30 June 2018, is R988 million
(US$72 million) (2017: R940 million (US$72 million)). The valuation of MIAL is fair value less cost to sell. The calculation
used the pleasing underlying performance of MIAL (EBITDA +13% for the year to March 2018), takes consideration of the
illiquid nature of the asset and applies a discount to the median peer group multiple, which is in a range of 12.5 and
14.1x EBITDA. A 1% change in the multiple or EBITDA will result in US$1.4 million change in the value.

During August 2018, the Group launched a public process to dispose of the stake.

MIAL is a foreign based asset and the ruling year end exchange rate, US$1 = R13.72 (2017: US$1 = R13.06), is a further
factor that affects the carrying value.

The carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of
borrowings of R12 477 million whose carrying value is R12 468 million.

Acquisitions

The Group acquired 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Noonan Topco Limited (UK), holding company
of the Noonan Services Group (Noonan) with effect from 1 September 2017. Noonan, which is based and operates
throughout the Republic of Ireland and in the United Kingdom, has a clear leadership position and a 40-year track
record of delivering high-quality integrated facility management services and solutions. Its services include soft,
technical and ancillary services and range from cleaning and security to building services and facilities management.
The board believes that Noonan's business model and geographic presence will be complementary to Bidvest's
Service division. The purchase price was funded by way of a three-year euro denominated offshore credit facility at
an attractive variable interest rate.

Effective 1 October 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital and voting rights of Ultimate Security
Services Limited (USS). USS, a building security company operating primarily in London (United Kingdom), provides
building security risk management solutions, ""front of house"" security management, reception services and mail-
room handling services to more than 240 of London's most prestigious and iconic locations. USS was founded in
1999 and currently has a staff complement of 2 100 experienced security officers. The acquisition enhances the
service offerings provided by Noonan. The purchase price was funded by way of existing euro denominated offshore
credit facility.

The Group also made a number of less significant acquisitions during the year. These acquisitions were funded from
existing cash resources.

The following table summarises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value which have been included
in these results from the respective acquisition dates. These values represent the final at acquisition fair values

Goodwill arose on the acquisitions as the anticipated value of future cash flows that were taken into account in determining the
purchase consideration exceeded the net assets acquired at fair value. The acquisitions have enabled the Group to expand its range
of complementary products and services and, as a consequence, has broadened the Group's base and geographic reach in the
marketplace.

With effect from 1 February 2018 the USS acquisition was integrated into Noonan Services. The combined
acquisitions of Noonan and USS contributed R5 241 million to revenue and R284 million to operating profit.

Had the Noonan and USS acquisitions taken place 1 July 2017, the contribution to revenue would have been
R5 771 million and R293 million to operating profit. Other smaller acquisitions contributed R613 million to revenue
and R22 million to operating profit, had these other smaller acquisitions taken place 1 July 2017, the revenue
contribution would have been R707 million and operating profit R27 million.

Disposals

Effective 30 June 2018, the Group disposed of its entire interest in Bidvest Namibia Fisheries Holdings Proprietary
Limited (Bidfish) to Tunacor Fisheries Limited. Bidfish was a 100% held subsidiary of Bidvest Namibia Limited
(Bidvest Namibia). Bidvest Nambia disposed of the Bidfish shares to Tunacor for a cash consideration equal to
the net asset value of Bidfish as at 30 June 2018.

BIDVEST BUSINESS UPDATE FOR THE TEN MONTHS TO APRIL 2018

Bidvest executive management are briefing stakeholders, including shareholders and financial
analysts, on Friday, 8 June 2018 with regards to the performance of the Group for the ten months
ended 30 April 2018.

Overall, the year to date operating performance has been satisfactory. As anticipated, the positive
sentiment stemming from the political changes post the December 2017 ANC elective conference
has not, as yet, translated to increased economic activity. This is also evident in the GDP contraction
in the first quarter of 2018. Spend at some State Owned Enterprises contracted even further as
procurement decisions and policies are interrogated and delayed.

Despite this background, Bidvest’s trading profit continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than that
reported to December 2017. This is testament to the resilience of the underlying Bidvest businesses,
tight expense control, strategic measures implemented to remain relevant and competitive, as well
as the continuing strong focus of the management team on ensuring an acceptable shareholder
return.

The South African operations delivered a solid trading result, which was also partially assisted by the
acquisitions of Brandcorp (effective 1 October 2016) and Noonan (1 September 2017). Given the
broad reach of activities, Bidvest has benefitted from greater commodity and agricultural volumes in
various businesses, as well as the annuity-type nature of many of its operations.

Contract pricing is very competitive and has challenged margins to some degree. Businesses exposed
to the infrastructure and construction sectors witnessed further contraction in demand. Consumer
facing businesses reported weak results.

Bidvest has always maintained strong B-BBEE credentials. Current demands around economic
transformation are varied and the heightened focus on black ownership presents its own set of
challenges. The Group continues to address this on a basis that is both relevant and commercially
sound.

The Group concluded bolt-on acquisitions and assessed several opportunities during this period,
some of which are still being pursued. Recent acquisitions, Noonan and Ultimate Security Services,
have traded in line with expectations.

Investment activity continues unabated. Bidvest Freight's ZAR1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)
project in Richards Bay is on track. Piling of the site and manufacturing of the tanks have started and
two-thirds of the multi-purpose tanks have been commissioned. Our specialist alternative energy
solutions business, Electech, implemented a significant green laundry solution at Bidvest Laundry’s
Spartan facility. This solution takes significant consumption off the electricity grid, thereby giving real
relevance to going green and resulting in sustainable and meaningful savings, including the
reduction in carbon emissions.
Discussions and processes continue with regards to the strategic assessment of Bidvest’s non-core
assets. No further monetisation has occurred since year-end. Bidvest Namibia continues to trade
under a cautionary. Bidvest divisional management have critically evaluated all businesses and are
discontinuing various smaller operations in a portfolio clean-up exercise.

Asset management remains a core focus. Management of debtors is a key focus in these challenging
times and the current profile is acceptable. In line with normal seasonality, the Group absorbed
working capital as at the end of the interim period. This is expected to reverse by year end. Net debt
/EBITDA remains healthy, despite the acquisition of Noonan and capital investments in projects in
South Africa.

Bidvest's sound financial position and strong balance sheet provides adequate headroom to support
our growth and investment aspirations, both locally and internationally.

Additional operational commentary:

Freight
Higher agricultural and bulk commodity volumes have driven greater utilisation and therefore
operating leverage. The benefit from investments in liquid fuel and multi-purpose tanks during the
2017 and 2018 financial years continues to flow through in higher trading profit. Activities exposed
to airfreight and other discretionary consumer product imports improved recently after a weak first
half period. Margin pressure in general logistics type activities remain a feature. Operating
conditions have been suboptimal in the handling of non-agricultural bulk commodities due to ship
collision damage caused to a berth. Despite this, the division delivered a strong result.

Services
The core annuity income businesses in Services delivered good results with pleasing performances
from Facilities Management, BidAir, Allied Services, Steiner, Bidtrack and Laundries. Industrial
project services weakened further with a lower trading result year on year. Travel results have been
negatively impacted by lower volumes and less lucrative rebate structures. Security held its own.
Noonan's maiden contribution is in line with expectations and contract wins recently have been
pleasing. Management interventions across the division continue to lower the cost of doing business
and further diversify the portfolio. Sizeable contracts are up for tender and are very price sensitive.

Commercial Products
Overall, the business result has been positive but below expectation, with the industrial focused
businesses performing better than the consumer facing operations. Academy Brushware, Plumblink,
Bidvest Materials Handling, Berzacks and Vulcan delivered good results. Constrained consumer
spending, delayed industrial projects and margin pressure continue to weigh on the results. There
are some early signs of the benefits from the structural changes implemented.

Financial Services
Banking advances and deposits continue to grow. Fleet contract roll-off and the termination of a
major short-term rental contract are material headwinds to both revenue and trading profit. Certain
large fleet contract tenders have been delayed. Net interest income and gross written premiums
continued to grow. The negative new business drag from the fast growing life insurance activities
remain a feature. The investment portfolio’s good performance has been moderated by recent
market softness.
Automotive
New vehicle sales volumes continued to grow, but margin retention is poor. The luxury segment is
particularly challenging with trading profit lower year on year. Used vehicle gross margins improved
and aftersales are stable. Bidvest Car Rental revenue, cost control and fleet management have been
disappointing. This was recently exacerbated by a very competitive market, resulting in a contraction
in trading profit.

Electrical
Considering the challenging conditions in the building and construction industry and the severe
downturn that the larger construction companies are experiencing, Electrical continued to hold its
own. Project-type businesses were depressed as key programmes have stalled. Despite a cable
market in flux, Voltex managed margins well. Niche products and services performed nicely.

Office & Print
The year to date result is good, especially considering the contracting industry in which it operates
and the loss of the Zonke monitoring contract, effective December 2017. Initiatives to simplify
businesses, improve efficiencies and tight cost controls were the main contributors to the improved
result. Gross profit margins continue to be well managed. The furniture order book remains healthy.
Packaging experienced both volume and pricing pressure. A key contract tender within the
Technology division is receiving focused attention.

Namibia
Bidvest Namibia recorded weaker results as difficult macro-economic conditions persist. The
disposal of the fishing interests remains a work in progress.

Conclusion
Bidvest intends issuing its results for financial year to 30 June 2018 on Monday, 3 September 2018.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information relating to the 2018 financial year has not
been audited, reviewed or reported on by the Group’s auditors and that this update does not
constitute a forecast.

A recording of the stakeholder briefing will be available on www.bidvest.com shortly after the event.

Message to shareholders
Introduction 
Bidvest is a leading business-to-business trading, distribution and services group, operating through seven divisions:
Services, Freight, Automotive, Office and Print, Commercial Products, Financial Services and Electrical. The Group owns
52% of Bidvest Namibia and a significant Bidvest-occupied property portfolio. Bidvest continues to hold investments in
Adcock Ingram (38,5%), Comair (27,2%) and Mumbai Airport (6,75%), as well as other listed and unlisted investments. 

Highlights 
Bidvest has produced a very commendable trading result despite a pedestrian economic backdrop, subdued consumer
spending and an evolving political environment. Trading profit rose 12,0% to R3,1 billion from R2,8 billion for the 
comparable period last year. This again demonstrates the benefits of Bidvest’s robust and diverse operating units, 
which collectively serve many key sectors of the South African economy. All the South African trading operations 
apart from Automotive grew profits, while Bidvest Namibia delivered a disappointing performance. Bidvest South 
Africa’s performance was augmented by our strategically important offshore acquisition, Noonan (effective 
1 September 2017) and an additional three-month contribution from Brandcorp (effective 1 October 2016). 

The Services, Freight and Office and Print divisions were the stand-out performers over the six-month period with
increases in trading profit of 24,3%, 18,0% and 12,7%, respectively. The Services division’s organic growth in 
trading profit of 10,4%, is considered good in the current economic circumstances. Freight recorded several record 
months as bulk commodities, agricultural and liquid volumes increased markedly. 

Bidvest’s share of profits from associated companies, before capital items, increased by 26,4%.

The net result of these positive trading performances was an increase in headline earnings to R1,9 billion 
(H1 2017: R1,7 billion). Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 12,5% to 574,0 cents (H1 2017: 510,3 cents). 
Organic HEPS growth was 11,9%. Basic earnings per share decreased by 4,6% to 560,6 cents (H1 2017: 587,4 cents) mainly 
due to limited share price movements in our associates compared to material share price increases in the prior period. 

Cash generated by operations increased significantly from R1,8 billion to R3,3 billion. Non-financial services had
strong cash conversion and Bidvest Bank was successful in raising deposits. The Group absorbed R0,6 billion (H1 2017: 
R1,9 billion) of working capital. 


Financial overview
Group revenue increased by 10,7% to R39,9 billion (H1 2017: R36,0 billion). Organic revenue growth was 3,3%. 
Gross profit margin was stable at 28,1% (H1 2017: 28,0%), largely due to changes in the mix and acquisitions. Some
margin pressure was evident in certain industries, particularly in consumer and construction, which affected the 
Automotive and Electrical divisions. Delayed industrial project work also negatively impacted the Services and 
Commercial Products divisions.

Operating expenses increased by 13,2%. Like-for-like expense growth was 8,5%. This increase was exacerbated by the 
the variable costs increases in Freight associated with the higher activity levels. 

Income from investments improved to R24,9 million (H1 2017: R98,2 million loss), and is predominantly attributable to
the insurance portfolio. The latter performed exceptionally well in relation to the prior year but this was somewhat
negated by a negative mark-to-market on our Mumbai Airport’s investment due to the strengthening of the Rand.

Trading profit grew by 12,0% to R3,1 billion (H1 2017: R2,8 billion), with a trading margin of 7,9% (H1 2017: 7,8%). 
Net capital items resulted from a loss on disposal and closure of Botswana operations, a profit on sale of a shipping
vessel in the Bidvest Namibia operations and a net negative adjustment to the investments in Adcock Ingram and Comair. 
Flat net finance charges of R523,5 million (H1 2017: R521,3 million), was assisted by good cash generation despite
additional borrowing to fund acquisitions. In addition, the year-on-year increase was partially offset by a 25-basis 
points reduction in the South African prime lending rate to 10,25% on 21 July 2017. 

The balance sheet remains robust with net debt only R0,7 billion higher at R9,0 billion, despite a net R3,4 billion
spent on recent acquisitions. Net debt to rolling EBITDA of 1,1 times (H1 2017: 1,1 times) and rolling EBITDA interest 
cover of 7,6 times (H1 2017: 7,5 times) are both comfortably above the Group’s conservative self-imposed targets, 
providing ample capacity for further expansion. 

Return on funds employed improved from 21,4% to 22,8% on a 4,8% higher average asset base.
Management remains committed to the disposal of non-core assets, but only at fair value. 


Prospects
Bidvest’s prediction at year end of a slight economic recovery has materialised to a degree. While consumer spending
remains tight, there are some signs of confidence emerging, specifically driven by rising commodity prices and retail
statistics that are showing signs of potential growth. The local equity markets have continued to perform well, 
despite credit rating downgrades and accounting issues impacting certain stocks. 

The Bidvest Group remains committed to, and has advanced, its various infrastructural development projects,
specifically in multi-purpose and liquid gas storage. 

Bidvest is encouraged by recent political changes in South Africa and believes that the country is on the cusp of a
much-needed confidence boost. Most divisions within Bidvest are ideally positioned to take advantage of a revival in
economic growth and investment. 

Government overspending, substantially reduced infrastructural and other investments as well as corruption has led to
South Africa experiencing significant economic damage, which will take many years to remedy. It is expected that any
real benefits will take some time to fully flow through into the broader economy. 

The Group reaffirms its commitment to ethical business practices, job creation and economic growth through expansion
of its operations.

Rand strength will result in further pricing pressure in our trading businesses in the coming months, but ultimately 
a stronger currency will be beneficial to the South African economy as a whole. 

The Noonan acquisition is delivering as expected and it is already providing the anticipated platform for potential
acquisitions, specifically in Europe. Possibilities, mainly bolt-on acquisitions, are being assessed that could add 
value to the existing portfolio. Local acquisitions will always remain a feature for Bidvest and the Group continues to
actively explore selective opportunities within the existing divisions. 

Recent developments in the South African market have again raised the spotlight on corporate management practices. At
Bidvest, governance is in our DNA, it is the way we do business and our accounting and governance practices have been
developed with long-term sustainable value creation in mind. Our structures are well-established and effective. We are
acutely aware of our responsibilities toward all stakeholders. Each of our divisions have quarterly audit committee
meetings, chaired by an independent chairman, risk-, social & ethics meetings as well as an operational board meeting. 
Senior internal audit and external audit representatives attend these. Feedback from these meetings is tabled and 
discussed at the relevant Bidvest Group committee meetings. 

The Group’s financial position is strong and a robust balance sheet with adequate headroom is ideally positioned to
support our growth ambitions.


Divisional review
Services 
The Services division’s trading profit rose by 24,3% to R951,5 million. The South African businesses delivered an
increase of 10,4% in trading profit. Noonan performed in line with our expectations. Generally, all businesses within 
this division performed well except for TMS and the Travel cluster. The annuity-income businesses performed well, 
securing some volume growth. Contracts out to tender are very price sensitive. Margin pressure in guarding was more 
than offset by niche services. BidAir performed well. Remedial action is ongoing in TMS and Travel is revamping its 
systems. Cash generation was particularly pleasing in these six months. 

Keen contract pricing, margin management as well as the broadening of the services basket will remain focus areas for
the division. The contract pipeline in both South Africa and Noonan are actively managed. 

Freight
The Freight division’s trading profit of R641,6 million increased by 18,0% on the prior period. Higher bulk
commodities, agricultural and liquid volumes drove increased activity levels. Bulk Connections experienced capacity 
constraints caused by a storm and ship collision damage to the berth. The benefits of the division’s capital spend, 
specifically in Bidvest Tank Terminals, commenced. 

Global demand for commodities is expected to remain healthy, supporting export volumes. The maize market is globally
in over supply, keeping prices relatively low. The stronger Rand is also limiting export pricing for local farmers and
volatile weather patterns make forecasting of the crop challenging. With surplus product available, any export movement
will be opportunistically price-driven. The wheat crop has been poor in South Africa, resulting in an increased need to
import. Rice imports have been very healthy and should continue. R240 million was spent on multi-purpose tanks in 
Richards Bay. These are currently being commissioned.

Office and Print 
This division delivered an excellent result, the fruits of initiatives to simplify the business and improve
efficiencies. Stock management was excellent which assisted the improvement in returns. While overall revenue was 
slightly  down, this was mainly in the office products sector, due to the non-recurrence of project-based voter 
registration business, and lower print cartridge volumes. The division’s strategy of actively managing margin 
delivered a 1,9% gain in gross profit margin. Operating expenses were exceptionally well controlled. Trading profit 
was 12,7% higher at R402,7 million. The Technology division benefited from improved margins at Konica Minolta which 
was assisted by a significant contract with the eThekwini municipality. Furniture delivered an outstanding result and 
Cecil Nurse ended the period with a good order book. Lithotech increased profits in challenging trading conditions. 
Packaging felt the impact of pricing pressure in the fast food market. The national contract for the monitoring of 
limited pay-out machines, held by Zonke since 2003, was handed over to a new operator in December. This will have an 
impact on the second half results. Remedial work underway in certain businesses is showing benefits.

Commercial Products 
The Commercial Products division produced a good result with 11 out of the 17 companies reporting improved
profitability. The division’s trading profit increased by 6,5% to R353,8 million. The organic performance was 
negatively impacted by limited consumer spend and margin pressure. Berzacks, Bidvest Materials Handling, 
Plumblink and Academy Brushware all achieved double digit trading profit growth. Delayed industrial projects and 
margin pressure contributed to a disappointing Brandcorp performance in Q2. Structural changes to the business will 
be beneficial. 

Some signs pointing to higher activity and demand are evident. Product and margin management 
will remain key focus areas. The strengthening Rand is expected to result in pricing pressure in the near-term. 

Automotive 
This division experienced a disappointing first six-month period with a trading profit of R342,7 million, down 6,0%.
New vehicle sales increased by 7,7% compared to last year, increasing McCarthy’s share of the new vehicle market
slightly. Motor retail activities were a tale of two segments. The volume brand dealerships performed well while the 
luxury brand dealerships struggled with a further decline in volumes and significant margin pressure. Benefits from 
the rationalisation of our footprint are also taking a bit longer than expected to materialise. Used car sales 
continue to perform reasonably well in terms of contribution. Bidvest Car Rental results were disappointing. 

Expenses and the asset base across the division are receiving management attention. NAAMSA is expecting a modest
increase in new vehicle sales in 2018. Bidvest Automotive has good exposure to recently launched volume brand 
products. 

Electrical 
The Electrical division has delivered another year of increased trading profit, which is up 1,0% to R147,5 million.
Considering the challenging conditions in the building and construction industry and the severe challenges that the 
larger construction companies are experiencing, these results are admirable. The aforementioned industry remains in
particularly dire straits and Government and State Owned Enterprises’ infrastructure spending remains poor. The 
division’s focus on increasing value-added products and solutions in its business mix continues to yield benefits. 
Changed competitive dynamics in the cable industry and volatile product pricing were well managed. 
The industry outlook remains uncertain with financial strain evident at some customers. Price, working capital and
expense management will remain key focus areas. 

Financial Services
The Financial Services division delivered 5,6% trading profit growth. Revenue declined mainly due to the termination
of a major short-term rental contract. Despite some new contract wins, the expected big fleet contract tenders have 
been delayed. Leased assets and fleet finance advances grew off the prior year base. Net interest income and gross 
written premiums increased as the business base continues to widen. FMI grew strongly and the build-up of the embedded 
value caused a drag on profitability, as was expected. The insurance investment portfolio performed strongly, yielding 
R61,3 million more compared to the prior year. 

Management will focus on driving Business Banking and acquiring services while further niche insurance product
development will also be pursued. 

Other investments
Bidvest Namibia (52% share)
Bidvest Namibia’s trading profit of R7,5 million was 67,9% lower than the prior period. The Namibian economy, as well
as the fishing industry and operational challenges continued to weigh on results. The former is not expected to improve
in the immediate future. A capital profit of R48,6 million was made on the sale of a fishing vessel. Bidvest Namibia
continues to trade under a cautionary announcement relating to the sale of its fishing interests.

Bidvest Corporate 
Bidvest Properties performed well with a 12,4% increase in trading profit to R233,0 million. The stronger Rand
resulted in a negative mark-to-market adjustment on the Mumbai International Airport investment. The United Kingdom 
businesses of Mansfield and Ontime both showed improvements over the prior year.

Directorate
As announced in November 2017, Peter Meijer, CFO, will be retiring on 28 February 2018. The board has approved the
appointment of Mark Steyn to this position, effective 1 March 2018. Prior to this appointment Mark was the financial 
director of Bidvest Freight and has 20 years' service with the Group.

Bongi Masinga resigned as a member of the Group audit committee and was appointed as a member of the Group risk and
Group social and ethics committees.

Ilze Roux was appointed Company secretary following the resignation of Craig Brighten.

Basis of presentation of condensed consolidated financial statements
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and containing
information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as well as the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by 
the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council 
and the Companies Act of South Africa and the JSE Listings Requirements. Selected explanatory notes are included to explain
events and transactions that are significant to an understanding to the changes in the Group’s financial position and
performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of
estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the 
year ended 30 June 2017.


Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those
applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017.


Net acquisition of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments
During the period the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Noonan Services Group of companies (Noonan) with
effect from 1 September 2017. Noonan, which is based and operates throughout the Republic of Ireland and in the United
Kingdom, has a clear leadership position and a 40 year track record of delivering high-quality integrated facility
management services and solutions. Its services include soft, technical and ancillary services and range from cleaning 
and security to building services and facilities management. The board believes that Noonan’s business model and 
geographic presence will be complementary to Bidvest’s Service division. The purchase price was funded by way of a three 
year euro denominated offshore credit facility at an attractive variable interest rate.


Effective 1 October 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ultimate Security Services (USS). USS, a
building security company operating primarily in London (United Kingdom), provides building security risk management
solutions, “front of house” security management, reception services and mail-room handling services to more than 240 of
London’s most prestigious and iconic locations. USS was founded in 1999 and currently has a staff complement of 2 100
experienced security officers. The acquisition enhances the service offerings provided by Noonan. The purchase price was 
funded by way of the euro denominated offshore credit facility arranged to fund the acquisition of Noonan.

The Group also made a number of less significant acquisitions and disposals during the year. These acquisitions were
funded from existing cash resources.
The final accounting for all the acquisitions had not been completed at the time that these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements were issued, in each case the final accounting will be completed within 12 months of the
acquisition date, as allowed by the applicable accounting standard. The following table summarises the provisional amounts 
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been included in these results from the respective dates.

The Group’s effective beneficial interest in the Indian based Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL) is
included in unlisted investments held-for-trade, where the fair value is not based on observable market data (level 3).
The carrying value of this investment at 31 December 2017, based on the directors’ valuation of 30 June 2017, is R892
million (US$72 million) (H1 2017: R827 million (US$60 million). The valuation used the actual operating results for MIAL
based on the most recent financial statements and a median multiple for its peer group which is in a range of 11,6 to 
12,5 times EBITDA. A 1% change in the multiple or EBITDA used results in US$1,6 million change in the value. 
Consideration was also given to an independent expert valuation as well as the Group’s prior disposal of the identical 
sized interest in the 2012 financial year after adjusting for a control premium achieved in that transaction. 
MIAL is a foreign-based asset and the ruling year end exchange rate, US$1 = R12,38 (H1 2017: US$1 = R13,78), is a
further factor that affects the carrying value. The valuation is considered a level 3 type valuation in accordance with 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

The carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of
borrowings of R13 767 million whose carrying value is R13 760 million.

The directors are not aware of any other matters or circumstances arising after the reporting period up to the date of
this report not otherwise dealt with in this report that requires an adjustment to the financial results at reporting
date.


Unaudited results
These results have not been audited or reviewed by the Group’s auditors. The interim condensed consolidated financial

NOTICE IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) OF THE COMPANIES ACT OF 2008 AS AMENDED

Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting of Bidvest held on 27 November 2017,
shareholders approved and passed a special resolution in terms of Section 45 of the Companies act
of 2008, as amended (“the Act”) authorising the Company to provide financial assistance to among
others, related or inter-related companies or corporations of the Company.

Section 45(5) of the Act requires a company to provide written notice to shareholders of the
adoption of a board resolution to provide financial assistance, if the value and/or obligations of the
financial assistance so contemplated together with any previous such resolutions during the financial
year, exceeds one-tenth of 1% of the company’s net worth at the time of the resolution.

In order to give effect to the treasury requirements of the Bidvest group from time to time,
guarantees and suretyships are issued to third parties for finance and other facilities granted by
those third parties to group subsidiary companies.

Accordingly, the Bidvest board has adopted a resolution authorising the Company to provide direct
or indirect financial assistance pursuant to the Suretyship signed with ABSA Bank Limited for the
provision of general banking facilities to certain group subsidiary companies to the maximum value
of R2 197 104 079.

The board has confirmed that, after considering the reasonable foreseeable financial circumstances
of the Company, it is satisfied that, immediately after providing such financial assistance, the
Company would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test, as contemplated in terms of Section 4 of the
Act and that the terms under which such financial assistance was given were fair and reasonable to
the Company.

3. BUSINESS UPDATE

Bidvest executive management are briefing stakeholders, including shareholders and financial analysts, on
Tuesday, 28 November 2017 with regards to the performance of the Group for the first four months, ended 30
October 2018, of the financial year (FY18).
Overall, the operating performance, year to date, has been exceptionally pleasing, despite weak economic
activity. This increase can be attributed to the resilience of the underlying businesses and the continuing
strong focus of the Bidvest management team on ensuring an acceptable shareholder return.

Bidvest Chief Executive, Lindsay Ralphs, commented, “Whilst we are very pleased with our year to date
performance, the country and economy continue to face a high level of uncertainty. Bidvest management
remain confident that our resilient business model, tight expense control, the strategic business measures
taken to remain relevant and competitive, as well as increased volumes in certain sectors and acquisitions, will
deliver good growth in FY18. Our sound financial position and strong balance sheet provides adequate
headroom to support our growth and investment aspirations, both locally and internationally.”

The South African operations delivered a strong trading result, which was also partially assisted by the
acquisitions of Brandcorp (effective 1 October 2016) and Noonan. Given the broad reach of our activities,
Bidvest has benefitted from greater commodity and agricultural volumes in various businesses, as well as the
annuity-type nature of many of its operations. Businesses exposed to the infrastructure and construction
sectors witnessed further contraction in demand. Consumer facing businesses reported weak results.

The Noonan acquisition became effective 1 September 2017. Noonan traded ahead of expectations and
recently concluded a bolt-on acquisition of a niche security company, Ultimate Security Services, in the United
Kingdom.

Bidvest Freight secured approvals for the construction of a ZAR1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)
investment. A contractor has been appointed with earthworks now completed. The commissioning of the
multi-purpose tanks in Richards Bay is on track.

Discussions and processes continue with regards to the strategic assessment of Bidvest’s non-core assets. No
further monetisation has occurred since year-end. Bidvest Namibia continues to trade under a cautionary.

Asset management remains a core focus. Management of debtors remain critical in these challenging times
and the current profile is acceptable. In line with normal seasonality, the Group expects working capital
absorption at the end of the interim period. Net debt /EBITDA remains healthy, despite the acquisition of
Noonan and capital investments in projects in South Africa.

Additional operational commentary:

Freight

Higher agricultural and bulk commodity volumes have driven greater utilisation and therefore operating
leverage. The benefit from investment in liquid fuel tanks during the 2017 financial year continues to flow
through in higher trading profit. Activities exposed to airfreight and other discretionary consumer product
imports remained weak. Recent inclement weather in Durban caused some damage and hindered activity at
port loading and storage facilities. Despite this, the division delivered a strong result.

Services

The core annuity income businesses in Services delivered good results. Security held its own. Noonan's maiden
contribution is exceeding expectations. Industrial project services remain weak with trading profit lower in the
quarter. Operationally, Travel results have improved. Management interventions across the division continue
to lower the cost of doing business and further diversify the portfolio. Facilities Management bundling
initiatives are taking shape and the enhanced model is presenting exciting opportunities.

Commercial Products

The Brandcorp acquisition annualised its contribution in the first quarter of FY18. The industrial focused
businesses held their own, while the consumer facing operations experienced a tough quarter, particularly
Yamaha. The Yamaha business model is in the process of being transformed. Academy Brushware, Afcom,
Berzacks, Burncrete, Materials Handling and Vulcan produced solid results.
Financial Services

Fleet contract roll-off is putting pressure on revenue and trading profit within Bidvest Bank. The award of new
material fleet contracts has been delayed. The remainder of the division traded well, considering the negative
business drag from the fast-growing life insurance activities. The investment portfolio yielded strong returns.
Overall, the increase in trading profit was pleasing.

Automotive

New car volumes grew, particularly to fleet customers. Margin retention has, however, been disappointing.
Commercial vehicle dealerships performed well. Bidvest Car Rental volumes, realised rate per day and fleet
utilisation fell short of expectations, largely as a result of an extremely competitive market.

Electrical

The continued decline in construction and infrastructure activity in South Africa resulted in depressed demand.
Many of the project-type businesses experienced a poor quarter, largely due to organisational changes at key
clients. Trading challenges are compounded by cable price volatility. Active price management is vital, and
working capital management and expense control remain key focus areas.

Office & Print

Results were satisfactory despite lower revenue from tough trading conditions. Gross profit margin improved
on a better mix and active management resulted in exceptionally well controlled costs. Stationery demand
continued to decline, but the processes to simplify the businesses are starting to deliver benefits. The furniture
order book remains healthy. Konica Minolta benefitted from the start of a large municipal contract at an
acceptable gross margin, as well as the annualising of the Treasury price adjustment.

Namibia

Bidvest Namibia delivered improved results, but remain well below expectations. Activities are plagued by
recessionary economic conditions. Tight asset management and expense control remain key focus areas. Poor
catch and realised pricing as well as higher gazetted levies remain the key challenges in the fishing operations.
The Bidvest Namibia cautionary was updated on 8 November 2017, stating that negotiations have been
entered to dispose of Bidfish.

Retirement of executive director

 The Bidvest Group announces the retirement of its Group financial director, Hans Peter Meijer, effective 28
February 2018. Mr Meijer’s retirement comes after spending nearly 28 years with the Group. He originally
joined Bidvest’s corporate office in 1990 and in 1995 moved into a subsidiary divisional financial role as
financial director of Steiner, appointed as financial director of the Bidvest Services division in 2001, and finally
the Bidvest South Africa division in 2011. He was appointed to the Bidvest board as Group financial director on
23 May 2016. The Board’s nominations committee is at an advanced interviewing stage for Mr Meijer’s
successor, and an announcement will be made in due course.

Conclusion

Bidvest intends issuing its results for the six-months ending 31 December 2017 on Monday, 26 February 2018.

Shareholders are advised that the financial information relating to the 2018 financial year has not been

NOTICE IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) OF THE COMPANIES ACT OF 2008 AS AMENDED

Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting (“AGM”) of Bidvest held on 28
November 2016, shareholders approved and passed a special resolution in terms of Section 45 of the
Companies act of 2008, as amended (“the Act”) authorising the Company to provide financial
assistance to among others, related or inter-related companies or corporations of the Company.

Section 45(5) of the Act requires a company to provide written notice to shareholders of the
adoption of a board resolution to provide financial assistance, if the value and/or obligations of the
financial assistance so contemplated together with any previous such resolutions during the financial
year, exceeds one-tenth of 1% of the company’s net worth at the time of the resolution.

In order to give effect to the treasury requirements of the Bidvest group from time to time,
guarantees and suretyships are issued to third parties for finance and other facilities granted by
those third parties to group subsidiary companies.

Accordingly, the Bidvest board has adopted a resolution on 22 September 2017 authorising the
Company to provide direct or indirect financial assistance pursuant to the Suretyship signed with
Nedbank Limited for the provision of general banking facilities to certain group subsidiary companies
to the maximum value of R3 455 000 000.

The board has confirmed that, after considering the reasonable foreseeable financial circumstances
of the Company, it is satisfied that, immediately after providing such financial assistance, the
Company would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test, as contemplated in terms of Section 4 of the
Act and that the terms under which such financial assistance was given were fair and reasonable to
the Company.

Message to shareholders
Introduction
Bidvest (the Company or the Group) is a leading trading, distribution and services group, operating through seven 
divisions: Services, Freight, Automotive, Office and Print, Commercial Products, Financial Services and Electrical. 
The Group owns 52,0% of Bidvest Namibia and a significant Bidvest-occupied property portfolio. Bidvest continues 
to hold investments in Adcock Ingram (38,4%), Comair (27,2%), Mumbai Airport (6,75%), as well as other listed and 
unlisted investments. 

Highlights 
Bidvest has delivered a solid trading result in an exacting market, characterised by a lack of economic growth and
declining consumer spend, as well as significant business and political uncertainty. The benefits of a diversified
portfolio and the quality of the underlying businesses are evident in the performance of the South African trading 
operations where five of Bidvest's seven divisions, as well as Bidvest Properties, delivered growth in trading profit. 
The Automotive division, while not growing profits, managed to perform ahead of a very challenging market. Exceptional 
cost discipline and driving down the cost of doing business helped to support growth in most of the businesses that 
faced deflationary pressure.

South African operations delivered improved trading results in most divisions, with trading profit increasing by 6,4%
against revenue growth of 3,5%. The results were bolstered by a strong focus on clients and solutions, as well as the
acquisition of Brandcorp (effective 1 October 2016) in the Commercial Products division and smaller bolt-on acquisitions
in the Electrical and Financial Services divisions. Bidvest Namibia continued to be impacted by a lack of fishing quotas
and a recessionary macro-economic environment. Bidvest Corporate benefited from mark-to-market fair value
adjustments on various investments, an exceptional performance from the property division and reduced losses in the UK.

Strong profitability gains were achieved at Adcock Ingram and Comair, which notably increased Bidvest's share of profits 
from these associated companies and prompted a reversal of previous impairments, arising from an increase in their 
respective market values. These financial impacts contributed to a more than doubling of basic earnings per share to 
1 430,3 cents (2016: 692,6 cents). Headline earnings per share increased by 5,1% to 1 108,2 cents (2016: 1 054,1 cents).

Financial overview
Group revenue increased 4,0% to R71,0 billion (2016: R68,2 billion), with R1,7 billion of the increase attributable to
the contribution from Brandcorp. The disposal of Manica, effective 30 June 2016, reduced revenue in the Freight
division by R1,3 billion in the current year. On a comparable basis, revenue (excluding Manica and Brandcorp) increased 
by 3,5%. 

Gross profit margin was fairly stable at 29,1% (2016: 29,2%). The inclusion of the higher margin Brandcorp business
served to support the overall margin, against Bidvest Namibia's margins that were decimated by challenging operating
conditions and Financial Services' margins which were diluted by low margin trade flow business. 

Operating expenses were well controlled, increasing by a modest 3,6%. This result is even more impressive in the
context of the distortions from the Manica and Brandcorp transactions. Excluding the effects of these material 
transactions, like-for-like were well contained and increased by 1,7%. 

Commercial Products, Electrical, Financial Services, Freight and Services contributed positively to the growth  
in the trading profit. Automotive and Office and Print profits were slightly down, while Bidvest Namibia suffered a
significant decline. 

Income from investments increased by 34,5% to R210,8 million. This outcome was the result of a range of realised and
unrealised gains and losses during the year in some of the listed and unlisted investments. The insurance investment
portfolio yielded a lower return compared to the prior year. 

Trading profit grew 4,6% to R6,0 billion (2016: R5,8 billion), with a trading margin of 8,5% (2016: 8,4%).

Net capital items contributed profits of R1,0 billion in 2017, relative to losses of R1,2 billion in the prior year.
The investments in Adcock Ingram and Comair benefited from positive mark-to-market adjustments relative to negative
adjustments for the 2016 financial year. Both Adcock Ingram and Comair reported substantially better results in 
the 2017 financial year.

Net finance charges were 14,9% higher at R1,1 billion (2016: R922 million), driven by an increase in net debt due to
the Brandcorp acquisition and an increase in the weighted average interest rate.

Share of profit from associates increased by 152,8%, due to the improved performances in Adcock Ingram and Comair. 

Bidvest's headline earnings increased by 6,2% to R3,7 billion (2016: R3,5 billion) and HEPS by 5,1% to 1 108,2 cents
per share. The increased number of weighted average shares in issue increased. 

Bidvest continues to maintain a conservative approach to gearing and net debt levels are acceptable at  R5,6 billion 
(2016: R5,1 billion). Stable net debt to EBITDA at 0,7 times and EBITDA interest cover of 7,2 times (2016: 8,0 times), 
are comfortably above the Group's conservative targets, providing ample capacity for further expansion.

Cash generated by operations at R6,9 billion, was marginally lower than the R7,0 billion generated in the prior year.
The Group absorbed R368 million of working capital in the current year compared to a release of R297 million in the
prior year. This was mainly due to substantial project deliveries in the fourth quarter of the 2017 financial year. 

An amount of R773 million was recognised on the sale of non-core assets including Cargo Carriers, Cullinan, 
approximately half of the Bidcorp shares and various other listed shares. 

Following Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of South Africa's sovereign rating in June 2017, the rating agency
also lowered Bidvest's global scale long and short-term counterparty credit ratings to Baa3/P-3 from Baa2/P-2,
respectively. The outlook is negative. Bidvest's national scale rating has remained unchanged at Aa1.za/P-1.za.

Acquisitions
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of Brandcorp with effect from 1 October 2016. Brandcorp is a value-added 
distributor of niche industrial and consumer products trading under the industrial brands, Matus, Renttech, Burncrete, 
Moto Quip, Leisure Quip and consumer brands, Cellini and MIC Prestige. The acquisition forms part of the Commercial 
Products segment and enabled the Group to expand its range of complementary products and services. 

Bidvest also announced the acquisition of 100% of Noonan for EUR175 million in July 2017. Noonan is an integrated 
facility management services and solutions provider with a 40-year track record. Its services range from cleaning and 
security to building services and facilities management and include soft, technical and ancillary services. Noonan 
employs more than 13 000 people and operates throughout the Republic of Ireland and in the United Kingdom, with 40% 
of its revenue derived from the latter. Noonan has deep management experience, supported by strong business technology, 
and has demonstrated strong client retention over the years. SA Reserve Bank approval has been obtained and the 
transaction has therefore become unconditional. The transaction will be effective 1 September 2017.

The acquisition of Noonan is in line with Bidvest's stated strategic intent to expand its presence beyond South Africa
in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from Bidvest's capabilities and expertise. 

In addition, the Group made several less significant acquisitions and disposals during the year, as part of its
strategy to grow through organic as well as acquisitive means.

Prospects
Current economic data points to moderately improving economic conditions. This trend is supported by higher commodity 
prices and improving consumer confidence as evidenced by the latest retail statistics. Accordingly, we expect trading 
conditions to improve marginally in the coming year.

Against this background, a continued strong focus on expense control and asset management remain essential ingredients
to ensure outperformance through the business cycles.

The Group will continue to actively explore selective acquisitive opportunities in local and international markets, 
to complement existing product and service offerings. Bidvest maintains a sound financial position and a strong balance
sheet with adequate headroom to support it's aspirations in this regard. The monetisation of the remaining non-core 
assets will continue.

Divisional review
Services 
This is a large and diverse division operating in numerous areas of service. The division continued to perform satisfactorily, 
increasing its trading profit by 3,0%. The Security and Allied clusters performed well, with Protea Coin again being a star 
performer. Bidvest Facilities Management achieved good results as it secured several new integrated contracts. The annuity 
based businesses all performed above expectations. The project-based industrial businesses and the Travel cluster generated 
disappointing results. 

Freight
The division performed pleasingly with trading profit up 4,9%. Revenue, after removing Manica from the prior year, was up 6,0%. 
The financial performance was supported by an uptick in mineral exports, particularly manganese, copper and chrome, and strong 
liquid volumes. Agricultural volumes fell short of expectations. The commissioning of the new Puma fuel tanks in Richards Bay 
contributed to the increase in petroleum volumes. Excellent cost control added to profitability. 

Automotive 
Automotive delivered a satisfactory performance against a new vehicle dealer market that has contracted by 8,2% in the year 
to June 2017 and new vehicle margins came under extreme pressure. Revenue was flat and trading profit was marginally down at 
1,7%. Improved balance has been achieved in the contribution from new vehicles, used vehicles, service and parts, which has 
been critical to offset the volume declines and margin pressures in new vehicle sales. Used vehicle volumes have stabilised 
and related activities achieved strong growth. Non-performing dealers and franchises were exited this year. Bidvest Car 
Rental grew volumes and secured rental rate increases. Fleet utilisation was, however, lower and accident incidents and 
costs higher. 

Office and Print 
Revenue declined by 4,0% and trading profit by 6,9%, after being down 14% at half-year. Year-on-year revenue
comparisons are distorted by the non-recurrence of the Tanzanian voter registration project and the disposal of 
Kolok Mozambique. The division's trading profit result was negatively impacted by a decline in volume and pricing 
pressure at Kolok, together with margin erosion and foreign exchange effects at Konica Minolta. Overall gross margin, 
however, continued to be well managed and operating expenses were exceptionally well-controlled. Operating cash 
generation and asset management was excellent. Zonke, Silveray and Packaging performed especially well and Waltons' 
turnaround strategy is bearing fruit. Three bolt-on acquisitions were concluded in the Paper and Printing areas.

Commercial Products 
The division produced good results, delivering a 48,5% increase in trading profit. The results include the acquisition
of the Brandcorp group of companies during the year. Excluding the Brandcorp acquisition, revenue increased by 3,0% and
trading profit by a commendable 6,0%, in a tough trading environment. A shift in mix towards the higher yielding
Brandcorp companies assisted in increasing margins, despite price pressure from customers and price deflation. 
Excellent results were achieved in Plumblink, Bidvest Materials Handling, Academy Brushware and Home of Living Brands. 
Yamaha experienced headwinds. Brandcorp performed in line with expectations, with Renttech and Burncrete achieving 
excellent results.

Financial Services
Bidvest Bank and the Insurance cluster reported a pleasing set of results. Trading profit increased by 7,4%, with a
strong contribution from Bidvest Bank. The bank's corporate advances increased by 26,5% and deposits grew by 16,6%. 
The positive performance was driven further by a 14,6% growth in the leasing business and a notable improvement in the
Treasury forex margin of the Trading and Investments business. The bank delivered strong improvements in key 
banking ratios. In June, Moody's Investor Services upgraded Bidvest Bank's long-term national scale rating to Aa2 
from A1. It also affirmed the bank's global scale rating by raising the outlook to stable from negative.

Positive operating performance in the Insurance cluster was impacted by declining returns on the investment portfolio.
Insurance premiums grew by 97,1% and insurance assets increased by 23,0% to R1,8 billion. Compendium was again the star
performer with an 88,0% increase in operating profit year-on-year.

Electrical 
The division has performed well given that the infrastructure development, mining and construction sectors in South
Africa remain constrained. The 10,3% increase in trading profit and revenue growth of 5,4% is excellent in this
environment. Voltex held its own, with Cabstrut and Electech achieving good growth. The Voltex brand remains strong. 
The solutions businesses Solid State Power, Versalec Cables and Voltex MVLV Solutions produced impressive results. 
Eagle Lighting, Technilamp and Mubelo are new diversified businesses in niche markets which will add value 
going forward.

Other investments
Bidvest Namibia (52% share)
Difficult macro-economic factors in Namibia contributed to a disappointing overall performance, with trading profit
declining by 70,9%. For the Bidfish division, limited quota allocations, a significant decline in prices and higher 
quota buy-in prices affected profitability. All the other divisions experienced pressure on revenue due to the 
recession in Namibia and, apart from Properties, reported a decline in profitability. The trading conditions are 
not expected to ease in the short term. Various cost initiatives have been implemented to improve the operating 
performance.

On 18 August 2017, shareholders were advised that Bidvest Namibia has entered into discussion, which if successfully
concluded, may have a material effect on the price of the Company's securities. 

Bidvest Corporate 
Bidvest Properties performed well with a 16,9% increase in trading profit. A positive mark-to-market adjustment in
Bidcorp and an upwards revaluation of the investment in Mumbai International supported the performance of investments.

Dividend declaration
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 264 cents 
211,2 cents net of dividend withholding taxation, where applicable) per ordinary share for the year ended 
30 June 2017 to those members registered on the record date, being Friday, 22 September 2017. This brings 
the total dividend for the year to 491 cents per share (2016: 714 cents). The total dividend is not comparable 
to the prior year total dividend which was declared as part of the larger Bidvest Group prior to the unbundling 
of the foodservice businesses.

The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend withholding taxation of 20% will be applicable to 
all shareholders who are not exempt.

Basis of presentation of summarised consolidated financial statements 
These summarised provisional financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the
measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by
Financial Reporting Standards Council, and includes, at a minimum, disclosure as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting, the Companies Act of South Africa and the JSE Listings Requirements. They do not include all the information
required for a complete set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial statements. However, selected
explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding to the changes
in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for
the year ended 30 June 2016.

In preparing these summarised provisional financial statements, directors make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by directors in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of
estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for 
the year ended 30 June 2016.

Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these summarised provisional financial statements are the same as those applied in
the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016.

During the year certain operations were reclassified between segments. The comparative period's segmental information
has been re-presented to reflect these insignificant changes.

Net acquisition of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments
During the year the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Brandcorp with effect from 1 October 2016. Brandcorp 
is a value added distributor of niche Industrial and Consumer products trading under the Industrial brands, Matus, 
Renttech, Burncrete, Moto Quip, Leisure Quip and consumer brands, Cellini and MIC Prestige. The acquisition forms 
part of the Bidvest Commercial Products segment and will enable the Group to expand its range of complementary products 
and services. Goodwill arose on the acquisition as the anticipated value of future cash flows, that were taken into 
account in determining the purchase consideration, exceeded the net assets acquired at fair value. The acquisition has 
been funded with a combination of long-term borrowings and existing cash resources.

The acquisition of Brandcorp contributed R1,8 billion to gross revenue and R198 million to operating profit. Had the
acquisition taken place on 1 July 2016, the contribution to revenue would have been R2,6 billion and R252 million to
operating profit.

The Group also made a number of less significant acquisitions and disposals during the year. Certain of these
acquisitions resulted in insignificant bargain purchase gains. These acquisitions were funded from existing 
cash resources.

The following table summarises the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been included in these
results from the respective acquisition and disposal dates.
                                                                        Other             Total                             Net

Commitments
Capital expenditure amounting to R1 939 million (2016: R1 138 million) is in respect of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent events
The Group acquired 100% of the shares of Noonan from Alchemy Partners and Noonan's current management. Noonan, which
is based and operates throughout the Republic of Ireland and a foothold in the United Kingdom, has established a clear
leadership position with a 40-year track-record of delivering high-quality integrated facility management services and
solutions. Its services include soft, technical and ancillary services, and range from cleaning and security to building
services and facilities management. The board believes that Noonan's business model and geographic presence will be
complementary to Bidvest's Services division. Several learnings can be shared, and enhanced, thereby improving the 
Group's overall service offering. The current dual geographic footprint allows for growth optionality into Europe and 
further afield. South African Reserve Bank approval has been obtained. The transaction is expected to be effective 
1 September 2017. The EUR175 million (R2,7 billion) purchase price was settled by way of foreign credit facilities. 
Three-year variable rate, Euro denominated funding has been secured at an attractive rate.

Other than above, no further subsequent events have been identified.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Group's investments of R2 843 million (2016: R2 870 million) include R62 million (2016: R89 million) recorded at
cost, R1 785 million (2016: R1 846 million) recorded and measured at fair values using quoted prices (level 1) and 
R996 million (2016: R935 million) recorded and measured at fair value using factors not based on observable data 
(level 3). Fair value gains on level 3 investments recognised in the income statement total R95 million 
(2016: R94 million) and other reductions of R67 million relate to net sales, and foreign exchange losses of 
R0,4 million recognised in the currency translation reserve.

The Group's effective beneficial interest in the Indian based Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL) 
is included in unlisted investment held-for-trade, where the fair value is not based on observable market data 
(level 3). The carrying value of this investment, based on the directors' valuation at 30 June 2017, is R940 million 
(US$72 million) (2016: R853 million (US$60 million)).
 
When the Group performs an analysis and notes significant changes in the underlying variables included in the valuation, 
the value of the investment is reconsidered. As a result of consistent increases in earnings driven off increased
passenger numbers the Mial asset has been revalued in the current year. The updated value was determined as fair value 
less cost to sell. The calculation used the actual operating results for MIAL based on the most recent financial statements
and a median multiple for the peer group which is in a range of 11.6 - 12.5x EBITDA. A 1% change in the multiple or
EBITDA used results in US$1,6 million change in the value. Consideration was also given to an independent expert valuation
as well as the Group's prior disposal of the identical sized interest in the 2012 financial year, after adjusting for a
control premium achieved in that transaction.
 
Mial is a foreign based asset and the ruling year end exchange rate, US$1 = R13,06 (2016: US$1 = R14,79), is a further
factor that affects the carrying value. The valuation is considered a level 3 type valuation in accordance with IFRS 13
- Fair Value Measurement.

The carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of
borrowings of R10 713 million whose carrying value is R10 716 million.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017


Bidvest is currently finalising its financial results for the year ended 30 June 2017. These
results are expected to be released on SENS on or about 28 August 2017.
Bidvest’s HEPS from continuing operations is expected to be between 4% - 6% (1096 cents -
1117 cents) higher than the 1054 cents reported in the prior comparative period.

Bidvest’s basic EPS from continuing operations is anticipated to be 100% - 110% (1386 cents
- 1455 cents) higher than the 693 cents reported in the prior comparative period. The
difference in the increase between HEPS and EPS is primarily due to fair value capital gains
arising from an increase in the market values of associate companies Adcock Ingram Holdings
Limited and Comair Limited.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Bidvest auditors.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: ACQUISITION OF NOONAN BY BIDVEST

Introduction
Bidvest is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Noonan
from Alchemy Partners as well as Noonan’s current management team (“the Acquisition”).

The Acquisition is for an enterprise value consideration of EUR175 million, approximately R2.7
billion, and is subject to South African Reserve Bank approval.

Overview of Noonan
Noonan, which is based and operates throughout the Republic of Ireland, has established a
clear leadership position with a 40-year track-record of delivering high-quality integrated
facility management (“FM”) services and solutions. Its services include soft, technical and
ancillary services, and range from cleaning and security to building services and facilities
management.

Noonan employs more than 13 000 people and also operates throughout the United Kingdom,
from where 40% of its revenue is derived. Over the years, Noonan has developed a vertically-
focused, client-centric business model that allows for successful expansion in the large FM
market. Within the fragmented and broad FM market, Noonan targets medium-sized clients
within its focus industries. Various external industry research forecast the FM market to grow
between 4.0-4.5% over the next five years.

Noonan has deep management experience, supported by strong business technology, and
has demonstrated strong client retention over the years.

Rationale for the Acquisition
The Acquisition of Noonan is in line with Bidvest’s stated strategic intent to expand its
presence beyond South Africa in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from Bidvest’s
capabilities and expertise.
The Acquisition satisfies the following specific criteria:

-   An experienced, entrepreneurial management team – senior management collectively
    has more than 70 years of experience in operating the business;
-   A good track record – strong EBITDA growth and operating cash flow conversion;
-   Annuity income – the combination of essential services and an average client tenure of
    eight years;
-   Strong growth prospects – established position in the Republic of Ireland and a foothold
    in the United Kingdom, with ample opportunities to expand service range and, potentially,
    a broader geographic footprint; and
-   Attractive, sustainable returns.

Bidvest believes that Noonan’s business model and geographic presence will be
complementary to Bidvest’s Services division. Several learnings can be shared, and enhanced,
thereby improving the overall service offering. The current dual geographic footprint allows
for growth optionality into Europe and further afield.

Salient terms of the Acquisition
The purchase price will be settled by Bidvest by way of foreign credit facilities. Three-year,
variable rate, Euro-denominated funding has been secured at an attractive rate.

Noonan management has signed service contracts in support of the Acquisition and remains
committed to the business.

The effective date of the transaction is expected to be 31 August 2017, assuming South
African Reserve Bank approval.

THE BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED, UPDATE AND INVESTOR DAY – JUNE 8, 2017


Shareholders and interested parties are advised that Bidvest will be hosting investor sessions and a
pre-close operational update today at 10:00 (SA time). An audio recording will be available for
replay, shortly after the event, at www.bidvest.co.za.

Trading environment

Post the expected improved trading environment in 3QFY17, market conditions have deteriorated as
reflected in lowered business and consumer confidence. In view of the volatile socio-political
outlook and the weaker than expected macro-economic environment, we now expect more
challenging trading conditions for the rest of calendar 2017. With many government departments,
State Owned Enterprises and parastatals in flux, the finalising and closing of contracts is challenging.

Against this backdrop, trading results to date have been satisfactory. The quality of earnings remains
high.

The annuity income type businesses delivered solid results, while those inherently linked to
construction and infrastructure development have done well to hold their own. The lack of industrial
project related work is weighing on some businesses. Demand is subdued in the Automotive and
Office & Print divisions. Significantly reduced fishing quotas remain an ongoing concern in Bidvest
Namibia.

Mark-to-market gains on the investment portfolio and improved results from the larger associate
companies, which are reported in the Corporate office, have been pleasing.

Costs remain well controlled and asset management is to be commended. A material capex
investment in fuel tanks in Richards Bay has been completed and commissioned. The construction of
additional multi-purpose tanks is currently on the go.

Bidvest remains committed to monetising its non-core assets in a value-accretive and responsible
manner. Discussions are ongoing. During April 2017, Bidvest disposed of some Bidcorp shares.

Prospects

The macroeconomic environment is South Africa remains a major concern.

Bidvest’s financial position remains sound and cash generation continues to be strong. Our ongoing
strategy of acquiring bolt-on companies that add additional value to existing Bidvest entities is
continuing. We retain adequate headroom to accommodate larger acquisitive and organic expansion
opportunities, which we are actively seeking, both locally and internationally.
This announcement and any forward looking statements have not been reviewed by the auditors.

Message to shareholders
Highlights 
Bidvest has delivered a pleasing result against the backdrop of significant and continuing market challenges. The
quality of earnings is evident in the performance of the South African trading operations, which delivered solid 
results. Despite the competitive and difficult operating environment, five of the divisions managed to maintain or 
increase margins through enhanced efficiencies and cost control.
 
South African operations delivered a good trading profit, increasing by 6,2% notwithstanding revenue only increasing
3,6%. Bidvest Namibia continued to be impacted by declining fish quotas and tough economic conditions in that country.
Numerous options are being considered to improve the current situation and return these assets to profitability.
 
Basic earnings per share increased by 39,6% to 587,4 cents (H1 2016: 420,9 cents) and headline earnings per share by
4,4% to 510,3 cents (H1 2016: 489,0 cents). The difference in the increase between basic earnings and headline earnings
per share is primarily due to the reversal of impairments arising from an increase in the market values of associate
companies, Adcock Ingram Holdings Limited (Adcock Ingram) and Comair Limited (Comair), due to strong profitability 
gains.

Financial overview
Group revenue increased 4,1% to R36,0 billion (H1 2016: R34,6 billion).
 
Gross profit margin was stable. Portfolio mix benefits were achieved by replacing low profit margin companies, with
Brandcorp, which is a better margin business. Bidvest Namibia’s margin continued to diminish as a result of increased
fishing quota costs. Operating expenses were well controlled, increasing by a modest 2,1%. The operating expense ratio
reduced to 20,1% (H1 2016: 20,5%). 

All the divisions apart from Office and Print and Bidvest Namibia contributed positively to the 7,5% growth in the
trading result and stable trading profit margin. Mark-to-market adjustments on our investments reduced the growth in 
trading profit to 3,2% or R2,8 billion (H1 2016: R2,7 billion).
 
The investments in Adcock Ingram, Comair and Cullinan benefited from positive mark-to-market adjustments of 
R319,8 million, relative to negative adjustments of R216,9 million in the corresponding period and R760,8 million 
for the full 2016 financial year.
 
Net finance charges were 15,4% higher at R521,3 million (H1 2016: R451,8 million), driven by a 1% increase in the
prime interest rate and an increase in net debt due to the Brandcorp acquisition.

Income from associates more than doubled to R200,9 million (H1 2016: R93,8 million), due to significant improvements
in the financial results of Adcock Ingram and Comair. 

Bidvest’s headline earnings increased by 5,6% to R1,7 billion (H1 2016: R1,6 billion). 

Cash generated by operations at R1,8 billion was, on a like-for-like basis, 30,1% higher than the R1,4 billion
generated in the prior year. The Group absorbed R1,9 billion of working capital in the current period compared to 
R2,0 billion in the prior period.
 
The balance sheet remains robust and net debt levels are acceptable at R8,4 billion given Brandcorp’s recent
inclusion. Net debt to equity at 42,7% (H1 2016: 41,3%) and EBITDA interest cover of 7,0 times (H1 2016: 
7,9 times), are comfortably above the Group’s conservative self-imposed targets, providing ample capacity for 
further expansion.
 
Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the Bidvest Group’s local currency global and national scale long-term issuer 
ratings of Baa2/Aa1.za and short-term ratings of P-2/P-1.za, with a negative outlook, in December 2016. The 
negative outlook relates to the challenging and low growth economic environment in South Africa.

Acquisitions
The Brandcorp acquisition was finalised with effect from 1 October 2016 and the focus is currently on the integration
of this business into the Commercial Products fold. Several small bolt-on acquisitions have been bedded down.
 
Prospects
It is anticipated that current trading conditions will continue for the remainder of the year, although a gradual
improvement is anticipated, supported by drought relief and improved business confidence. 

Expense control and asset management remain essential pillars of our high-performance philosophy and will continue to
be closely monitored.

The Group is continuously assessing and implementing plans for real growth and pursuing selective local and international 
opportunities to complement existing product and service offerings. This growth drive is supported by Bidvest’s sound 
financial position and strong cash generation, which provides adequate headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities. 

Divisional review
Services 
This is a large and diverse division operating in numerous areas of service. The Services division continues to perform 
well, with a 6,8% increase in trading profit for the period. Expense control and good asset management remain features
of the division. Excellent results were achieved by Facilities Management Services, Security Services and Allied Services. 
Industrial Services produced steady results, while the Travel Services business remains a concern. The division has a 
positive outlook for the remainder of 2017, and will benefit from the inclusion of some bolt-on acquisitions and the 
start up of several new contracts.

Freight
The Freight division reported a commendable trading profit increase of 6,1%, despite a decrease in revenue following
the sale of the Manica business. Results in the second quarter were particularly good. The increased profits were
supported by maize import volumes resulting from the drought in southern Africa. Commodity export volumes continued to 
be below expectations, although manganese and chrome exports have started to improve. Good cost control has contributed 
to the improved performance. 

Automotive 
The Motor Retail and Car Rental division reported a pleasing increase of 1,9% in trading profit, against a new vehicle
market that has contracted by 13,0% in the six months to December 2016. Used vehicles performed well, increasing
revenue by more than 9%. The focus on used vehicles has been critical to offset double-digit volume declines and margin
pressures in the new vehicle market. The luxury new vehicle component continued to contract at a faster rate than the 
overall market. Bidvest Car Rental experienced a strong price recovery, despite increased competition in the market. This 
was achieved through changes in the mix towards higher margin business, leading to a good increase in trading profit. 

Office and Print 
Revenue declined by 1,4%, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the Tanzanian voter registration project and the
disposal of Kolok Mozambique. The division’s trading profit result was negatively impacted by currency movements in 
Konica Minolta and Kolok, which masked solid performances by the other operations. Margins and expenses were generally 
well controlled.
 
Commercial Products 
The division produced another set of excellent results, delivering a 37% increase in trading profit. The results
include the Brandcorp acquisition effective 1 October 2016. Excluding Brandcorp, trading profit increased by a 
solid 7,5%, despite tough trading conditions. The Industrial segment (excluding Brandcorp) achieved a pleasing 
performance, growing trading profit by 18%, on revenue growth of 9%. G Fox and Plumblink recorded exceptional 
performances. The Consumer division experienced some headwinds, with Yamaha bearing the brunt of tough trading 
conditions and volumes under pressure. Brandcorp’s performance was in line with expectation. Cash generation in 
this division was particularly strong.

Financial Services
Bidvest Bank and the Insurance cluster reported a pleasing set of results. Trading profit increased by 14,1%, with
strong contributions from Bidvest Bank, as well as an improved return on the investment portfolio in the insurance
business. Bidvest Bank’s performance was driven mainly by increased profits in the Fleet and Asset Finance businesses, 
as well as an enhanced customer programme and product offering. Bidvest Bank corporate advances increased by 12,9% and 
deposits grew by 23,7%. The Insurance Group showed good premium growth in the Commercial and Travel Insurance channels, 
while Compendium produced outstanding results.
 
Electrical 
The division has performed well given the infrastructure development, mining and construction sectors in South Africa
remain constrained. The 5,1% increase in operating profit on revenue growth of 1,9% is commendable. Solid State Power
generated an excellent set of results, while Voltex managed to improve margins in a tough trading environment. Asset
management and a reduction in expenses remain focus areas.

Other investments
Bidvest Namibia (52% share)
Difficult macro-economic factors in Namibia contributed to a disappointing overall performance, with trading profit
declining by 80,6%. All operations apart from Properties, reported a decline in profitability, with Bidfish and Food and
Distribution generating losses for the six months. The extremely difficult trading conditions are expected to continue in
the short term. Various initiatives have been implemented to improve the operating performance. The size of the vessel
fleet is being reduced and cost reduction programmes have been put in place.
             
Bidvest Corporate
Bidvest Properties performed well with a 12,7% increase in trading profit. Mark-to-market adjustments negatively
impacted the performance of investments. Ontime Automotive and the DH Mansfield Group,reduced their losses and robust 
action plans are in place to further improve performance.

(181,6000 cents net of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share for the six months ended 
31 December 2016. The interim dividend is not comparable to the prior year interim dividend, which was declared as 
part of the larger Bidvest Group, prior to the unbundling of the foodservice businesses.

The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all
shareholders who are not exempt.

Basis of presentation of condensed consolidated financial statements
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and 
Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council. They do not include 
all the information required for a complete set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial 
statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant 
to an understanding to the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual 
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, management make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of
estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for 
the year ended 30 June 2016.

Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those
applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016.

#Re-presentation of December 2015 comparative information
Following the unbundling and separate listing of the Group’s foodservice businesses as Bid Corporation Limited, the
Group’s condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and condensed segmental
analysis have been re-presented to take into account of the effects of the application of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held
For Sale and discontinued operations. The Group’s condensed consolidated statement of other comprehensive income,
condensed consolidated statement of financial position and condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity are not
required to be re-presented.

Included in the net assets unbundled were 3 614 487 Bidvest shares (treasury shares) held by Bid Corporation Limited.
These shares have been treated as shares issued without a corresponding change in resources, in terms of IAS 33 Earnings
per Share, and the comparative total, weighted average and diluted weighted average number of shares in issue have been
restated to include these shares for the basic, diluted basic, headline and diluted headline earnings per share
calculations; and net asset and net tangible asset value per share calculations.
                                                                        
In addition, during the period certain operations were reclassified between segments. The comparative periods' segmental
information have been restated to reflect these insignificant changes.

Net acquisition of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments 
During the period the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Brandcorp Holdings Proprietary Limited (Brandcorp)
with effect from 1 October 2016. Brandcorp is a value-added distributor of niche industrial and consumer products trading
under the industrial brands, Matus, Rentech, Burncrete, Moto/Leisure Quip and consumer brands, Cellini and MIC Prestige. 
The acquisition forms part of the Bidvest Commercial Products segment and will enable the Group to expand its range of
complementary products and services provided by Bidvest Commercial Products. Although the acquisition has been funded
in the interim with a combination of short-term borrowings and existing cash resources the intention is to secure
long-term funding before the financial year end.
            
The Group also made a number of less significant acquisitions and disposals during the year. Certain of these
acquisitions resulted in insignificant bargain purchase gains. These acquisitions were funded from existing cash 
resources. 
           
The final accounting for all the acquisitions had not been completed at the time that these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements were issued. However the following table summarises the provisional amounts of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed which have been included in these results from the respective dates.

Subsequent event 
The directors are not aware of any other matters or circumstances arising after the reporting period up to the date of
this report not otherwise dealt with in this report that require an adjustment to the financial results at reporting 
date.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s investments of R2 828 million (H1 2016: R2 524 million) include R84 million (H1 2016: R497 million)
recorded at cost, R1 908 million (H1 2016: R1 040 million) recorded and measured at fair values using quoted prices 
(level 1) and R835 million (H1 2016: R987 million) recorded and measured at fair value using factors not based on 
observable data (level 3). Level 3 investments are valued using discounted cash flows with a discount rate of 15,3%
(H1 2016: 15,3%). Fair value losses on level 3 investments recognised in the income statement total R26 million 
(H1 2016: R60 million gain) and other reductions of R73 million relate to net sales and net foreign exchange losses 
of R1 million recognised in the currency translation reserve.

The carrying values all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of
borrowings of R11 939 million whose carrying value is R11 959 million.

TRADING STATEMENT

Bidvest is currently finalising its interim results for the period ended December 31 2016. The
interim results are expected to be released on SENS on Monday, February 27 2017.

Headline earnings per share for continuing operations is expected to be between 508,0 to 512,0
cents per share, relative to 489,0 cents per share for the prior comparative period, which
represents an increase of between 4% - 5%.

Bidvest’s basic earnings per share for continuing operations is anticipated to be 37% - 42%
higher than the prior comparative period of 420,9 cents per share and is expected to be
between 580,0 to 595,0 cents per share for the six months ended December 31 2016.
The difference in the increase between basic earnings and headline earnings per share is
primarily due to fair value capital gains arising from an increase in the market values of
associate companies, Adcock Ingram Holdings Limited and Comair Limited.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by Bidvest’s auditors.

THE BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED INVESTOR DAY - NOVEMBER 29 2016

Shareholders and interested investors are advised that Bidvest will be hosting an investor day
teleconference and pre-close operational update today at 15:00 (SA time). Dial in details for the
teleconference are provided below. An audio recording will be available for replay shortly after the event.

Trading environment
Market conditions remain challenging. Against this backdrop, trading results to date have been
satisfactory if not exciting. The quality of the earnings remains high. The seven South African trading
divisions have performed well in the first quarter of the financial year. This performance has been
counteracted to an extent by declines in horse mackerel and pilchard yields as well as reduced fishing
quotas at Bidvest Namibia and by mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio in the Corporate
office.

The Bidvest Freight division, Services division and Commercial Products division have achieved good
results and the Financial Services division is performing in line with expectations. The Automotive division
is holding its own despite a challenging market that shows no signs of improvement, while the Office and
Print division continues to experience subdued conditions and the Electrical division continues to face
very difficult trading conditions in its core industries.

Expense control and asset management remain key focus areas and are well controlled.

The Brandcorp acquisition has been approved and has been implemented with effect from 1 October
2016.

Bidvest is one of the largest employers in South Africa with more than 112 000 employees. In light of the
recently announced minimum wage recommendations, Bidvest has undertaken an impact analysis of the
implementation of the minimum wage across its operations. The group is pleased to note that despite its
large workforce, group wages are above these thresholds and the implementation of the current
requirements will have a negligible financial impact on operations.

Prospects

The Group’s financial position remains sound, cash generation continues to be strong and we retain
adequate headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic.
The macroeconomic environment in South Africa remains a major concern, with no GDP growth expected
for the current year and modest growth at best expected over the medium term. Compounding the
economic situation, is the uncertain socio-political environment that is not conducive for foreign and
domestic investment.

We are actively seeking bolt on acquisitions and exploring international opportunities while our Other
Assets and Investments are constantly being reviewed. These assets will be dealt with appropriately in
due course.

This announcement and any forward looking statements have not been reviewed by the auditors.

Bidvest successfully unbundled its food service operations and separately listed Bid Corporation Limited (“Bidcorp”) on the 
JSE on May 30  2016. The unbundling transaction resulted in an accounting profit of R76,3 billion, which was distributed to
shareholders by way of a dividend in specie on May 30 2016.

The food services business has been treated as a discontinued operation and comparatives have been re-presented
accordingly, and the details thereof have been disclosed in the financial statements. The commentary in this 
announcement  will focus on Bidvest’s continuing operations. 

The successful and value enhancing unbundling has allowed Bidvest’s management team to move forward with a refocused
platform from which to pursue growth.  Bidvest will benefit from a greater visibility of its continued operations and
their potential values.

Message to shareholders

Highlights
The Group has delivered creditable trading results against the backdrop of challenging market conditions in the
southern African region. The Commercial Products, Financial Services, Electrical and Services divisions delivered 
improved contributions, while the Freight division’s trading profit was marginally lower than last year, largely as a 
result of declining commodity volumes due to the slow-down in the resources sector. Automotive has been negatively 
affected by the decline in vehicle sales, while Office and Print disposed of the Océ business and did not repeat a 
large export order in this financial year. Bidvest Namibia continues to be impacted by declining fish quotas.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for continuing operations increased by 2,5% to 1 054,1 cents (2015: 1 028,9 cents).
The mark-to-market alignment of our listed associates and investments including the R595 million impairment of Adcock
Ingram, reduced basic earnings per share (EPS) for continuing operations by 28,6% to 692,6 cents (2015: 969,9 cents). 

Financial overview
Revenue increased 3,6% to R68,2 billion (2015: R65,9 billion).

Gross profit margin increased to 29,2% (2015: 28,8%). This improvement is a consequence of portfolio mix benefits
achieved by shedding low margin revenue through the disposal of the Cash-in-Transit business in 2015 and the acquisition 
of better margin businesses such as Novel and Plumblink in 2016. Operating expenses increased by 6,3%, while the operating
expense ratio at 21,4% (2015: 20,8%) edged up slightly. 

Trading profit rose by 3,0% to R5,8 billion (2015: R5,6 billion) and the trading profit margin was stable at 8,4%. 
The main contributors to the increase were the Commercial Products, Financial Services, Electrical and Services
divisions, as well as Bidvest Properties.

Net finance charges were 13,7% higher at R922 million (2015: R811 million), with the increase largely attributable to
the various acquisitions, an increased prime interest rate, as well as finance raised to acquire additional Adcock
Ingram shares. 

Profits from associate earnings reflected a decline of 25,9% after the write off of non-headline items in associates.
Prior to these non-headline items, the share of profit from associates increased by 5%. 

Headline earnings increased by 3,6% to R3,5 billion. 

Cash generated by operations at R7,0 billion was, on a like-for-like basis, 17% higher than the R6,0 billion generated
in the prior year. The Group released R296 million of working capital in 2016 compared to an absorption of R725 million
in 2015. This reflects an excellent working capital management result. 

Net debt decreased from R7,8 billion to R5,0 billion in the main as a consequence of the unbundling. 

Bidvest remains well capitalised in line with its conservative approach to gearing, with EBITDA interest cover at 
8,0 times (2015: 8,7 times). This is comfortably above the Group’s conservative self-imposed target, providing ample
capacity for further expansion.

Acquisitions
In the first half of the year, Plumblink was acquired in South Africa; and Novel Ford in Namibia. In the second half
of the year, Bidvest Insurance acquired Glassock & Associates. 

After year-end, Bidvest announced the acquisition of 100% of Brandcorp, which will enable Bidvest to add various niche
industrial and consumer products into its portfolio of existing services and offerings. The acquisition is very close
to finalisation pending final Competition Tribunal approval. The Brandcorp portfolio will form part of the Bidvest’s
Commercial Products division.

At divisional level, we have continued to make a variety of bolt-on acquisitions such as Bidvest Insurance’s purchase
of FMI, a life insurance underwriting manager.

Prospects
Bidvest’s internal divisional restructuring and the unbundling of the food services unit, has positioned the Group
well for its next growth phase. Bidvest’s management teams, which are unchanged following the restructuring initiatives,
remain focused on moving their respective divisions further up the value curve. 
The Group’s financial position remains sound, cash generation is strong and it retains adequate headroom to
accommodate expansion opportunities. At  corporate and operational level, management is assessing and implementing
plans for real growth and pursuing selective local and international opportunities to complement the existing product and
service offering. Our Other Assets and Investments will also be very closely scrutinised and decisions will be taken on 
the best way forward for these assets. 

As one of South Africa’s largest employers and a significant investor in the local economy, Bidvest shares the concerns that 
have been raised by business leadership relating to the ongoing disruption of some of our country’s most important economic 
institutions. We appeal for a rapid resolution of this current state of affairs.

Divisional review
Services 
This is a large and diverse division operating in numerous areas of service. The business has operated well and
remains resilient to the volatility of economic cycles recording an increase in operating profit of 6,0%. The Cash-In-Transit
business that was sold in 2015 has been included in the prior-year results for seven months. Excellent results were
posted by BidAir, Security, Cleaning and Bidtrack.

Freight
Global freight trade remained depressed, and as a consequence, volumes declined. This division’s focus in 2016 has
therefore been on innovation and flexibility in an effort to contain costs and enhance efficiencies. The 3,8% decline in
trading profit is considered satisfactory given the significant decline in the movement of commodities - particularly
minerals - out of the country. Grain imports assisted marginally in the last quarter. The continued import of grain will be
positive for this division in the new financial year. 

Office and Print 
Growth and spending within corporate South Africa remains constrained, which culminated in a 4,9% decline in trading
profit for the year, after the delivery of pleasing results for the first half. The second half performance in the prior
year included a significant once-off profit of an export contract and the inclusion of Océ, which was subsequently sold.
Excellent results were reported in Konica Minolta, Silveray, Cecil Nurse, Kolok, and a number of the Paper and Print
businesses, reflecting a double digit increase.

Automotive 
The Motor Retail and Car Rental divisions performed in line with a depressed motor retail market. The market was
impacted by a general decline in demand, particularly in the luxury vehicle sector, as well as high vehicle inflation and
severe margin pressure in new vehicles. The net result was a 7,8% decline in trading profit. The second-hand vehicle market
is beginning to show more activity. This division includes a number of brands that have performed poorly and which the
Group is in the process of exiting. 

Financial Services
Bidvest Bank and the Insurance division performed well. Bidvest Bank improved trading profit by 30%, and the insurance
company performed satisfactorily, but was impacted by the decline in the mark-to-market profits of its equity
portfolio. This division posted an overall increased trading profit of 10,4%. 

Commercial Products 
The division produced outstanding results across the board. Of the 10 business units in the division, eight achieved
strong double-digit increases in profit and, together with the Plumblink acquisition which exceeded management’s
expectation, delivered a 41,8% increase in trading profit. At the end of the financial year, Bidvest announced its intention 
to acquire 100% of Brandcorp, which is now in the final stages of Competition Tribunal approval. Cash generation was
strong, considering that volumes are under pressure as a result of the continued subdued market conditions. 

Electrical 
The division faced difficult trading conditions in its core industries - construction, mining and Government
infrastructure spend. The increase in turnover of 2,3% improved margin, and an increase in trading profit of 4,1% is 
commendable. Management has been successful in diversifying its income streams into renewable energy (solar geysers) 
and retrofitting low power consumption lighting (LED technology), which has benefited the profit performance in the 
current year. 

Bidvest Namibia (52% share)
Macro-economic factors contributed to a disappointing overall performance, with the trading profit declining 25,9%, as
fishing quotas were once again reduced. The size of the vessel fleet is being reduced and cost-reduction programmes
have been put in place. The Commercial Products, Freight and Distribution businesses continue to suffer from the weak
economy, while the recently acquired Novel Motors has performed in line with management expectations. All other businesses 
in this division showed a double-digit increase in performance. 

Bidvest Corporate and Investments
Bidvest Properties performed well and continues to be of key strategic importance to the Group. Ontime Automotive and
the DH Mansfield Group, both in the UK, remained loss making and will be addressed in the 2017 financial year. 

Directorate
There were various changes to the board during the year. These included: 
• Mr Alfred de Costa retired on November 23  2015
• Mrs Flora Nolwandle Mantashe resigned on September 23  2015
• Mr Donald Masson passed away on March 20  2016
• Mr Paul Baloyi resigned from the board on August 5  2016
• As a consequence of the unbundling, on May 16  2016:
  - Mr Brian Joffe retired as chief executive of Bidvest. Mr Joffe continues to serve on the board as a 
    non-executive director 
  - Mr Lindsay Ralphs was appointed as chief executive of Bidvest
  - Mr Bernard Berson resigned as executive director
  - Mr David Cleasby resigned as executive director
  - Mr Peter Meijer was appointed as an executive director and group financial director.

The board and management of Bidvest wish to thank these board members for their valued contribution over the 
past few years.

We pay tribute to Mr Brian Joffe who now has the distinction of having created two exceptional groups in one
generation. We are intent on striving to perpetuate the business heritage that he has built.

Dividend declaration
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 232 cents 
(197,2000 cents net of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share for the year ended 
June 30  2016 to those members registered on the record date, being Friday, September 23  2016. This brings 
the total dividend for the year to 714 cents per share (2015: 909 cents). The full dividend for the year 
needs to be viewed in the context of the interim dividend of 482 cents which was paid as part of the larger 
Group, prior to unbundling.

The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend withholding tax of 15% will be applicable to 
all shareholders who are not exempt.

sale and discontinued operations. The Group’s condensed consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, condensed
consolidated statement of financial position and condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity are not required
to be re-presented.

Included in the net assets unbundled were 3 614 487 Bidvest shares (treasury shares) held by Bid Corporation Limited.
These shares have been treated as shares issued without a corresponding change in resources, in terms of IAS 33
Earnings per share, and the current and comparative total, weighted average and diluted weighted average number of shares 
in issue have been restated to include these shares for the basic, diluted basic, headline and diluted headline earnings per
share calculations; and the net asset and net tangible assets values per share calculations.

In addition, during the year certain operations were reclassified between segments. The comparative year’s segmental
information has been re-presented to reflect these insignificant changes.

Discontinued operations
On May 16 2016 the shareholders approved the unbundling and separate listing (unbundling) of the Group’s foodservices
businesses as Bid Corporation Limited (Bidcorp) via a distribution in specie. This unbundling was undertaken in order to
implement a strategic decision to restructure the business operations and management focus of the Group and to provide
shareholders with the opportunity to participate directly in the Group’s foodservices operations.
The fair value of Bidcorp was determined with reference to the volume weighted average price of Bidcorp’s trading on
the JSE over the first ten days of trading, being 27 818 cents per share.

The contribution of discontinued (Bidcorp) operations included in the Group’s results until the loss of control is detailed below:

Net acquisition of businesses, subsidiaries, associates and investments 
The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Plumblink SA Proprietary Limited (Plumblink) with effect from 
July 1  2015. Plumblink is a specialist plumbing and bathroom merchant currently operating from 61 branches strategically
situated throughout South Africa. The acquisition forms part of the Bidvest Commercial Products segment and will enable 
the Group to expand its range of complementary products and services provided by Bidvest Commercial Products and, as a
consequence, broaden the Group’s base in the market place.

A 100% shareholding in International Capital Investments Proprietary Limited trading as Novel Motor Company and Lenkow
Proprietary Limited (Novel) was acquired by the Group with effect July 31  2015. The acquisition forms part of the
Bidvest Namibia segment and is in line with this segment’s strategy to diversify its business portfolio. Novel Motor 
Company is a well-known vehicle dealership in Namibia.

A further 2,5 million Adcock Ingram Holdings Limited (Adcock) ordinary shares were acquired from Adcock’s black
economic empowerment (BEE) partners, Blue Falcon Trading 69 Proprietary Limited and the Mpho ea Bophelo Trust for a cash
consideration of R52,00 per Adcock ordinary share in July 2015.

At the end of July 2015 the Group supported the new Adcock BEE scheme (Scheme) and sold 15% of its Adcock shareholding
to Ad-izinyosi, a new broad-based empowerment entity, for a minimum price of R52,00 and a maximum price of R72,00 per
Adcock ordinary share, to be settled on the fourth anniversary of the date that the Scheme became operative.

In addition to these transactions, the Group acquired a further 1,2 million shares, on the market, at an average price
of R41,08 per share. Following these transactions the Group holds 38,4% of the net ordinary shares in issue in Adcock,
but account for 45,0% of its results as a consequence of treating the sale of 15% of its holding in terms of the new
Adcock BEE Scheme to Ad-izinyosi, as a deferred sale.  

The Group also made a number of less significant acquisitions and disposals during the year. Certain of these
acquisitions resulted in insignificant bargain purchase gains.

The acquisitions were funded from its existing cash resources.

The following table summarises the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been included
in these results from the respective acquisition and disposal dates.

The acquisition of Plumblink contributed R1 528 million to revenue and R86 million to operating profit. Similarly, the Novel acquisition 
contributed R778 million to revenue and R45 million to operating profit and would have contributed R855 million to revenue and R51 million 
to operating profit, had the acquisition been effective July 1  2015.                                                                                                                                                                   

Subsequent events
The Group has entered into a binding agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of and equity loan claims against
Brandcorp Holdings Proprietary Limited (Brandcorp). Brandcorp is a holding company of businesses involved in the distribution
and reselling of a wide range of niche, high-quality industrial and consumer products in southern Africa. Brandcorp owns
well-known brands across its individual businesses, as well as distribution rights (exclusive and otherwise) for leading
local and international brands. The board considers the Brandcorp acquisition to present an attractive investment
opportunity which is aligned with Bidvest’s proven strategy of expanding its business operations through value accretive
acquisitions. Brandcorp will form a part of Bidvest’s Commercial Products division and it is expected that the Group will
complement Brandcorp’s offering, and opportunities exist for the Group and Brandcorp to leverage off each other’s client
base, expertise, resources and network to significantly grow revenue and earnings. The Brandcorp acquisition is still
subject to regulatory and other conditions typical for a transaction of this nature.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s investments of R2 870 million (2015: R2 551 million) include R89 million (2015: R431 million) recorded at
cost, R1 846 million (2015: R1 273 million) recorded and measured at fair value using quoted prices (level 1) and 
R935 million (2015: R847 million) recorded and measured at fair value using factors not based on observable data (level 3).
Level 3 investments are valued using discounted cash flows with a discount rate of 15,3% (2015: 15,3%). Fair value gains
recognised in the income statement total R94 million (2015: R118 million) and other reductions of R7 million relate to
net sales and net foreign exchange gains of R2 million recognised in the currency translation reserve.

The carrying values all financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values, with the exception of
borrowings of R8 965 million whose carrying value is R8 982 million.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT – ACQUISITION OF BRANDCORP HOLDINGS PROPRIETARY
LIMITED

Bidvest is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire 100% of the
shares of and equity loan claims against Brandcorp Holdings Proprietary Limited (“Brandcorp” or the
“Business”), from Ethos Private Equity and management (the “Brandcorp Acquisition”).

Brandcorp is a holding company of businesses involved in the distribution and reselling of a wide range
of niche, high-quality industrial and consumer products in southern Africa. Brandcorp owns well-known
brands across its individual businesses, as well as distribution rights (exclusive and otherwise) for
leading local and international brands. The Business operates under two distinct platforms, the
Industrial Division and Consumer Division.

Industrial Division

-   Matus: A market leader in the distribution of hand tools, general hardware, welding equipment and
    power tools
-   Renttech: provider of a comprehensive range of industrial rentals and supply of welding machines
    and generator sets to a number of sectors and industries
-   Burncrete: provider of lifting, rigging, pulling and lashing equipment to a number of sectors and
    industries

Consumer Division

-   Interbrand: designs, procures, distributes and retails luggage, travel accessories and related
    products through its own retail stores (including airports), independents and large retailers. Owner
    of the highly fashionable and distinctive Cellini brand
-   Moto and Leisure Quip: distributor of motor vehicle accessories, camping and outdoor equipment to
    the retail market
-   MIC: distributes branded dinnerware, homeware and table top products into the retail market


Each business is managed by an autonomous managerial team with a strong entrepreneurial focus.
These teams are expected to readily fit into Bidvest’s decentralised operational management structure.

The board of directors of Bidvest considers the Brandcorp Acquisition to present an attractive
investment opportunity which is aligned with Bidvest’s proven strategy of expanding its business
operations through value accretive acquisitions. Bidvest’s Commercial Products division (“BCP”), which
Brandcorp will form a part off, includes various industrial and consumer businesses such as G.Fox,
Plumblink, Home of Living Brands, Berzacks, Yamaha and Academy Brushware. BCP could
complement Brandcorp’s offering and opportunities exist for both BCP and Brandcorp to leverage off
each other’s client base, expertise, resources and network to significantly grow revenue and earnings.


The Brandcorp Acquisition falls below the threshold of the categorisation of transactions which require
disclosure in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.

The Brandcorp Acquisition is subject to regulatory and other conditions typical for a transaction of this
nature. A further announcement regarding the implementation of this transaction will be made as and
when appropriate.

1. INTRODUCTION


    On April 14 2016, Bidvest issued a circular (“the Circular”) to its shareholders (“Shareholders”) in
    relation to the unbundling by Bidvest of all of its shares held in Bid Corporation Limited
    (“BidCorp”) to Shareholders (“the Unbundling”), and the listing of BidCorp on the main board of
    the JSE Limited (“the JSE”) on May 30 2016. Under the terms of the Unbundling, eligible
    shareholders (which term excludes certain foreign shareholders affected by the laws of their
    relevant jurisdiction) were entitled to receive one BidCorp share for every one Bidvest share held
    by them on June 3 2016.


    A number of such foreign shareholders elected to follow procedures that allowed them to receive
    their BidCorp shares, notwithstanding the exclusion referred to above. On June 3 2016,
    Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited (“the Transfer Secretaries”), notified Bidvest
    and BidCorp that foreign Shareholders holding 18,419,929 Bidvest shares had indicated their
    inability to receive such BidCorp shares.

    In accordance with the terms of the Unbundling set out in the Circular, such BidCorp shares will
    be disposed of for cash with the proceeds (determined on the basis set out in the Circular) paid to
    the relevant Shareholders. Due to the number of such BidCorp shares to be sold by Bidvest, the
    Board of Directors of Bidvest have resolved to proceed with the sale by way of an accelerated
    bookbuild placing (the “Placing”).

2. THE PLACING

    In terms of the Placing, up to 18,419,929 BidCorp ordinary shares (“Placing Shares”) will become
    available for sale to qualifying institutional investors through the Placing.

    The books of the Placing will open with immediate effect. The timing of closing of the books will
    be at the absolute discretion of the Managers (as defined below). Pricing and allocations of the
    Placing will be determined as soon as practicable following the closing of the book. The sale is
    subject to demand, price and market conditions.

    The Placing process will be subject to normal share trading practices, the relevant rules,
    regulations and procedures of the JSE, the applicable law and the settlement authority of Strate
    Proprietary Limited.

    The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited is acting as sole global coordinator, joint bookrunner
    and transaction sponsor and Merrill Lynch International as joint bookrunner (together “the
    Managers”) in relation to the Placing.

    The Seller is conducting the Placing on an undocumented basis – no prospectus, offering circular,
    pre-listing statement or other offering document has been or will be published in connection with
    the Placing. Potential investors in the Placing should take into account all publicly available
    information in relation to BidCorp before making an investment decision.

   the balance of these costs will still be reflected in respect of the retained Bidvest ordinary
   shares.

2. Apportionment tax principles

   Shareholders will have a combined expenditure in respect of the Bidvest ordinary shares
   and the BidCorp ordinary shares received pursuant to the Unbundling.

   Bidvest ordinary shares held as trading stock: Any Bidvest Shareholder holding Bidvest
   shares as trading stock will be deemed to acquire the unbundled BidCorp ordinary
   shares as trading stock. The combined expenditure of such Bidvest and Bidcorp ordinary
   shares will be the amount taken into account by the Shareholder in respect of those
   Bidvestordinary shares, as contemplated in section 11(a), section 22(1), or section 22(2)
   of the Income Tax Act. The portion of the above combined expenditure to be allocated to
   the unbundled BidCorp ordinary shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the
   market value of the BidCorp ordinary shares bears to the sum of the market value of
   Bidvest and BidCorp ordinary shares at the end of the date of Unbundling, being May 30
   2016 . The expenditure so allocated to the unbundled BidCorp ordinary shares will
   reduce the expenditure relating to the Bidvest ordinary shares so retained.

   Bidvest shares held as capital assets: Any Bidvest Shareholder holding Bidvest ordinary
   shares as capital assets will be deemed to acquire the unbundled BidCorp ordinary
   shares as capital assets. The combined expenditure of such Bidvest and BidCorp
   ordinary shares will be the original expenditure incurred in respect of the Bidvest ordinary
   shares, in terms of paragraph 20 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, and
   where the Bidvest ordinary shares were acquired before October 1 2001, the
   expenditure and/or market value, as the case may be, adopted or determined as
   contemplated in paragraph 29 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The portion
   of the above combined expenditure to be allocated to the unbundled BidCorp ordinary
   shares will be determined by applying the ratio that the expenditure and/or market value,
   as the case may be of the BidCorp ordinary shares bears to the sum of the expenditure
   and/or market value, as the case may be, of Bidvest and BidCorp ordinary shares at the
   end of the date of Unbundling, being May 30 2016. The expenditure and market value,
   as the case may be, so allocated to the unbundled BidCorp ordinary shares will reduce
   the expenditure and market value of the Bidvest ordinary shares that are retained.

   Shareholders are advised to consult their own professional tax advisors should they
   have any queries regarding the taxation consequences of the Unbundling and the
   calculation of their costs for taxation purposes.


3. Apportionment ratio

   Pursuant to the Binding Class Ruling obtained, Shareholders are hereby advised that the
   expenditure and market value, as the case may be, of their Bidvest ordinary shares as
   referred to above must be apportioned in the ratio of 28.05585% to a Bidvest ordinary
   share held after the Unbundling and 71.94415% to an unbundled BidCorp ordinary share
   (“Apportionment Ratios”).

   The Apportionment Ratios are based on the closing price of R 118.55 per Bidvest share
   and R 304.00 per BidCorp share on May 30 2016 being the Unbundling date.

                                            19 May 2016
Following shareholder approval and in accordance with the 1 for 1 unbundling terms for BidCorp Ltd
(South Africa, ZAE000216537, BZBFKT7) by Bidvest Group (South Africa, ZAE000117321, 6100089)
which is expected to become effective Monday 30 May 2016, the following index treatment is anticipated
in the FTSE/JSE Africa Index Series:

Friday 27 May 2016 after close (i.e. effective from open Monday 30 May 2016)

BidCorp Ltd will be added to the same FTSE/JSE Indexes (including the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index) of which
Bidvest Group is an index constituent. There will be no index divisor changes.

Monday 30 May 2016 after close

FTSE/JSE will rank the constituents of all indexes with a fixed number of constituents by full market
capitalisation as at close of business.

Eg. FTSE/JSE will rank the constituents of the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index and the FTSE/JSE Mid Cap Index
by full market capitalisation as at close of business. The lowest ranking FTSE/JSE Top 40 constituent will
become a constituent of the FTSE/JSE Mid Cap and the lowest ranking constituent of the FTSE/JSE Mid
Cap will, in turn, become a constituent of the FTSE/JSE Small Cap Index.

FTSE/JSE will issue a further notice to confirm these resulting changes.

Tuesday 31 May 2016 after close (i.e. effective from open Wednesday 01 June 2016)

changes and become effective from Wednesday 01 June 2016.

between 30 May and 31 May 2016 inclusive.


FTSE/JSE will issue a further notice after close on Wednesday 25 May 2016 to confirm details for the
various FTSE/JSE Africa Index series that will be impacted by this event.

Impact on the June 2016 FTSE/JSE Africa Index Series Quarterly Review:

The unbundling of BidCorp Ltd from Bidvest Group occurs after the review cut date and before the review
outcome is published and hence the results of the corporate action may impact the June review,
particularly for indices with a fixed number of constituents. The final review changes published on 1 June
2016 will incorporate the impact of the unbundling.

Divisional Day – May 12 2016

Management update on the strategy and general trading conditions in
the Bidvest Industrial and Bidvest Namibian operations only (in light of
the proposed unbundling of the foodservice business)


Shareholders are advised that the executive management of Bidvest
(excluding foodservice) met on May 12 2016 with members of the financial
community, including shareholders and financial analysts, for an update on
current market conditions and the trading environment across the Industrial
and Namibian operations.

Management commented as follows:

1. Bidvest Group (ex Foodservice) overview

   • An inaugural international road show has recently been completed
      indicating overall positive sentiment and an increased understanding of
      the Industrial operations of the Group.
   • The pleasing performance of the Industrial businesses within a
      challenging southern African economy has been testament to
      management’s commitment and experience.
   • Management remains focused on executing on the strategic
      decentralised entrepreneurial plan to organically grow their businesses,
      establishing market leading positions within their industries and on
      adding value to their customer offering through innovation and service
      delivery.

   •   The proposed unbundling would result in Bidvest being a locally based
       and focused trading, services and distribution business made up of
       approximately R100bn of Revenue and EBITDA of R7bn (EBITDA
       margin 8%), based on the previous years audited results.

   •   This business is structured in seven divisions, each entrepreneurially
       run and managed by industry specialists on a decentralised basis.

   •   Employing approximately 120,000 people, the business has shown
       historically solid growth, been highly cash generative and delivered a
       pre-capex operating cash conversion ratio in excess of 80-90%.
   •   This business is largely southern African focused with some exposure
       to neighboring Mauritius and other southern African environments. The
       opportunity post-unbundling exists to grow these operations beyond
       the South African borders, starting in niche industries where the
       business model can be exported and grown over time.

   •   The executive team driving this business has a long standing record of
       working together under the guidance of Brian Joffe and are committed
       to the Bidvest culture and decentralised operating philosophy.

   •   The post-unbundling board will remain largely the same, with Brian
       Joffe taking on a non-executive directorship and a consultancy role,
       focused on assisting with strategic initiatives. Bernard Berson and
       David Cleasby will resign upon unbundling.


2. Divisional review

   • Bidvest is recognised for its strategy of both organic and acquisitive
      growth, and this will continue to be an area of focus.
   • Trading remains positive, activity levels across most markets are
      resilient and management are expecting results for the year ending
      June 2016 similar to H1 F2016.
   • A significant acquisition will be concluded early in the new financial
      year, strengthening the Commercial Products division. Recent
      acquisitions such as Plumblink and Academy Brushware have both
      significantly contributed to the strategy of scaling up the Commercial
      Products division.
   • Some small disposals may be considered, but these would not impact
      materially on the Group.

   Automotive
      • A cyclical business that is currently halfway through an estimated
        four year downturn, results will be lower than the comparative
        period to June 2015.
      • Management are comfortable with the business model and market
        reach in South Africa, and do not intend internationalising these
        operations in the foreseeable future.

   Freight
      • For the first time in fifteen years, the Freight business is struggling
         as the lower commodities cycle impacts the flow of manganese,
         steel and other products out of the South African ports.
      • Some benefit is anticipated in H2 F2016 as the drought results in
         imported maize but this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover the loss
         experienced in the current commodity down cycle.

   Commercial Products
     • Management are particularly pleased with the performance of this
       division. Most likely to deliver similar growth as shown in H1 F2016.
   •   Acquisitions of Plumblink and previously Academy Brushware have
       contributed to the good performance.
   •   Some international expansion is likely in this division, however not
       in those operations where Bidvest is restricted through agency
       agreements (Yamaha for example).

Electrical
   • Management is very proud of the performance of this division,
       growing organically in spite of the weak infrastructural investment in
       the country.
   • Double digit growth is anticipated as a result of continued strong
       operating performance and strategic focus into niche markets.
   • No international expansion is intended for this division in the short
       term, they remain focused on being the largest electrical wholesaler
       in southern Africa.

Financial services
   • Bidvest Bank is a specialist bank, and have positioned themselves
      as the best foreign exchange service provider in the country.

   •   Specialised forex services, such as offering the facility of 22
       different currencies on a single cash card have created a unique
       niche offering.

   •   Fleet finance services have grown significantly and with significant
       potential in the parastatal area, good growth should continue.

   •   Insurance product offering has diversified from vehicle insurance
       products to both short and long term offerings; supported by
       expansion in the travel insurance industry.

   •   The equity portfolio performed significantly worse on the prior year,
       but this is cyclical and is subject to broader economic influences.

   •   Financial services will not be an international growth area, but will
       continue to expand its local market presence.


Office & Print
   • The 2015 voter registration project in Tanzania significantly boosted
       profits reported in the prior period, and will not be repeated in
       F2016. However electoral technologies have positioned the division
       well to provide similar voter registration services to other countries
       and management are positive about these prospects.

   •   Paper continues to be a declining market and management
       continue to digitise where possible. Konica Minolta continues to
       perform well and Walton’s is still in recovery mode. The Post Office
       strike had a significant negative impact on operational performance
       of this division.

   •   Management do not intend to grow this operation internationally
       beyond the provision of the technological solutions developed.


Services
   • Services is the largest of all the divisions, with an EBITDA of
      approximately R1,8bn.

   •   Bidvest Steiner is the most significant business within this division,
       having grown organically over the number of years to having an
       EBITDA of R400m and is the number one operator in South Africa,
       in spite of competition from many international players.

   •   This division is likely to be our key focus area for international
       expansion. Management have identified fragmented international
       markets where they can draw on their experience, acquire locally
       established businesses and grow a unified single product offering to
       compete in these new markets. Opportunities have been identified
       in Italy and the UK.

   •   Industrial Services continues to deliver cash generative growth
       results.

   •   Management will allocate capital to this division to pursue
       expansion and are excited about the possibilities.


Namibia
  • The ability to secure adequate quota remains a key challenge in the
     Namibian horse mackerel market. Discussions with government
     continue with no clear indication of resolution as yet. Resolution of
     the quota issue will be a significant indicator as to whether or not
     we will continue to operate in the fishing industry.

   •   Commercial and industrial businesses in Namibia are similar to their
       South African counterparts. The recently acquired Automotive
       business is performing well. Food and distribution is delivering
       pleasing results. Freight and logistics are in a similar down cycle as
       reflected in the Freight division in South Africa.


Properties
   • A significant R6-7bn portfolio of strategically owned properties
     allows us enough headroom to generate capital should it be
     required.
       •   No short term intention to make any significant changes to this
           portfolio.


   Material associate investments
     • A number of material associate investments will remain in the
         Group structure post unbundling. Most notably Adcock (37%),
         Comair (26%), Cullinan (20%), MIAL and various others such as
         Cargo Carriers.

       •   These assets will comprise a significantly larger part of Bidvest post
           the unbundling and the strategic nature of these need to be critically
           re-evaluated by management over time.

       •   Other assets comprise the internationally owned Ontime GATS and
           The Mansfield Group businesses in the UK and will fall under
           divisional management going forward.


3. Financial review

   • Financial disciplines continue to be strong and make up a large part of
      the Bidvest DNA. Management of working capital is a core focus.
   • Bidvest operate a working capital cycle that sees absorption up to
      December, a small spike in March but a significant recovery at year
      end.
   • Management of cash flow before and after capex is a key performance
      indicator, with targets of in excess of 80% conversion of operating profit
      into cash.
   • Dividend policy remains unchanged at 2.25x cover.
   • Key internal controls assured through an independent internal audit
      process with strong IT capabilities ensure a good platform for
      sustainable business growth.

4. Business development and Transformation

   • Bidvest has responded well to the new BEE codes, with each division
     being individually assessed. Overall a Level 4 has been obtained for
     the Bidvest Group. No significant contracts have been lost as a result
     of the new BEE codes and we continue to be committed to CSI and
     procurement initiatives that support the requirements of the BEE
     codes.
   • Executive training and development remain a core focus of our
     executive team, growing talent through our internal programs such as
     the Bidvest Academy.

   •   There are no changes to the shareholding from a BEE perspective.
       Post the unbundling the current 62% black owned shareholding will
       remain however this may change over time depending on the makeup
       of the share register.

   •   Business development remain a core focus for the executive team.
       Clients are looking for the best product and best service at the best
       price which is resulting in some pressure on margins however volumes
       are growing.

   •   Our African growth strategy remains focused on Sub-Saharan Africa;
       East and West Africa has shown high levels of risk and volatility
       currently beyond our appetite.


5. General

   •   Bidvest continues to differentiate itself through its entrepreneurial
       culture. The executive management team has been around a long time
       and are committed to this culture. Younger divisional management
       teams have grown into their roles through the Bidvest ranks and have
       shown their ability to deliver within the unique decentralized
       entrepreneurial Bidvest model.

   •   Management remain focused on our chosen markets, steering away
       from pure retail, IT, manufacturing, mining and resources industries.
       We maintain light head office structures, and a divisional management
       team that is accountable for their performance.

   •   Management is highly motivated by challenge and the opportunity
       presented by the unbundling and are excited about continuing to grow
       off the current solid platform.

VOLUNTARY SHAREHOLDER UPDATE

Ratings actions from Moody’s Investors Service

-   Moody Investors Services upgrades Bidvest’s National Scale Rating to Aa1.za
    from A1.za

-   Bidvest assigned a Baa2 local currency global scale long-term and Prime-2 (P-2)
    short-term issuer rating

Moody’s Investors Services (MIS) has informed Bidvest that following a revision of its
National Scale Ratings (NSR) methodology for South Africa, MIS has recalibrated
Bidvest’s national scale long-term issuer ratings up 3 levels to Aa1.za from A1.za.

MIS has also for the first time published Bidvest’s global scale ratings (GSRs). As a
result, MIS has assigned Bidvest a Baa2 local currency global scale long-term and
Prime-2 (P-2) short-term issuer ratings.

These actions follow the publication of MIS’s updated methodology ""Mapping Moody's
National Scale Ratings from Global Scale Ratings"".

At the same time, as a consequence of the proposed unbundling of the foodservice
businesses from Bidvest, MIS has assigned a negative ratings outlook pending a full
analysis.

David Cleasby, Bidvest Group Financial Director commented, “It is pleasing that our
National Scale Rating is positioned more positively and has been recalibrated upwards
by 3 notches. The negative outlook that has been assigned to Bidvest is due to the
potential credit implications of the unbundling the Foodservice businesses, which if
approved by shareholders on the May 16 2016 would become effective at end May
2016”.

MIS said in its statement that the assignment of Baa2/P-2 local currency global scale
issuer ratings reflects Bidvest’s:

-   Strong operational and financial profile;
-   Diversified sources of revenue across a range of businesses;
-   Solid international footprint with a focus on Southern Africa, the UK and Europe,
    with an expanding presence in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and
    Latin America;
-   History of low financial debt leverage, with healthy interest cover and good cash
    flow generation in the context of the high volume, low margin nature of many of
    its activities; and
-   Experienced management team with a successful track record of organic growth
    and growth through acquisitions, which have been effectively integrated into the
    Bidvest network where appropriate while being managed on a decentralized
    basis.

Divisional Day – May 4 2016

Management update on general trading conditions in the foodservice
operations only


Shareholders are advised that the executive management of the Foodservice
group on May 4 2016 met with members of the financial community, including
shareholders and financial analysts, for an update on current market
conditions and the trading environment across the foodservice operations.

Management commented as follows:

1. Foodservice Group current market conditions and trading

   - The pleasing performance of the foodservice businesses has been
     achieved against a backdrop of zero food inflation, in relatively
     negative circumstances globally.
   - Management remains focused on executing on the strategic plan to
     balance their customer portfolios and on adding value to their customer
     offering through innovation and service delivery.
   - Trading remains positive, activity levels across all markets are buoyant
     and management are expecting good results for the year ending June
     2016.

   United Kingdom (“UK”)
      - The businesses continue to grow relatively well in both foodservice
         and fresh offerings. The foodservice market is a highly fragmented
         industry which presenting lots of opportunity.
      - Logistics remains a tough business driven by a few large customers
         and tight margins.
      - Some uncertainty exists around Brexit which is dampening
         consumer confidence however our operations remain agile and
         opportunistic enough to adapt to the changing conditions.

   Europe
      - Western European growth remains sluggish however Eastern
        Europe is experiencing stronger growth conditions.
      - Our Foodservice operations in this region are realizing the benefits
        of timely restructuring and infrastructural investment.
      - DAC Italy has settled in well post acquisition and is exploring
        expansion opportunities. Global procurement benefits in Italian
        product are being realized across the group.
   -   Czech (Nowaco) has benefitted from excellent ice cream sales; but
       we continue to focus on growth of core wholesale business in
       Czech, Slovakia and Poland.
   -   The Belgium business is experiencing a tough trading environment.
       The Netherlands business is delivering positive growth as
       management focus on moving away from the previous institutionally
       focused customer model.
   -   Spain is a good market where we remain committed to accessing
       the right opportunity.
   -   Further expansion into the region will be considered as we are not
       represented or underrepresented in many countries.

Asia
   - China presents a huge growth opportunity with a growing middle
     class population and increasing demand for Western styled food
     products. Organic expansion over the past 8 years of operating in
     China has seen expansion into 12 cities – creating a geographic
     reach and operational platform that bodes well for future growth.
   - Hong Kong has experienced tough trading off lower tourism activity.
   - Singapore is well positioned having fully transitioned to a
     foodservice model, benefitting from no longer being commodity
     traders.
   - Further expansion into this region is being explored, using
     Singapore as a base for countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam.
     Indonesia is also being considered.

Australasia
  - The tourism boom has facilitated good growth in Australasia. Both
      Australia and New Zealand continue to produce solid results.
  - Exponential growth is not anticipated in this region without some
      diversification of the current business model. This is being
      considered where expanding into allied non-food products
      distribution model might be an opportunity.

Emerging markets
  - South Africa continues to produce good results in spite of the tough
     operating conditions. Strong management, rebalancing the portfolio
     and moving towards a wider customer base has all contributed to
     the improved result. Expansion into Africa is being pursued via new
     agency relationships or business expansion.
  - South America faces tough political and economic conditions
     however management remain bullish that significant opportunities
     exist in the region to consolidate markets to build a strong growth
     platform over time.
  - Middle East has produced good results in spite of the geopolitical
     challenges in the region; indicative of the fact that opportunities
     exist in spite of consequent macro-economic conditions.

2. General

      -   Management is highly motivated by challenge and the opportunity
          presented by the unbundling from Bidvest and are excited about
          continuing to grow off the current solid platform. The
          decentralization philosophy which breeds accountability and
          responsibly will remain the cornerstone of the foodservice group.
      -   Operating across 35 countries, the foodservice group is made up of
          committed and passionate people that are best of breed and have
          the authority and autonomy to run their business.
      -   The unbundling presents an opportunity for the foodservice group to
          deliver superior growth and shareholder value over time.
      -   Management remain alert to acquisition opportunities that present
          themselves both in current markets and in new territories.

Announcement relating to:

    -   the proposed unbundling by Bidvest;
    -   the listing of Bid Corporation Limited (“BidCorp”) on the JSE; and
    -   withdrawal of cautionary announcement.


1. Introduction

    Shareholders of Bidvest (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released on the Stock
    Exchange News Service (“SENS”) of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) on February 8 2016 regarding the
    proposed listing (“the Listing”) and subsequent unbundling of its foodservices business on the
    main board of the JSE (“the Unbundling”).

    The Unbundling is presumed, without confirmation, to constitute a section 112 disposal in terms of
    the South African Companies Act, 71 of 2008, as amended (“the Companies Act”) and as such
    Bidvest is required to consider the provisions of the Companies Act and the Takeover Regulations
    in implementing the Unbundling. The Unbundling will result in Shareholders holding a direct
    interest in BidCorp rather than holding that interest through Bidvest.

2. Background to and rationale for the Unbundling

    The Bidvest Group is an international services, trading and distribution company listed on the JSE
    and operating on five continents. We are proud of our South African roots and our place on the
    JSE. At the same time, we have become a global business with further international growth on the
    horizon both within our food and industrial businesses. The evolution of Bidvest into two distinct
    businesses comprising Bidvest Industrial, a major diversified industrial group operating in
    southern Africa employing c.117,000 people and generating turnover and trading profit of c.R93
    billion and R5.7 billion respectively for the year ended June 30 2015 and Bidvest Foodservice, a
    global foodservice business operating in multiple geographies, has been a natural progression
    over many years. Both businesses have divergent strategic focuses and require different
    management skills.

    A clear separation of interests will provide for greater management focus and enable
    management to identify opportunities both locally and abroad thereby increasing the scope for
    entrepreneurial flair. Consequently, the board of directors of Bidvest (“the Board”) had decided to
    separately list and unbundle the foodservice business from Bidvest thus creating two fit for
    purpose businesses managed by focused teams that are better equipped to sustain and grow
    their respective businesses.

    The Board believes that the separation of BidCorp from the Bidvest Group will enable the
    following:

        -   streamline the activities and operations of the Bidvest Group which will ensure an
            improved platform from which to pursue continued growth;
        -   greater transparency with regard to the nature of the activities and geographies in which
            each of BidCorp and the remainder of the Bidvest Group operate and their respective
            potential values;
        -   improve management focus to assist in identifying acquisition opportunities both locally
            and abroad and to enable management to mitigate and manage specific risks and
            challenges faced by each individual business;
        -   enable the respective management teams of BidCorp and Bidvest to express their
            entrepreneurial flair and take direct responsibility and accountability for the performance
            and growth of the respective companies;
       -    enable smooth and transparent management succession, planning and implementation;
            and
       -    provide flexibility to anticipate and react to changes within the specific market segments
            and economic landscapes within which each company operates.

3. The Listing and the Unbundling

   In order to give effect to the Listing and Unbundling, Bidvest will, prior to the Listing and
   Unbundling:

       -   dispose of the all of the shares in Bidvest Food Africa Proprietary Limited (“Bidvest Food
           Africa”), Bidvest Food Properties Proprietary Limited (“Bidvest Food Properties”) and the
           Bidvest treasury shares (“the Transferring Assets”) to its wholly-owned subsidiary,
           BidCorp, prior to the Listing, in terms of asset-for-share transactions and unbundling
           transactions in accordance with the provisions of sections 42 and 46 of the Income Tax
           Act 58 of 1962, as amended (the “Income Tax Act”) (“the Disposal”); and
       -   acquire EAS Zimbabwe (Pvt) Limited, EAS Zambia Limited and Bidvest Zambia Limited
           (“the Excluded Assets”) from BidCorp in terms of an unbundling transaction in
           accordance with the provisions of section 46 of the Income Tax Act (collectively, “the
           Internal Restructuring”).

   The net book value of the Transferring Assets being disposed of by Bidvest is approximately R2.8
   billion and the net book value of the Excluded Assets being acquired by Bidvest is approximately
   R6.2 million.

   Subject to the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions as set out in paragraph 4 below, Bidvest will
   distribute all of the BidCorp shares held by the Company to all of its Shareholders recorded in the
   register at the close of business on Friday, June 3 2016 (“the Record Date”) by way of the
   Unbundling, which shares will be listed on the JSE in the ""Food Retailers and Wholesalers"" sector
   of the Main Board of the JSE.

   Shareholders will indicatively receive 1 BidCorp share for every 1 Bidvest share held on the
   Record Date (subject to the rounding convention applied by the JSE).

   The general meeting of Shareholders to consider and, if deemed fit, pass the resolutions
   necessary to give effect to the Unbundling will be held on or about Monday, May 16 2016 (“the
   General Meeting”).

   In terms of the Companies Act, the resolution to approve the Unbundling requires the approval of
   at least a 75% majority of Shareholders present or represented by proxy at the General Meeting
   and entitled to vote.

4. Suspensive conditions

   The implementation of the Unbundling is subject to the fulfilment or waiver (by Bidvest, to the
   extent permitted) of the following suspensive conditions on or before Tuesday, May 17 2016:

       -   the resolutions authorising the Unbundling shall have been passed by the requisite
           majority of the votes of Shareholders at the General Meeting;
       -   Bidvest shall have obtained a 'binding class tax ruling' and a binding private tax ruling in
           terms of sections 78 and 79 of the Tax Administration Act, 2011, in regard to the Disposal
           and the Unbundling on terms satisfactory to the Board; and
       -   the Takeover Regulation Panel shall have issued a certificate of compliance in respect of
           the Unbundling in terms of section 115 of the Companies Act.

5. Pro forma financial effects of the Unbundling

   The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the Unbundling.

   Based on Bidvest’s consolidated interim results for the period ended December 31 2015, the pro
   forma financial effects of the Unbundling on the earnings per share (“EPS”), diluted EPS, headline
   earnings per share (“HEPS”), diluted HEPS, normalised HEPS, net asset value (“NAV”) and
   tangible NAV (“TNAV”) of the Bidvest Group are set out below.

   These financial effects are prepared for illustrative purposes only in order to assist Shareholders
   to assess the impact of the Unbundling and, because of their nature, may not give a fair

   Notes to the pro forma financial effects:

   1.   The “Before the Unbundling” column sets out the EPS, diluted EPS, HEPS, normalised HEPS, diluted
        HEPS, NAV, TNAV, per Bidvest Group share prior to the Unbundling.
   2.   The “After the Unbundling” column sets out the EPS, diluted EPS, HEPS, normalised HEPS and diluted
        HEPS, per Bidvest Group share assuming that the Unbundling took place with effect from July 1 2015
        for pro forma statement of comprehensive income purposes and takes into account the following
        adjustments:
         a. inclusion of the income, expenditure and taxes relating to the excluded assets which will be
            transferred to the Bidvest Group in terms of the Internal Restructuring. These adjustments will have
            a continuing effect on Bidvest’s statement of comprehensive income;
         b. exclusion of the income, expenditure and taxes relating to Bidvest Food Africa, Bidvest Food
            Properties and the Transferring Assets which will be transferred to BidCorp in terms of the Internal
            Restructuring;
        c. exclusion of head office costs of R23.4 million and the related taxation adjustment which relate to
           the costs of executives currently employed by Bidvest but who will be transferred to the BidCorp
           subsequent to the Listing and Unbundling. These adjustments will have a continuing effect on the
           Bidvest Group’s statement of comprehensive income;
        d. reversal of the administrative fee expense incurred by subsidiaries of BidCorp of R19.7 million and
           the related taxation adjustment which will no longer be receivable by Bidvest subsequent to the
           Listing and the Unbundling. These adjustments will have a continuing effect on Bidvest Group’s
           statement of comprehensive income;
        e. share based payment (IFRS 2) relief of R12.4 million, and the related taxation adjustment, which
           relates to the executives who are currently employed by Bidvest but will be employed by the
           BidCorp subsequent to the Listing and Unbundling. This adjustment will have a continuing effect on
           the Bidvest Group’s statement of comprehensive income. An additional IFRS 2 charge of R25.7
           million and the related taxation adjustment, resulting from the early vesting of the existing CSP
           scheme will be expensed in Bidvest and will not have a continuing effect on Bidvest’s statement of
           comprehensive income. R19.9 million of this charge relates to BidCorp executives;
        f. expensing of transaction costs, amounting to R18 million, which relate directly to the Listing and
           which have been expensed in terms of IAS 32: Financial Instruments. These adjustments will not
           have a continuing effect on Bidvest’s statement of comprehensive income; and
        g. interest adjustment has been made in relation to the above items where it is deemed material.

Message to shareholders
Highlights
The Group delivered solid trading results for the half-year ended December 31 2015, against the backdrop of challenging 
market conditions, particularly in the southern African region. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 13,0%
to 1  001,5 cents per share (2014: 886,3 cents per share) with basic earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 7,8% to 
930,9 cents per share (2014: 863,3 cents per share).

Bidvest Foodservice achieved real organic growth in local currencies in most businesses in an environment of zero food
inflation. Trading results in rand overall were buoyed by currency depreciation. 

Bidvest South Africa delivered an improved trading result despite tough economic conditions as a consequence of the
fallout from declining commodity volumes and prices in Freight and weak consumer demand in Automotive. Some good
performances were achieved in the Commercial, Electrical and Office and Print divisions. Bidvest Namibia recorded a further
decline in trading profit impacted by poor Fishing and Freight results which outweighed the benefits of newly acquired
Automotive business.

Financial overview
Turnover grew by 9,6% to R114,5 billion (2014: R104,4 billion). Major contributors to the increases were Bidvest
Europe and Bidvest UK, reflecting organic growth and some assistance from currency effects on translation.

Gross profit percentage increased to 20,5% (2014: 20,1%) off the increase in turnover. Operating expenses remained
well controlled, increasing by 5,5% on a like-for-like basis excluding the effects of foreign currency translation.
Investment income declined slightly due to reduced fair value and mark-to-market gains on the portfolio investments.

The Group grew trading profit by 11,6% to R5,2 billion (2014: R4,6 billion). Trading profit margin improved marginally
to 4,5%. The average rand exchange rate weakened against sterling and the euro, resulting in a 3,7% overall benefit to
trading profit.
 
Net finance charges were 3,9% higher at R601,5 million (2014: R578,8 million), a consequence of higher working capital
utilisation, some acquisitions and a rising interest rate environment in South Africa, both in respect of base rates as
well as credit spreads. Bidvest remains well capitalised in line with its conservative approach to gearing, with
trading profit interest cover at 8,6  times (2014: 8,0 times). 

Associate earnings declined by 22,8% largely as a result of the decline in the fortunes of Comair Limited offset to
some extent by the improved performance of Adcock Ingram Holdings Limited (Adcock).

Headline earnings increased by 14,7% to R3,3 billion with profit for the year up 9,5% to R3,0 billion. Headline
earnings adjustments in the period totalled R229,6 million comprising mostly fair value impairments of the investment in
associates. In line with management's valuation as at June 2015, Adcock was valued at R52 per share. As a consequence of the
subsequent decline of the Adcock share price, this may require a non-cash and non-headline earnings impairment at year
end.

The Group's financial position remains strong. Growth in total assets reflects the ongoing investments into
infrastructure and the trading activity in inventories and receivables. Net debt has increased to R12,0 billion as compared to
R7,8 billion at June 30 2015 (2014: R10,4 billion) driven by investment into property, plant and equipment and working
capital utilisation. Normalised trading profit interest cover (excluding the finance costs of the Adcock investment) is 
10,7 times (2014: 10,3 times) and is comfortably above the Group's conservative self-imposed targets, retaining adequate
headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities.
 
Cash generated by operations before working capital changes increased 6,5% to R6,4 billion (2014: R6,0 billion). The
Group absorbed R3,5 billion of working capital in 2015 compared to R2,4 billion in 2014, reflecting growth, the impact of
the devaluation of the rand on replacement inventories, some acquisitions, pockets of inefficient asset management as
well as impacts of currency translation. Net working capital days increased to 17,6 days (2014: 14,1 days).

Moody's Investor Service affirmed Bidvest's national long-term rating of A1.za with a stable outlook in January 2015.

Acquisitions
The Group made a number of small acquisitions, including Plumblink SA Proprietary Limited (Plumblink) in South Africa
and Novel  Ford in Namibia.

Prospects
Trading conditions in South Africa are likely to remain subdued in a low growth environment. Certain divisions have
been realigned to cater for succession, and to streamline our service offering to customers. Management will strive to
deliver real organic growth and pursue local and international opportunities to complement our existing product and service
offering. Further acquisition opportunities in the industrial sector are being pursued. In respect of Adcock, good
progress continues to be made on their path to normalised profitability and Bidvest remains optimistic about their
medium-term prospects. Bidvest Namibia continues to face uncertainty around future horse mackerel quotas and the availability
thereof, however initiatives are underway to finding more permanent solutions to the issue. Fixing areas of underperformance 
and diversifying the business base remain focus areas. 

In the Food businesses, the ongoing focus of our wholesale segments remains on balancing the exposure between national
and independent foodservice customers. Innovative technological foodservice solutions for customers as a value-add
service continue to be rolled out across all businesses. The fresh product offering presents significant potential in most
regions. Across all our businesses, opportunities to add new product ranges and expand local footprints, via both organic
and acquisitive growth, will continue.

Management is conscious of the need to remain focused on improving asset management in order to maximise returns in
our businesses, particularly in current economic environments. Our financial position remains sound, cash generation
remains strong and we retain adequate headroom to accommodate expansion opportunities, both acquisitive and organic.
Management remains alert to opportunities and is confident of delivering further growth in the period ahead.

Over many years, the Bidvest entrepreneurial and decentralised business model has proven its resilience through many
economic cycles. The strength of the culture breeds accountability and confidence which allows the Group to deliver
above-average returns to our shareholders. As the Group prepares itself for the next stage in its evolution, each 
management team is confident of being able to sustain 'Proudly Tomorrow'.

Subsequent events
Bidvest announced on October 7 2015 that it was in the process of formalising the restructure of its business
operations and management focus.
 
Further to this announcement, and in order to provide shareholders with the opportunity to participate directly in
Bidvest's Foodservice operations, Bidvest intends to unbundle and separately list the Foodservice business on the main
board of the JSE. The successful completion of the proposed transaction will be subject to conditions precedent, including
approval by shareholders and the relevant regulatory authorities. Shareholders are advised to continue to exercise
caution when trading in Bidvest securities until a further announcement in this regard is made.

Divisional review
Bidvest Industrial
Bidvest South Africa
In challenging economic conditions the business achieved 3,1% turnover growth to R45,3 billion (2014: R43,9 billion)
and a 5,1% rise in trading profit to R2,7 billion (2014: R2,5 billion). Performance was pleasing as a new divisional
structure was rolled  out.
 
The new combined Services division brings together the original Services division plus Travel and Aviation and Rental
and Products divisions. The Office and Paperplus divisions are consolidated into a new Office and Print division, while
the Industrial and Consumer Products divisions are combined into a single Commercial Products division. The Automotive,
Electrical, Financial Services and Freight divisions remain unchanged.

Automotive 
Satisfactory results were delivered in the context of severe market contraction. Turnover dipped to R12,2 billion
(2014:  R12,3  billion).  Trading profit fell 7,0% to R357,8 million (2014: R384,7 million). Passenger vehicle sales and
margins were under pressure. Expenses rose and credit extension tightened. The uptick in used vehicle trading was slower than
expected. Two loss-making dealerships are being disposed of. The parts business continued to grow, as did service
revenue. Rising interest rates and currency weakness are expected to create significant headwinds in the second half.
Opportunities for selective expansion of McCarthy Pre-Owned will be pursued.

Commercial Products 
The new, consolidated division recorded impressive results from both the Industrial and Consumer Products units. The
combined entity drove turnover 36,0% higher to R2,9 billion (2014: R2,2 billion), with trading profit up 37,3% at 
R250,9 million (2014:  R182,8  million). Trading profit in the new reporting period benefited from Plumblink's first 
contribution (acquired July 2015).

Home of Living Brands experienced volume growth at almost all top retailers in the customer mix. Independents face
particular challenges, but a new approach by management resulted in overall volume improvements. Online sales grew and
exports met expectations. Academy Brushware, Bidvest Afcom, Berzacks, Bidvest Materials Handling, Bidvest Buffalo Tapes and
Yamaha all delivered solid results. Vulcan Catering and G Fox faced challenges. Plumblink bedded down well and opened
eight new stores. A  restructure was undertaken at Sanlic.

Electrical 
A positive half-year result was achieved. Turnover rose 3,2% to R2,7 billion (2014: R2,6 billion). At R139,0 million,
trading profit was up 14,0% (2014: R121,9 million). Margins and expenses were well managed. Cable volumes rose while
market prices fell. Infrastructure and construction faced intense pressure. Volume and margin pressure is constant among
mining customers. Subcontractor debtor stress remains a challenge. Eastern and southern Cape operations are being
consolidated. The Voltex Lighting business restructure is underway. Atlas, Solid State and Waco did well. The Voltex MV/LV
Solutions business is positioned for ongoing growth. Versalec disappointed but remains profitable with a strong order book.

Financial Service
Trading profit rose 4,4% to R264,7 million (2014: R253,6 million), buoyed by a strong Bidvest Bank performance.
However, poor share portfolio performance within the Insurance business led to a negative mark-to-market adjustment of 
R41,3 million on the prior  year.

Trading profit at Bidvest Bank rose 26,7% to R231,9 million (2014: R183,1 million). At R1,5 billion, new lending
pay-outs were 451% up on the comparative period. Top-line income of R527,5 million was up 20% on strong contributions from
foreign exchange, transactional banking and fleet and asset finance. Deposits were up 50,3% at R3,2 billion. Corporate
advances, leased assets and trade finance showed pleasing growth. The bank is strongly cash generative, though cash
surpluses fell from R2,0  billion to R1,4 billion as management maintained strong focus on higher returns. 

Trading profit at Bidvest Insurance fell 53,6% to R32,7 million (2014: R70,5 million), though gross written premiums
rose 7,2% to R148,0 million (2014: R138,1 million). Premiums were buoyed by the launch of the commercial channel and
rising volumes from new product ranges, including Theft Buster and travel insurance.

Freight
Half-year results were disappointing. Turnover increased 1,7% to R14,7 billion (2014: R14,4 billion). Trading profit
dropped 9,6% to R512,4 million (2014: R566,9 million). Big reductions in commodity volumes created substantial
challenges. South African Bulk Terminals handled no maize volumes as drought crippled agricultural exports. However, Bidvest 
Tank Terminals achieved some growth and the Richards Bay fuel storage build made progress. Bidvest Panalpina Logistics also
put in a good performance buoyed by automotive demand and warehousing growth. Port Operations experienced low activity
levels in both its terminal and stevedoring operations. South African Container Depots was hit by lower import volumes as
a consequence of rand weakness. Exports also fell. Low demand from mining customers severely impacted Bulk Connections.
Naval volumes were well down.

Office and Print 
The consolidated business, combining Office and Paperplus, achieved satisfactory results, with turnover 3,5% higher at
R5,2  billion (2014: R5,0 billion) and trading profit up 24,7% at R415,3 million (2014: R333,1 million).

Lithotech was buoyed by export income and changes to its service mix. Bidvest Data created a competitive advantage
from the shift to electronic communication. Bidvest Packaging maintained strong momentum after consolidation. Rotolabel
achieved a pleasing turnaround, as did Silveray. Kolok performed strongly, with rand weakness contributing to its results.
Performance at Waltons continued to disappoint. A strong performance was put in by Konica Minolta. Zonke Monitoring
Systems again did well. Among the furniture businesses, Cecil Nurse performed exceptionally well and the furniture
contribution was well above budget.
 
Services 
A new-look Services business, combining the previous operations at Services, Rental and Products, and Travel and
Aviation recorded acceptable results. Turnover fell 5,7% to R6,2 billion (2014: R6,5 billion) mainly as a result of the
Cash-in-Transit business sale in February 2015. Trading profit, however, was up 4,5% at R717,1 million (2014: R686,2
million). Fine individual business performances were interspersed with some sluggish results. Expenses were well managed.
Several new management teams made a promising start and new business clusters settled down well.

Facilities Management Services, the largest cluster in the business, produced reasonable results. Prestige is
centralising its division into hubs with warehousing. Employment tax incentives underpinned good Prestige growth. Steiner was
impacted by the weak rand, but achieved acceptable growth. Royal Mnandi disappointed. A restructure is under way.
 
Allied Services' growth was bolstered by pleasing results at Pureau and Execuflora. Pureau's bulk water and coffee
sales were a highlight.

The security cluster achieved very positive results, and the Technical turnaround continued. BidTrack excelled. An
enhanced sales team is in place. 

Within Industrial Services, BidAir put in a stellar performance. Cargo volumes are well up. Results at TMS were flat
and operating expenses moved higher. Vericon achieved profit growth and Laundries made some gains. 

The travel cluster faced serious challenges, with the flagship Rennies brand under pressure. 

Bidvest Namibia
Results again disappointed. Turnover was flat at R2,1 billion, but trading profit fell 30,1% to R120,7 million 
(2014: R172,5 million). Bidfish was impacted by poor performance at Trachurus, Comet (Angola) and Namsea. Freight and 
Logistics performed below expectation. Food and Distribution achieved some growth. Performance was flat at Industrial and
Commercial. The recently acquired Automotive business became the second largest profit contributor after Bidfish. Another
recent acquisition, Namibia Bureau de Change made a small contribution. The Glenryk brand was acquired. 

Bidvest Foodservices
Food Group achieved strong results in challenging economic environments across all regions. Strategies put in place in
recent years solidified. UK and Europe achieved strong growth. Australasia made a solid contribution, as did Emerging
Markets.

Turnover rose 14,6% to R68,2 billion (2014: R59,5 billion), with trading profit 22,8% higher at R2,4 billion 
(2014: R1,9 billion).

Australasia 
Turnover reported in Australasia fell 2,0% to R14,6 billion (2014: R14,9 billion), but the dip was more than offset by
a pleasing 10,4% rise in trading profit to R751,9 million (2014: R680,9 million) as the mix changed.

Australia delivered a strong performance, growing the free-trade base while exiting some large logistics contracts.
Expenses rose, but this was foreseen as the new Fresh Produce and Fresh Meat divisions operate off a higher expenses base.
The new divisions were slow to build momentum, but look forward to second-half improvements.

New Zealand exceeded sales and profit expectations on the back of a strong second quarter. The core Foodservice, Fresh
and Logistics divisions did well, while solid improvements were seen in Processing and Retail. A key focus was the use
of specialist sales resources to support margins and drive growth in key categories.

UK 
Foodservice performed very well, achieving good sales and profit growth. Margins were well managed. Turnover was up
27,3% at R30,4 billion (2014: R23,8 billion) and trading profit 37,6% higher at R717,7 million (2014: R521,5 million).
Strategic focus remains on building an entrepreneurial culture while driving free-trade volumes. The south of England
infrastructure programme is progressing well. Logistics had a difficult period impacted by excess capacity, delayed new
contract start-ups and high vehicle expenses, yet achieved sales growth. A major long-term contract was won. Bidvest Fresh
faced a tough six months as Seafood experienced operational challenges, though Oliver Kay did well.

Europe 
A positive half-year result was achieved. Turnover rose 13,4% to R14,4 billion (2014: R12,7 billion) and at R435,0 million 
trading profit was up 27,5% (2014: R341,1 million). Deli XL Netherlands grew profit and sales. Lower Institutional
volumes were offset by improvements in the free-trade sector. Deli XL Belgium put in a solid performance. Catering and
Institutional did well. Horeca sales faced pressure. DAC Italy put in a pleasing performance as the business footprint
grows nationally. Cash generation was robust. Farutex Poland exceeded budget for sales and profit. Strong growth was seen
in the individual market. Czech Republic and Slovakia achieved good results. Foodservice optimised changes to the sales
team and Retail surprised on the upside. Ice cream sales hit a 10-year high. Bidvest Baltics were impacted by the
Russian food embargo and the slowdown in the Russian economy. Aktaes Turkey improved significantly against the prior year.

Emerging Markets 
Emerging Markets increased turnover 9,3% to R8,9 billion (2014: R8,1 billion). Trading profit rose 20,3% to R444,0 million 
(2014: R369,0 million).

Bidvest Food Africa achieved net sales growth above food inflation, with improved trading profit. Bidvest Food
Ingredients saw strong growth across most channels while Bidvest Foodservice did well in the independent and national account
channels. Bidvest Bakery Solutions recorded continued growth in the retail and franchise sectors. Industrial sector sales
and export business faced challenges. The business acquired full ownership of its Zambian operations. 

Angliss Greater China again performed well. Shenzhen and Beijing showed exceptional sales growth. However, Hong Kong
failed to meet expectations as tourism inflows slowed. Sales in China's second-tier cities grew steadily. 

Angliss Singapore continued its rightsizing programme. Operational efficiencies and new synergies are evident.

At Bidvest Procurement Company, sales and customer support showed pleasing growth. Strong sales momentum is driven by
new additions to the product mix and repeat orders.

In Brazil, sales and profit fell, though earnings were impacted by once-off distribution centre relocation costs.
After adjustments for abnormal costs, profit eased higher in an extremely challenging economic environment.
 
Despite the economic slowdown in Chile, pleasing sales and trading profit growth were achieved. Margins and expenses
were well managed, and the move to the new Santiago distribution centre was completed.

Across the Middle East, resilient businesses delivered healthy growth in a tough geopolitical environment, with margin
management improvements evident in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Sales growth was assisted by changes to the
portfolio mix across all  markets.
 
Bidvest Corporate
Ontime Automotive UK remained loss-making on the back of an extremely onerous contract. Activity levels at Technical
Services were subdued. At Mansfield Rescue Recovery the mild winter resulted in lower job numbers and a trading loss was
recorded. New efficiencies are being implemented as unprofitable contracts are renegotiated or exited. Bidvest
Properties continued to develop its portfolio while assisting Bidvest operations to expand their infrastructure.
 
Directorate
At the annual general meeting (AGM), Mr AA da Costa retired from the board. The board and management of Bidvest wish
to thank Mr da Costa for his contribution to the development of Bidvest.

Supplementary pro forma information regarding the currency effects of the translation of foreign operations on the
Group
The pro forma financial information has been compiled for illustrative purposes only and is the responsibility of the
board. Due to the nature of this information, it may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in
equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information has been compiled in terms of the JSE Listings
Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information by SAICA.

The average rand exchange rate weakened against the major currencies in which the Group's foreign operations trade,
namely sterling (17,89 in 2014 to 20,86 in 2015), the euro (14,16 in 2014 to 15,01 in 2015) and the Australian dollar
(9,79 in 2014 to 9,84 in 2015). The illustrative information, detailed below, has been prepared on the basis of applying the
2014 average rand  exchange rates to the 2015 foreign subsidiary income statements and recalculating the reported income
of the Group for the period.
