NEW R1.33 BILLION DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PLACEMENT AND EXTENSION TO THE MATURITY OF R492.1 MILLION OF DOMESTIC 
MEDIUM TERM NOTES UNDER THE R15 BILLION DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME


Northam is pleased to announce that it has completed a private placement of domestic medium term notes
(“Notes”) to the value of R1.33 billion (“New Notes”) in a bookbuild under Northam’s R15 billion Domestic
Medium Term Note Programme (dated 29 October 2020, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time)
(“Programme”). The bookbuild was oversubscribed by 33%.


The New Notes were issued today, 25 November 2020, on the Interest Rate Market of the JSE Limited, primarily
as tap issuances under the following bond series: NHM011, NHM014, NHM016, NHM018 and NHM019
(“Existing Bond Series”) as well as issues under new bond series NHM020 (“New Bond Series”).


The New Notes issued under the Existing Bond Series attract floating rate coupons between 2.50% and 4.25%
per annum above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR, with interest payable quarterly, as detailed in previously published
SENS announcements.

The New Notes issued under the New Bond Series mature on 25 November 2023 (R132 million) and attract a
floating rate coupon of 3.75% per annum above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR with interest payable quarterly.


The New Notes issued under the Existing Bond Series and the New Bond Series have a staggered maturity
profile, maturing within the next 12 months (R10 million), 18 months (R345 million), 30 months (R253 million),
36 months (R132 million), 42 months (R390 million) and 54 months (R200 million) from the date of issue.


The proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes will be applied towards replenishing Northam’s cash reserves
utilised in the course of Northam’s ongoing acquisition of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited,
including as published on SENS on 15 October 2020.
Furthermore, pursuant to the announcement published on SENS on 28 October 2020 pertaining to the partial
capital redemption of Notes under bond series NHM017, Northam is pleased to announce that, on
30 October 2020, it completed a R492.1 million note switch, effectively extending the maturity date of certain
Notes issued under bond series NHM017, maturing on 26 February 2021. This was achieved through the
purchase and cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous issue of new Notes to the same Note holders as
a second tranche under bond series NHM012, maturing on 13 June 2022, for the same aggregate nominal
amount (“Note Switch”). The NHM012 series Notes have a floating interest rate of 3.75% per annum above the
3 month ZAR-JIBAR, with interest payable quarterly.


Following the placement of the New Notes, the total nominal value of Notes in issue under the Programme
amounts to c. R7.13 billion.


The combination of the placement of the New Notes and the Note Switch provides significant additional balance
sheet flexibility for Northam.


Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam is pleased to have such strong investor support
for our DMTN Programme. This continues to support Northam’s growth strategy and simultaneously allows the
Company to accelerate the return of value to shareholders.”

CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Northam shareholders are advised that Northam and Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi Platinum”)
have entered into discussions regarding a potential transaction to accelerate the maturity of the
empowerment transaction concluded between Northam and Zambezi Platinum in May 2015, whilst
maintaining Northam’s broad-based black economic empowerment ownership. If the transaction is
successfully concluded it may have a material effect on the price of Northam’s securities.

Accordingly, Northam shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in Northam’s securities,
until a further announcement is published.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “the significant value created for all Northam
shareholders from our empowerment transaction with Zambezi Platinum, as well as Northam’s current
ownership of 70% of all Zambezi Platinum preference shares and the inherent share buy-back implied by
this holding, provides a unique opportunity to unlock permanent value for our shareholders, whilst
maintaining Northam’s broad-based black economic empowerment ownership. Northam has taken the
initiative to enter into pro-active discussions with Zambezi Platinum with a view to secure a successful and
sustainable outcome.”

Platinum Limited ZAR10 000 000 000 Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (dated 3 August 2012, as
amended and / or supplemented from time to time) (the “Programme”), of the reduction in the nominal
amount of notes in bond series NHM017 (the “Relevant Notes”), guaranteed by Booysendal Platinum
Proprietary Limited, by an amount of R492.1 million (the “Purchased Notes”), on 30 October 2020.


 Bond Code:                                                                    NHM017

 Reduction in the nominal amount:                                              R492 100 000.00
 Remaining nominal amount in issue:                                            R2 800 000.00


The reduction in the nominal amount of the Relevant Notes was effected through the purchase by Northam
of the Purchased Notes in the market and the surrender by Northam of the Purchased Notes to the Transfer
Agent under the Programme for cancellation thereof on 30 October 2020.

The reduction in the nominal amount of the Relevant Notes forms part of a note switch whereby the maturity
dates of Purchased Notes will be extended through a purchase and cancellation of such notes and the
simultaneous issue of new notes for the same nominal amount as a second tranche under series NHM012,
which has a longer maturity date.

NORTHAM INCREASES ITS ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARE HOLDING TO APPROXIMATELY 70% BY ACQUIRING 
R3.5 BILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES


Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 18 August 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”)
(“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 37 179 697 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately R3.5 billion
(“ZPLP acquisitions”). Following the ZPLP acquisitions, Northam holds 111 909 248 Zambezi preference
shares (“Northam owned prefs”), representing approximately 70% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

The face value of the Northam owned prefs as at 15 October 2020, calculated as the initial issue price of the
Zambezi preference shares plus accumulated preference share dividends, amounts to approximately
R9.1 billion.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the
preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements, as well
as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi preference
shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect to redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a distribution
of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisitions have been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisitions are not categorised transactions in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam has continued to return significant value to
shareholders by accelerating the purchase of Zambezi preference shares to the current 70% holding. This
strategy will positively impact future earnings and earnings per share and will add to the success of our
empowerment transaction. Furthermore, Northam no longer considers the back-up guarantee provided in favour
of the Zambezi preference shareholders to be a dilution risk to Northam ordinary shareholders and this is a
significant milestone for the Company. Our mines and operations have proved to be resilient following the COVID-
19 induced national lockdown and the commitment demonstrated by the Northam employees in restoring
operations to normality has been outstanding.”

UPGRADE TO NORTHAM’S LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK                            

Northam is pleased to advise shareholders and noteholders that the credit rating agency, Global Credit
Rating Co. (“GCR”), has upgraded Northam’s national scale long term credit rating to A(ZA) (from the
previous rating of A-(ZA)) and short term credit rating to A1(ZA) (from the previous rating of A2(ZA)), with a
stable outlook.

The upgrade primarily reflects Northam’s strengthened earnings profile and expectations of continued
robust free cash flows and financial metrics on the back of favourable commodity prices. Other factors
sighted by GCR include, inter alia, the surge in Northam’s profitability over recent years enhanced by rising
production volumes, the positive manner in which Northam managed and recovered from the impact of
COVID-19, the group’s globally competitive cost position and Northam’s track record of maintaining
conservative financial policies. GCR continues to view Northam’s liquidity as strong.

The stable outlook reflects GCR’s view that the group will pursue a conservative financial profile and will
continue to benefit from its ongoing production ramp up against supportive pricing levels, which should
translate into robust margins and cash flows to sustain strong credit metrics over the next 12 to 18 months.

GCR’s announcement in regard to Northam’s credit rating is available from GCR’s website at
https://gcrratings.com/announcements/gcr-upgrades-northams-issuer-ratings-to-aza-a1za-on-

ABRIDGED AUDITED GROUP ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 AND NOTICE
OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Key features:

-   Record revenue of R17.8 billion
-   Record operating profit of R5.3 billion
-   Record EBITDA of R6.0 billion
-   Record normalised headline earnings of R3.4 billion equating to 676.3 cents per share, up 150.4%
-   Record profit after tax of R2.2 billion
-   Return of shareholder value, through 46.7% Zambezi preference share ownership
-   Net debt of R3.3 billion

Financial results

Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, this has been a record year for Northam. The company has
commenced the fourth strategic phase by returning meaningful value to Northam shareholders (“shareholders”)
and remains committed to returning further value going forward.

The group achieved record sales revenue, record operating profit and record earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year. These record outcomes were achieved notwithstanding
the impact of mine and production stoppages, which occurred as a result of the COVID-19 induced lockdown.
Prior and up to the commencement of the lockdown period, the group was on track to achieve record production
from own operations during the year ended 30 June 2020 (“F2020”).

Sales revenue increased by 67.3% to R17.8 billion (F2019: R10.6 billion) for the year. This increase is attributable
to a 60.8% rise in the 4E basket price to USD1 764/oz (F2019: USD1 097/oz) and a 10.9% weaker ZAR/USD
exchange rate realised.

Despite logistical hurdles associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures that made the
distribution of refined metal challenging, the group maintained robust refined metal sales of 560 238 4E oz. This
highlights the strong relationships that Northam has developed and maintained with its industrial customer base
over many years.

The average US dollar sales prices achieved during the year under review improved for most metals. Palladium
and rhodium both performed well, increasing by 52.4% and 169.8%, respectively. Both these metals continued
their upward trends subsequent to the financial year end. Platinum however, making up roughly 60% of the sales
volume of Northam’s precious metals 4E basket, continues to be the laggard. The average price achieved during
the year was USD858/oz (F2019: USD824/oz), which impacted the 4E basket price achieved. Platinum now only
contributes 28.0% (F2019: 46.3%) to the 4E basket. Any upward movement in the platinum price will have a
positive impact on the profitability of the group.

The group continues to deliver on its strategy of developing low-cost, long-life assets which are positioning the
group for further strong financial performance even in subdued or potentially volatile commodity markets. The
benefit of Northam’s growth strategy, initiated in 2015, is evidenced by some of the key financial highlights listed
below:

Dividends and other means of returning value to shareholders

There are a number of ways that value can be returned to shareholders. This includes cash dividends, but also
includes share buy-backs or the purchase of the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”) preference shares.

During the year under review, Northam returned value to shareholders by acquiring 49 364 435 Zambezi
preference shares for R3.7 billion. Subsequent to year end an additional 21 134 297 preference shares were
acquired for R1.7 billion. Northam now holds 46.7% of the total issued number of Zambezi preference shares.

The board has therefore resolved not to declare a dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 (F2019:
RNil).

ACQUISITION OF R804.6 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 2 July 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”)
(“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 9 635 664 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately R804.6 million
(“ZPLP acquisition”). Following the ZPLP acquisition, Northam will hold 74 729 551 Zambezi preference
shares (“Northam owned prefs”), representing approximately 46.7% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.
The face value of the Northam owned prefs as at 17 August 2020, calculated as the initial issue price of the
Zambezi preference shares plus accumulated preference share dividends, amounts to approximately R5.96
billion.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the
preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements, as well
as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi preference
shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect to redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a distribution
of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

TRADING STATEMENT AND TRADING UPDATE

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the financial
results for the current reporting period will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of the previous
corresponding period.

Northam expects to achieve a record operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“F2020”),
underpinned by a solid performance at all operations and higher prices realised for our basket of metals.
This is despite significant production losses associated with the national lockdown (“Lockdown”) and
phased restart of mining activities following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa.

The group achieved production from own operations of 515 370 4E oz, representing a marginal 0.9%
decrease from the year ended 30 June 2019 (“F2019”) (F2019: 519 954 4E oz). Purchased material
increased by 212.9% to 72 443 4E oz (F2019: 23 154 4E oz). Sales volumes amounted to 582 686 4E oz,
which included ore sales (F2019: 583 069 4E oz.), whilst total revenue per platinum ounce sold increased
by 78.8% to R53 009/Pt oz (F2019: R29 640/Pt oz), resulting in a cash margin per platinum ounce in excess
of 40%.

The group achieved record sales revenue, record operating profit and record earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year. These record outcomes were achieved
notwithstanding the impact of mine and production stoppages which occurred as a result of the COVID-19
induced Lockdown. Prior and up to the commencement of the Lockdown period, the group was on track to
achieve record production from own operations during F2020.

* Used to determine the basic and headline earnings per share, calculated as 509 781 212 shares in issue less
159 905 453 shares held by Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”). Zambezi is Northam’s major empowerment
shareholder and Zambezi’s financial results are consolidated into the group’s financial results.

However, the Lockdown resulting from COVID-19 and consequential production stoppages have been
disruptive, and Northam’s proactive and positive response measures minimised the impact on production
to an equivalent estimated loss of 108 685 4E oz. Northam would like to extend its sincere appreciation to
management and our employees, in restarting the operations in a safe and effective manner and making a
concerted effort to achieve normalised production. Surface ore sources at Eland mine, together with
streamlined operations at the mechanised Booysendal mine, enabled a swift restart. By financial year end,
Booysendal mine and Eland mine were again operating at full complement, whilst Zondereinde mine was
operating at 80% capacity. Normalised production is expected to resume at Zondereinde by the second
half of the current financial year ending 30 June 2021 (“F2021”) with a corresponding reduction to our F2021
production estimate.

The health and wellness of our employees and our host communities were given priority in our response to
COVID-19. Our program for restarting operations drew on our many years of experience in managing
significant health threats such as HIV and tuberculosis. We followed the prescripts of the National Institute
for Communicable Diseases and the amended regulations pertaining to the Disaster Management Act No.
57 of 2002, working in collaboration with the various government departments and the Minerals Council.
Our program encompassed screening and identification for early diagnosis and treatment, as well as health
promotion through a variety of educational initiatives.

All growth projects progressed well during F2020. Booysendal South has advanced into production ramp-
up, Zondereinde Western extension is ahead of schedule and on reef development of Eland mine continued
whilst simultaneously increasing mineable reserve.

Despite significant logistical hurdles associated with COVID-19, including border closures that made the
distribution of refined metal challenging, the group maintained robust refined metal sales of 560 238 4E oz.
This highlights the strong relationships that we have developed and maintained with our industrial customer
base over many years.

Group unit costs were negatively impacted by lower production levels, as operating costs continued close
to pre-Lockdown levels. This was largely attributable to our decision to maintain payment of salaries and
ancillary benefits to all of our employees during the Lockdown period and phased restart, notwithstanding
the lost production and the phased restart’s negative impact on productivity.

In light of this, and as part of our COVID-19 response measures, the group proactively implemented a multi-
pronged action plan to preserve liquidity. This entailed a restructuring of the company’s domestic medium-
term note programme to significantly extend maturity dates of notes in issue, to raise some additional debt
funding and to generally smooth the maturity profile of the various note series (“Note Switch”). In addition,
our revolving credit and general banking facilities were refinanced on more favourable terms, extending the
maturity date whilst reducing the cost of debt. Both facilities were undrawn at financial year end.

In addition to direct production and revenue losses associated with COVID-19, the group incurred once-off
costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Lockdown period of R977.2 million (the bulk of
which relates to employee costs).

Total group capital expenditure reduced year on year to R2.4 billion as a result of capital intensive programs
at Booysendal mine either having been completed or nearing completion and thus tapering down in terms
of total annual expenditure. R2.0 billion was incurred on expansionary capital expenditure and R382.2
million on sustaining capital expenditure. A decision to temporarily scale back on specific growth projects
in the interest of liquidity preservation was made after the onset of COVID-19 and the concomitant
Lockdown period. However, the group remains committed to its strategy of developing low-cost, long-life
assets in order to position itself at the lower end of the industry cost curve and the group envisages no
lasting effects in this regard.

The development of our project pipeline, which builds on our existing asset base, is bearing fruit and will
continue to deliver a strong and sustainable financial performance in the coming years. Despite the effect
of the COVID-19 pandemic, Northam achieved record financial results for the year and generated significant
free cash. Our forecasted production growth, together with favourable rand denominated metal prices, are
expected to further support and enhance free cash flow generation over the medium-term.

Our strategy of returning value to shareholders remains unchanged and can be implemented through the
payment of dividends, a share buyback or a purchase of Zambezi preference shares. We believe that, to
date, the most efficient mechanism to return value to Northam’s shareholders has been through the
purchase of Zambezi preference shares.

The acquisition of the Zambezi preference shares reduces the preference share dividend expense and
liability included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure
under the guarantee provided to holders of Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called
upon. Furthermore, in the event that Zambezi elects to redeem the Zambezi preference shares through a
distribution of Northam ordinary shares held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference
shares held by Northam at such time will result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby
reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

To this end, Northam has continued to purchase Zambezi preference shares and held 53 595 254
preference shares at 30 June 2020, representing c.33.5% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.
Subsequent to the financial year end, Northam acquired an additional 11 498 633 Zambezi preference
shares and currently holds 65 093 887 preference shares, representing c. 40.7% of all Zambezi preference
shares in issue. Purchases to date have returned R4.8 billion of value to Northam shareholders, R4.6 billion
of which was returned post F2019. Despite these purchases, the group achieved a net debt position of R3.3
billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio well below 1 : 1 as at 30 June 2020. The average premium (expressed
as a percentage to face value, being the capital amount and all accrued preference share dividends,
calculated until the date of each acquisition) paid on these purchases has been less than 2.2%.

Northam’s purchases of Zambezi preference shares to date has reduced the preference share dividend
expense in the consolidated financial statements for F2020 by R299.7 million. The full positive impact on
the income statement arising from some of these purchases will only accrue in F2021 and this, combined
with the compounding effect of dividends accruing on Zambezi preference shares, is expected to contribute
positively towards reducing the preference share dividend expense in future.
The group’s balance sheet strength and the relatively quick recovery to production capacity, combined with
the positive impact on medium term liquidity arising from the Note Switch, collectively position the group
well to continue to proactively and aggressively return value to shareholders.

In summary, whilst F2020 has been a challenging year in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic and
its wide-ranging knock-on effects, the company has performed well. Northam has efficiently managed the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has not wavered from its strategy of pursuing production growth
and asset diversification. We have delivered a meaningful return of value to our shareholders and look
forward to continuing to do more over the coming year.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam’s auditors. The audited results for the year ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be published on
or about 28 August 2020.

ACQUISITION OF R959.7 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 3 April 2020 (“previous announcement”)
pertaining to, inter alia, the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited
(“Zambezi”) (“Zambezi preference shares”).

Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
additional 11 717 037 Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately
R959.7 million (“ZPLP acquisition”). Following the ZPLP acquisition, Northam will hold 65 093 887 Zambezi
preference shares, representing approximately 40.71% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce
the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements,
as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi
preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi redeem the Zambezi
preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”) held by Zambezi,
then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam, at such time, will result in a
distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through Northam’s internal cash resources.

The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and
information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam had set itself an ambitious internal target of
acquiring at least 40% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue in order to de-risk the company’s position
and to simultaneously return significant value to its shareholders through our unique empowerment
transaction. We are delighted to have achieved this target approximately halfway through the 10 year
structure. The group’s financial position remains strong amidst very challenging global economic times.”

NORTHAM COMPLETES A R2.65 BILLION RESTRUCTURING OF ITS DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE
PROGRAMME, INCLUDING R411 MILLION OF NEW FUNDING

Northam shareholders and noteholders are referred to the announcement published by Northam on
SENS on 11 May 2020 pertaining to a R2.166 billion restructuring of Northam’s R10 billion Domestic Medium
Term Note Programme (dated 3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time)
(“Programme”), comprising a c.R1.885 billion note switch into longer term maturities and c.R281 million of new
funding.

Northam is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement with additional noteholders to participate in a
note switch to extend the maturity dates of certain domestic medium term notes (“Notes”) with an aggregate
nominal amount of R350 million, through the purchase and cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous
issue of new Notes with longer term maturities, for the same nominal amount and to the same noteholders
(“Additional Note Switch”). Upon implementation, this will result in a total Note switch of c.R2.235 billion.
Furthermore, certain noteholders will provide new funding by subscribing for additional new Notes with an
aggregate nominal amount of R130 million (“Additional New Funding”), resulting in a total of c.R411 million of
new funding raised during this process.


The Additional Note Switch and the accompanying Additional New Funding completes the restructuring of the
maturities and fund raising which Northam set out to achieve in order to preserve its medium term liquidity in the
current global economic climate following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.


The Notes to be purchased and cancelled as part of the Additional Note Switch are issued under bond code
series NHM009 (R50 million) and NHM014 (R300 million). The new Notes to be issued as part of the Additional
Note Switch and Additional New Funding will be placed as a new tranche under each of the NHM016
(R130 million) and NHM018 (R350 million) series and will be issued on the same terms applicable to such series.
The NHM016 and NHM018 series have a maturity date of 11 May 2025 and 25 May 2023, respectively, and a
floating interest rate of 3 month ZAR-JIBAR plus 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively, with interest payable quarterly.


The following table summarises the impact of the total Note switch and the total new funding on the maturity
profile of the Notes under the Programme, in respect of Northam’s financial years ending 30 June. Values
represent the change in the nominal amount of Note maturities for each financial year.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam is pleased to have successfully completed its
R2.65 billion restructuring of its DMTN Programme. This will assist significantly in preserving and strengthening
Northam’s liquidity position during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Northam is also pleased to have attracted
more than R400 million of additional new long-term funding during the lockdown period. We believe the company
is well placed to weather the ongoing COVID-19 challenges and we remain appreciative of the support of our
investors.”

R2.166 BILLION RESTRUCTURING OF NORTHAM’S DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME,
INCLUDING NEW FUNDING

Northam is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with certain holders of domestic medium term
notes (“Notes”) (“Noteholders”) under Northam’s R10 billion Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (dated
3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time) (“Programme”), to extend the maturity
dates of certain Notes with an aggregate nominal amount of c.R1.885 billion through the purchase and
cancellation of such Notes and the simultaneous issue of new Notes with longer term maturities, for the same
nominal amount and to the same Noteholders (“Note Switch”). Furthermore, certain Noteholders will invest
additional capital and subscribe for additional new Notes with an aggregate nominal amount of c.R281 million
(“New Funding”).

The Note Switch will preserve the group’s liquidity in the short to medium term by extending the maturity dates
of certain Notes, whilst the New Funding will provide additional liquidity and further strengthen the group’s balance
sheet over the short to medium term. The Note Switch will not increase the total nominal amount of Notes in
issue under the Programme whilst the New Funding will increase the total nominal amount of Notes in issue
under the Programme by c.R281 million, from R5.245 billion to c.R5.526 billion.

The Notes to be purchased and cancelled as part of the Note Switch were issued under bond code series
NHM002, NHM006, NHM007, NHM009, NHM010, NM011, NHM012, NHM013 and NHM014 and mature in
Northam’s financial years ending 30 June 2020, 2021 and 2022. The new Notes to be issued as part of the Note
Switch and New Funding (collectively, the “New Notes”) will mature over a nine month (c.R495 million), three
year (c.R671 million), four year (R450 million) and five year (R550 million) term from the date of issue. The nine
month, three year, four year and five year New Notes will attract a floating rate coupon of 2.40%, 3.75%, 4.00%
and 4.25% above the 3 month ZAR-JIBAR per annum, respectively. Interest on the New Notes will be payable
quarterly.

Following implementation of the Note Switch, the remaining maturities under the Programme pertaining to the
rest of the calendar year 2020 (“CY 20”) will reduce from R550 million to c.R20 million. Northam is pleased that
the large reduction in CY 20 maturities significantly reduces capital outflow during the current national lockdown
and related operational constraints as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Northam has attracted
an additional c.R281 million of long-term funding during this period. The net effect for CY 20 is a c.R811 million
increase in liquidity derived from the Note Switch and New Funding.

The following table summarises the impact of the Note Switch and New Funding on the maturity profile of Notes
in issue, in respect of Northam’s financial years ending 30 June. Values represent the change in the nominal
amount of maturities of Notes for each financial year.

Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement published by Northam on SENS on 8 May 2020
pertaining to the listing of the NHM016 Note with a nominal amount of R550 million. c.R469 million of this amount
pertains to the Note Switch and c.R81 million pertains to the New Funding. Accordingly, Notes with a nominal
amount of c.R469 million will be purchased and cancelled by Northam on 11 May 2020, being the date of issue
of the NHM016 Note.

Further information pertaining to the Note Switch will be announced as and when the Note Switch is implemented
through the purchase of issued Notes and the issue of New Notes.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer said “Northam remains appreciative of the support and
confidence it continues to receive from investors in the Programme. The R1.885 billion note switch will assist in
preserving and strengthening Northam’s liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Added to this is a R530 million
reduction in maturities during calendar year 2020, coupled with an injection of R281 million of new capital,
resulting in an R811 million increase in calendar year 2020 liquidity. This is a very positive outcome for Northam.”

ACQUISITION OF R1.27 BILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES, FULLY FUNDED THROUGH A
PLACEMENT OF R1.27 BILLION OF NOTES UNDER THE DMTN PROGRAMME, AND AN INCREASE IN
THE DMTN PROGRAMME AMOUNT TO R10 BILLION

1.   ACQUISITION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES FOR R1.27 BILLION

     Northam shareholders are referred to the announcement dated 1 November 2019 (“previous
     announcement”) pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi Platinum (RF)
     Limited (“Zambezi”) (“Zambezi preference shares”).

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, it has acquired an
     additional 16.7 million Zambezi preference shares for a total cash consideration of approximately
     R1.27 billion (“ZPLP acquisition”). Northam now holds a total of 53 376 850 Zambezi preference shares,
     representing approximately 33.38% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

     As stated in the previous announcement, Northam’s acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce
     the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial
     statements, as well as Northam’s potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of
     Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi redeem
     the Zambezi preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (“Northam shares”)
     held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam at such time will
     result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in
     issue.

     The ZPLP acquisition has been fully funded through the placement of the new notes, as further detailed
     below.

     The ZPLP acquisition is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     and information relating thereto is provided for information purposes only.

2.   INCREASE IN NORTHAM’S DMTN PROGRAMME AMOUNT FROM R5 BILLION TO R10 BILLION

     In terms of the programme memorandum in respect of Northam's ZAR5 000 000 000 Domestic Medium
     Term Note Programme dated 3 August 2012, as amended and / or supplemented from time to time
     (“DMTN Programme”), the board of directors of Northam has approved an increase in the Programme                                                                                                       
     Nominal Amount from ZAR5 000 000 000 to ZAR10 000 000 000. This increase will provide Northam with
     additional funding flexibility.

3.   PLACEMENT OF R1.27 BILLION OF NEW NOTES

     Northam is pleased to announce that it has completed a private placement of notes to the value of
     R1.27 billion (“new notes”) under its DMTN Programme, in an amount equal to the consideration payable
     under the ZPLP acquisition. The new notes were placed as a new tranche under the NHM014 series and
     were listed on the Interest Rate Market of the JSE today, 3 April 2020. The new notes were issued on the
     same terms as the NHM014 series with a maturity date of 20 November 2021 and a floating interest rate of
     3 month ZAR-JIBAR plus 2.5%, with interest payable quarterly. Following the placement of the new notes,
     the total aggregate nominal amount of notes in issue under the DMTN Programme amounts to R5.445
     billion.

Financial results

Normalised headline earnings have been calculated taking into account the headline earnings adjusted for
items relating to the 2015 Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited black economic empowerment transaction (""BEE
transaction""); these include the preference share dividends associated with the BEE financing structure
as well as the loss on derecognition of the preference share liability. Stripping out the impact of the BEE
transaction resulted in normalised headline earnings increasing to R1.9 billion (H1 F2019: R553.3 million),
which equates to normalised earnings per share, based on the total number of 509 781 212 issued shares,
of 369.6 cents (H1 F2019: 108.5 cents), being an increase of 240.6%.

Sales revenue increased by 57.0% from R5.0 billion in H1 F2019 to R7.8 billion in the period under review.
The increase is attributable to an 11.9% increase in the volume of PGMs sold to 329 760 oz 4E (H1 F2019:
294 823 oz 4E), a 42.4% increase in the 4E basket price to USD1 443/oz (H1 F2019: USD1 013/oz) and a
3.7% weaker average ZAR/USD exchange rate realised of R14.72 (H1 F2019: R14.19).

A 23.1% increase in cost of sales and corresponding 57.0% increase in revenue resulted in operating profit
increasing to R3.0 billion (H1 F2019: R1.0 billion), an all-time high for the group. This translates to an
operating profit margin of 37.8%.

It is the first time since 2015 that the group has generated meaningful free cash flow after funding capital
expenditure. This amounted to R695.8 million (H1 F2019: utilisation of R185.6 million).

It is expected that the group's ability to generate free cash flow in the foreseeable future will be positively
impacted by production growth and the continuing increase in Platinum Group Metal prices.

The board of directors of Northam (""board"") has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the 2020
financial year (H1 F2019: R Nil per share). The board is currently of the view that the most efficient way to
return value to shareholders is by way of the purchase of Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited preference shares.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the financial
results for the current reporting period (H1 F2020) will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of
the previous corresponding period (H1 F2019).

Northam expects to achieve a record operating profit for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
underpinned by a solid operating performance at all operations and a higher basket price received. The
group achieved a record production from own operations amounting to 306 738 4E oz, representing a

* Used to determine the basic and headline earnings per share, calculated as 509 781 212 shares in issue less
159 905 453 shares held by Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (Zambezi). Zambezi is Northam's major empowerment
shareholder and Zambezi's financial results are consolidated into the group's financial results.

The group expects normalised headline earnings (defined as the group's headline earnings adjusted for
the impact of Northam's black economic empowerment transaction), which constitutes the group's main
measure of performance, to be in excess of R1.8 billion (H1 F2019: R553.3 million), representing an
increase in excess of 240% from H1 F2019.

During the period under review, Northam returned value to shareholders by acquiring 32.5 million
Zambezi preference shares (representing 20.3% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue) for
R2.4 billion. Northam now holds 22.9% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue, whilst maintaining a net
debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 to 1.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam's auditors. The condensed reviewed interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2019
are expected to be published on or about 28 February 2020.

ACQUISITION OF R997.5 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam shareholders (""shareholders"") are referred to the announcement dated 2 September 2019
     (""previous announcement"") pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi
     Platinum (RF) Limited (""Zambezi""), (""Zambezi preference shares"").

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, Northam has reached
     an agreement to acquire additional Zambezi preference shares, as detailed in paragraph 3 below
     (""acquisition""). Following the acquisition, Northam will hold 36 688 840 Zambezi preference shares,
     representing approximately 22.94% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

2.   RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION

     As stated in the previous announcement, Northam's acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce
     the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam's consolidated financial
     statements, as well as Northam's potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders
     of Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi redeem
     the Zambezi preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (""Northam shares"")
     held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam at such time will
     result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in
     issue.

3.   SMALL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION AND FAIRNESS OPINION

     Northam has reached agreement with the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (""PIC""), pursuant to
     which Northam will acquire 13 300 000 Zambezi preference shares from the PIC today, 1 November 2019
     at a price of R75 per Zambezi preference share, for a total cash consideration of R997.5 million.

     The acquisition is not subject to any conditions precedent and will be funded from Northam's cash reserves.

     The PIC is a material shareholder of Northam, in that within the preceding 12 months, it has been able to
     exercise voting control in excess of 10% of all Northam shares in issue. Accordingly, the PIC is a related
     party to Northam as contemplated in paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     (""Listings Requirements"") and the acquisition is categorised as a ""small related party transaction"" in
     terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements.

     In terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements, the acquisition is not subject to shareholder
     approval, provided an independent professional expert confirms that the terms of the acquisition are fair to
     shareholders. Northam has appointed BDO Corporate Finance Proprietary Limited (""BDO"") as the
     independent expert for purposes of providing an opinion in respect of the fairness of the acquisition
     (""fairness opinion"").

     BDO has considered the terms and conditions of the acquisition and is of the opinion that the acquisition
     is fair to shareholders. A copy of the fairness opinion is available for inspection for a period of 28 days from
     the date of this announcement, at Northam's registered office being, Building 4, 1 st Floor, Maxwell Office
     Park, Magwa Crescent West, Waterfall City, Jukskei View.

     Over the course of the past 12 months, Northam has acquired, in aggregate, 32 458 021 Zambezi
     preference shares. As a result of the aggregation provision contemplated in paragraph 9.11 read with
     paragraph 9.13(b) of the Listings Requirements, the acquisition is categorised as a ""category 2 transaction""
     in terms of paragraph 9.5(a) of the Listings Requirements. Notwithstanding this, in terms of paragraph 10.7
     as read with paragraph 10.8 of the Listings Requirements, the acquisition is not a ""related party transaction""
     as contemplated in paragraph 10.4 of the Listings Requirements and therefore is not subject to shareholder
     approval.

4.   DETAILS OF THE ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

     The Zambezi preference shares are cumulative, non-participating redeemable preference shares which
     accrue dividends at a nominal rate equal to the South African prime interest rate plus 3.5%, calculated on
     a daily basis, based on a 365-day year, compounded annually. The Zambezi preference shares were listed
     on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited on 11 May 2015.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Zambezi preference shares are redeemable on 17 May 2025 and will be
     redeemed, at Zambezi's election, in cash and / or through the distribution of Northam shares held by
     Zambezi. The redemption of the Zambezi preference shares is secured through a guarantee provided by
     Northam in favour of the holders of Zambezi preference shares. If the guarantee is exercised, Northam
     will, at its election, settle the associated liability using cash and / or through the issue of new Northam
     shares.

     As reported in the annual financial statements of Northam for the year ended 30 June 2019, the Zambezi
     preference share liability amounted to approximately R10.8 billion and the accumulated preference share
     dividends for the period amounted to approximately R1.3 billion. The acquisition by Northam of Zambezi
     preference shares will further reduce the Zambezi preference share liability and accumulated preference
     share dividends recognised in Northam's consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies
     adopted by Northam in the preparation of its annual financial statements are in accordance with the
     International Financial Reporting Standards.

NORTHAM ACQUIRES THE MAROELABULT ASSETS FOR R20 MILLION

Northam is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Eland Platinum Proprietary Limited
(""Eland""), has entered into an agreement with Barplats Mines Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of Eastern
Platinum Limited, to purchase the Maroelabult assets (""Maroelabult assets"") including the mining and
surface rights, infrastructure, equipment and associated fixed and movable property, for a cash
consideration of R20 million (""purchase consideration""), (""transaction""). Upon implementation of the
transaction, Eland will assume the environmental rehabilitation liabilities associated with the Maroelabult
assets in accordance with the transaction terms.

The transaction and payment of the purchase consideration are subject to the fulfilment of certain
conditions precedent typical for a transaction of this nature including, inter alia, consent by the Minister of
Mineral Resources and Energy in terms of section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act, No. 28 of 2002 to incorporate the relevant mining right portions into the contiguous
mining right held by Eland.

The property on which the Maroelabult assets are located lies immediately west of Eland mine and the
UG2 orebody on these two properties is analogous. The Maroelabult assets include a measured and
indicated resource of 231 744 oz 4E and a proved and probable reserve of 188 357 oz 4E. The surface
and underground infrastructure included in the Maroelabult assets will positively impact the overall build
program of Eland mine and provide additional planning optionality.

In order to facilitate an efficient transfer of ownership, Eland will be granted access to the Maroelabult
assets from 1 November 2019 and will assume responsibility for the care and maintenance costs of the
Maroelabult assets with effect from this date, amounting to approximately R6.6 million per annum.

Northam's Chief Executive Officer, Paul Dunne, said ""Northam is looking forward to extracting the
synergistic benefits between the Maroelabult assets and Eland and we are confident that the Maroelabult
assets will make a positive contribution towards Eland's ongoing development.""

The transaction falls below the threshold for categorisation in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements and therefore this announcement is provided for information purposes only.

NORTHAM'S LONG TERM CREDIT RATING RE-AFFIRMED, SHORT TERM CREDIT RATING
REVISED AND OUTLOOK UPGRADED

Northam is pleased to advise shareholders that the credit rating agency, Global Credit Rating Co.
(""GCR""), has re-affirmed Northam's national scale long term credit rating of A-(ZA) and revised its short
term credit rating to A2(ZA) (in accordance with the changes in GCR's Rating Scales, Symbols and
Definitions, May 2019), with the outlook upgraded to positive.

The upgrade to a positive outlook acknowledges Northam's improving trends in its earnings and
production profile, as well as its conservative debt metrics. Moreover, the positive outlook reflects the
likelihood of a future upgrade to Northam's credit rating, should Northam continue to expand its
production profile and operating cash flows in line with expectations, whilst maintaining financial discipline
regarding expansionary capital expenditure and shareholder distributions.

ACQUISITION OF R293 MILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam shareholders (""shareholders"") are referred to the announcement dated 30 August 2019
     (""previous announcement"") pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi
     Platinum (RF) Limited (""Zambezi""), (""Zambezi preference shares"").

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, Northam has
     reached an agreement to acquire additional Zambezi preference shares, as detailed in paragraph 3
     below (""acquisition""). Following the acquisition, Northam will hold 23 388 840 Zambezi preference
     shares, representing approximately 14.6% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

2.   RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION

     As stated in the previous announcement, Northam's acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will
     reduce the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam's consolidated financial
     statements, as well as Northam's potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders
     of Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect
     to redeem the Zambezi preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam
     (""Northam shares"") held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by
     Northam at such time will result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the
     number of Northam shares in issue.

3.   SMALL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION

     Northam has reached agreement with Coronation Asset Management Proprietary Limited, acting as an
     investment manager on behalf of its clients (""Coronation""), pursuant to which Northam will acquire
     Coronation's entire remaining shareholding of Zambezi preference shares, being 3 980 382 Zambezi
     preference shares, at a price of R73.50 per Zambezi preference share, for a total cash consideration of
     approximately R292.6 million. The acquisition will be funded from Northam's cash reserves.

     The acquisition will be implemented on 30 September 2019, provided Northam obtains a fairness opinion
     confirming that the acquisition is fair to shareholders, as further detailed below.
     
     Coronation is a material shareholder of Northam, in that it is able to exercise voting control, on behalf of
     its clients, in excess of 10% of all Northam shares in issue. Accordingly, Coronation is a related party to
     Northam as contemplated in paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     (""Listings Requirements"") and the acquisition is categorised as a ""small related party transaction"" in
     terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements.

     The acquisition is not subject to shareholder approval, provided an independent professional expert
     confirms that the terms of the acquisition are fair to shareholders (""fairness opinion""). Further
     information regarding the fairness opinion will be published on SENS in due course.

4.   DETAILS OF THE ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

     The Zambezi preference shares are cumulative, non-participating redeemable preference shares which
     accrue dividends at a nominal rate equal to the South African prime interest rate plus 3.5%, calculated on
     a daily basis, based on a 365-day year, compounded annually. The Zambezi preference shares were
     listed on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited on 11 May 2015.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Zambezi preference shares are redeemable on 17 May 2025 and will
     be redeemed, at Zambezi's election, in cash and / or through the distribution of Northam shares held by
     Zambezi. The redemption of the Zambezi preference shares is secured through a guarantee provided by
     Northam in favour of the holders of Zambezi preference shares. If the guarantee is exercised, Northam
     will, at its election, settle the associated liability using cash and / or through the issue of new Northam
     shares.

     As reported in the annual financial statements of Northam for the year ended 30 June 2019, the Zambezi
     preference share liability amounted to approximately R10.8 billion and the accumulated preference share
     dividends for the period amounted to approximately R1.3 billion. The acquisition by Northam of Zambezi
     preference shares will reduce the Zambezi preference share liability and accumulated preference share
     dividends recognised in Northam's consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies adopted
     by Northam in the preparation of its annual financial statements are in accordance with the International
     Financial Reporting Standards.

ACQUISITION OF R1 BILLION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam shareholders (""shareholders"") are referred to the announcement dated 6 August 2019
     (""previous announcement"") pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of preference shares in Zambezi
     Platinum (RF) Limited (""Zambezi""), (""Zambezi preference shares"").

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, Northam has
     reached an agreement to acquire additional Zambezi preference shares, as detailed in paragraph 3
     below (""acquisition""). Following the acquisition, Northam will hold 19 408 458 Zambezi preference
     shares, representing approximately 12.1% of all Zambezi preference shares in issue.

2.   RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION

     As stated in the previous announcement, Northam's acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will
     reduce the preference share dividend expense and liability included in Northam's consolidated financial
     statements, as well as Northam's potential financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders
     of Zambezi preference shares, should the guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect
     to redeem the Zambezi preference shares through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam
     (""Northam shares"") held by Zambezi, then the redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by
     Northam at such time will result in a distribution of Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the
     number of Northam shares in issue.

3.   SMALL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION AND FAIRNESS OPINION

     Northam has reached agreement with the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited (""PIC""), pursuant
     to which Northam will acquire 13 700 000 Zambezi preference shares from the PIC today
     (Friday, 30 August 2019) at a price of R73.50 per Zambezi preference share, for a total cash
     consideration of approximately R1.007 billion.

     The acquisition is not subject to any conditions precedent and will be funded from Northam's cash
     reserves.

     The PIC is a material shareholder of Northam, in that within the preceding 12 months, it has been able to
     exercise voting control in excess of 10% of all Northam shares in issue. Accordingly, the PIC is a related
     party to Northam as contemplated in paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     (""Listings Requirements"") and the acquisition is categorised as a ""small related party transaction"" in
     terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements.

     The acquisition is not subject to shareholder approval, provided an independent professional expert
     confirms that the terms of the acquisition are fair to shareholders. Northam has appointed BDO
     Corporate Finance Proprietary Limited (""BDO"") as the independent expert for purposes of providing an
     opinion in respect of the fairness of the acquisition (""fairness opinion"").

     BDO has considered the terms and conditions of the acquisition and is of the opinion that the acquisition
     is fair to shareholders. A copy of the fairness opinion is available for inspection for a period of 28 days
     from the date of this announcement, at Northam's registered office being, Building 4, 1st Floor, Maxwell
     Office Park, Magwa Crescent West, Waterfall City, Jukskei View.

4.   DETAILS OF THE ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

     The Zambezi preference shares are cumulative, non-participating redeemable preference shares which
     accrue dividends at a nominal rate equal to the South African prime interest rate plus 3.5%, calculated on
     a daily basis, based on a 365-day year, compounded annually. The Zambezi preference shares were
     listed on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited on 11 May 2015.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Zambezi preference shares are redeemable on 17 May 2025 and will
     be redeemed, at Zambezi's election, in cash and / or through the distribution of Northam shares held by
     Zambezi. The redemption of the Zambezi preference shares is secured through a guarantee provided by
     Northam in favour of the holders of Zambezi preference shares. If the guarantee is exercised, Northam
     will, at its election, settle the associated liability using cash and / or through the issue of new Northam
     shares.

     As reported in the annual financial statements of Northam for the year ended 30 June 2019, the Zambezi
     preference share liability amounted to approximately R10.8 billion and the accumulated preference share
     dividends for the period amounted to approximately R1.3 billion. The acquisition by Northam of Zambezi
     preference shares will reduce the Zambezi preference share liability and accumulated preference share
     dividends recognised in Northam's consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies adopted
     by Northam in the preparation of its annual financial statements are in accordance with the International
     Financial Reporting Standards.

ABRIDGED AUDITED GROUP ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019 
AND NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Key features:

-   Record operating profit of R2.4 billion
-   Record production from own operations of 519 954 oz 4E
-   Normalised headline earnings of 270.1 cents per share, up 226.6%
-   Execution of growth strategy remains firmly in place, with R2.6 billion spent on its execution 
    during the period under review
-   Net debt of R3 billion
-   Commendable safety performance LTIIR of 0.93

Financial results

Northam achieved a record operating profit of R2.4 billion for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 
(F2018: R823.3 million), representing a 192.7% increase from the previous corresponding period, underpinned 
by a solid operating performance at both operations, well contained unit cash costs and a higher basket 
price received. This translates to an operating profit margin of 22.6% (F2018: 10.9%).

The group achieved a record production from own operations amounting to 519 954 oz 4E (F2018: 483 941 oz 4E), 
representing a 7.4% increase from the previous corresponding period, with increased contributions from
both Booysendal and Zondereinde. Group chrome concentrate production increased by 17.6% to 764 528 tonnes
on the back of growth at Booysendal and Zondereinde, as well as first production from Eland 
(F2018: 650 091 tonnes).

The total comprehensive income for the period was R71.4 million (F2018: loss of R705.4 million). Included in
the income for the period is the impact of the black economic empowerment (""BEE"") transaction relating to the
Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited preference shares, which are consolidated into the group results and accrued a
cumulative variable dividend (accrued dividends) amounting to R1.3 billion (F2018: R1.1 billion). This negatively
impacted the consolidated group results for the period under review. Shareholders are reminded that this is a
non-cash item.

Normalised headline earnings per share for the period were 226.6% higher at 270.1 cents (F2018: 82.7 cents)
per share. Normalised headline earnings, which is Northam's main measure of performance, has been calculated
taking into account the headline earnings/loss per share adjusted for non-cash items relating to the BEE
transaction. These include the preference share dividends associated with the BEE transaction, as detailed above.

Total group capital expenditure reduced year on year to R2.9 billion as major project milestones were completed.
R2.6 billion was spent on expansionary capex and R221.8 million on sustaining capex.

Despite the difficult economic circumstances prevailing during the period under review, both of Northam's mining
operations posted an operating profit. Zondereinde achieved an operating profit of R1.3 billion (F2018: R355.4 million) 
and Booysendal achieved an operating profit of R985.7 million (F2018: R525.4 million).

The group continues to deliver on its strategy of developing low-cost, long-life assets in order to position itself at
the lower end of the industry cost curve.

Dividends

Given the company's current capital structure, project commitments and economic operating environment, the
Northam board of directors (the ""board"") are of the view that the most efficient way to return value to investors
precludes the payment of a cash dividend. The board has therefore resolved not to declare a dividend for the
financial year ended 30 June 2019 (F2018: R Nil).

NORTHAM REFINANCES ITS FIVE YEAR R3.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND
INCREASES ITS R2 BILLION DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAMME LIMIT TO R5 BILLION


Northam is pleased to announce that it has concluded definitive agreements in terms of which its existing five
year R3.5 billion revolving credit facility (""RCF"") will be refinanced on more favourable terms and the maturity
date will be extended from November 2021 to August 2024. The interest rate on the previous RCF was JIBAR
plus 3.3% whereas the effective interest rate on the new RCF ranges between JIBAR plus 2.2% (at the lower
end of utilisation) and JIBAR plus 2.6% (at the upper end of utilisation, including full utilisation).

In addition, the interest rate on Northam's R500 million general banking facility (""GBF"") will reduce from prime
less 1.5% to prime less 1.75%.

The lower interest rate on the RCF and GBF will reduce Northam's weighted average cost of debt.

Northam further advises that the board of directors has approved an increase in the limit stipulated in Northam's
Domestic Medium Term Note Programme (""DMTN Programme""), dated 3 August 2012, from R2 billion to
R5 billion. This increase will provide Northam with increased funding flexibility. Northam currently has
R1.825 billion of notes in issue under the DMTN Programme.

Paul Dunne, Northam's Chief Executive, said ""The new RCF and GBF terms reflect improved lender
confidence in Northam, underpinned by Northam's operational performance and project execution. Northam's
cost of debt will be reduced and the combination of the new facilities and increased DMTN Programme will
provide Northam with increased funding flexibility in support of Northam's significant and continued growth"".

ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam shareholders (""shareholders"") are referred to the announcement dated 1 November 2016
     (""previous announcement"") pertaining to the acquisition by Northam of 4 043 018 preference shares in
     Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (""Zambezi""), (""Zambezi preference shares"") for a purchase
     consideration equal to the issue price plus accumulated preference share dividends (""face value"").

     Northam is pleased to announce that, since the date of the previous announcement, Northam has
     acquired additional Zambezi preference shares and has reached agreement to acquire further Zambezi
     preference shares, as detailed in paragraph 3 below. As a result of these acquisitions, Northam will hold
     5 708 458 Zambezi preference shares (""Northam owned prefs""), representing approximately 3.6% of all
     Zambezi preference shares in issue. The face value of the Northam owned prefs, calculated as at
     6 August 2019, amounts to approximately R403.5 million.

     All the Northam owned prefs have been purchased at, or below, face value (as calculated on the date of
     acquisition).

2.   RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

     Northam's acquisition of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the preference share dividend expense
     and liability included in Northam's consolidated financial statements, as well as Northam's potential
     financial exposure under the guarantee it provided to holders of Zambezi preference shares, should the
     guarantee be called upon. Furthermore, should Zambezi elect to redeem the Zambezi preference shares
     through a distribution of ordinary shares in Northam (""Northam shares"") held by Zambezi, then the
     redemption of the Zambezi preference shares held by Northam at such time will result in a distribution of
     Northam shares to Northam, thereby reducing the number of Northam shares in issue.

3.   SMALL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION AND FAIRNESS OPINION

     Northam has reached agreement with Coronation Asset Management Proprietary Limited, acting as an
     investment manager on behalf of its clients (""Coronation""), pursuant to which Northam will acquire
     341 455 Zambezi preference shares from Coronation on Tuesday, 6 August 2019, at a price of R70.69
     per Zambezi preference share, representing the face value of such shares, for a total cash consideration
     of approximately R24.1 million (""further transaction"").
     The further transaction is not subject to any conditions precedent and will be funded from Northam's
     cash reserves.

     Coronation is a material shareholder of Northam, in that it is able to exercise voting control, on behalf of
     its clients, in excess of 10% of all Northam shares in issue. Accordingly, Coronation is a related party to
     Northam as contemplated in paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
     (""Listings Requirements"").

     Over the course of the past 12 months, Northam has acquired Zambezi preference shares from
     Coronation at face value. As a result of the aggregation provision contemplated in paragraph 10.8 of the
     Listings Requirements, the further transaction is categorised as a ""small related party transaction"" in
     terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements.

     The further transaction is not subject to shareholder approval, provided an independent professional
     expert has confirmed that the terms of the further transaction are fair to shareholders. Northam has
     appointed BDO Corporate Finance Proprietary Limited (""BDO"") as the independent expert for purposes
     of providing an opinion in respect of the fairness of the further transaction (""fairness opinion"").

     BDO has considered the terms and conditions of the further transaction and is of the opinion that the
     further transaction is fair to shareholders. A copy of the fairness opinion is available for inspection for a
     period of 28 days from the date of this announcement, at Northam's registered office being, Building 4,
     1st Floor, Maxwell Office Park, Magwa Crescent West, Waterfall City, Jukskei View.

4.   DETAILS OF THE ZAMBEZI PREFERENCE SHARES

     The Zambezi preference shares are cumulative, non-participating redeemable preference shares which
     accrue dividends at a nominal rate equal to the South African prime interest rate plus 3.5%, calculated on
     a daily basis, based on a 365-day year, compounded annually. The Zambezi preference shares were
     listed on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited on 11 May 2015.

     Subject to certain exceptions, the Zambezi preference shares are redeemable on 17 May 2025 and will
     be redeemed, at Zambezi's election, in cash and / or through the distribution of Northam shares held by
     Zambezi. The redemption of the Zambezi preference shares is secured through a guarantee provided by
     Northam in favour of the holders of Zambezi preference shares. If the guarantee is exercised, Northam
     will, at its election, settle the associated liability using cash and / or through the issue of new Northam
     shares.

     As reported in the reviewed condensed consolidated interim results of Northam for the six months ended
     31 December 2018 (""Northam results""), the Zambezi preference share liability amounted to
     approximately R10.1 billion and the accumulated preference share dividends for the period amounted to
     R611.8 million. The acquisition by Northam of Zambezi preference shares will reduce the Zambezi
     preference share liability and accumulated preference share dividends recognised in Northam's
     consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies adopted by Northam in the preparation of its
     consolidated financial statements, including the Northam results, are in accordance with the International
     Financial Reporting Standards.

NORTHAM APPROVES KUKAMA PROJECT AT ELAND MINE

Northam is pleased to advise its shareholders that mining operations at the Kukama shaft situated at
its Eland mine complex will recommence in the new financial year (F2020).

This significant development comes after the successful conclusion of a feasibility study for the
Kukama project.

Background

Northam purchased a 100% interest in the Eland mine from Glencore Operations South Africa
Proprietary Limited in February 2017 for a cash consideration of R175 million. Eland mine was placed
on care and maintenance in 2015 and Northam continued to manage it as such whilst undertaking
the feasibility study for the Kukama shaft.

In terms of the transaction, Northam acquired all of Eland mine's assets which included:

   •   Eland's two mining rights with a resource currently estimated at 19.3 Moz 4E at an average in
       situ grade of 3.95 g/t;

   •   surface and underground infrastructure including a concentrator with a nameplate capacity of
       250 ktpm; a chrome spiral recovery plant; a tailings storage facility; two decline systems; and
       surface support infrastructure;

   •   immovable property; and

   •   a mining fleet in excess of 100 vehicles, which includes low profile mechanised mining
       equipment.
Key conclusions from the Kukama shaft feasibility study

   •   Steady state production of 150 Koz pa 4E, at unit costs in the lower half of the industry cost
       curve.

   •   Forecast investment returns comfortably in excess of Northam's current weighted average
       cost of capital.

   •   Forecast positive free cash flow generated from year 4 onwards.

   •   Creation of 2 800 permanent jobs.

   •   Life of mine in excess of 30 years.

Current status of Eland mine

To date, Northam has continued to manage the Eland mine on care and maintenance whilst
undertaking the feasibility study for the Kukama shaft.

Whilst completing the feasibility study for Kukama shaft and following positive feedback from the
study, Northam commenced early work in preparation for its recommissioning. This includes
refurbishing underground fixed and mobile equipment, as well as certain sections of the concentrator.
Processing of the tailings storage facility at Eland mine has also commenced, which facilitated
recommissioning of the surface plant and associated infrastructure.

The next steps

Conversion of the Kukama decline shaft into a footwall array will start in F2020, along with limited
early stoping. Strike development and stoping build-up is scheduled to commence in F2021.
Production is forecast to reach 100 Koz pa 4E by 2025 and steady state production of 150 Koz pa 4E
is forecast from 2029.

Capital expenditure

Total developmental capital expenditure is estimated at R2.2 billion over a five year period, in nominal
terms (F2019 terms: R1.9 billion), which includes a provision for working capital requirements during
the development phase. The project will be fully funded from Northam's own resources.
                                             
Conclusion

Northam chief executive Paul Dunne points to the positive investment return demonstrated by the
Kukama project, which comfortably exceeds the company's weighted average cost of capital. ""In
addition,"" says Dunne, ""the project further diversifies the group's operations and production capacity
and does so efficiently by utilising an extensive existing capital footprint. Kukama is a project that
lends itself to scaling up or down and will form the production base for the broader Eland complex.
The mining method to be implemented at Kukama is well-known and well proven. Our focus will be
on safe, quality, long-life production, whilst creating sustainable long-term employment in the platinum
industry.""

NORTHAM SECURES R1 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FACILITIES

Northam is pleased to announce that it has increased its existing revolving credit facilities (""RCF"") by R500
million, from R3 billion to R3.5 billion. In addition a new R500 million general banking facility (""GBF"") has been
secured.

The maturity date of Northam's existing R1 billion RCF has been extended to match that of its existing R2
billion RCF and both of these facilities, as well as the R500 million increase, have been combined into a single
R3.5 billion RCF maturing on 29 November 2021. The interest rate on the total RCF remains unchanged and
the GBF will accrue interest at a variable rate of prime less 1.5%.

Paul Dunne, Northam's Chief Executive said ""The R1 billion increase in available facilities is in addition to
the placement of R1.65 billion of domestic medium term notes announced on 16 April 2019, and further
strengthens Northam's balance sheet. This additional funding flexibility will enable Northam to further return
value to shareholders, in due course, through a repurchase of ordinary shares and/or a purchase of Zambezi
preference shares"".

NORTHAM SECURES ADDITIONAL FUNDING WITH NEW R1.65 BILLION
DOMESTIC MEDIUM TERM NOTES PLACEMENT

Northam is pleased to announce that it has completed a private placement of domestic medium term notes
(""Notes"") to the value of R1.65 billion (""New Notes"") under Northam's R2 billion Domestic Medium Term Note
Programme (the ""Programme""). The New Notes will mature over a one year (R250 million), two year
(R250 million) and three year (R1.15 billion) term from the date of issue. The one year, two year and three year
New Notes will attract a floating rate coupon of 2.40%, 3.25% and 3.75% above a 3 month ZAR-JIBAR per
annum, respectively. Interest on the New Notes is payable quarterly.

The initial proceeds from the New Notes will be applied towards settling existing Notes in issue which mature on
20 April 2019 (NHM004) (payment date 23 April 2019), 18 May 2019 (NHM005) (payment date 20 May 2019)
and 9 June 2019 (NHM003) (payment date 10 June 2019), respectively (collectively, ""Maturing Notes""). The
Maturing Notes have an aggregate nominal value, excluding interest, of R1.25 billion. Upon completion of the
issuing of the New Notes and settlement of the Maturing Notes, the total value of Notes in issue will increase by
R400 million.

An aggregate amount of R550 million of the New Notes will be issued today on the Interest Rate Market of the
JSE Limited, as announced on SENS on 15 April 2019. This issue comprises a tranche of R250 million two year
senior unsecured floating rate Notes (NHM006) and a tranche of R300 million three year senior unsecured
floating rate Notes (NHM007).

The remaining tranches of the New Notes, with a total value of R1.1 billion (""Outstanding New Notes""), will be
issued during the months of April, May and June 2019, to coincide with the maturity dates of the Maturing Notes
and subject to the terms of the Programme, in terms of which the maximum aggregate nominal value of Notes in
issue is limited to R2 billion at any point in time. Further detailed announcements pertaining to the issue of the
Outstanding New Notes will be published on SENS in due course.

The issue of three year term Notes with an aggregate nominal value of R1.15 billion aligns with Northam's
medium term intention to repurchase Northam ordinary shares and/or purchase Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited
preference shares (""Zambezi Preference Shares"").

Paul Dunne, Northam's Chief Executive said ""Northam is pleased to maintain its balance sheet strength and
funding flexibility in order to complete its various growth projects and, in due course, to commence a programme
of repurchasing its ordinary shares and/or purchasing Zambezi Preference Shares to return value to
shareholders.""

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED REVIEWED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESILTS

1. Accounting policies and the basis of preparation
The interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the financial instruments to the extent required or
permitted under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as set out in the relevant accounting policies detailed in Northam's Annual Integrated
Report, which includes the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2018. These condensed interim financial statements incorporate the
accounting policies which are in terms of IFRS and have been applied on a basis consistent with the previous year, with the exception of the policies adopted
during the period as more fully set out below.

The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and containing the information required by the framework concepts
and the measurement and recognition requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee, presentation and disclosures as required by Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards
Council, the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and were reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act No. 71 of South Africa
(Companies Act) including the adoption of the following standards, amendments or interpretations with effect from 1 July 2018:

- IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

- IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

- Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment - Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions

- IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The group has adopted IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 for the first time with a date of initial application of 1 July 2018. The nature and effect of the changes as a result
of adoption of these new accounting standards are described below.

The adoption of all other standards, amendments or interpretations, other than IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 had no impact on the interim condensed consolidated
results.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)'s replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement. The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting of financial
instruments.

The new Standard contains substantial changes from the previous financial instruments Standard (IAS 39) with regards to the classification, measurement,
impairment and hedge accounting requirements.

IFRS 9 establishes a new model for recognition and measurement of impairments in financial assets that are measured at amortised cost or fair value
though other comprehensive income (FVOCI), the so-called expected credit loss model. This is the only impairment model that applies in IFRS 9 because
all other assets are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) or, in the case of qualifying equity investments, FVOCI with no
recycling to profit or loss.

Expected credit losses are calculated by: identifying scenarios in which a financial asset defaults; estimating the cash shortfall that would be incurred in
each scenario if a default were to happen; multiplying that loss by the probability of the default happening; and summing the results of all such possible
default events. Because every financial asset has at least some probability of defaulting in the future, every financial asset has an expected credit loss
associated with it from the moment of its origination or acquisition.

IFRS 9 does not require an entity to restate prior periods. Restatement is permitted, if and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight and the restated
financial statements reflect all of the requirements of IFRS 9. If the entity does not restate prior periods, any difference between previous carrying amounts
and those determined under IFRS 9 at the date of initial application should be included in the current year opening retained earnings (or other equivalent
component of equity).

IFRS 9 has been applied for the current period presented and comparatives have not been restated.

Below is a summary of the impact that IFRS 9 has had on the statement of financial position:

Financial assets
The characteristics of Long-term receivables, Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents were reassessed based on the requirements of
IFRS 9 and it was concluded that they meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement. Therefore reclassification of these instruments was not required.

The characteristics of the Investments held by Northam Platinum Restoration Trust Fund, Environmental Guarantee Investment and the Buttonshope
Conservancy Trust were reassessed based on the requirements of IFRS 9. These financial assets are not considered to derive contractual cash flows which
are solely principal and interest on the principal amount, they therefore are not classified as at amortised cost, and default into the fair value through profit
or loss measurement category.

Provisional pricing receivables measured at fair value through profit or loss relate to financial assets recognised as a result of satisfaction of performance
obligations relating to revenue from contracts with customers. The group therefore has an unconditional right to the consideration that is due. The value of
the receivable fluctuates in line with market factors, resulting in this class of financial asset being measured at fair value through profit or loss. The balance
of this financial asset was previously recognised within Trade and other receivables but has been separated out for better disclosure. The balance of the
financial asset was previously recognised within trade and other receivables, but has now been separately disclosed for improved disclosure.

Financial liabilities

There were no changes to the recognition and measurement criteria of financial liabilities. Therefore all existing financial liabilities remain at their original
classification and measurement.

A Provisional pricing derivative is recognised when payment by the customer made on provisionally priced goods results in an effective overpayment due
to fluctuations in market factors until final pricing is confirmed. Provisional pricing derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss relate to financial
liabilities recognised as a result of the satisfaction of performance obligations relating to revenue from contracts with customers.

The value of the payable fluctuates in line with market factors, resulting in this class of financial liability being measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The balance of this financial liability was previously recognised within Trade and other payables but has been separated out for better disclosure.

Once pricing on goods are finalised and no further market fluctuations affect the value of consideration refundable to the customer, the balance of Provisional
pricing derivatives is transferred to Trade and other payables.

Impairment

Previously under IAS 39, impairment or credit losses are only recognised when a credit loss event occurs (incurred loss model). Under IFRS 9, the new
impairment requirements are based on expected credit losses (expected credit loss model). Expected credit losses (ECLs) are an estimate of credit losses
over the life of a financial instrument, and are recognised as a loss allowance or provision. The amount of ECLs to be recognised depends on the extent of
credit deterioration since initial recognition.

IFRS 9 requires an entity to apply the expected credit loss model to all debt instruments classified as measured at amortised cost, or at fair value through
other comprehensive income, including lease receivables and contract assets.

In applying the IFRS 9 requirement of assessment of impairment, the group considers both approaches: the general approach and the simplified approach.
For trade receivables (not subject to provisional pricing) and other receivables due in less than 12 months, the group applies the simplified approach in
calculating ECLs, as permitted by IFRS 9. Therefore, the group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead, recognises a loss allowance based on
the financial asset's lifetime ECL at each reporting date. The group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The general approach requires the assessment of financial assets to be split into 3 stages:

Stage 1: no significant deterioration in credit quality. This identifies financial assets as having a low credit risk, and the asset is considered to be performing
as anticipated. At this stage, a 12 month expected credit loss assessment is required.

Stage 2: significant deterioration in credit quality of the financial asset but no indication of a credit loss event. This stage identifies assets as under-
performing. Lifetime expected credit losses are required to be assessed.

Stage 3: clear and objective evidence of impairment is present. This stage identifies assets as non-performing financial instruments. Lifetime expected
credit losses are required to be assessed.

Once a default has occurred, it is considered a deterioration of credit risk and therefore an increase in the credit risk.

The group considers a wide variety of indicators when assessing the increase in credit risk as well as the probability of the default happening for impairment
purposes. Some indicators considered include: Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtor; past due information;
significant changes in external market indicators including market information related to the debtor, existing or forecast adverse changes in business,
financial or economic conditions; an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment; actual or
expected significant internal credit rating downgrade or decrease; actual or expected significant change in the operating results of the debtor.

The expected credit loss value is determined as the estimated cash shortfall that would be incurred, multiplied by the probability of the default occurring.

The group has assessed the expected credit losses on the following financial assets as at 30 June 2018 as follows, which is over and above any previous
impairments provided for in prior years:

                                                                                                                                       Additional impairment
                                                                                                                                                       value
                                                                                                                                                        R000


Long term receivables (net of tax)                                                                                                                   1 326

All other financial assets have been assessed for expected credit losses, and the effect is considered to be negligible due to the group's history of recovery
of these balances; as well as the credit rating of the various financial institutions that some of the balances are held with.

The probability of a shortfall being incurred is considered remote in the current economic environment, and the group therefore does not account for any
credit losses relating to the other financial assets.

Impact of adopting IFRS 9

In adopting IFRS 9 in the current period, the group's carrying value of financial instruments was only impacted with the impairment disclosed above. Minor
amendments were accounted for on the disclosure requirements on adoption of IFRS 9.

For financial instruments where the classification under IFRS 9 changed from the previous classification under IAS 39, the values were approximately
the same.

The group applies the following policies in line with the adoption of IFRS 9.

Measurement

Amortised cost

Financial instruments accounted for at amortised cost will remain at amortised cost with no adjustments required. The group continues to utilise the effective
interest method for financial instruments designated at amortised cost.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest income or
expense over the period of the instrument. Effectively, this method determines the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts
through the expected life of the financial instrument or, if appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.

All movements relating to financial instruments measured at amortised cost are accounted for in profit or loss. Interest is accounted for in line with the
effective interest method and impairment gains and losses are accounted for in line with the policy for impairment.

Fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets with provisional pricing arrangements (provisional pricing receivables) are recognised as a separate category of trade and other receivables.

These instruments represent all movements after the date of sale, which are determined to be fair value gains or losses on provisionally priced sales
throughout the quotational period until the sale value is finalised. The balance represents amounts owing to the group.

The movements are therefore not considered to be contractual cash flows of principal and interest on the principle. Therefore this financial asset is required
to be classified and measured as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial liabilities with provisional pricing arrangements (provisional pricing derivatives) are recognised as a separate category of
financial liability.

These instruments represent all movements after the date of sale, which are determined to be fair value gains or losses on provisionally priced sales
throughout the quotational period until the sale value is finalised. The balance represents amounts owing by the group.

This financial liability is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.

These financial instruments are subsequently measure at fair value with all gains or losses recognised directly in profit or loss in line with the requirements
of IFRS 9.

The measurement principles applied by the group in line with IFRS 9 disclosed above are relatively consistent with the IAS 39 measurement principles
which were previously applied.

Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: the rights to receive
cash flows from the asset have expired; the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass through' arrangement; and either: (a) the group has transferred substantially
all the risks and rewards of the asset or (b) the group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has
transferred control of the asset

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced
by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts
is recognised in profit or loss.

Impairment

Impairment policy relating to financial instruments are considered in line with the expected credit loss model utilising the general approach.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition
guidance. The core principle is that an entity recognises revenue based on a five-step model to reflect the transfer of goods or services, measured at the
amount to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

The application of the five-step model in IFRS 15 has required the exercise of judgement, considering all facts and circumstances relative to each contract.
Judgements and estimates relating to IFRS 15 have been disclosed in the notes to the condensed interim financial statements. The standard
also provides guidance on the accounting treatment of costs attributable to fulfilling the contract, as well as the incremental costs of obtaining the contract.

In terms of IFRS 15, the group identifies each separate performance obligation contained in the contract and allocates a portion of the contract revenue to
each performance obligation. Revenue is then only recognised on the satisfaction of each of the relevant performance obligations. Revenue from contracts
with customers is recognised when control is transferred to the customer.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been adopted using the full retrospective method, making use of some of the practical expedients,
and therefore comparative information has been restated in line with the new accounting standard. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and all related
amendments and interpretations.

Below is a summary of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15:

The group undertook a detailed assessment of the impact of the new revenue standard based on a review of the contractual terms of its principal revenue
streams with the primary focus being to identify differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognised under IFRS 15. For all of the revenue streams,
the nature and timing of satisfaction of the performance obligations, and, hence, the amount and timing of revenue recognised under IFRS 15, is the same
as that under IAS 18.

There were however some disclosure reclassifications required as a result of the adoption of IFRS 15 (in conjunction with IFRS 9) and additional impact on
presentation requirements. The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have an impact on the opening retained earnings balance.

The following 2 practical expedients which are available in IFRS 15 have been utilised in the preparation of the financial information:

-      Significant financing components

       Sales terms are for payment from the customer to be made shortly after delivery. IFRS 15 contains a practical expedient where the promised amount
       of consideration (the transaction price) need not be adjusted for the effects of the time value of money and a significant financing component if the
       entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between transfer of the goods and receipt of payment for those goods will be one year or less.
       This would therefore not result in the recognition of any significant financing component contained within the sales agreement due to the short-term
       nature of the time between delivery of the metal and receipt of cash as all contracts are finalised within one to four months.

-      Future performance obligations

       IFRS 15 requires entities to disclose information relating to remaining performance obligations on current open contracts. Disclosures relating to the
       nature, timing and amount, as well as any specific terms contained in the open contract, are required. IFRS 15 provides a practical expedient when
       the performance obligations on contracts are expected to be completed within one year from inception of the contract. The group's contracts are all
       finalised within one to four months of inception and therefore are considered to be short-term.

       The practical expedient has therefore been applied to this disclosure as any future performance obligations on open contracts are expected to be
       finalised shortly after the reporting period. This is in line with the contractual terms, standard business operations, as well as historical information
       on open contracts.

Most contracts' performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time when product is delivered. The INCO terms utilised in most contracts within the group
are DAP and Ex-works. Delivery takes place, either at the determined location, or at the customer's premises. This is also the point at which control transfers
to the customer.

Precious metal sales

Revenue from platinum group metal (PGM) sales are recognised based on contractual terms specific to each transaction. The contractual terms stipulate
a fixed price relating to the commodity as well as exchange rates in the month in which the product is purchased. Platinum and palladium sales are recorded
at the daily London Metal Exchange: LBMA price. Rhodium, iridium and ruthenium sales are recorded at the weekly Platts New York Dealer price.

No adjustments are accounted for relating to volume of product or price on PGM sales as all these inputs are finalised on delivery date, which is the date
on which revenue is recognised. Therefore there were no changes identified relating to the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

Base metal sales

Revenue from base metal sales are recognised based on the initial assayed quantity of product; prevailing market prices and exchange rates. Revenue is
accounted for when control has transferred to the customer on delivery. Revenue accounted for, is the estimation of the amount of consideration to which
the group will be entitled at the date of sale. Revenue is estimated at contract inception (when control transfers) and is based on initial assays, prevailing
metal prices and current exchange rates. Movement in assay amounts were assessed in detail and were found to be immaterial and are therefore included
in the disclosure of all other movements relating to fair value adjustments which are separately disclosed in Revenue.

Payment on base metal sales is only made once provisional pricing has been finalised. Adjustments to the provisional pricing value occurs at the reporting
date and on finalisation of the sales transaction. A Provisional pricing receivable is recognised, in line with IFRS 9, to account for the fluctuations in market
factors until final pricing is confirmed. All fair value movements after the date of sale relating to provisionally priced amounts are recognised separately
within revenue as Revenue from fair value adjustments. There were no changes identified relating to the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

Chrome sales

Revenue from chrome sales are recognised based on the initial assayed quantity of product; prevailing market prices and exchange rates. Revenue is
accounted for when control has transferred to the customer on delivery and is based on the provisional pricing value which is the amount that reflects the
best estimate of the consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in terms of the calculation of revenue in line with IFRS 15 to the end of the
quotational period.

Payment on chrome sales is made based on the initial assayed quantity of product and related market inputs. Adjustments to the provisional pricing value
occurs at the reporting date and on finalisation of the sales transaction. A Provisional pricing derivative is recognised, in line with IFRS 9, when payment by
the customer made on provisionally priced goods results in an effective overpayment due to fluctuations in market factors until final pricing is confirmed.
 A provisional pricing receivable is recognised when the initial payment by the customer on the provisionally priced goods resulted in an underpayment due
to the fluctuations in market factors until final pricing is confirmed.

All fair value movements after the date of sale relating to provisionally priced amounts are recognised separately within revenue as Revenue from fair value
adjustments. There were no changes identified relating to the timing or amount of revenue recognition.

Contract balances

Provisional pricing receivables are recognised in line with IFRS 9, when the group has satisfied its performance obligation relating to delivery of the product
and has an unconditional right to the consideration that is due. This will be recognised when only the passage of time is required before payment is made
by the customer. All fair value adjustments relating to the movements in this balance are recognised within revenue from fair value adjustments.

A Provisional pricing derivative is recognised in line with IFRS 9, when payment by the customer made on provisionally priced goods results in an effective
overpayment due to fluctuations in market factors until final pricing is confirmed. All fair value adjustments relating to the movements in this balance are
recognised within revenue from fair value adjustments.

Provisional pricing receivables are reallocated to trade and other receivables at the end of the quotational period once the consideration relating to the sale
is no longer variable. The finalised consideration receivable is therefore no longer subject to fair value fluctuations.

Provisional pricing derivatives are reallocated to trade and other payables at the end of the quotational period once the consideration relating to the sale is
no longer variable. The finalised consideration refundable is therefore no longer subject to fair value fluctuations.

Impact of adopting IFRS 15

The groups' base metal and chrome sale agreements contain terms which allow for price adjustments based on the market price at the end of a relevant
quotational period stipulated in the contract, referred to as provisionally priced sales agreements.

Under previous accounting standards (IAS 18 and IAS 39), provisionally priced sales were considered to contain an embedded derivative, which was
required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes from the date of delivery. Revenue was initially recognised for these arrangements
at the date of delivery (which was when risks and rewards passed) and was based on the most recently determined estimate of metal in concentrate (based
on initial assay results) and the estimated price which was expected to receive at the end of the quotational period, determined at the date of delivery.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative were recognised in profit or loss each period until the end of the quotational period, and
were presented as part of revenue.

Under IFRS 15, the accounting for revenue will remain unchanged in that revenue will be recognised when control passes to the customer (which will
continue to be the date of delivery) and will be measured at the amount to which the group expects to be entitled. This will be the estimate of the price
expected to be received at the end of the quotational period. It will be the impact of the requirements of IFRS 9 that will lead to a changes in the disclosure
of the results of the group.

While the group will continue to present such movements as part of revenue on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,
presentation and disclosure changes are required. This is because the movements throughout the quotational period are not within the scope of IFRS 15,
and therefore required to be disclosed separately from revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of IFRS 15.

In adopting IFRS 15 in the current period, the only impact affecting the group is the disclosure requirements of revenue from contracts with customers being
separately presented from other revenue items in the notes to the financial statements, as well as the expanded disclosures on disaggregated revenue in
the notes to the financial statements. IFRS 15 did not impact profit or loss for the period, there was no impact on the statement of cash
flows, or EPS, and there was no required adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.

IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The interpretation clarifies that in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on
the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which an
entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts
in advance, the group must determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. The amendments are intended to
eliminate diversity in practice, when recognising the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-
monetary liability relating to advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency.

This interpretation did not have an impact on the condensed reviewed interim financial results.

The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards are not effective and have not been early adopted, but will be adopted once
these new standards, interpretations and amendments become effective:

IFRS 16 Leases

The new standard provides a comprehensive model to identify lease-arrangements and the treatment thereof in the financial statements of both lessees
and lessors.

IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise most leases on their statement of financial position as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. Lessees
will apply a single model for most leases (with certain exemptions). Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern will change as interest and depreciation
expenses are recognised separately in profit or loss (similar to current finance lease accounting). However, lessees can make accounting policy elections
to apply accounting similar to operating lease accounting under IAS 17 Leases to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from the current lease statement. As with IAS 17, IFRS 16 requires lessors to classify their leases into two
types: finance leases and operating leases. Lease classification determines how and when a lessor recognises lease revenue and what assets a lessor
records.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Lessees must apply IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified
retrospective approach.

The group has limited lease arrangements and the impact is therefore expected to be minimal, however this is still in the process of being assessed.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment

The IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (the Interpretation). The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition
and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation specifically addresses
the following: whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately, the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by
taxation authorities, how an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates and how an entity
considers changes in facts and circumstances.

The interpretation is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

This interpretation is currently not considered to have a material impact on the group results, however this will be assessed on a
continuous basis.

Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing costs

The amendments clarify that an entity treats, as part of general borrowings, any borrowing originally made to develop a qualifying asset when substantially
all of the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.

An entity applies those amendments to borrowing costs incurred on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies
those amendments.

An entity applies those amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

This amendment will be taken into account when determining general borrowing costs which can be capitalised to qualifying assets, in accordance with the
transitional provisions.

Definition of a Business - Amendments to IFRS 3

The IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of
activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants
are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of
a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.

The amendments must be applied to transactions that are either business combinations or asset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on or after
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Consequently, entities do not have to revisit such transactions that
occurred in prior periods. Early application is permitted and must be disclosed.

Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after the date of first application, the group will be affected by
these amendments on transition.

Definition of Material - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8

In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors to align the definition of material across the standards and to clarify certain aspects of the definition. The new definition states that,
information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose
financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity will need to assess whether the information,
either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the financial statements.

The definition of material in the Conceptual Framework and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Making Materiality Judgements were amended to align with the
revised definition of material in IAS 1 and IAS 8.

The amendments must be applied prospectively. Early application is permitted and must be disclosed.

Although the amendments to the definition of material is not expected to have a significant impact on the group's financial statements, the introduction of
the term obscuring information in the definition could potentially impact how materiality judgements are made in practice, by elevating the importance of
how information is communicated and organised in the financial statements.

The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020.

Conceptual Framework

The IASB has revised its Conceptual Framework. The primary purpose of the Framework is to assist the IASB (and the Interpretations Committee) by
identifying concepts that it will use when setting standards. Key changes include:

-      increasing the prominence of stewardship in the objective of financial reporting, which is to provide information that is useful in making resource
       allocation decisions

-      reinstating prudence, defined as the exercise of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty, as a component of neutrality

-      defining a reporting entity, which might be a legal entity or a portion of a legal entity

-      revising the definition of an asset as a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events

-      revising the definition of a liability as a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events

-      removing the probability threshold for recognition, and adding guidance on derecognition

-      adding guidance on the information provided by different measurement bases, and explaining factors to consider when selecting a measurement
       basis

-      stating that profit or loss is the primary performance indicator and that, in principle, income and expenses in other comprehensive income should be
       recycled where the relevance or faithful representation of the financial statements would be enhanced.

The Board and Interpretations Committee will immediately begin using the revised Framework, and the group will consider it when needed in terms of the
IAS 8 hierarchy dealing with selecting accounting policies not covered by an IFRS standard.

The revised Conceptual Framework is effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 2020.

RESULTS COMMENTARY
Northam's growth strategy of developing low-cost, long-life operations remains firmly in place. Project execution is on track and we are
confident that the group is in a position to deliver a strong financial performance even in subdued market conditions going forward.

We maintain a strong statement of financial position and significant empowerment credentials.

Both operating mines performed well during a challenging year. Our focus remains on project execution, sustainable cost control and
creating long-term value for all stakeholders.

Zondereinde
The lost time injury incidence rate improved to 1.27 per 200 000 hours worked (H1 F2018: 1.31). Regrettably on 25 October 2018,
Mr Stepher van Niekerk, a site manager for a contracting company, lost his life in an engineering related accident at the concentrator
dewatering plant. We extend our sincere condolences to Mr van Niekerk's family, friends and colleagues.

Zondereinde produced a solid operating performance with increased production from both the Merensky and UG2 reefs. Merensky
tonnage milled increased by 5.7% to 400 686 tonnes while UG2 increased by 2.8% to 606 450 tonnes for the period. The Merensky
head grade was 6.02 g/t 4E and the UG2 head grade increased marginally to 4.28 g/t 4E.

The UG2 stockpile increased to 290 969 tonnes.

Chrome concentrate tonnes increased by 4.9% due to the higher UG2 tonnage milled and improved yields.

Equivalent refined metal produced from own operations was similar to the corresponding prior period at 154 078 4E oz. Equivalent
refined metal from external parties was significantly lower as a third party concentrate purchase agreement expired.

Total refined metal produced increased by 41.1% to 299 323 4E oz, as a result of the strong operational delivery and commencement
of destocking of excess inventory.

Cash cost per equivalent refined platinum ounce for Zondereinde increased by 8.4% to R23 614 Pt/oz (H1 F2018: R21 775 Pt/oz).

During the period under review a three year wage agreement was concluded, effective 1 July 2018.

Ore reserve development in the western extension is making good progress. On the first raise line, two reef raises have holed with the
balance between three and twelve levels expected to be holed by the end of the financial year. Ground conditions are generally very
good and the predominant reef is the higher grade P2 sub-facies.

The deepening project continues with the conveyor decline halfway between 17 and 18 levels. Lateral development has started on
17 level while stoping is in progress on 16 level.

Booysendal North UG2 and Merensky mine
Booysendal achieved 4 million fatality free shifts on 31 October 2018 and during the six month period under review only two lost time
injuries were recorded. The lost time injury incidence rate was 0.10 per 200 000 hours worked. (H1 F2018: 0.31), a commendable
67.7% improvement.

The square metres mined for both Merensky and UG2 production increased by 42.3% and 7.3% respectively. At the Merensky North
mine a third crew was employed to increase stoping production.

An increased focus on stoping width control had a positive impact on head grade.

During the period under review metal in concentrate produced from own operations and ore stockpiles increased by 8.9% to
105 285 4E oz (H1 F2018: 96 650 4E oz). Metal in concentrate purchased from third parties increased from 2 272 4E oz to 3 576 4E
oz during the period under review.

Production of chrome concentrate increased by 33.9% to 193 360 tonnes mainly due to the contribution from the South Tailings Storage
Facility (TSF) Retreatment project as well as the improved yields at the North mine.

The cash cost per platinum ounce in concentrate produced increased by 1.9% to R16 772 Pt/oz (H1 F2018: R16 459 Pt/oz).

Booysendal South
Construction of Booysendal South's central mining complex and ancillary infrastructure is well advanced and on track to reach steady
state in F2022.

Key project milestones during the reporting period include:

-       Commissioning of the aerial rope conveyor and the first ore transported from the central complex to the South concentrator
        stockpile.
-       Re-commissioning the PGM circuit of the South concentrator and ramping up the rate of tailings re-treatment from the south
        TSF to produce chrome concentrate and PGMs.
-       Ongoing development of the BS1 and BS2 mining modules which are currently producing 20 000 tonnes per month of
        UG2 ore.
-       Re-establishment of underground access to the BS4 module for future tailings deposition.

Eland
At Eland the re-commissioning of the concentrator is well advanced. Mining of the tailings dam is expected to start in March 2019 along
with the recovery of chrome. Recovery of PGMs is expected to start in May 2019. Trial mining at the Kukama shaft to test stoping and
ore transport methodologies is expected to start before the end of the financial year. In addition, we are pursuing other opportunities
including the treatment of third party ore.

US recycling assets
The US recycling assets are still on care and maintenance. However during the period under review small batches of salvaged catalytic
convertors were sourced from third parties and processed on a trial basis. The PGM bearing material arising from these recycled
convertors will be processed at the Zondereinde metallurgical operations. Once this trial process has been bedded down, options to
re-establish the recycling operations will be considered, taking into account the working capital requirements and capital allocation for
the group.

Normalised headline earnings
Normalised headline earnings increased by 192.6% to R553.3 million (H1 F2018: R189.1 million), which equates to a normalised
earnings per share of 108.5 cents (H1 F2018: 37.1 cents) based on the total number of 509 781 212 issued shares.

Normalised headline earnings, our main measure of performance have been calculated taking into account the headline loss per share
adjusted for non-cash items relating to the 2015 black economic empowerment (BEE) transaction. These include the preference share
dividends associated with the BEE financing structure.

Revenue
Sales revenue increased by 48.6% from R3.4 billion in H1 F2018 to R5.0 billion in the period under review. The increase is attributable
to a combination of a 40.5% increase in the volumes of 4E oz sold, an increase of 4.2% in the basket price to USD1 013 per 4E oz and
a 5.7% weaker ZAR/USD exchange rate realised. The average US dollar sales price achieved improved on all metals, except platinum
and gold which averaged USD820/oz (H1 F2018 USD937/oz) and USD1 222/oz (H1 F2018 USD1 280/oz) respectively. The price of
palladium increased by 13.0%, and the price of rhodium was 95.7% higher.

Base metal prices were generally lower with the exception of nickel which was 4.0% higher. The average copper price achieved
decreased by 12.2%. The price of chrome in US dollar terms decreased by 37.1% and in South African rand terms decreased by
32.6%, which negatively impacted the rand value of chrome sales from R368.2 million in H1 F2018 to R293.8 million in the current
period under review.

Overall total revenue per platinum ounce sold increased by 3.8% from R26 516/Pt oz to R27 524/Pt oz. Due to the festive season, not
all available refined metal was sold at the period end.

Adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The group's base metal and chrome sale agreements contain terms which allow for price adjustments based on the market price at the
end of a relevant quotational period stipulated in the contract, referred to as provisionally priced sales agreements.

There was no impact on the net profit or loss arising from the adoption of IFRS 15, with the only impact being presentation and
disclosure requirements for provisionally priced sales agreements.

Cost of sales and operating margin
Cost of sales increased by 31.1%, in comparison with the 48.6% increase in revenue which resulted in operating profit increasing
from R338.8 million in H1 F2018 to R1.0 billion in the period under review, an all-time record for the group for an interim period.
This translates to an operating margin of 20.7% (H1 2017: 10.1%).

Movements of the individual elements making up cost of sales are discussed below:

-      Mining costs increased by 9.4%, which is attributable to the increase in labour costs together with an increase in total square
       metres mined.
-      Concentrating costs increased by 20.2% with the start-up of the concentrator at Booysendal South which resulted in additional
       working cost of R55.0 million spent during the period under review.
-      Smelter and base metal removal plant costs increased significantly owing to additional power consumed as a result of the
       second furnace, and reflecting the 41.1% increase in refined metal produced.
-      Higher chrome processing costs are associated with the growth in the group's chrome output, which was 18.4% higher.
       The bulk of the higher production emanates from the chrome circuit at the Booysendal South TSF.
-      Included in sales and administration overheads are costs incurred relating to the corporate office and group services as well as
       all marketing costs incurred by the group.
-      Royalty charges are based on a number of inputs, including the ratio between revenues generated from own operations and
       custom material, EBITDA and capital expenditure incurred. Zondereinde and Booysendal paid royalties at the minimum royalty
       rate of 0.5% based on revenue from own operations due to the significant amounts of capital expenditure incurred during the
       period under review. The royalty charge increased in line with the increase in revenue.
-      Share-based payment expenses and profit share scheme costs relate to expenses incurred in respect of the group's share plan
       and contributions made to the Toro Employee Empowerment Trust. The main inputs in calculating the share-based payment
       liability is the number of outstanding performance, retention and LIM shares as well as the share price at the reporting date.
       The Toro Employee Empowerment Trust is an employee profit share scheme for Zondereinde employees based on 4% of after
       tax profit contributions from Zondereinde.
-      Concentrates purchased decreased by 78.1%, owing to a contract with a third party concentrate supplier expiring at the end of
       June 2018. Ounces from external parties decreased by 73.3% to 7 962 4E oz (H1 F2018: 29 770 4E oz).
-      Refining including sampling and handling charges increased by 27.1%, even though the total refined metal production increased
       by 35.7%, this is because of a change in the nickel sales agreement. Going forward the nickel refining charges will be offset
       against sales revenue and not charged separately as done previously.
-      Depreciation is based on the unit of production depreciation method. With the increased production and additional capital
       expenditure incurred by the group, depreciation increased.
-      The commencement of destocking was offset by the increase in the cost of production which is reflected in the change in metal
       inventories.

In the current price environment, our main focus is on cost control, and growing our production base, thereby creating long-term value
for our stakeholders.

Taxation
During the period under review, the group paid tax on non-mining income which comprises mainly interest and sundry income earned.
During the period, tax receivable balances and interest to the value of R4.3 million was received from the South African Revenue
Services.

Higher capital expenditure results in increased deferred tax. The balance of unredeemed capital available for utilisation against future
taxable mining profits for Northam Platinum Limited (Zondereinde) approximates R885.2 million and for Booysendal Platinum
Proprietary Limited approximates R6.9 billion.

Capital expenditure
During the period under review the group incurred R1.5 billion in the execution of its growth strategy. Projects are generally ahead of
schedule. The following significant amounts were spent on expansionary capex:

-      R877.3 million was spent on the development of Booysendal South. In total, R2.8 billion has now been spent on the project
       and an amount of R36.0 million was prepaid for the construction of the North aerial rope conveyor system. During December
       2018, commissioning of the South rope conveyor commenced, with the first ore being transported to the stacker pad at South
       mine. The crusher feed conveyor and crusher are scheduled for completion by the end of February 2019. A surface stockpile
       in excess of 120 000 tonnes has accumulated. Capital development at the Central mine is progressing well with 1 133 metres
       being achieved against a plan of 1 121 metres at the end of December 2018. The Booysendal South mine should sustain
       annual production up to 300 000 oz of refined 4E oz for more than 25 years. Given Booysendal's favourable cost profile, this
       will enable the group to grow down the cost curve.
-      It is important that value is extracted from the massive Booysendal resource through various growth initiatives. Both the UG2
       North deepening project and the development of the Booysendal Merensky North mine will add substantial additional capacity
       from the original nameplate capacity of 160 000 oz. The development of the capital footprint relating to the Merensky North
       mine is nearing completion, with R11.4 million spent (H1 F2018: R75.0 million). Construction relating to the installation of strike
       3 belt, the construction of dip belt 2, dirty water dam 1 and the underground sub-station is planned to be completed by
       June 2019.
-      The Booysendal UG2 deepening project is also nearing completion with R26.5 million spent (H1 F2018: R48.6 million) and the
       construction of reef dam 1 and strike belts nine North and South is scheduled for completion in June and August 2019
       respectively. On completion, two half levels will be added to the two already operational namely eight North and eight South.
-      An amount of R48.7 million (H1 F2018: R73.6 million) was also spent on the South TSF Retreatment project.
-      The Zondereinde western extension project is advancing well. Two of the ten planned raise lines in the 11 line holed. The
       remainder of the raise lines will hole during the next six months. Six of the levels are busy with the development of crosscuts
       on the 10 line, which is the second stoping line. During the period R69.6 million was spent.
-      The Merensky reef relating to the current mine (excluding the western extension) has been largely depleted on the upper levels
       of the mine and future production will come from the deepening project extending from 13 level to 18 level. Development of the
       decline system has progressed beyond the 17 level while stoping commenced on 16 level. The belt decline is currently being
       developed to 18 level. For the period under review R52.9 million has been spent and the project remains on schedule for
       completion by 2020.
-      During the reporting period R50.1 million was spent on the concentrator storage and dewatering optimisation project at the
       Zondereinde metallurgical facility. The project entails the installation of three solid bowl decanter units and ancillary equipment
       to replace the current concentrate thickeners and the Delkor vacuum belt filter at the smelter. The project will allow a once-off
       reduction in stock at the concentrator and will result in increased dryer capacity, flexibility, efficiency and decoupling of the
       concentrator and smelter.

In addition, R25.3 million (H1 F2018: R93.7 million) and R36.6 million (H1 F2018: R25.2 million) was spent on sustaining capital
expenditure at Zondereinde and Booysendal respectively.

Capital expenditure for the current financial year is forecasted to amount to R550.0 million for Zondereinde, R1.5 billion for Booysendal
and R300.0 million for Eland, which include amounts spent to date.

Working capital
The working capital lock up is mainly as a result of the high inventory levels. During the reporting period ore stockpile inventory
increased due to the mill capacity being limited at Zondereinde. Management is currently looking at various options to monetise the
value of the UG2 stockpile.

As previously reported, significant surplus concentrate was built up at Zondereinde in anticipation of commissioning the second furnace.
The concentrate stockpile was processed and the working capital lock-up was released during the period under review, with all other
inventory moving on in the pipeline.

There are still large amounts of reverts which require reprocessing. Reverts are an intermediate high value product that require a
significant degree of material handling effort.

The normal pipeline inventory is considered to be between 80 000 and 90 000 4E oz of metal at any given time. All inventory over and
above pipeline material (140 000 oz) is considered excess inventory.

The value of excess inventory at the period end amounted to R1.9 billion at cost, with a potential sales value in excess of R2.3 billion,
using the sales prices and exchange rate at 31 December 2018, only taking into account 4E oz.


Cash flow and net debt
The group's net debt position has been calculated as follows:

During the period under review cash to the value of R1.3 billion was generated from operating activities (H1 F2018: utilisation of
R562.7 million). R1.5 billion of capital expenditure was paid for in cash, R650.0 million was drawn down on the revolving credit facility
and R150.3 million was paid relating to interest on the domestic medium term notes and the revolving credit facility, resulting in an
increase in cash and cash equivalents of R346.5 million, to R639.7 million.

The group's net debt position is expected to be alleviated with the processing of the excess inventory, whilst taking into account the
forecast capital expenditure of the group.

The group's future cash generation is vulnerable to exchange rate volatility and metal price fluctuations. It is the policy of the group not
to hedge currency or metal. Should changes be required to this policy, these will be timeously communicated to the market.

During the next six months, domestic medium term notes to the value of R1.25 billion become repayable. The payments are scheduled
as follows: R450.0 million in April 2019, R550.0 million in May 2019 and R250.0 million in June 2019. The group intends to refinance
the domestic medium term notes and to continuously review and optimise the quantum of its available debt facilities in view of the
group's increasing production profile and the impact thereof on working capital requirements and exposure to metal price fluctuations.

Booysendal is on track to achieve steady state production in F2022. Northam intends to direct surplus free cash flow associated with
this production increase and completion of the capital expenditure programme to shareholders by way of an ordinary share repurchase
programme, the purchase of Zambezi preference shares or a combination of both, dependent on the respective pricing of these
instruments.

Key accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
The preparation of the condensed reviewed interim financial results requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the reporting date.

However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future.

These estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Information relating to the individual estimates, assumptions and judgements made by management have been included in the notes
to the condensed reviewed interim financial results.

Market review
The average platinum price realised during the reporting period was USD820/oz, 12.5% lower than the USD937/oz achieved in the
previous corresponding period. This lacklustre performance is attributable to declining demand from light duty diesel vehicles,
particularly in Western Europe following the 'dieselgate' scandal and lower Chinese jewellery demand.

Platinum demand in the autocatalyst sector is expected to increase as tighter emissions legislation is introduced in China and India.
Real driving emissions legislation (RDE) will become more onerous for original equipment manufacturers as emissions limits will need
to be maintained over the lifecycle of a vehicle and is likely to lead to increased loadings per vehicle. Industrial demand is also expected
to grow in the petrochemicals sector and as support for fuel cell development increases.

On the supply side, underinvestment in the South African industry over the past decade and rationalisation of the industry going forward
is likely to lead to lower production.

The deficit in the palladium market continued during the reporting period resulting in the average price received gaining 13.0% to
USD1 071/oz (H1 2018: USD948/oz).

Autocatalyst demand for palladium is expected to increase, particularly in China with the introduction of China VI legislation, and in
Western Europe loadings in gasoline vehicles are expected to increase significantly owing to the strict application of RDE standards.

The palladium market remains in meaningful deficit estimated at 1 million oz due to the increasing demand for autocatalysts. It is fair
to conclude that at some point in the future, platinum will substitute palladium.

The price received for rhodium averaged USD2 427/oz during the period under review, an increase of 95.7% from the previous
corresponding period (H1 2018: USD1 240/oz).

The increased deficit expected in rhodium will continue as supplies contract and demand in the autocatalyst sector follows a similar
trajectory as palladium with the exception that in the case of rhodium, there is no real substitute.

The ruthenium price increased by 226.9% during the period under review to USD255/oz (H1 2018: USD78/oz).

The increased demand for ruthenium in specifically the chemical and communication sectors will add to the substantial deficit envisaged
for this metal in the near future.

The iridium price received increased 49.8% to USD1 432/oz (H1 2018: USD956/oz).

The processing of ballast water in the shipping industry accounts for large increase in the demand for iridium, creating a deficit in a
relatively small market.

Mineral resources and reserves
The mineral resources and mineral reserves statements comply with the provisions of the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves of 2016.

Mineral resources and reserves for the wholly owned Northam assets have been prepared under the guidance of the group's
competent persons who have reviewed and approved the information contained in this document, as it relates to
mineral resources and mineral reserves. Contact details for Northam's competent persons are available in the Northam
Platinum Limited annual integrated report for the year ended 30 June 2018, which is available on the group's website

Changes to the board of directors
During the period under review the following changes to the board occurred:

Mr MH Jonas and Mr JJ Nel were appointed as independent non-executive directors, with effect from 6 November 2018.

Ms AH Coetzee was appointed as the chief financial officer and an executive director, with effect from 15 November 2018. Ms Coetzee
replaced Mr AZ Khumalo following his resignation effective 1 November 2018.

Corporate governance
The group has adopted the King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa, 2016 (King IV). The board and board
sub-committee charters, code of ethics and various internal policies and procedures are in place to both regulate and guide the group's
conduct as a responsible corporate citizen. Northam's application and explanation of the King IV principles is available on the Northam
website at http://www.northam.co.za/downloads/send/92-2017/1162-king-iv.

Going concern
Mining operations have a finite life and are dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as well as economic factors such
as commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and low US dollar metal prices are a concern as the group is
an exporter of PGMs to global markets. Operations continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs and low metal prices.

The group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, to maximise the return to stakeholders
through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to ensure that all externally imposed capital requirements are complied
with. The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in these condensed reviewed interim
results, issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

The condensed reviewed interim results have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates. The board of directors believes that the group will continue to have adequate financial resources
and access to capital to continue operating for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the condensed reviewed interim results have
been prepared on a going concern basis.

Dividends
The company's dividend policy is to consider an interim and final dividend for each reporting period. At its discretion, the board of
directors (board) may consider a special dividend, where appropriate. Depending on the perceived need to retain funds for expansion
or operating purposes, the board may pass a resolution for the payment of a dividend.

The quantum of any dividend would ultimately be subject to expected future market and capital commitments at the time of consideration
by the board.

Given the continuing difficult conditions in the platinum mining industry, and taking into consideration the cash requirements to fund
the development of the group's project pipeline and growth strategy, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend
(H1 F2018: R Nil per share).

Outlook and key factors impacting future financial results
The following key factors will impact future financial results:

-      Management of production and performance targets to ensure the successful execution of our business strategy -
       Management sets realistic strategic targets for the business. The success of the strategy will affect shareholders and
       stakeholders alike.
-      Continuing to improve the safety performance and health and wellness of our workforce - The group strives to improve
       the safety performance and health and wellness of all employees. By continuously seeking to reduce injuries, applying
       appropriate technologies, communication and training and reinforcing operational standards and responsibilities we seek to
       improve the safety performance and health and wellness of our workforce.
-      Effective project execution - The group has a large capital expansion programme in place to secure its future through the
       creation of long-life, low-cost operations. Successful project execution is key to creating a sustainable business for the long-
       term benefit of all our stakeholders.
-      Effective cost control - The platinum sector remains under pressure from low metal prices and hence cost containment is
       key to the group's sustainability. We continue to strive to maintain our relative position in the lower half of the industry cost
       curve.

The global economic outlook remains uncertain resulting in volatile metal markets and exchange rates. The group's financial
performance will depend on achieving higher metal sales prices and a stable operating performance. Management is confident that the
group's strong financial position, prudent financial controls and the development of shallow, mechanisable operations at Booysendal
and Eland will place the group in a position to take advantage of improved market conditions going forward.

Cost control will continue to remain a key focus area and management is confident that through various initiatives and increasing the
production base that the unit cost will be well contained going forward.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they are satisfied, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the financial
results for the current reporting period will differ by at least 20% from the financial results of the previous
corresponding period.

Improvement in normalised headline earnings

The group expects normalised headline earnings, defined as the group's headline earnings adjusted for
the impact of Northam's black economic empowerment transaction, which constitutes the group's main
measure of performance, to be in excess of R550.0 million (H1 F2018: R189.1 million), representing an
increase in excess of 190%.

Improvement in loss and headline loss per share

Shareholders are advised that the loss per share for the six months ended 31 December 2018 is expected
to be between 17.8 cents and 18.6 cents per share and headline loss per share is expected to be between
18.6 cents and 19.4 cents per share, compared with the loss per share of 81.1 cents and headline loss per
share of 80.0 cents reported in the comparative prior period (""H1 F2018""). The aforementioned ranges
expressed in percentage terms, are, in respect of the loss per share, a decrease of between 77% and 78%
and, in respect of the headline loss per share, a decrease of between 76% and 77%.

The anticipated loss and headline loss per share is attributable to Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited's non-
cash preference share dividends, which are consolidated into Northam's results in terms of International
Financial Reporting Standards.

The number of shares in issue remains unchanged at 509 781 212 (H1 F2018: 509 781 212), which the
group uses to determine the normalised headline earnings per share. The weighted average number of
shares in issue for the period ended 31 December 2018 also remains unchanged at 349 875 759 (H1 F2018:
349 875 759 shares), which the group uses to calculate the loss and headline loss per share.

The expected improvement in earnings is primarily driven by a 40.5% increase in 4E metal sales volumes,
which is underpinned by Northam's growth and diversification strategy. The US Dollar basket price
improved by 4.2% to USD1 013 per 4E oz (H1 F2018: USD972 per 4E oz) and the average ZAR/USD
exchange rate weakened 5.7% to ZAR14.19/USD (H1 F2018: ZAR13.43/USD).

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam's auditors. The condensed reviewed interim results for the period ended 31 December 2018 are
expected to be published on or about 22 February 2019.

OPERATIONAL UPDATE

Record operating profit

Northam is pleased to announce that it expects to report a record operating profit for an interim period
amounting to R1.0 billion for the six month ended 31 December 2018, representing an increase of 204.3%
from the comparative prior period (H1 F2018: R338.8 million). Earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is expected to increase to R1.1 billion for the interim period (H1
F2018: R532.8 million), representing an EBITDA margin of 22.6%.

This strong financial performance is underpinned by Northam's growth and diversification strategy, which
is on track and well advanced. Project execution risk is reducing rapidly.

Revenue increased by 48.6% to approximately R5.0 billion (H1 F2018: R3.4 billion) primarily driven by a
40.5% increase in 4E oz sales volumes to 294 823 4E oz (H1 F2018: 209 861 4E oz). The average US Dollar
basket price improved by 4.2% to USD1 013 per 4E oz (H1 F2018: USD972 per 4E oz) and the average
ZAR/USD exchange rate weakened 5.7% to ZAR14.19/USD (H1 F2018: ZAR13.43/USD). On a per unit basis,
total revenue per platinum oz sold is expected to increase by 3.8% to R27 524 (H1 F2018: R26 516).

Northam's unit cash costs per platinum oz increased by 5.5% to approximately R22 007 (H1 F2018: R20
851).

Destocking of excess inventory continues

Total refined metal production increased by 41.1% oz to 299 323 4E oz (H1 F2018: 212 133 4E oz). This
increase includes a net destocking of 30 000 4E oz of excess inventory accumulated prior to commissioning
the second furnace.

The remaining excess inventory as at 31 December 2018 amounted to 140 000 4E oz, with a value of
R1.9 billion at cost and an estimated sales value at period end of approximately R2.3 billion (only taking
into account 4E ounces). Destocking is expected to continue for the remainder of the 2019 financial year.

Solid operational performance

The group produced 256 461 oz of equivalent refined 4E oz from own operations (H1 F2018: 246 473 4E
oz), representing an increase of 4.1%. This follows a strong operational performance at both Zondereinde
mine and Booysendal mine.
Zondereinde mine's equivalent refined metal from own operations increased to 154 078 4E oz (H1 F2018:
152 487 4E oz). Metal in concentrate produced at Booysendal mine increased to 105 285 4E oz (H1 F2018:
96 650 4E oz), representing an increase of 8.9%. This is a very pleasing outcome given that the mine
transitioned to owner-operator in 2018.

Growth and diversification strategy on track

The group invested R1.5 billion in capital expenditure during the six months ended 31 December 2018 (H1
F2018: R2.6 billion), of which R877.3 million was spent on the continued development of the Booysendal
South mine. At period end, a total of R2.8 billion has been invested into the development of the
Booysendal South mine which is well advanced, ahead of schedule and within budget.

The Booysendal South rope conveyor was commissioned in December 2018 with the first ore being
transported to the receiving pad at the Booysendal South concentrator. The Booysendal South mine is
designed to sustain annual production of up to 300 000 4E refined oz for more than 25 years, increasing
the total production for the greater Booysendal complex to approximately 500 000 4E oz. Expansion of
the group's smelting capacity (the second furnace) was well timed and is more than sufficient to handle
the projected mine volume increase from Booysendal. Northam continues to grow down the industry cost
curve as Booysendal's low cost production volume increases.

Capital expenditure during the interim period was funded by operational cash flows and available debt
facilities, with net debt at approximately R2.9 billion as at 31 December 2018. However, the sales value
of excess 4E inventory at 31 December 2018 is estimated to amount to approximately R2.3 billion.

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam's auditors. The condensed reviewed interim results for the period ended 31 December 2018 are
expected to be published on or about 22 February 2019.

APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER


In compliance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, Northam shareholders are
advised of the appointment of Ms Aletta Helena (Alet) Coetzee as successor to Mr Ayanda Khumalo,
current Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Northam, with effect from 15 November 2018. This follows a
decision by Mr Khumalo to step down, effective 1 November 2018. He will be taking time off before
embarking on the next phase of his career. Ms Coetzee has been part of Northam’s senior management
team since joining the group in December 2015.

The appointment of Ms Coetzee arises from a comprehensive process followed by the board of directors
(“board”) to find a suitable replacement for Mr Khumalo.

Ms Coetzee is a Chartered Accountant (South Africa) and former associate director at Ernst & Young Inc.
(“EY”), Northam’s external auditor. Ms Coetzee worked at EY for almost 14 years and has been involved
with the group since June 2007 when she first joined the external audit team.

The board has full confidence in Ms Coetzee’s ability to seamlessly take over from Mr Khumalo and is
pleased to have found a highly qualified and experienced replacement.

The members of the board would like to express their grateful appreciation to Mr Khumalo for his service
to the company and especially for pro-actively ensuring a smooth transition. They wish him well in his
future endeavours and welcome Ms Coetzee as CFO.

NOTES TO THE SUMMARISED FINANCIAL RESULTS

1. Accounting policies and the basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the financial instruments to the extent required or permitted
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as set out in the relevant accounting policies detailed in North am's Annual
Integrated Report, which includes the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2018. These financial statements incorporate the
accounting policies which are in terms of IFRS and have been applied on a basis consistent with the previous year, with the exception of the
policies adopted during the period as more fully set out below.

The summarised financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition
requirements of IFRS, its interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, presentation and
disclosures as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and the requirements of the Companies
Act No. 71 of 2008 (Companies Act) including the adoption of the following standards, amendments or interpretations with effect from
1 July 2017:

- IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative - Amendments to IAS 7

- IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses - Amendments to IAS 12

- Annual Improvements Project (AIP) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities - Clarification of the scope of the disclosure
  requirements in IFRS 12

The adoption of these standards, amendments or interpretation resulted in changes only in additional disclosures in the annual financial
statements. They did not impact any amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or
consolidated statement of financial position.

The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to standards are not effective and have not been early adopted, but will be adopted
once these new standards, interpretations and amendments become effective:

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)'s replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement. The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge
accounting of financial instruments.

The new standard contains substantial changes from the current financial instruments standard (IAS 39) with regards to the classification,
measurement, impairment and hedge accounting requirements. These changes include:

- Classification and measurement: The new classification requirements are based on both the entity's business model for managing the
  financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset. The more principle based approach of IFRS 9 requires
  the careful use of judgment in its application.

- Impairment: The IASB has sought to address a key concern that arose as a result of the financial crisis, that the incurred loss model in
  IAS 39 contributed to the delayed recognition of credit losses. As such, it has introduced a forward-looking expected credit loss model.

- Hedge accounting: The aim of the new hedge accounting model is to provide useful information about risk management activities that an
  entity undertakes using financial instruments, with the effect that financial reporting will reflect more accurately how an entity manages its
  risk and the extent to which hedging mitigates those risks.

IFRS 9 establishes a new model for recognition and measurement of impairments in loans and receivables that are measured at amortised cost
or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), the so-called expected credit loss model. This is the only impairment model that
applies in IFRS 9 because all other assets are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) or, in the case of qualifying
equity investments, FVOCI with no recycling to profit or loss.

Expected credit losses are calculated by: identifying scenarios in which a loan or receivable defaults; estimating the cash shortfall that would be
incurred in each scenario if a default were to happen; multiplying that loss by the probability of the default happening; and summing the results
of all such possible default events. Because every loan and receivable has at least some probability of defaulting in the future, every loan or
receivable has an expected credit loss associated with it from the moment of its origination or acquisition.

IFRS 9 does not require an entity to restate prior periods. Restatement is permitted, if and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight and
the restated financial statements reflect all of the requirements of IFRS 9. If the entity does not restate prior periods, an y difference between
previous carrying amounts and those determined under IFRS 9 at the date of initial application should be included in the current year opening
retained earnings (or other equivalent component of equity). IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with
early adoption permitted.

IFRS 9 will be adopted on the required effective date and comparatives will not be restated. An impact assessment has been performed on the
aspects of IFRS 9. The assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable
and supporting information being made available during the F2019 financial year when IFRS 9 will be adopted. Below is a brief summary of the
expected impact that IFRS 9 will have on the statement of financial position:

Classification and measurement

Northam does not expect a significant impact on its statement of financial position or equity on applying the classification and measurement
requirements of IFRS 9.

Loans as well as trade receivables, excluding receivables with provisional pricing arrangements, are held to collect contractual cash flows and
are expected to give rise to cash flows representing payments of principal and interest. The contractual cash flow characteristics of these
instruments were analysed and it was concluded that they meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement under IFRS 9. Therefore,
reclassification for these instruments will not be required.

Impairment

IFRS 9 requires an entity to record expected credit losses on all of its loans and trade receivables. The group will apply the simplified approach
and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables, excluding receivables with provisional pricing arrangements. There are no expected
impairment losses that will arise due to the short-term nature of the group`s trade receivables cycle and history of recovery.

There could however be expected impairment losses that arises from long-term receivables and loans to employees that comprise balances due
in respect of Northam's home ownership scheme. The group will apply the general approach on these balances. The general approach involves
determining whether the credit risk of a loan or receivable has increased significantly relative to the credit risk at the date of initial recognition.

Hedge accounting

The group currently does not apply hedge accounting and these changes are therefore not expected to impact the group.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The IASB has published IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IFRS 15 outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle is that an entity
recognises revenue based on a five-step model to reflect the transfer to goods or services, measured at the amount to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted. Entities can choose to apply
the standard fully retrospectively or use a modified retrospecitve approach in the year of application. Northam plans to adopt the new standard
on the required effective date using the full retrospective method making use of som e of the practical expedients.

An assessment was performed with regards to the impact which IFRS 15 will have on the results of the group. The key issues identified, are set
out below. These are based on the current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be subject to changes as interpretations evolve. Furthermore, the
group is considering and will continue to monitor any further developments.

Contract terms for the group's sale of base metals allow for a price adjustment based on final assay results to determine the final metal content.
These are referred to as provisional pricing arrangements, and are such that the selling price is based on prevailing spot prices on a specified
future date after shipment to the customer (the quotational period (QP)). Adjustments to the sales price occur based on movements in quoted
market prices up to the date of final settlement. The period between provisional invoicing and final settlement can be between one to four months.

Under IAS 18, sales contracts that have provisional pricing features are considered to contain an embedded derivative, which is required to be
separated from the contract for accounting purposes. The contract is the sale of base metals and the embedded derivative is the forward contract
for which the provisional sale is subsequently adjusted. Recognition of sales revenue for these commodities is based on the most recently
determined estimate of metal in concentrate (based on initial assay results) and the spot price at the date of shipment. The embedded derivative
is initially recognised at fair value, with subsequent changes in the fair value recognised in profit or loss each period until final settlement, and
presented as part of revenue.

Revenue is recognised at the estimated fair value of the total consideration received or receivable when the concentrate is delivered, which is
either when it passes to the buyers trucks or delivered to the customers premises.

The initial estimate of the fair value of the embedded derivative and subsequent changes in fair value over, and to the end of, the QP, are also
estimated by reference to forward market prices. The subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of revenue. Any subsequent changes arising due to differences
between the initial and final assay results are not considered part of the embedded derivative and are adjusted against revenue.

IFRS 15 states that if a contract is partially within scope of this standard and partially in the scope of another standard, an entity will first apply
the separation and measurement requirements of the other standard(s). Therefore, to the extent that provisional pricing features are considered
to be in the scope of another standard, they will be outside the scope of IFRS 15 and entities will be required to account for these in accordance
with IFRS 9. Any subsequent changes that arise due to differences between initial and final assay will still be considered within the scope of
IFRS 15 and since it constitutes variable consideration, it will be subject to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration.

Revenue in respect of the contract will be recognised when control passes to the customer (which has been determined to be the same point in
time) and will be measured at the amount the entity expects to be entitled - being the estimate of the price expected to be received at the end
of the QP, i.e., using the most recently determined estimate of the metal content (based on initial assay results) and the estimated forward price
(which is consistent with current practice).

When considering the initial assay estimate, the group has considered the requirements of IFRS 15 in relation to the constraint on estimates of
variable consideration. It will only include amounts in the calculation of revenue where it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will
not occur when the uncertainty relating to final assay/quality is subsequently resolved, i.e., at the end of the QP.

As disclosed above, the assay differences are not usually material, hence, no change is expected when compared to the current approach.
Consequently, at the time the concentrate passes the buyer's trucks or delivered to the buyer, the group will recognise a receivable because
from that time it considers it has an unconditional right to consideration. This receivable will then be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9.

The embedded derivative will no longer be separated from the contract, i.e., the concentrate receivable. This is because the existence of the
provisional pricing features will mean the concentrate receivable will fail to meet the requirements to be measured at amortised cost. Instead,
the entire receivable will be measured at fair value, with subsequent movements being recognised in profit or loss. The requirement to measure
the entire receivable at fair value is different from current practice in that the current embedded derivative represents changes in the commodity
price, whereas under IFRS 9 the fair value of the receivable will include the impact of changes in the commodity price, interest rate risk and
credit risk. Given the nature of the group's provisionally priced sales in that they are no more than four months long and are with customers who
have a strong credit rating, the group does not expect this change to have a material impact.

With respect to the presentation of amounts arising from such provisionally priced contracts, IFRS 15 requires ""revenue from contracts with
customers"" to be disclosed separately from other types of revenue. This means that revenue recognised from the initial sale must be separately
disclosed in the financial statements from any subsequent movements in the fair value of the related receivable.

This requirement will have an impact on disclosure as the group currently recognises fair value movements in revenue. However, the quantum
of the fair value movement may be different as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9. Consistent with current practice, any subsequent changes that
arise due to differences between initial and final assay related to volume/quantity and quality will be recognised as an adjustment to revenue
from contracts with customers.

In addition to the presentation and disclosure requirements for provisionally priced sales discussed above, IFRS 15 contains other presentation
and disclosure requirements which are more detailed than the current IFRS. The presentation requirements represent a significant change from
current practice and will increase the volume of disclosures required in the group's financial statements. Many of the disclosure requirements in
IFRS 15 are new.

IFRS 16 Leases

The new standard provides a comprehensive model to identify lease-arrangements and the treatment thereof in the financial statements of both
lessees and lessors.

IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilitie s with corresponding right-of-use assets. Lessees
will apply a single model for most leases (with certain exemptions). Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern will change as interest and
depreciation expenses are recognised separately in profit or loss (similar to current finance lease accounting). However, lessees can make
accounting policy elections to apply accounting similar to operating lease accounting under IAS 17 Leases to short-term leases and leases of
low-value assets.

Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from the current lease statement. As with IAS 17, IFRS 16 requires lessors to classify their leases
into two types: finance leases and operating leases. Lease classification determines how and when a lessor recognises lease revenue and what
assets a lessor records.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted provided that the new revenue
standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been, or is, applied at the same date as IFRS 16. Lessees must apply IFRS 16
using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The group has limited lease arrangements and the impact is therefore expected to be minimal, but is still in the process of being assessed.

IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an Interpretation on how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on
foreign currency transactions, IAS 21. The Interpretation applies where an entity either pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign
currency-denominated contracts. The date of the transaction determines the exchange rate to be used on initial recognition of the related asset,
expense or income. The issue arises because IAS 21 requires an entity to use the exchange rate at the 'date of the transaction', which is defined
as the date when the transaction first qualifies for recognition. The 'date of the transaction' for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to
use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary
asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in
advance, the entity should determine a date of transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.

The Interpretation provides guidance for when a single payment/receipt is made, as well as for situations where multiple payments/receipts are
made. The guidance aims to reduce diversity in practice.

The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

The group already follows the principles included in IFRIC 22, relating to non-current prepayments made and therefore believes that the impact
will be minimal.

Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment

The IASB has issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in relation to the classification and measurement of share-based payment
transactions. The amendments are intended to eliminate diversity in practice in three main areas. The effects of vesting conditions on the
measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction. The classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement
features for withholding tax obligations. The accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction
changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.

The amendments to IFRS 2 are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but earlier application is permitted provided
it is disclosed. On adoption, prior periods will not be restated.

The amendment is believed to have a minimal impact on the results of the group as the clarifications is consistent with current practices applied
by the group.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment

The IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (the Interpretation). The Interpretation clarifies application of
recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation
specifically addresses the following: whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately, the assumptions an entity makes about the
examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities, how an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused
tax credits and tax rates and how an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances.

The interpretation is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

This interpretation is not considered to have a material impact on the group results, but is still being assessed.

Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing costs

The amendments clarify that an entity treats, as part of general borrowings, any borrowing originally made to develop a qualifying asset when
substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.

An entity applies those amendments to borrowing costs incurred on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first
applies those amendments.

An entity applies those amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Earlier application is permitted.

This amendment will be taken into account when determining general borrowing costs which can be capitalised to qualifying assets, in
accordance with the transitional provisions.

Conceptual Framework

The IASB has revised its Conceptual Framework. The primary purpose of the Framework is to assist the IASB (and the Interpretations Committee)
by identifying concepts that it will use when setting standards. Key changes include:

- increasing the prominence of stewardship in the objective of financial reporting, which is to provide information that is useful in making
  resource allocation decisions

- reinstating prudence, defined as the exercise of caution when making judgments under conditions of uncertainty, as a component of
  neutrality

- defining a reporting entity, which might be a legal entity or a portion of a legal entity

- revising the definition of an asset as a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events

- revising the definition of a liability as a present obligation of the entity to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events

- removing the probability threshold for recognition, and adding guidance on derecognition

- adding guidance on the information provided by different measurement bases, and explaining factors to consider when selecting a
  measurement basis

- stating that profit or loss is the primary performance indicator and that, in principle, income and expenses in other comprehensive income
  should be recycled where the relevance or faithful representation of the financial statements would be enhanced.

The Board and Interpretations Committee will immediately begin using the revised Framework, and the group will consider it when needed in
terms of the IAS 8 hierarchy dealing with selecting accounting policies not covered by an IFRS standard.

The Conceptual Framework is effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 2020.

2. Related parties

The group enters into various sales, purchases, financing and lease transactions in the ordinary course of business with a large number of
entities, some of whom are related parties.

3. Events after the reporting period

There have been no other events subsequent to the year-end which require additional disclosure or adjustment to these summarised
financial results, other than what has been disclosed in the financial results.

INTRODUCTION

Northam's equivalent refined metal production from its own operations rose 4.5% to 571 843oz 6E (F2017: 546 984oz) for the year.
This reflects a commendable operational performance at Zondereinde mine where production volume was up 7.0% year on year.
Booysendal's output was affected by a work stoppage associated with the change-over from contract mining to an owner operator-
model in May 2018.

During the year, the group paid R1.0 billion for the Tumela Block (now called the Western extension) and R175.0 million for Eland
Platinum mine. The assets of a PGM recycling business were acquired in Pennsylvania, United States for USD10.8 million and the
non-core 7.5% share in the Pandora joint venture was disposed of for R45.6 million.

The group continued to increase both its mining and processing capacity through the continued development of Booysendal South and
the completion of the second furnace at the Zondereinde smelter complex respectively. Capital expenditure on these projects has
contributed to a record spend of R3.8 billion in the current year.

The acquisitions and development mentioned above have been in line with Northam's growth strategy.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Normalised headline earnings

Normalised headline earnings (the group's headline earnings adjusted for the impact of the BEE transaction) is the main measure of
business performance used by Northam's management. In a continuously tough trading environment, marked by low metal prices and
higher costs, the group increased normalised headline earnings by 5.8% to R421.5 million (F2017: R398.3 million), equivalent to
82.7 cents per share (F2017: 78.1 cents per share).

Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income

Group sales revenue rose 10.0% to R7.6 billion (F2017: R6.9 billion) on the back of improved production and sales volumes combined
with the effects of a 13.5% higher US dollar basket price to USD910/oz 6E (F2017: USD802/oz 6E).

Sales volumes for the group were up 5.0% to 549 508 oz 6E (F2017: 523 170oz). The average value of the ZAR strengthened 5.9% to
ZAR 12.82/USD from ZAR 13.63/USD in F2017. Average US dollar PGM prices were up significantly year on year with the exception
of platinum which is currently trading around 10 year lows. Copper and nickel prices were also substantially higher year on year.

Cost of sales increased to R6.7 billion (F2017: R6.3 billion) on the back of higher operating costs and higher volumes of concentrate
purchased from third parties. Operating costs, which include mining, concentrating and metallurgical processing rose 11.3% to
R6.3 billion (F2017: R5.7 billion) owing to a combination of higher production volumes and higher labour and power costs. In addition,
administrative overheads which include the implementation of SAP and related group services for the more effective management of
a larger Northam group were up 16.2% to R188.7 million (F2017: R162.4 million).

The value of concentrates purchased from third parties increased to R1.4 billion (F2017: R404.1 million), up 249.1% owing to the
availability of additional material. This increase reflects a higher volume of purchased material, which was up 193.8%.

Share-based payment expenses increased by 11.4% from R96.4 million in F2017 to R107.3 million reflecting a higher share price at
the time of payment in November 2017 compared to the previous year.

Refining and related costs were marginally higher at R123.8 million (F2017: R120.6 million) in line with the additional volumes
processed following the completion of the second furnace. These cost increases were largely tempered by the stronger average
ZAR/EUR exchange rate. The change in metal inventories reflects the increase in stock levels over the year owing to the group's mining
capacity exceeding its processing capacity. Since the new furnace at the smelter complex is now complete, inventory levels should
reduce to normal levels in the next 12 months.

Depreciation is calculated by the group on a unit of production basis relative to the resource base. This expense is marginally lower
than the previous year at R441.9 million (F2017: R452.6 million) as a result of an increase in the resource base following the acquisition
of the Western extension block at Zondereinde.

The net result of the above-mentioned sales revenues and costs is an operating profit of R823.3 million (F2017: R614.0 million) with
an operating margin of 10.9% (F2017: 8.9%).

Share of earnings from associate declined to R4.2 million (F2017: R4.9 million) on lower earnings from the associate company,
SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited. Investment revenues fell on the back of lower cash balances during the year owing to the group's
intensive capital expenditure programme. Finance charges are marginally lower after capitalisation of interest as the group continues
to develop Booysendal South and the second furnace was completed.

Sundry income is considerably higher at R217.0 million (F2017: R73.4 million) owing to a series of once-off credits from corporate
activity and higher toll treatment revenues earned from the processing of higher volumes of third party concentrate in F2018. The
increase in sundry expenditure to R380.9 million (F2017: R130.8 million) is a result of higher corporate action and once-off project
costs of R96.5 million (F2017: R56.5 million), Eland mine care and maintenance costs of R106.6 million (F2017: R12.0 million) and
transition costs of R86.4 million incurred when Booysendal mine changed its mining model from contracting to owner-operator in
May 2018.

The non-cash preference share dividend charge is 8.8% higher owing to the compounding nature of the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited
preference shares. Northam's 31.4% BEE shareholder's results are consolidated with Northam in terms of International Financial
Reporting Standards. At R232.0 million (F2017: R212.0 million), taxation is in line with the higher profit before preference
share charges.

Cash flows

The group's F2018 cash flows were largely impacted by an intensive capital expenditure programme and a build-up of inventory.
Operating cash flow was offset by a R1.5 billion increase in working capital, resulting in a negative cash flow from operating activities
of R342.2 million compared to a positive R981.5 million cash flow in F2017, a R1.3 billion swing. Revolving credit facility (RCF) funding
was utilised to support the activities of the business as explained below under financing activities. Cash flows were utilised on the back
of a build-up of inventory, hence the R1.5 billion (F2017: R182.4 million) net change in working capital.

Cash flows utilised in investing activities increased to R3.6 billion (F2017: R2.0 billion) owing to the development of Booysendal South,
the construction and completion of the second furnace at the Zondereinde smelter complex and payments for the acquisitions of the
Western extension, Eland mine and the recycling assets in the United States.

Cash flows generated from financing activities amounted to R2.4 billion (F2017: R250.1 million utilised) owing to a R1.5 billion
drawdown of the RCF and the issue of R1.0 billion in domestic medium term notes (DMTNs) during the year.

OPERATIONS

Zondereinde

The management and employees of Zondereinde are commended for achieving the milestone of 1 000 000 fatality free shifts on
6 February 2018. The lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) improved to 1.29 injuries per 200 000 hours worked (F2017: 1.65).

This achievement was overshadowed however by two tragic accidents in the period under review, and management takes this
opportunity to mark the loss of life of Messrs Sebastio Massingue, a diamond drill operator aged 59, and Mr DJ Du Plessis, an
underground fitter, aged 49. Mr Massingue lost his life in a rail incident and Mr Du Plessis in an engineering related incident.

UG2 tonnages milled increased 4.0% to 1 193 365 tonnes at a head grade of 5.24g/t 6E (F2017: 1 147 878 tonnes at 5.15g/t 6E).
Merensky tonnages milled dropped 9.2% to 739 439 tonnes at a head grade of 6.53g/t 6E (F2017: 814 639 tonnes 6.25g/t 6E). Total
tonnage milled fell 1.5% to 1 932 804 tonnes with a combined 6E head grade of 5.73g/t 6E (F2017: 1 962 517 tonnes at 5.60g/t 6E).

The Merensky head grade increase from F2017 reflects a reduction in the normal reef contribution and an increase in the potholed reef
contribution during the financial year.

Development into the Western extension block is in progress on 3 to 12 levels. Each footwall drive has reached the first reef crosscut
position with most levels expected to have intersected reef by the end of the calendar year and stoping expected to commence in
mid 2019.

Total operating costs at Zondereinde for the period were R4.21 billion (F2017: R3.7 billion), a 14.1% increase. Labour costs represent
a significant portion of this increase, partly owing to the hiring of new employees required to exploit the Western extension.
The combination of higher costs and higher production translated into a 5.8% increase in unit cash costs per equivalent refined platinum
ounce to R22 101/oz (F2017: R20 890/oz).

Production of equivalent refined metal from own operations was up 7.0% to 348 888oz 6E (F2017: 325 981oz). Concentrate purchased
from third parties was 97 974oz 6E (F2017: 35 936oz 6E).

Capital expenditure during the current period reached R1.5 billion (F2017: R806.4 million). Expansionary project expenditure accounted
for R1.3 billion while sustaining expenditure was R249.5 million. The project expenditure pertained primarily to the acquisition of the
Western extension resource and the completion of the new 20MW furnace at Zondereinde's smelter complex. Expansion and sustaining
capital expenditure for F2019 is estimated at R453.5 million and R96.5 million respectively.

Zondereinde's current total resource estimate increased to 105.2 million oz 4E (Moz) (F2017: 84.0Moz), due to the inclusion of the
Western extension resource acquired from Anglo American Platinum Limited during the year.

Booysendal

The good safety performance at the Booysendal operations has been sustained over the year, with the mine recording 3 000 000
fatality free shifts on 17 July 2017. This has been achieved in seven years. The lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) remained constant
at 0.31 for the year (F2017: 0.30) with an improvement in the reportable injury incident rate to 0.18 (RIIR) (F2017: 0.20).

Total operating costs at Booysendal were R2.1 billion (F2017: R2.0 billion), an increase of 5.8%. The increase in the unit cash cost per
platinum oz was contained to 8.5% from R15 747/oz to R17 090/oz for the current period, in the face of lower production volumes. Post
the transition to an owner operating model good mining results are anticipated.

Capital expenditure was R2.0 billion for the period (F2017: R773.8 million), with R1.8 billion on expansion expenditure and
R136.1 million on sustaining expenditure. In addition, R89.6 million was prepaid for the aerial rope conveyor system.

Booysendal North

Production from the UG2 North mine dropped by 5.0% to 2 211 045 tonnes (F2017: 2 326 460 tonnes) primarily as a result of the work
stoppage during the Booysendal mine transition to an owner operator model in May 2018. The UG2 head grade was maintained at
3.31g/t 6E (F2017: 3.33g/t 6E) pre dense media separation. The North Merensky mine produced 458 027 tonnes during the year
at a head grade of 2.27g/t 6E (F2017: 161 134 tonnes at 2.21 g/t 6E). Total metal production declined by 4.3% to 229 275oz 6E
(F2017: 239 643oz).

The North mine capital expenditure of R462.2 million for the year (F2017: R448.2 million), included R326.1 million spent on projects
and R136.1 million spent on sustaining capital. The North mine capital projects comprise the Merensky North project, the UG2 North
deepening project.

During the financial year an agreement was signed with Doppelmayr to start construction on a second aerial conveyor system which
will connect the North mine with the Central mine, allowing ore to be transferred from the North mine to the South mine concentrator
for processing. The construction of the North aerial conveyor system is expected to start early in F2019, after environmental approval
is obtained. Capital expenditure for this was R80.4 million (F2018: RNil) currently accounted for as a prepayment.

The F2019 capital expenditure is estimated at R364.8 million, R169.0 million for sustaining capital expenditure and R195.8 million
expansion capital.

Booysendal South

At Booysendal South, capital expenditure grew to R1.5 billion for the year (F2017: R325.6 million). Most of this capital expenditure
relates to infrastructure expenditure including the South aerial rope conveyor system, the South/North connection road, the Central
mine boxcut and decline development and the refurbishment and start-up of the South mine concentrator. In addition, R9.2 million was
prepaid to Doppelmayr for other items being manufactured in Austria related to the aerial rope conveyor system.

The installation of the South aerial conveyor system, linking the central UG2 decline with the South stockpile area, is progressing well.
By the end of F2018 all the towers had been erected and all the ropes installed and tensioned. Commissioning is expected in December
2018, ahead of schedule.

During the financial year under review the design of two additional Merensky declines was finalised and it is envisaged that development
of these two declines will commence in F2019 and F2020 respectively. The ore from these two declines will be transported via the
aerial conveyor system to the South mine concentrator for processing.

The F2019 capital expenditure is estimated at R935.2 million.

MARKET REVIEW*

Platinum

The average platinum price for the financial year declined by 5.5% year on year to USD934/oz. A surplus of platinum supply is projected
for calendar year 2018 (C2018). This underperformance of the platinum price, compared to the other PGMs, is largely attributable to
the drop in demand for platinum from two of the traditional pillars of demand, Western Europe's light-duty diesel autocatalysts and the
Chinese jewellery industry.

Platinum recycling is expected to continue to grow to 1 955 000oz in 2018 as autocatalyst recycling increases in Europe and
North America.

Platinum demand remains well diversified, with autocatalysts comprising 42% of end-use, while jewellery contributes 33% and a range
of industrial end-uses, including petroleum and chemical catalysts, medical devices, glass fabrication and electrical components make
up the rest.

Gross autocatalyst demand is projected to decline marginally to 3 090 000oz in 2018, as diesel's share of Western European car sales
continues to shrink. Although consumers are wary of buying into a powertrain when risks abound that diesel cars may be banned from
some cities, the reality is that many new diesel cars are able to meet the latest Euro 6d standards for NO x and particulates emissions,
even under forthcoming more stringent real driving emissions testing. Automakers and consumers also face challenging CO2 emission
standards needed to avert global warming. Diesel powertrains are highly competitive compared to gasoline and gasoline hybrids, thus
supporting on-going demand.

Demand for platinum from the jewellery sector is expected to fall marginally to 2 420 000oz in C2018. It is likely to take another year at
least before demand starts to pick up once again. The Platinum Guild International is working closely with retailers to develop platinum
jewellery sales in target markets.

Palladium

The palladium market remains in meaningful deficit by some 805 000oz in C2018, though slightly softer than the 850 000oz deficit seen
in C2017. The average price gained 33.5% to USD976/oz over the reporting period (F2017: USD731/oz).

Global palladium supply is forecast to be 6 980 000oz in C2018. Output is projected to drop in most regions except North America
(+7% to 1 055 000oz), where new production is ramping up, while South African production is expected to contract by 2.6% to
2 477 000oz owing to mine closures. Russian output may also decline as Nornickel's processing reconfiguration work continues.

North American palladium recycling has increased over the last 12 months due to a recovery in the scrap steel and palladium prices,
which are expected to grow again in C2018. However, a slight slowdown in US car sales which is expected this year may limit the rate
of growth. Overall secondary supply is expected to reach 2.5Moz in the 2018 calendar year.

Palladium is becoming increasingly exposed to autocatalysts as it is gradually substituted out of industrial end-uses, mainly electrical
and dental. Autocatalysts, mostly three-way catalysts for gasoline and gasoline hybrid light vehicles, now comprise 80% of total
palladium demand. The United States and China each make up a quarter of autocatalyst palladium demand, closely followed by
Western Europe. Hybridisation of gasoline powertrains, from 48V mild hybrids to full hybrids, is taking place rapidly in order to cut
CO2 emissions as standards tighten and diesel cars' share of the market contracts.

Rhodium

The rhodium market is projected to have a small surplus of some 30 000oz in C2018, compared to 60 000oz in C2017. However, it is
a small market (just over 1 Moz), and close to balance, making it more susceptible to price volatility than its larger sibling metals.

Rhodium remains a key component to remove NOx in three-way catalysts for gasoline vehicles and diesel vehicles. Tightening
emissions legislation for gasoline cars in China supports demand.

The F2018 price averaged USD1 618/oz (F2017: USD803/oz).

Ruthenium

The average ruthenium price jumped 242.9% to USD144/oz for the year (F2017: USD42/oz), aided by growth in electrical and
chemical demand.

Electrical demand (some 40% of the market) continues to grow, as chip resistor use increases and demand for hard disk drives based
on ruthenium alloys grows with global data storage needs. Ruthenium requirements for chemical catalysis have grown as China builds
polyamide capacity. Electrode coatings for electrochemical processes remain robust, while novel applications in fuel cell catalysts
show promise.

The ruthenium market is now projected to move into a structural deficit.

Iridium

Iridium achieved an average price of USD1 014/oz over the period (F2017: USD698/oz), a 45.3% increase year-on-year.

Iridium crucibles (around a third of the market) continue to be favoured for the production of electronic materials for use in smartphones
and many other devices. Demand is robust. Iridium and ruthenium coatings on electrodes enable more environmentally-
friendly production of commodity chemicals worldwide and iridium-tipped spark plugs help to improve the fuel efficiency of gasoline
combustion engines.

Changes to the board of directors

Mr PL (Lazarus) Zim, chairman of the board, retired at the conclusion of the AGM on 7 November 2017 and as a member of the nomination
committee.

Mr KB (Brian) Mosehla, a non-executive director of the board was appointed as chairman on 7 November 2017, and as a member of the
nomination committee, following the retirement of Mr PL Zim. Mr Mosehla also resigned as a member of the social, ethics and human resources
(SE&HR) committee on 8 November 2017.

Mr DH (David) Brown was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 7 November 2017. He was also appointed as a member of
the audit and risk committee and chairman of the investment committee.

Mr R Havenstein resigned as chairman of the investment committee but remained as a member.

Mr JG Smithies was appointed as a member of the health, safety & environmental (HS&E) committee on 7 November 2018.

Dr NY (Yoza) Jekwa was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 8 November 2017 and as a member of the SE&HR committee.

Corporate governance

The board and management are committed to good corporate governance, underpinned by transparency and accountability. We believe that
this approach is fundamental to the management of our business risks, to the way we communicate with our stakeholders, to the delivery of our
strategy, and ultimately to the long-term sustainability of the group.

With the introduction of the King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa, 2016 (King IV), released in November 2016, the board
set about assessing the effectiveness of the company's current processes, practices and structures which are in place to assist with the direction
and management of the company's business and operations.

In February 2017 an independent third party was appointed to conduct a gap analysis on Northam's governance structures and processes.
A number of documentation gaps were identified. These have since been addressed through the group governance framework, in accordance
with the Memorandum of Incorporation, which serves as evidence of Northam's commitment to proper governance and governance best practice
in terms of King IV.

Going concern

Mining operations have a finite life and are dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as well as economic factors such as
commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and low US dollar metal prices are a concern as the group is an exporter
of PGM's to global markets. Operations continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs and low metal prices.

The group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, to maximise the return to stakeholders through the
optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to ensure that all externally imposed capital requirements are complied with. The capital structure
of the group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in these results, issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.

The results have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates.
The board of directors believes that the group will continue to have adequate financial resources and access to capital to continue operating for
the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the results have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Dividends

Given the continuing difficult conditions in the PGM mining industry, and taking into consideration the cash requirements for the development of
the group's project pipeline and acquisition of platinum assets, the board has resolved not to declare a dividend for F2018 (2017: RNil cents
per share).

On behalf of the board.

VOLUNTARY OPERATIONAL AND TRADING UPDATE


OPERATIONAL UPDATE

Northam is pleased to provide an update on the group’s operations and growth strategy for the year
ended 30 June 2018.

The group produced 571 843 oz of equivalent refined 6E (F2017: 546 984 oz), an increase of 4.5% from
the comparative prior period. This follows a strong operational performance from the Zondereinde mine
which increased production by 7.0% year-on-year to 348 888 oz 6E of equivalent refined metal
(F2017: 325 981 oz 6E).

Booysendal mine’s output was adversely affected by a work stoppage in May 2018 when it changed from
a contract mining model to an owner mining model, achieving metal in concentrate production of
229 275 oz 6E (F2017: 239 643 oz 6E), a decline of 4.3% from the comparative prior period.

Owing to the group’s mining capacity exceeding its processing capacity before and during the current
financial period, there has been an inventory build-up. The bulk of the excess inventory, which is
estimated at 170 000 oz, is expected to be processed through the expanded smelter complex in F2019.
The value of excess inventory at year-end amounted to R2.1 billion, with an estimated sales value of
R2.5 billion.

The group’s growth, diversification and optimisation strategy is on track with good progress being made
in the development of the Booysendal South mine and at Zondereinde, the successful commissioning of
the second 20MW furnace, which is performing well. This, together with the acquisition of growth assets
such as the Western block resource adjacent to Zonderiende for R1.0 billion, Eland mine for R175.0 million
as well as the US based recycling assets, contributed to record capital expenditure of R3.8 billion.

TRADING UPDATE

The US Dollar basket price improved by 13.5% to US$910 oz 6E (F2017: US$802 oz 6E), and the average
ZAR/USD exchange rate strengthed 5.9% to ZAR12.82/USD (F2017: R13.63/USD). Total revenue per
platinum oz sold is expected to be R26 103 (F2017: R25 050) with unit cash costs per platinum oz at
approximately R21 270 (F2017: R19 736).

Both Zondereinde and Booysendal recorded healthy cash margins despite difficult market conditions and
higher operating costs. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is
expected to increase to approximately R1.1 billion (F2017: R967.2 million) for the year ended
30 June 2018.

The group expects normalised headline earnings, defined as the group’s headline earnings adjusted for
the impact of Northam’s black economic empowerment transaction, which is the group’s main measure
of performance, to be maintained at approximately R420.0 million (F2017: R398.3 million).

The loss and headline loss per share is expected to be between 185.9 cents and 216.0 cents compared
with the loss per share of 181.8 cents and headline loss per share of 181.9 cents reported in F2017. The
anticipated loss and headline loss per share is attributable to the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited’s non-
cash preference share dividends, which are consolidated into Northam’s results in terms of International
Financial Reporting Standards.

The number of shares in issue remains at 509 781 212 (F2017: 509 781 212) which the group uses to
determine the normalised headline earnings per share. The weighted average number of shares in issue
for the year ended 30 June 2018 is unchanged at 349 875 759 (F2017: 349 875 759 shares).

The financial information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by
Northam’s auditors. The financial results for the year ended 30 June 2018 are expected to be published
on or about 7 September 2018.

NORTHAM SECURES R2 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAPACITY FOR GROWTH INITIATIVES
AND AN UPDATE REGARDING THE SECOND FURNACE AT ZONDEREINDE

Additional R1 billion revolving credit facility

Northam is pleased to advise shareholders that it has secured a new R1 billion two-year unsecured revolving
credit facility (“New R1bn RCF”), which matures in April 2020. This facility is in addition to Northam’s existing
R2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (“R2bn RCF”), which matures in November 2021, and increases
Northam’s total revolving credit facilities to R3 billion up until April 2020. The New R1bn RCF will accrue interest
at the same rate as the R2bn RCF (variable rate of JIBAR plus a margin of 3.3%).

R1 billion fixed rate Domestic Medium Term Notes placement

Northam announced the issue of a R450 million tranche and a R550 million tranche of one-year senior unsecured
fixed rate notes (“Notes”) on 19 April 2018 and 17 May 2018, respectively. The cumulative R1 billion of Notes
were issued under Northam’s R2 billion Domestic Medium Term Note Programme and attract a fixed coupon of
11% per annum, compounded annually. Interest on the Notes is payable upon redemption.

Rationale for and application of the additional funding

During the past 12 months Northam has completed the construction and commissioning of its second furnace at
Zondereinde (at a capital cost of approximately R1 billion); settled its purchase price commitments pertaining to
the acquisition of the Tumela resource, the Eland mine and the recycling assets in the USA; accelerated certain
capital growth projects; and made significant progress with the development and construction of its new
Booysendal South mine. The combined funding requirement in respect of the aforementioned was well in excess
of R3 billion. During this period a significant surplus concentrate stockpile, with an approximate value of R2 billion,
was built up at Zondereinde in anticipation of commissioning the second furnace. Processing of this stockpile at
the second furnace is currently underway and the working capital lock-up is expected to be released during
financial year 2019.

A significant new purchase of concentrate agreement has been entered into with a third party and processing of
this concentrate has already commenced.

A portion of the proceeds from the Notes has been used to repay previous drawdowns under the R2bn RCF and
the New R1bn RCF remains undrawn. In view of the successful commissioning of the furnace and the ongoing
working capital release from the concentrate stockpile, Northam opted to place the Notes for a one-year term
only.

As at 30 April 2018, Northam’s net debt position amounted to approximately R2.5 billion, comprising R875 million
of domestic medium term notes in issue and a net drawdown of approximately R1.6 billion on the R2bn RCF.
The Notes issued on 17 May 2018 will have no impact on the net debt position and the proceeds from this issue
have been paid into the R2bn RCF.

The addition of the New R1bn RCF is intended to right-size Northam’s standby facilities from R2 billion to
R3 billion during a capital intensive development period at the Booysendal South mine whilst releasing value
locked in the stockpile and, following that, to maintain a prudent level of standby facilities, taking into account
Northam’s significantly enlarged operational footprint.

Update on the second furnace at Zondereinde

Ramp-up of the newly commissioned second furnace is progressing as planned with concentrate feed currently
averaging approximating 400 tonnes per day at 13.5 MW. Northam is on track to complete processing of the
surplus stockpile in financial year 2019, taking into account the additional concentrate purchased.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer, said “the additional R2 billion funding flexibility addresses our
investment in the concentrate stockpile during this capital intensive period for the Booysendal South project. The
increased RCF also provides additional medium-term flexibility to take advantage of further potential opportunities
which may arise in the PGM sector.”

Northam confirms that approximately 750 employees at the Booysendal mine in
Mpumalanga Province, embarked on an unprotected work stoppage with effect from
Monday night, 26 March 2018.

The MRC employees had been approached by Northam to become full-time employees in a
move for Booysendal to become an owner-operating mine, which will result in them
becoming permanent Northam employees. The affected employees are demanding end-of-
contract termination packages from MRC.

Both MRC and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), the
representative union, have been in consultation with the affected employees. MRC has
applied for an urgent interdict to effect a return to work.

Shareholders will be kept informed of further developments.

NOTES TO THE REVIEWED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS

1. Accounting policies and the basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the financial instruments to the extent required or permitted
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as set out in the relevant accounting policies detailed in Northam's annual
integrated report, which includes the annual financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017. These interim financial statements incorporate
the accounting policies which are in terms of IFRS and have been applied on a basis consistent with the previous year, with the exception of the
policies adopted during the period as more fully set out below.

The group interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition
requirements of IFRS, its interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
Accounting Practices Committee, presentation and disclosures as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the JSE Listing Requirements
and the requirements of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008 (Companies Act) including the adoption of the following amendments, standards or
interpretations with effect from 1 July 2017:

- IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative - Amendments to IAS 7

- IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses - Amendments to IAS 12

- AIP IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities - Clarification of the scope of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12

The adoption of these amendments resulted in changes only in the way in which the interim financial results statements are presented, as well
as additional disclosures in the annual financial statements. They did not impact any amounts recognised in the interim conso lidated statement
of comprehensive income or interim consolidated statement of financial position.

The following new standards and amendments to standards are not effective and have not been early adopted, but will be adopted once these
new standards become effective:

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)'s replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instrum ents: Recognition
and Measurement. The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge
accounting of financial instruments. The new standard contains substantial changes from the current financial instruments standard (IAS 39)
with regards to the classification, measurement, impairment and hedge accounting requirements. These changes include:

Classification and measurement: The new classification requirements are based on both the entity's business model for managing the financial
assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial asset. The more principles-based approach of IFRS 9 requires the careful use
of judgement in its application.

Impairment: The IASB has sought to address a key concern that arose as a result of the financial crisis that the incurred loss model in IAS 39
contributed to the delayed recognition of credit losses. As such, it has introduced a forward-looking expected credit loss model.

Hedge accounting: The aim of the new hedge accounting model is to provide useful information about risk management activities that an entity
undertakes using financial instruments, with the effect that financial reporting will reflect more accurately how an entity manages its risk and the
extent to which hedging mitigates those risks.

IFRS 9 establishes a new model for recognition and measurement of impairments in loans and receivables that are measured at amortised cost
or fair value though other comprehensive income (FVOCI), the so-called expected credit losses model. This is the only impairment model that
applies in IFRS 9 because all other assets are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) or, in the case of qualifying
equity investments, FVOCI with no recycling to profit and loss.

Expected credit losses are calculated by: identifying scenarios in which a loan or receivable defaults; estimating the cash shortfall that would be
incurred in each scenario if a default were to happen; multiplying that loss by the probability of the default happening; and summing the results
of all such possible default events. Because every loan and receivable has at least some probability of defaulting in the future, every loan or
receivable has an expected credit loss associated with it from the moment of its origination or acquisition.

IFRS 9 does not require an entity to restate prior periods. Restatement is permitted, if and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight and
the restated financial statements reflect all of the requirements of IFRS 9. If the entity does not restate prior periods, any difference between
previous carrying amounts and those determined under IFRS 9 at the date of initial application should be included in the current year opening
retained earnings (or other equivalent component of equity).

The entity will apply the expected loss model when assessing for impairment of financial assets.

The standard is effective for year-ends beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The IASB has published IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IFRS 15 outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for
revenue arising from contract with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle is that an entity
recognises revenue to reflect the transfer to goods or services, measured at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services.

IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted. Entities can choose to apply
the standard fully retrospectively or use a modified approach in the year of application.

Whereas previously IFRS allowed significant room for judgement in devising and applying revenue recognition policies and practices, IFRS 15
is more prescriptive in many areas relevant to the mining sector. It also introduces some new concepts for determining when revenue should
be recognised.

Under IAS 18 the timing of revenue recognition from the sale of goods was based on the transfer of risk and rewards of ownership. IFRS 15
focuses on when control of those goods has transferred to the customer. Although the timing of transfer under the two models will often coincide,
this different approach may result in a change of timing for revenue recognition for some entities.

IFRS 15 is more prescriptive than the current IFRS requirements for revenue recognition and provides more application guidance. The disclosure
requirements are also more extensive.

Based on an assessment performed on the various sales contract the recognition of revenue will relatively be unchanged except for provisionally
priced agreements. Sales contracts for certain commodities (e.g. copper, nickel and chrome) often include provisional pricing at the time of
delivery of the metal concentrate, for which final pricing is based on a price at a future date.

Under current IFRS, if these price adjustment features meet the definition of an embedded derivative, they are separated from the contract and
accounted for under IAS 39 starting at the date of delivery. Revenue is then initially recognised at the estimated fair value of the total consideration
received or receivable when the mineral concentrate/product is delivered. This fair value is estimated by reference to forward market prices. Any
changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative from the date of delivery to the end of the quotational period are recognised in profit or loss
for the period. IAS 39 does not specify the presentation of such subsequent fair value movements. Consequently, this has led to some divergent
practices for presenting fair value gains or losses in profit or loss. The majority of mining sector participants present the se movements as part of
revenue, which is consistent with Northam's approach.

IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. Lessees
will apply a single model for most leases (with certain exemptions). Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern will change as interest and
depreciation expenses are recognised separately in profit or loss (similar to current finance lease accounting). However, lessees can make
accounting policy elections to apply accounting similar to operating lease accounting under IAS 17 Leases to short-term leases and leases of
low-value assets.

Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from the current lease statement. As with IAS 17, IFRS 16 requires lessors to classify their leases
into two types: finance leases and operating leases. Lease classification determines how and when a lessor recognises lease revenue and what
assets a lessor records.

The new standard provides a comprehensive model to identify lease-arrangements and the treatment thereof in the financial statements of both
lessees and lessors.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted provided that the new revenue
standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been, or is, applied at the same date as IFRS 16. Lessees must apply IFRS 16
using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The group has limited lease arrangements and the impact is therefore expected to be minimal.

IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration

The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an Interpretation on how to determine the date of the transaction when applying the standard on
foreign currency transactions, IAS 21. The Interpretation applies where an entity either pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign
currency-denominated contracts. The date of the transaction determines the exchange rate to be used on initial recognition of the related asset,
expense or income. The issue arises because IAS 21 requires an entity to use the exchange rate at the 'date of the transaction', which is defined
as the date when the transaction first qualifies for recognition. The 'date of the transaction' for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to
use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entit y initially recognises the non-monetary
asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in
advance, the entity should determine a date of transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.

IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires an entity to record a foreign currency transaction, on initial recognition in its
functional currency by applying to the foreign currency amount, the spot rate at the date of transaction. However, there are circumstances when
an entity pays or receives consideration in advance in a foreign currency. This gives rise to a non-monetary asset or liability before recognition
of the related asset, expense or income.

This Interpretation applies to a foreign currency transaction (or part of it) when an entity recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary
liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recognises the related asset, expe nse or income (or part
of it).

The Interpretation provides guidance for when a single payment/receipt is made, as well as for situations where multiple payments/receipts are
made. The guidance aims to reduce diversity in practice.

The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

The group already follows the principles included in IFRIC 22, relating to the non-current prepayments made and therefore believes that the
impact will be minimal.

Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments

The IASB has issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in relation to the classification and measurement of share-based payment
transactions. The amendments are intended to eliminate diversity in practice in three main areas. The effects of vesting conditions on the
measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction. The classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement
features for withholding tax obligations. The accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction
changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.

The amendments to IFRS 2 are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but earlier application is permitted provided
it is disclosed. On adoption, prior periods will not be restated.

The amendment will have a minimal impact on the results of the group as the clarifications with regards to cash-settled share-based payment
transactions have already been taken into account when valuing the share-based payment liability of the group.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment

The IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (the Interpretation). The Interpretation clarifies application of
recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation
specifically addresses the following: whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately, the assumptions an ent ity makes about the
examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities, how an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused
tax credits and tax rates and how an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances.

The interpretation is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

The Interpretation is not considered to have a material impact on the group but is still being assessed.

2. Related parties

The group enters into various sales, purchases, financing and lease transactions in the ordinary course of business with a large number of
entities, some of whom are related parties.

3. Events after the reporting period

Subsequent to the period end, the purchase of the Eland mine from Glencore Operations (South Africa) Proprietary Limited became
unconditional. Apart from this item there has been no other events subsequent to the period end which require additional disclosure or adjustment
to these interim financial results.

Introduction

The Northam group continued to execute its growth strategy during this period by concluding the Tumela block acquisition,
commissioning the new 20MW furnace at the Zondereinde smelter complex, continuing the development of the Booysendal South
mine, acquiring a PGM recycling business in Pennsylvania, United States, and the disposal of the non-core 7.5% share of the Pandora
joint venture.

In a further development after the end of the reporting period the Eland transaction was finalised.

The group's 6E equivalent refined metal production from own operations increased by 6.4% to 291 407oz (H1 F2017: 273 878oz)
during the reporting period (4E: 246 473oz (H1 F2017: 235 375oz)), reflecting a sound operational effort at the group's operations.

Financial overview

Sales volumes (6E) in the period were lower by 3.9% at 249 865oz (H1 F2017: 260 073oz), (4E: 209 861oz (H1 F2017: 223 705oz)),
reflecting the continued build-up of inventory ahead of the commissioning of the new furnace. The lower volumes had a predictable
effect on sales revenues, which dropped by 3.1% to R3.4 billion (H1 F2017: R3.5 billion). This was exacerbated by the stronger South
African currency over the period at ZAR13.43/USD (H1 F2017: R13.99/USD).

Despite significant US dollar price increases for some of the PGMs, notably palladium and rhodium, revenue from platinum, which
constitutes approximately 60% of the production basket, dropped by 17.8%, reflecting the lower average market price achieved and
sales volumes for platinum compared to the previous period.

Cost of sales dropped by 3.0% to R3.0 billion (H1 F2017: R3.1 billion) owing primarily to the lower sales volumes. Mining and
concentrator operational costs increased by 10.6% to R2.4 billion (H1 F2017: R2.2 billion) and 12.1% to R347.0 million (H1 F2017:
R309.6 million) respectively, owing to labour and power cost increases and the expenditure associated with commissioning the dense
media separation (DMS) plant at Booysendal mine.

The lower volumes and a stronger ZAR/EUR exchange rate had a positive impact on refining costs, which declined by 14.6%. However,
costs associated with corporate activity, the implementation of SAP and other related group services required for more effective
administration and management of the growing Northam group, rose by 29.4% to R83.6 million (H1 F2017: R64.6 million).

Lower group royalty rates had a positive impact on royalty charges, which were 51.6% lower at R15.6 million (H1 F2017: R32.1 million).
The value of concentrate purchases increased by 141.3% to R430.1 million (H1 F2017: R178.2 million) owing to higher volumes
delivered.

Share-based payments were up 239.9% to R99.7 million (H1 F2017: R29.3) as a result of Northam's higher prevailing share price
compared to the previous period.

The higher metal inventories are largely a function of the group's mining capacity exceeding that of its processing capacity currently.
This situation should normalise during the second half of F2018 as the new furnace ramps up to steady state production.

Depreciation costs were essentially unchanged on a group basis, reflecting the higher capex requirements at the newer Booysendal
property on the one hand, and the lower spend at the more mature Zondereinde mine on the other, where a higher proportion of
property, plant and equipment has relatively lower values being depreciated.

The group operating profit was down by 3.8% to R338.8 million (H1 F2017: R352.0 million). The operating margin is largely unchanged
from the previous period at 10.1% (H1 F2017: 10.2%).

The share of earnings from associates and joint ventures increased to R6.4 million (H1 F2017: R1.9 million) reflecting the substantial
increase in the profitability of SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited, an associate company of Northam which provides cleaning and security
services. Investment income is down 73.1% to R28.9 million (H1 F2017: R107.4 million) reflecting lower cash balances as a result of
the group's high capital expenditure.

Finance charges were lower at R25.5 million (H1 F2017: R50.1 million) due to the capitalisation of interest. Sundry income was higher
due to a series of once-off credits from corporate activity during the period, whilst sundry expenditure comprises once-off costs incurred
on assets that the group has acquired.

Taxation increased to R132.8 million (H1 F2017: R104.6 million) owing to a higher deferred tax liability arising from the group's capital
expenditure programme.

Cash flows

Operating cash flows were negative to the value of R562.7 million (H1 F2017: positive R216.4 million) owing to the high inventory levels
and prepayments resulting in higher working capital requirements. The high level of inventory is expected to normalise during H2 F2018
given the recent commissioning of the new furnace as concentrate is processed through the new furnace.

Cash utilised in investing activities rose by 181.6% to R2.2 billion (H1 F2017: R778.0 million) reflecting the intensity of the group's
capital expenditure programme as production is expanded in line with the growth strategy. The major spend has been on the new
20MW furnace at Zondereinde, which is now complete and commissioned, the acquisition of the Tumela block and the development of
Booysendal South mine.

Financing cash flows increased by R1.3 billion (H1 F2017: outflow of R285.6 million) owing to the drawdown of the revolving credit
facility to finance the group's intensive capital expenditure programme.

Zondereinde operations

Management regrets to report that Mr Feliciano Sebastiao Massingue, a diamond drill operator, aged 59, was fatally injured on
17 July 2017 in an underground accident. The board and management express their sincere condolences to the family and colleagues
of Mr Massingue.

It is encouraging that the lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) improved to 1.31 injuries per 200 000 hours worked (H1 F2017: 1.59)
during the reporting period. Management continues to devote considerable effort and resources to encouraging safe working practices.

Total tonnages mined increased marginally to 1 136 541 tonnes (H1 F2017: 1 123 629 tonnes), with the UG2's contribution 10.2%
higher at 673 042 tonnes (H1 F2017: 610 973) tonnes, and the Merensky tonnages 9.6% lower at 463 499 tonnes (H1 F2017:
512 656 tonnes). The combined 6E head grade was 5.7g/t (4E: 5.7g/t).

Zondereinde continues to be impacted by the constrained availability of Merensky reef in the north-west quadrant of the mine. This will
be relieved by the accessing of the Tumela block in due course. Nevertheless, tonnages from the pothole Merensky facies increased
in this period, which had a positive impact on the Merensky 6E head grade at 6.6g/t (H1 F2017: 6.3g/t) (4E: 6.1g/t for the current period
(H1 F2017: 5.8g/t)). The Tumela block is expected to improve the availability of Merensky mining face over the next two years as new
reserves are established.

Total mine operating costs for the period were R2.1 billion (H1 F2017: R1.8 billion), a 16.6% increase on the previous period's costs.
Labour costs represent a significant proportion of this rise given the hiring of new employees to replace those who had been discharged
at the start of the current reporting period. The combination of higher costs and higher production translated into a 9.0% increase in
unit cash costs per equivalent refined platinum ounce to R21 775/oz (H1: F2017 R19 980/oz).

The 6E production of equivalent refined metal from own operations increased by 5.9% to 177 755oz (H1: F2017 167 896oz), (4E up
5.7% to 152 487oz (H1 F2017: 144 292oz)). Third party concentrate added 6E equivalent metal of 31 819oz (H1 F2017: 16 255oz)
(4E: 27 561oz (H1 F2017: 14 179oz)).

Capital expenditure during the period was R1.4 billion (H1 F2017: R425.0 million). Expansionary capital expenditure included the
acquisition of the Tumela block from Anglo American Platinum Limited (R1.0 billion) and the completion of the new 20MW furnace at
Zondereinde's smelter complex (R210.1 million). Net capital expenditure for the period was R1.1 billion after deducting the proceeds
of the Heraeus contribution to the new furnace (R303.1 million). Sustaining expenditure was R93.7 million. Expansion and sustaining
capital expenditure for the remainder of F2018 is estimated at R161.9 million and R205.8 million respectively.

Zondereinde's current total resource estimate increased to 102.59 million oz (Moz) (F2017: 83.98Moz), owing to the inclusion of the
Tumela block resources acquired.

Booysendal operations

Booysendal North mine recorded three million fatality free shifts on 17 July 2017. Although the lost time injury incident rate per 200 000
hours worked increased to 0.31 for the period (H1 F2017: 0.14) Booysendal's safety performance is still commendable.
The mechanised mining method remains a significant safety differentiator.

The Booysendal North Merensky mine milled 137 400 tonnes at a 6E head grade of 2.2g/t. The Merensky stockpile contains
157 032 tonnes.

Tonnages from the UG2 mine declined by 1.8% to 1 190 215 tonnes milled (H1 F2017: 1 212 281 tonnes) at a constant head grade of
2.7 g/t. The start-up of the DMS will enable the processing of higher mined tonnages with a marginal overall recovery sacrifice.

Chrome produced for the current period was 144 382 tonnes (H1 F2017: 138 635 tonnes), a 4.1% increase.

Metal in concentrate produced and purchased was 120 139oz 6E.

Total mine operating costs increased by 5.8% to R1.0 billion (H1 F2017: R948.8 million).

The cash cost per equivalent 6Eoz in concentrate is R8 211/oz (H1 F2017 R7 622/oz) (4E equivalent concentrate was R9 938/oz
(H1 F2017: R9 218/oz)). This equates to a cash cost per platinum oz of R16 459/oz (H1 F2017: R15 271/oz)), an increase of 7.8%.

Capital expenditure was R1.2 billion for the period (H1 F2017: R330.0 million) with R1.1 billion on project expenditure and R25.2 million
on sustaining expenditure. In addition, R140.2 million was prepaid for the construction of the aerial rope conveyor system. The
estimated expansionary and sustaining capital expenditure for the remainder of F2018 is R690.7 million and R72.0 million respectively.

Market review *

Platinum

The average group platinum price received in the period was USD937/oz (H1 F2017: USD1 027/oz), an 8.8% price decline year
on year.

Global platinum end-use dropped by 4.0% to 5.7Moz during 2017, which outpaced the 1.4% reduction in supply to 5.9Moz.
Nonetheless, excess metal was absorbed by investment demand, which rose by 200 000oz, thereby leaving the platinum market
balanced.

Platinum market fundamentals are set to improve in 2018. Industrial demand, which contracted by 8.4% (150 000oz) in 2017, is forecast
to recover fully in 2018.

Jewellery demand, which amounted to an estimated 2.6Moz or 34% of the market, declined by just 1% in 2017, compared to a sharp
fall in 2016 when the market contracted in China. This market has since improved and companies there are once again expanding.
Outside of China, which accounts for 52% of the market, growth is expected to continue, mainly in India and the USA.

Autocatalyst demand, which made up 43% of end-use in 2017 (excluding investment), remains remarkably resilient. Passenger diesel
car sales, which contain platinum-rich catalysts, are declining in Europe. However, tighter tailpipe emission standards, as well as growth
elsewhere, helped to limit the reduction in global autocatalyst platinum demand to just 65 000oz, to a total of 3.2Moz in 2017.

A further drop in autocatalyst demand is in prospect in 2018, but at a similar level to 2017.

The resulting outlook for total end-use is growth of 2.5% to around 5.8Moz, excluding investment which is more difficult to forecast.
ETF holdings got off to a positive start to the year, adding 25 000oz in January 2018.

Mine closures in 2017 and constrained growth in recycling should lead to a further contraction in supply, ultimately leaving the platinum
market in a slight deficit for the year.

Palladium

The average price of palladium increased by 39.8% in the current period rising to USD948/oz (H1 F2017: USD678/oz). Palladium
exhibited a tighter physical market as expressed by double-digit lease rates, driven by deficits over several years. Limited palladium
ingot availability is likely to persist in calendar year 2018.

Automotive demand, which now accounts for 80% of the total market, has grown from just 4Moz in 2009 to 8.1Moz in 2017. The rapid
rise in car sales in China and a full automotive market recovery in the USA drove palladium requirements to record levels. Weaker
growth in China and an expected drop in sales in the USA should keep palladium requirements flat for 2018. Total demand is also
forecast to remain flat year-on-year at just over 10Moz.

Nonetheless, as the industrial market for palladium was already in an estimated deficit of more than a million ounces, a similar shortfall
is expected in 2018.

Rhodium

The average market price achieved for rhodium in this period was USD1 240/oz (H1 F2017: USD682/oz), an increase of 81.8%.

Tighter tailpipe emissions standards termed 'China 5' are being rolled out nationwide in China from January 2018 resulting in higher
rhodium loadings on three-way gasoline catalysts.

The combination of stronger Chinese demand and a drop in South African mine supply tightened the market, leading to double-digit
lease rates. Non-Chinese automotive buying and speculative interest have further exacerbated demand for rhodium, leading to a sharp
rise in prices.

The market is forecast to be very closely balanced in 2018. Any sustained period of buying or additional reductions in supply from
South Africa could further tighten the market.

Ruthenium

The average price achieved for the period was USD78/oz (H1 F2017: USD38/oz), a 105.3% hike. Prices were driven mainly by
accelerating demand for chip resistors, with rising content in smartphones and vehicle electronics.

Demand is likely to be sustained in hard disk drives, with ruthenium used to keep them competitive on price and storage capacity.

Ruthenium is already used in some fuel cell and electrolysis applications, and there is extensive research and development activity
in this field which is benefiting from intense global interest in renewable and sustainable energy.

Iridium

Iridium's average price was USD956/oz for the period (H1 F2017: USD612/oz), a 56.2% increase.

Iridium and ruthenium continue to be very effective as electrode coatings in the chloralkali industry, benefiting recently from
environmental legislation favouring their use over other processes, and serving high-volume basic global chemical markets.

Iridium crucibles are widely used in the manufacture of crystal materials for the electronics industry.

Recycling

Autocatalyst recycling has had three years of lost growth. The collapse in scrap steel prices in the second half of 2014 led to a reduction
in the number of vehicles collected and dismantled. Many salvage yards went out of business and scrapped vehicle stocks
accumulated. This led to fewer autocatalysts reaching dealers and catalyst processors. Scrap steel prices bottomed out at the end of
2015 and have been steadily recovering along with the number of autocatalysts being recycled and therefore so are PGM volumes.

Platinum recycled from the processing of end of life autocatalysts only surpassed 2014 levels in 2017 at 1.3Moz. A steady increase in
platinum recycling is expected in 2018, although some processing bottlenecks, particularly in respect of diesel particulate filters may
present some constraints and could ultimately limit the amount of platinum recycled in 2018.

South African regulatory environment

Northam is a member of the South African Chamber of Mines and supports all the initiatives of the Chamber to find ways to resolve the
current Mining Charter III impasse and the declaratory order on the principles which apply to the assessment of the ownership element
of the Mining Charter.

Both these matters have been subject to current court action until recently, when the new President of South Africa,
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, declared government's intention to resolve the Mining Charter III impasse outside the court process, directly with
the Chamber and all other parties concerned. The declaratory order matter, however, remains subject to court action.

Changes to the board of directors

Mr KB (Brian) Mosehla, a non-executive director of the board was appointed as chairman on 7 November 2017, and as a member of the
nomination committee, following the retirement of Mr PL Zim.

Mr DH (David) Brown was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 7 November 2017 and as a member of the audit and
risk committee.

Dr NY (Yoza) Jekwa was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 8 November 2017 and as a member of the social, ethics and
human resources committee.

Corporate governance

The group is in the process of adopting the King IV code which includes the update and design of certain documentation to support the application
of the principles and outcomes of the code.

For further details regarding the group's governance structures and processes refer to the corporate governance section included in the annual
integrated report for the year ended 30 June 2017, which may be found on the website at http://www.northam.co.za.

Going concern

Mining operations have a finite life and are dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as well as economic factors such as
commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and low US dollar metal prices are a concern as the group is an exporter
of PGMs to global markets. Operations continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs and lower metal prices.

The group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, to maximise the return to stakeholders through
the optimisation of the debt and equity balance, and to ensure that all externally imposed capital requirements are complied with. The capital
structure of the group consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in these reviewed interim results, issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings.

The reviewed interim results have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and
estimates. The board of directors believes that the group will continue to have adequate financial resources and access to capital to continue
operating for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the interim results have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Dividends

Given the continuing difficult conditions in the mining industry, and taking into consideration the cash requirements for the development of the
group's project pipeline and acquisition of platinum assets, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for H1 F2018 (H1 F2017:
RNil cents per share).

TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are advised that the group’s loss per share for the period ended 31 December 2017 is
estimated to range between 77.7 cents per share and 90.7 cents per share and the headline loss per
share is estimated to range between 77.6 cents per share and 90.5 cents per share, compared with the
loss per share of 64.8 cents and headline loss per share of 64.7 cents reported for the period ended
31 December 2016. The aforementioned ranges expressed in percentage terms, are, in respect of both
the loss per share and headline earnings per share, an increase of 20% and 40% per share.

The anticipated loss is attributable to the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”) preference share
dividends, which are consolidated in the group’s results in terms of the International Financial Reporting
Standards. The Zambezi preference shares accrue dividends at a cumulative variable dividend of 3.5%
over the prime overdraft interest rate in South Africa. Shareholders are reminded that
159 905 453 Northam shares are held for settlement of the Zambezi preference share liability in terms
of the Northam guarantee and the accrued dividends are consolidated into the Northam results as a
non cash item for Northam.

Although the platinum mining industry has experienced difficult economic conditions during the
reporting period, both of the group’s operating mines, Zondereinde and Booysendal, are expected to
record an operating profit.

The weighted average number of Northam shares in issue for the period ended 31 December 2017 was
349 875 759 (31 December 2016: 349 875 759 shares).

The information on which this trading statement and trading update is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by the group’s external auditors. The reviewed interim results for the period ended
31 December 2017 are anticipated to be published on or about 23 February 2018.

NORTHAM’S LONG TERM CREDIT RATING UPGRADED


Northam wishes to advise shareholders that the credit rating agency, Global Credit Rating Co.
(“GCR”), has upgraded Northam’s long term credit rating to A-(ZA) from BBB+(ZA) and reaffirmed
Northam’s short term credit rating at A1-(ZA), with the outlook being accorded as Stable.

Northam’s credit rating upgrade was achieved despite the current and ongoing challenges being
faced by the mining industry, further illustrating the group’s resilience and ability to maintain a strong
capital base and liquidity position.

Northam’s credit rating upgrade is based on the following key considerations:

•    The realisation of projected benefits of Northam’s fully funded R6.6 billion black economic
     empowerment transaction through the acquisition of quality platinum group metal (“PGM”)
     assets at favourable prices.
•    Additional sources of production being expected from Northam’s recent transactions, including
     the acquisition of the Tumela block and the Eland Platinum mine, and further geographical and
     segmental diversification through the acquisition of the PGM recycling assets in the United
     States of America.
•    A 60% increase in Northam’s operating profit as a result of improved metal prices, lower costs
     of production, general economies of scale and the implementation of stringent cost controls.
•    The easing of Northam’s corporate risk profile as a result of Booysendal North maintaining
     steady state production for two years and becoming the second operational mine of the group.
•    A strong improvement in Northam’s operating cash flows, up from R952.7 million for the financial
     year ended 30 June 2016 to R1.1 billion for the financial year ended 30 June 2017.
•    A strong capital base, with R1.8 billion in cash as at 30 June 2017, well in excess of the
     R425 million in interest bearing obligations, as well as the availability of a R1.0 billion revolving
     credit facility (which increases to R1.5 billion H2 F2018), asserting Northam’s strong liquidity
     position in the medium-term.
•    A further positive rating migration is predicted on the development of Booysendal South and
     recently acquired ore bodies, which should see a continued widening of the group’s operating
     margins and sustainability of cash flows and credit protection metrics.

GCR has published an announcement in regard to Northam’s credit rating (available from GCR
at http://globalratings.net).

INTRODUCTION

The Northam group's equivalent refined metal production from own operations increased 8.5% to 474 007oz (F2016: 436 960oz) (4E)
during the reporting period. This was due to a commendable operational performance at both Booysendal North and Zondereinde.
Booysendal North recorded a 23.6% increase in production, while Zondereinde's year-end output was only marginally lower year on
year, as it largely overcame the effects of a workforce reorganisation and an 18-day outage of the UG2 milling circuit during the first
half of the financial year.

Capital expenditure increased 40.1% as the group continued with the development of its expansion projects at both Booysendal and
Zondereinde mines. These include the development of Booysendal South, deepening projects at both mines as well as an additional
new furnace and dryer at the Zondereinde smelter complex. A total of R1.6 billion has been spent (F2016: R1.2 billion).

The group continues to execute its expansion strategy of growing production down the cost curve, both organically and through
acquisitions. In line with our external growth ambitions, we have acquired the Tumela block's mineral resources from Anglo American
Platinum Limited for R1.0 billion and are in the process of acquiring the Eland Platinum mine from Glencore Operations South Africa
Proprietary Limited for R175.0 million. The cash payment of these amounts will be made once all conditions precedent have been met.
Subsequent to year-end, the group acquired PGM recycling assets in Pennsylvania, United States, from A-1 Specialized Services Inc.
for USD10.7 million.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income

Group sales revenue rose 12.6% to R6.9 billion (F2016: R6.1 billion) on the back of higher US dollar PGM and base metal prices. The
average PGM basket price increased by 8.3% to USD900/oz (F2016 USD831/oz).This translated to total revenue per platinum oz sold
increasing by 11.0% to R25 050 (F2016: R22 566). However, the stronger average exchange rate of R13.63/USD (F2016: R14.33/USD)
tempered the increase in the total revenue.

Sales volumes increased marginally to 453 581oz (F2016: 452 393oz) reflecting the current metallurgical processing capacity
constraints of the group.

Cost of sales increased 9.4% to R6.3 billion (F2016: R5.7 billion) following a 13.4% rise in operating costs to R5.7 billion
(F2016: R5.0 billion). The increase in operating costs is mainly the result of higher on-mine operational costs, which were up 13.7%,
reflecting production volume increases at Booysendal as well as labour and power increases. The value of purchased concentrate from
third parties rose 15.3% to R404.1 million (F2016: R350.5 million) reflecting the 12.1% growth in volumes delivered. The 12.2% increase
in the depreciation charge is attributable to the higher volumes of production as the charge is calculated on the units of production
method and the higher values of property, plant and equipment in line with increasing group capital expenditure.

The change in metal inventory value of R402.1 million (F2016: R180.8 million), reflects the increase in inventories owing to the group's
current constrained metallurgical capacity. Group unit cash costs per equivalent refined platinum oz were well contained, increasing
4.6% to R19 736 (F2016: R18 877), with the group cash profit per equivalent refined platinum oz increasing 44.0% to R5 314
(F2016: R3 689).

With the increased capital expenditure in support of our production growth strategy, cash balances were lower, thereby impacting
revenues from investment which fell 36.9% to R167.3 million (F2016: R265.3 million). Sundry income is down 52.6% at R73.4 million
(F2016: R154.8 million) mainly due to the once off receipt from a cancelled insurance contingency policy and a related insurance refund
in the comparative period.

Included in finance costs, which are up 79.6% to R71.2 million, is the unwinding of the rehabilitation liability charge of R41.5 million.
The interest charges of R51.8 million (F2016: R28.3 million) associated with the two domestic medium-term notes of R175.0 million
and R250.0 million have been fully capitalised in the current period.

Sundry expenditure is up 42.0%, due to the higher care and maintenance costs, which now also include Eland mine, and higher
corporate action costs reflecting the increased corporate activity of the group.

Operating profit increased 60.2% to R614.0 million (F2016: R383.3 million). The group's operating profit percentage improved to 8.9%
(F2016: 6.3%) reflecting higher PGM prices, strong cost control and economies of scale as group production increases.

The 10.7% increase in the cumulative non-cash preference share dividend to R1.0 billion, net of capitalised interest of R24.3 million, is
due to the compounding nature of the preference share liability, and is the main reason for the group's net loss.

Cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities increased to R981.5 million (F2016: R839.1 million) largely as a function of lower tax paid and the
higher working capital requirements which reflect unusually high levels of inventory. The high inventory levels should normalise soon
after the new furnace is commissioned at the beginning of H2 F2018.

The R2.0 billion (F2016: R1.1 billion) of cash utilised in investing activities, which includes a prepayment of R336.4 million (F2016:
RNil), is higher than in the comparative period, reflecting the group's growing capital expenditure programme. With the prepayment,
we have secured cheaper financing from the offshore supplier of the aerial rope conveyor for Booysendal South. The major project
spend is on the 20MW furnace at Zondereinde and the Booysendal South mine development.

Cash flows utilised from financing activities are lower at R250.1 million (F2016: R745.4 million) as there were no fund raising activities
in F2017 compared to the previous period. In F2016 the R1.4 billion domestic medium term note was repaid whilst in the current period
Northam acquired Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited preference shares to the value of R208.7 million (F2016: RNil).

OPERATIONS

Zondereinde

Management regrets the loss of life, during the F2017 reporting period, of Mr Alexandre Macave. Mr Macave, a locomotive operator,
was fatally injured in an underground rail accident on Friday, 6 January 2017. Mr Macave was a Mozambican citizen aged 54 with
25 years' experience. The board and management express their sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.

Management and employees are however commended for achieving the six million fatality-free shifts milestone in November 2016.
The lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) improved to 1.65 injuries per 200 000 hours worked (F2016: 1.92).

Despite the disruptions to production resulting from measures taken to reorganise the workforce, after the discharge of 357 employees,
as well as an 18-day outage of the UG2 milling circuit owing to a mill bearing failure, Zondereinde's equivalent metal production from
own operations was down by only 0.9%, to 280 172oz (F2016: 282 765oz). This is a commendable performance by both management
and employees, who took the necessary measures to meet production targets despite the above mentioned challenges.

Merensky ore remains constrained currently but the Merensky:UG2 ore mix will gradually be modified back to a 55:45 ratio. This should
happen within 24 months of the section 102 approval for the transfer of the recently-acquired Tumela block from Anglo Platinum to
Northam, resulting in the immediate access to new Merensky ore.

Equivalent refined metal processed from third parties was up 12.1% to 30 953oz (F2016: 27 618oz) due to improved availability from
third parties.

The total operating costs at Zondereinde were R3.7 billion (F2016: R3.5 billion), an increase of 7.3%. The increase in the unit cash
cost equivalent per refined platinum oz was contained to 7.6% from R19 409 to R20 890, a notable achievement given the production
challenges outlined above.

Expansionary capital expenditure for the period of R619.2 million (F2016: R294.3 million), combined with sustaining capital expenditure
of R187.2 million (F2016: R259.8 million), resulted in total capital spend of R806.4 million (F2016: R554.1 million). The F2018
expansionary and sustaining capital expenditure is estimated at R325.7 million and R198.6 million respectively.

Zondereinde's current resource estimate is 84.0 million oz (Moz) (F2016: 84.1Moz) excluding the recently purchased Tumela block
which is expected to increase the mine's resource base by an additional 16.7Moz on the section 102 transfer.

Booysendal

Booysendal North mine recorded three million fatality free shifts. The lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) improved to 0.30
(F2016: 0.44) per 200 000 hours worked. The mechanised mining method continues to be a significant safety differentiator.

Production from the UG2 mine increased 12.2% to 2 326 460 tonnes (F2016: 2 072 958 tonnes) milled at a head grade of 2.8g/t
(F2016: 2.7g/t). The Merensky North mine produced 161 134 tonnes (F2016: 92 645 tonnes) during the year at a head grade of 2.0g/t
(F2016: 1.9g/t).

The total operating costs at Booysendal North increased by 27.5% from R1.5 billion to R2.0 billion. The higher costs are largely
attributable to the higher production volumes from underground. Metal in concentrate produced, plus ore stockpiles increased by 23.6%
to 199 330oz (F2016: 161 300oz).

On a unit basis, the cash cost equivalent per refined platinum oz achieved was R15 747 (F2016: R15 297) representing a 2.9% increase.

Capital expenditure incurred amounted to R773.8 million (F2016: R616.4 million). The key elements of this spend were R120.8 million
spent on the UG2 deepening project, R325.6 million on the Booysendal South project, R202.3 million on the Merensky North decline
and R111.9 million on sustaining capital expenditure.

Management estimates that expansionary and sustaining capital expenditure will amount to R1.2 billion and R108.9 million respectively
in F2018, a total capital spend of R1.3 billion.

MINERAL RESOURCES AND RESERVES

Key points and significant revisions from the previous year
The UG2 and Merensky reserves within the Booysendal North and South mines increased following amendments to the underground
pillar design.

During the 2017 financial year, Northam entered into agreements with Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited and Glencore Operations
South Africa Proprietary Limited regarding the purchase of a portion of the Amandelbult mine and the Eland mine respectively. These
purchases are still subject to regulatory approval and therefore are not yet finalised. Consequently no formal resource or reserve
estimates for these properties have been included in this statement. Indicative estimates of resource content within these properties
were summarised in Northam's interim results presentation for the period ending 31 December 2016. This presentation is available on
the company's website.

Eastern Platinum Proprietary Limited. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval before finalisation, hence the resource and
reserve estimates for this property will be removed from this statement, once all conditions precedent have been met.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Mr JG (John) Smithies was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 1 January 2017.

Mr AR (Alwyn) Martin retired from the board at the conclusion of the annual general meeting on 9 November 2016.

Ms HH (Hester) Hickey replaced Mr Martin as chairman of the audit and risk committee on 9 November 2016.

GOING CONCERN AND PROSPECTS

Mining operations have a finite life and are also dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as well as economic factors
such as commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and low USD dollar metal prices are a concern as the
group is an exporter of PGMs to global markets. Operations continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs (mainly power
and labour) and lower metal prices. Management is focused on cost control and moving the operations down the cost curve in order
to remain profitable.

The board believes that the group has adequate financial resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future and, accordingly,
the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

DIVIDENDS

Given the continuing difficult conditions in the mining industry, and taking into consideration the cash requirements to fund the
development of the group's project pipeline and growth strategy, the board has resolved not to declare a final dividend for the 2017
financial year (30 June 2016: RNil cents per share).

TRADING STATEMENT AND TRADING UPDATE

Shareholders are advised that the group’s loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2017 is estimated to
range between 167.8 cents per share and 196.0 cents per share and the headline loss per share is
estimated to range between 167.3 cents per share and 196.3 cents per share, compared with the loss per
share of 145.3 cents and headline loss per share of 140.9 cents reported for the year ended 30 June 2016.
The aforementioned ranges expressed in percentage terms, are, in respect of a loss per share, an increase
of between 15% and 35% per share and, in respect of headline earnings per share, an increase of 19% and
39% per share.

The anticipated loss is attributable to the higher Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”) preference
share dividends, which are consolidated in the group’s results in terms of the International Financial
Reporting Standards. The Zambezi preference shares accrue dividends at a cumulative variable dividend
of 3.5% over the prime overdraft interest rate in South Africa. Shareholders are reminded that
159 905 453 Northam shares are held for settlement of the Zambezi preference share liability in terms of
the Northam guarantee and that the accrued dividends are consolidated into the Northam results as a
non-cash item for Northam.

Despite difficult economic circumstances during the reporting period, both of the group’s operating
mines, Zondereinde and Booysendal, are expected to record an operating profit. The group’s total
operating profit is estimated to be higher than the previous year, owing to an improved operational
performance and well contained unit costs.

The weighted average number of Northam shares in issue for the year ended 30 June 2017 was
349 875 759 (30 June 2016: 349 875 759 shares).

The information on which this trading statement and trading update is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by the group’s auditors. The audited results for the year ended 30 June 2017 are anticipated
to be published on or about 25 August 2017.

ACQUISITION OF PLATINUM GROUP METALS RECYCLING ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam is pleased to announce that it has entered into binding transaction agreements pursuant
     to which it will acquire platinum group metals (“PGM”) recycling equipment located in
     Pennsylvania, United States of America (“US”) (“PGM Recycling Equipment”), as well as
     immoveable property comprising land and buildings for the PGM Recycling Equipment
     (“Premises”), (collectively, the “Transactions”).

     The aggregate consideration payable by Northam in respect of the Transactions amounts to
     approximately USD10.7 million, to be settled in cash. Closing and settlement of the Transactions
     are envisaged to take place by no later than 1 September 2017.

2.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE

     The PGM Recycling Equipment will be acquired from A-1 Specialized Services Inc., a recycler of
     PGMs from automotive catalysts. The PGM Recycling Equipment comprises, inter alia, multiple
     ceramic catalytic converter processing lines and ancillary equipment, including sampling and
     separation systems, transportation and a materials handling fleet.

     The Premises consist of approximately 30 acres of land as well as buildings measuring
     approximately 301,000 sq.ft used for warehousing, manufacturing and office space. It has direct
     access to excellent surrounding infrastructure, including roads and a direct rail connection.

     The Transactions afford Northam as an integrated primary and secondary producer, the
     opportunity to expand and diversify its business interests into PGM recycling. Northam will be able
     to participate in the growing demand for recycled PGMs from autocatalysts and maintain and
     develop a strategic footprint in North America.

     Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer, said “the Transactions represent a low cost
     entry by Northam into a key segment of the broader PGM market. Northam has secured an
     excellent asset base of strategic future importance.”

3.   CATEGORISATION

     The Transactions fall below the threshold for categorisation in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
     Requirements and this announcement is provided for information purposes only.

NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF NOTEHOLDERS

1. A notice of request for consent (the “Consent Request”) has been delivered by Northam to each
   holder of Notes (the “Noteholders”) issued under Northam’s ZAR2 000 000 000 Domestic Medium
   Term Note Programme (the “Programme”). This is pursuant to the section headed “Terms and
   Conditions of the Notes” (the “Terms and Conditions”) in the Programme Memorandum dated
   3 August 2012 and as amended and restated from time to time, in accordance with Condition 18
   (Notices) of the Terms and Conditions for the purposes of obtaining the Noteholders’ written
   consent to various amendments to the Applicable Pricing Supplements relating to the Notes (the
   “Existing Applicable Pricing Supplements”).

2. Capitalised terms used herein which are not otherwise defined shall bear the meaning ascribed
   thereto in the Terms and Conditions.

3. Northam seeks the Noteholders’ consent in accordance with Condition 19 (Amendment of these
   Conditions) of the Terms and Conditions for the amendment and restatement of the Existing
   Applicable Pricing Supplements and the schedules thereto for the senior unsecured Notes issued
   under stock codes NHM002 and NHM003 (the “Amended and Restated Applicable Pricing
   Supplements”) to remove Khumama Platinum Proprietary Limited (“Khumama”) as a Guarantor
   (the “Proposed Amendment”).

4. Khumama is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northam which was part of Northam’s acquisition of the
   Booysendal Mine in 2008 from Mvelaphanda Resources Limited. Khumama is for all intents and
   purposes a dormant private company. Accordingly, the Proposed Amendment will not adversely
   affect the Guarantee detailed in the Existing Applicable Pricing Supplements. Schedule 3 of the
   Consent Request contains a summarised group structure of Northam, illustrating the position of
   Khumama prior to the Proposed Amendment. Subject to Noteholders consent to the removal of
   Khumama, as a Guarantor, Northam is seeking to place Khumama in voluntary winding-up in
   accordance with Section 80 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (as amended) following the
   unbundling by Khumama of its shares in Booysendal Platinum Proprietary Limited (“Booysendal”)
   to Northam. Booysendal will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Northam and a Guarantor
   pursuant to the Amended and Restated Applicable Pricing Supplements. The Proposed
   Amendment will simplify Northam’s group structure and remove administration costs associated
   with Khumama going forward.

5. The Noteholders are requested to provide their consent to the Proposed Amendment by completing
   the Consent Notice (annexed to the Consent Request and which is also available on request from
   the Transfer Agent, Nedbank Limited (acting through its Corporate and Investment Banking
   division). Noteholders are also required to deliver the same to the registered office of the relevant
   CSD Participant that provided the Noteholder with the Consent Notice, and providing a copy thereof
   to Nedbank Limited (acting through its Corporate and Investment Banking division) and the Issuer
   by no later than 17h00 on 6 July 2017 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Consent
   Notice. The relevant CSD Participant will then notify Strate Proprietary Limited of the total number
   of Consent Notices received for the Proposed Amendment.

6. The changes marked-up against the Existing Applicable Pricing Supplements are attached to the
   Consent Request and are available on the Issuer’s website at http://www.northam.co.za.

7. Drafts in substantially agreed form of the Amended and Restated Applicable Pricing Supplements

RESULTS COMMENTARY

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Statement of comprehensive income
Sales revenue generated by the group increased 7.9% to R3.5 billion (H1 F2016: R3.2 billion) compared to the
previous period despite lower sales volumes. The higher revenue reflected a 19.1% increase in the total revenue
per platinum oz sold of R25 720/oz (H1 F2016 R21 594/oz) aided by a 3.2% weaker average ZAR/USD exchange
rate of R13.99/USD (H1 F2016: R13.55/USD).

Sales volumes declined by 9.8% to 223 705 oz for the current period (H1 F2016: 248 075 oz) reflecting metallurgical
constraints and an 18-day outage resulting from a mill bearing failure on the UG2 concentrator at Zondereinde.

Cost of sales were unchanged at R3.1 billion despite higher operating costs. Operating costs increased by 16.8% to
R2.8 billion (H1 F2016: R2.4 billion). This reflected the impact of higher labour and power costs as well as greater
production volumes from the Booysendal North mine. Depreciation and associated write-offs were higher and
the cost of purchased concentrate dropped in line with lower third party deliveries. Higher depreciation costs are
driven by the higher units of production at the Booysendal North mine which increased metal production volumes
by 35.4%.

The positive change in metal inventories reflects the increase in stockpiles within the group as ore production
exceeds current milling and smelting capacity. The higher group revenue with an unchanged cost of sales resulted
in an operating profit of R352.0 million (H1 F2016: R93.4 million), at an operating margin of 10.2% (H1 F2016: 2.9%).

Investment revenues dropped by 34.3% to R107.4 million (H1 F2016: R163.6 million), reflecting the lower average
cash balances during the current period as cash has been deployed for expansion of current production capacity.
Sundry income was down 67.9% largely as a result of the once off receipt from a cancelled insurance contingency
policy and an insurance refund in the comparable period.

The increase in finance charges reflects the costs associated with the two domestic medium-term notes of
R175.0 million and R250.0 million reported at the end of F2016. Included in sundry expenditure, which is up
18.5%, is a net foreign currency loss compared to a net gain in the previous period. The cumulative non-cash
preference share dividends increased by 12.2% to R482.8 million (H1 F2016: R430.4 million), net of capitalised
interest of R17.4 million, due to the compounding nature of the preference share liability.

Although group operating profits were higher at R352.0 million (H1 F2016: R93.4 million), the tax charge was
similar owing to the utilisation of unredeemed capital expenditure against increased mining income and the
reduction of taxable non-mining income.

Cash flows
Abnormally high inventory levels and prepayments drove working capital requirements, which in turn led to a
decline of 68.4% in operating cash flows to R216.4 million (H1 F2016: R684.4 million). The high inventory levels
accounted for in working capital reflect the higher mining production of the group relative to its current metallurgical
capacity, which will be released once the new furnace is commissioned. Working capital movement includes the
prepayment of R157.9 million relating to the construction of the aerial rope conveyor for ore transportation at the
Booysendal South mine.

The cash utilised in investing activities is 51.1% up at R777.9 million (H1 F2016: R515.1 million) owing to the
group's current intensive capital expenditure programme.

Cash flows utilised in financing activities amounting to R285.6 million, decreased 79.6% from the previous
period's R1.4 billion, due to the relatively lower levels of financing-related repayments in the current period. In the
previous period, the repayment of the R1.4 billion domestic medium-term note was recorded. In the current period,
Northam acquired Zambezi preference shares to the value of R208.7 million.

OPERATIONS
Zondereinde
Management and employees of Zondereinde are commended for achieving the milestone of 6 million fatality-free
shifts during the current period. The lost time injury incident rate (LTIIR) improved to 1.59 injuries per 200 000
hours worked (F2016: 1.92)

Management however regrets to report that soon after the end of this reporting period, Mr Alexandre Macave,
a locomotive operator, was fatally injured in an underground rail accident on Friday, 6 January 2017. Mr Macave,
was a Mozambican citizen aged 54, with 25 years' experience. The board and management express their sincere
condolences to the family and colleagues of Mr Macave.

Zondereinde's production was adversely affected by measures taken to reorganise the workforce, along with an
18-day outage of the UG2 milling circuit owing to a mill bearing failure. The workforce reorganisation was a
result of the discharge of 357 employees following labour disruptions in June 2016. In spite of the fewer mining
crews, centare mining targets were met, but tonnage volumes hoisted were lower, as resources were moved from
vamping to stoping teams. UG2 tonnages mined were lower by 12.7% at 610 973 tonnes (H1 F2016: 699 775
tonnes). The Merensky tonnage mined decreased by 2.2% to 512 656 tonnes (H1 F2016: 524 211 tonnes) at a
head grade of 5.8g/t. The decline in total tonnages was 8.2% at 1 123 629 tonnes (H1 F2016: 1 223 986 tonnes)
with a combined head grade of 4.9g/t.

The mining teams are expected to be back at full complement by the end of March 2017. Merensky ore remains
constrained for now, but the ore mix will gradually be modified to accommodate the more dominant Merensky reef
in the additional ground acquired from Anglo Platinum, moving to a Merensky:UG2 ratio of 55:45. This should be
achievable within a 24 month period, post the section 102 approvals.

Total operating costs at Zondereinde for the period were R1.8 billion (H1 F2016: R1.7 billion), a 7.0% increase.
The combination of higher costs and lower production translated into a 12.7% increase in unit cash costs per
equivalent refined platinum ounce to R19 980 (H1 F2016: R17 730 per platinum ounce).

The production of equivalent refined metal declined by 7.0% to 144 292 oz (H1 F2016: 155 063 oz) owing to the
disruptions mentioned above. Third party concentrate added 14 179 oz to on-mine production.

Capital expenditure during the current period was R425.0 million (H1 F2016: R161.9 million). Expansionary project
expenditure accounted for R347.2 million while sustaining expenditure was R77.8 million. The project expenditure
pertained primarily to the construction of the new 20MW furnace and drying plant. Expansion and sustaining
capital expenditure for the remainder of F2017 is estimated at R160.7 million and R137.3 million respectively.

Zondereinde's current total resource estimate is 84.0 million oz (Moz) (F2016: 84.1Moz) excluding the recent
purchase of resources. Mineral resources purchased from the neighbouring Tumela mine are expected to increase
this resource base by 16.7Moz on completion of the transaction.

Booysendal
Booysendal's outstanding safety run continued, with an improvement in the lost time injury rate per 200 000 hours
worked to 0.14 (F 2016: 0.44). The mechanised mining method remains a significant safety differentiator.

The Merensky North mine at Booysendal has been brought into production and is producing at a rate of
25 000 tonnes per month. Production has been stockpiled and 133 952 tonnes (H1 F2016: 42 809 tonnes),
at a head grade of 2.0g/t was mined during the period. The head grade at steady state will be around 2.5g/t.
Production from the UG2 mine increased by 31.4% with 1 190 722 tonnes mined (H1 F2016: 906 000 tonnes)
at a head grade of 2.7g/t. The combined tonnage mined was 1 324 674 tonnes (H1 F2016: 948 809 tonnes) at a
head grade of 2.7g/t.

Chrome concentrate produced for the current period was 138 635 tonnes (H1 F2016: 95 166 tonnes), a 45.7%
increase, in line with the higher volume of UG2 ore mined.

Booysendal's total operating costs rose 42.2% to R948.8 million (H1 F2016: R667.4 million). This is in direct
correlation with the higher production volumes from Booysendal, at 100 021 oz (H1 F 2016: 73 882 oz).

The cash cost per equivalent 3PGM+Au ounce in concentrate was R9 218 (H1 F2016: R9 075) a 1.6% increase
compared to the previous period. This equates to a cash cost per platinum ounce of R15 271/oz (H1 F2016: R14 854/oz).

Capital expenditure was R330.0 million for the period (H1 F2016: R322.1 million) of which R277.5 million was
project expenditure and R52.5 million sustaining expenditure. In addition, R157.9 million was prepaid for the
construction of the aerial rope conveyor system at Booysendal South. The Booysendal estimated expansionary and
sustaining capital expenditure for the rest of F2017 will be R568.5 million and R34.7 million respectively.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Mr JG (John) Smithies was appointed as an independent non-executive director, effective 1 January 2017 as
announced on 10 November 2016.

Mr AR (Alwyn) Martin retired from the board of directors, at the conclusion of the annual general meeting,
held on 9 November 2016. Ms HH (Hester) Hickey has replaced Mr Martin as chairman of the audit and risk
committee.

GOING CONCERN AND PROSPECTS
Mining operations have a finite life and are dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as well as
economic factors such as commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and low US dollar
metal prices are a concern as the group is an exporter of PGMs to global markets. Operations continue to be under
pressure due to increasing input costs (mainly power and labour) and lower metal prices.

The board believes that the group has adequate financial resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future
and, accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The group is in the process of evaluating compliance in terms of King IV and will update the checklist available on
the Northam website www.northam.co.za in due course.

DIVIDENDS
Given the continuing difficult conditions in the mining industry, and taking into consideration the cash requirements
for the development of the group's project pipeline and acquisition of platinum assets, the board has resolved not
to declare an interim dividend for H1 F2017 (H1 F2016: Rnil cents per share).

NORTHAM ACQUIRES THE ELAND PLATINUM MINE AND CONCLUDES A CHROME MARKETING AGREEMENT

 1.   INTRODUCTION

      Northam is pleased to announce that it has entered into the following agreements:
      -  an agreement with Glencore Operations South Africa (Pty) Ltd (“GOSA”) to purchase the
         Eland Platinum mine (“Eland” or the “mine”) for a cash consideration of R175 million (“Eland
         transaction”); and
      -  a long-term chrome marketing agreement with Glencore International AG (“Glencore”) to
         exclusively market and sell chrome produced at Northam’s Zondereinde and Booysendal
         operations.

      More on Eland
      Eland is located on the south-eastern limit of the western limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex. It
      comprises two mining rights and contains a resource estimated at 21.3 Moz 4E with an average in
      situ 4E grade of 4.4 g/t (source: Glencore resource and reserve statement 2016).

      The mine was placed on care and maintenance in September 2015. In terms of the Eland
      transaction and for a purchase price of R175 million in cash, Northam will acquire all Eland’s
      assets, including:
      -  Eland’s two mining rights;
      -  surface and underground infrastructure including a concentrator with a nameplate capacity of
         250ktpm; a chrome spiral recovery plant; a tailings storage facility with a capacity of 100
         million tonnes; two decline systems equipped to 1.3km; and surface support infrastructure
         designed for a 250ktpm operation;
      -  immovable property; and
      -  a mining fleet in excess of 100 vehicles which includes low profile mechanised mining
         equipment.

     The transaction includes the takeover of Eland’s environmental obligations and responsibilities.
     The purchase consideration will be payable on the fulfilment of all the conditions precedent.
     Northam will be granted access to Eland from the signature date of the agreement to the fulfilment
     of the conditions precedent in order to facilitate a smooth transfer of ownership. Northam will
     reimburse GOSA for care and maintenance costs, amounting to approximately R30 million per
     annum, during this period.

     Commenting on the transaction today, Northam chief executive Paul Dunne said, “the Eland
     transaction provides Northam with a medium-term option over a large, shallow resource with fully
     developed, world-class surface infrastructure. Northam will also be acquiring a sizeable mining
     fleet, a portion of which will be utilised at the Booysendal South operation.

     The chrome marketing agreement establishes a long-term relationship between Northam and
     Glencore, a leading global chrome trader, which will contribute to maximising Northam’s chrome
     revenue.”

2.   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     The Eland transaction is subject to, inter alia, the following conditions precedent:
     -   consent being granted by the Minister of Mineral Resources in terms of section 11 of the
         Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, No. 28 of 2002;
     -   Northam entering into a chrome offtake agreement with GOSA or its affiliates in respect of all
         chrome produced at Eland; and
     -   cancellation of certain existing contractual arrangements between Eland and certain third
         parties, subject to Northam’s satisfaction.

3.   CATEGORISATION

     The Eland transaction falls below the threshold for categorisation in terms of the JSE Limited
     Listings Requirements and this announcement is provided for information purposes only.

Northam shareholders (“shareholders”) are advised that the company has made awards in
accordance with the terms of the Northam Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). These include the
award of conditional shares relating to Northam’s BEE transaction (“BEE SIP Awards”),
which awards were specifically approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting
held on 9 November 2016. The BEE SIP Awards have been carved out of the existing total
SIP allocation limit previously approved by shareholders on 5 November 2014, therefore the
total SIP allocation limit has not been increased as a result of the BEE SIP Awards.

NORTHAM ACQUIRES ZAMBEZI PLATINUM PREFERENCE SHARES



1.   INTRODUCTION

     Northam hereby advises shareholders of the acquisition of 4 043 018 preference shares (preference
     shares) in Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (Zambezi) from Coronation Asset Management Proprietary
     Limited acting as investment manager on behalf of its clients (Coronation), (acquisition).

     The acquisition was effected on 31 October 2016 at R49.468 per preference share, for a total cash
     value of R200 million, and constitutes approximately 2.5% of the total preference shares in issue.

     The preference shares were issued by Zambezi in 2015 in terms of Northam’s black economic
     empowerment transaction (Northam BEE transaction), which raised Northam’s empowerment equity
     levels to 31.4%.

     Northam chief executive Paul Dunne said today:

     “The preference shares offer an attractive yield whilst acting as a partial hedge against any potential
     financial liability which could arise in respect of the guarantee that Northam provided to the holders of
     preference shares in terms of the Northam BEE transaction.”


2.   RATIONALE

     Northam considers the preference shares to be a high-yield instrument with a credit risk profile that
     matches that of Northam. Accordingly, an investment in the preference shares provides the following
     benefits:

     -    the preference shares generate a high return without the introduction of significant additional third
          party risk for Northam;
     -    Northam may access future liquidity through the disposal of the preference shares in the future;
     -    should Zambezi elect to redeem the preference shares using Northam ordinary shares, Northam
          will benefit from the discount that shall be applied to the Northam ordinary shares for purposes
          of the redemption calculations;
     -    the acquisition partially hedges Northam against the potential future liability which could become
          payable pursuant to the guarantee provided by Northam to preference shareholders in respect
          of the preference shares (guarantee); and
     -    the net finance charges and liability included in Northam’s consolidated financial statements in
          relation to the preference shares will be reduced when setting off these preference shares held
          as an asset.


3.   PURCHASE CONSIDERATION

     The price paid of R49.468 per preference share was calculated as the redemption value of a
     preference share as at 31 October 2016, being an amount equal to the issue price of R41.00 plus the
     accrued dividends at that date. The aggregate value of the acquisition was R200 million and was
     funded from Northam’s cash reserves.


4.   DETAILS OF ZAMBEZI AND THE PREFERENCE SHARES

     Zambezi was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle for purposes of facilitating the Northam BEE
     transaction, the primary purpose of which is to (i) hold the Northam ordinary shares it acquired as part
     of the Northam BEE transaction (BEE shares) for the benefit of historically disadvantaged South
     African participants and (ii) issue the preference shares. Zambezi is a ring-fenced entity and does not
     conduct any operational business activities, with its only investment being the BEE shares.

     The preference shares, which were issued at R41.00 per share, are cumulative, redeemable
     preference shares which accrue dividends daily at an effective rate equal to the prime interest rate
     plus 3.5% compounded annually and are redeemable on 18 May 2025. The preference shares are
     secured by the BEE shares held by Zambezi and payments to their holders are guaranteed by
     Northam.

     The preference shares may be redeemed, at Zambezi’s election, in cash and / or through the
     distribution of the BEE shares held by Zambezi in Northam. In the event that the preference shares
     are redeemed through the distribution of the BEE shares, the settlement value of the BEE shares shall
     be calculated at the 30 day volume weighted average price of a Northam ordinary share, as at the
     date preceding the settlement date, less 10%.

     If payment under the guarantee is required, Northam may, at its election, settle the associated liability
     using cash and / or new Northam ordinary shares.


5.   SMALL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION AND FAIRNESS OPINION

     Coronation is deemed to be a material shareholder of Northam in that it is able to exercise voting
     control on behalf of its clients over shares constituting an approximate 29.68% interest in Northam,
     and is therefore considered a related party in terms of paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Limited Listings
     Requirements (Listings Requirements). Accordingly, the acquisition is classified as a small related
     party transaction in terms of paragraph 10.7 of the Listings Requirements.

     The acquisition is not subject to shareholder approval, provided an independent professional expert
     has confirmed that the terms of the acquisition are fair as far as Northam’s shareholders are
     concerned. Northam appointed KPMG Services Proprietary Limited as an independent expert to
     provide an opinion on the fairness of the acquisition.

     In accordance with paragraph 10.7(b) of the Listings Requirements, and the fairness opinion, the
     board hereby confirms its opinion on the fairness of the acquisition for Northam shareholders. A copy
     of the fairness opinion is available for inspection at Northam’s registered office, being Building 4, 1st
     Floor, Maxwell Office Park, Magwa Crescent West, Waterfall City, Jukskei View, for a period of 28
     days from the date of this announcement.

NORTHAM’S SHORT AND LONG TERM CREDIT RATINGS RE-AFFIRMED AND OUTLOOK RAISED


Northam wishes to advise shareholders that the credit rating agency, Global Credit Rating Co.
(“GCR”), has reaffirmed Northam’s short term credit rating at A1-(ZA) and the company’s long term
rating of BBB+(ZA) with the Outlook raised from Stable to Positive.

Although the GCR view on resource corporates is a Negative Outlook, there is sufficient comfort in
the developments at Northam for the panel to accord a Positive Outlook.

GCR has published a detailed credit rating report (available from GCR at http://globalratings.net)
detailing the key criteria which form the basis for its rating, these include:

    -   The impact of Northam’s fully funded R6.6 billion black economic empowerment
        transaction (“BEE Transaction”), which secured Northam’s status as a fully-empowered
        mining company, for at least 10 years and incorporated a cash injection of R4.6 billion,
        which will be used to fund the expansion of platinum group metal (“PGM”) output to
        800,000 oz annually in six years.
    -   Further diversification into mechanised and inherently lower cost ore bodies which secure
        stronger margins and return on capital, providing greater operational and financial
        flexibility.
    -   The timely delivery of steady-state production at Booysendal North and the strategic
        acquisition of Booysendal South (formerly Everest Mine).
    -   The 7% increase in PGM sales volumes which has sustained Northam’s revenue above R6
        billion in the financial year ended 30 June 2016, despite a 6% fall in the ZAR basket price
        from the prior year.
    -   The marginal year-on-year increase in normalised headline earnings to R444.1 million in
        the financial year ended 30 June 2016, after removing the effect of the preference
        dividends accrued and capital items related to the BEE Transaction.
    -   Operations remained cash generative for the year ended 30 June 2016, which coupled with
        R265 million in interest income, nearly trebled operating cash flow.
    -   Northam’s operations are expected to be net ungeared in the medium term assuming no
        significant decrease in PGM prices.
    -   Following the issue of 3 and 5 year domestic medium term notes, which raised
        R425 million in aggregate, Northam has sound debt service ratios.

NORTHAM ACQUIRES CONTIGUOUS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT ZONDEREINDE MINE FROM ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM LIMITED



 1.   INTRODUCTION


      Northam is pleased to announce that it has entered into agreements with Rustenburg Platinum
      Mines Limited (“RPM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American Platinum Limited, on
      10 October 2016, whereby Northam will:


          a) acquire a portion of the Amandelbult mining right contiguous with the north western
             boundary of Northam’s Zondereinde mine, including all of RPM’s rights and obligations
             thereto (“Acquired Resource”), for a cash consideration of R1 billion; and

          b) acquire a portion of the Elandsfontein 386 KQ farm overlying part of the Acquired
             Resource, in exchange for a portion of the Zondereinde mining right, located on the north
             western corner of the Zondereinde mining right including all of Northam’s rights and
             obligations thereto (“Sold Resource”), (collectively the “Transaction”).


      Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer, said “the Transaction adds flexibility and
      optionality to the mining operations at Zondereinde. The Acquired Resource is of high quality, is
      well understood by Northam and allows us to better leverage the existing Zondereinde
      infrastructure. The additional resource also enables Northam to continue mining higher grade
      Merensky ore for a longer period, with relatively low incremental capital expenditure. Northam is
      confident that the Transaction will add sustainable shareholder value, unlocking a large resource in
      a capital efficient manner. The Transaction positions Zondereinde on a similar long-term footing as
      our Booysendal operation.”


 2.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION


      Acquired Resource


      The Acquired Resource is contiguous with the north western boundary of Zondereinde. Its
      resource characteristics and properties are similar to those of the Zondereinde orebody lying to the
      west of Zondereinde mine shaft. A short lead time and limited capital expenditure is required to
      access the Acquired Resource from Zondereinde’s existing infrastructure.

      It extends on dip from approximately 1 400 metres below surface, corresponding to the
      Zondereinde 3 level, to the deepest extent of planned mining on 18 level. Laterally, it extends for
      approximately 3.6 kilometres.


     Sold Resource


     The Sold Resource is located in the north western corner of the Zondereinde mining right. This
     area has never been mined and did not form part of the Zondereinde life of mine (“LOM”) plan, as
     it is above the minimum depth required for effective use of hydro-powered mining equipment.


3.   RATIONALE


     The acquisition of the Acquired Resource provides Northam with numerous benefits, such as it:


        -    Extends the Zondereinde economic LOM to beyond 30 years.
        -    Provides extensive mining flexibility associated with a high quality resource that is well
             understood by Northam.
        -    Provides early access to additional higher grade Merensky and UG2 reef on 10 and
             ultimately 16 mining levels.
        -    Reduces the overall average mining depth of the Zondereinde mine, with associated
             potential savings.
        -    Provides long-term optionality and reduces Zondereinde’s operational risk profile.


4.   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT


     The Transaction is subject to, inter alia, the consent by the Minister of Mineral Resources in terms
     of section 102 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, No. 28 of 2002.


5.   CATEGORISATION


     The Transaction falls below the threshold for categorisation in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
     Requirements and is provided for information purposes only.

economic outlook and low US dollar metal prices are a concern as Northam is an exporter of PGMs
to global markets. Operations continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs (mainly
power and labour) and lower metal prices.   

The ZAR/USD exchange rate, however, cushions the effects of lower metal prices. Management has
implemented thorough cost-cutting initiatives. This effort, along with the group's strong statement of
financial position and current operational cash flows has informed the opinion of management that
the group remains a going concern.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Subsequent to year-end, the group renegotiated a five-year R1.5 billion revolving credit facility with
Nedbank Limited to replace the existing R1.0 billion facility which will mature in November 2016.
The group further increased its investment in SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited by 10% and now
holds a total of 30%. Apart from these events there have been no other events subsequent to the
year end which require additional disclosure or adjustment to the financial results.

RESULTS COMMENTARY

INTRODUCTION
Northam's production of equivalent refined metal from own operations increased by 15.7% to
13 591kg/436 960oz during the year under review. This followed a solid operating performance
at Zondereinde and Booysendal reaching steady-state production. The group's financial results,
however, were negatively impacted by lower ZAR basket prices. In line with the group strategy to
diversify into shallow mechanisable operations the Board approved the development of the initial
phase of the Booysendal South project in June 2016. This project includes the development of two
UG2 mining modules and a Merensky mining module which will contribute an additional 240 000oz
per annum of platinum group metals to the group's production profile.

The construction of the new 20MW furnace at the Zondereinde mining complex is progressing well.
In addition to adding smelter capacity, it will also reduce operational risk. The total cost of the project
is anticipated to be R750.0 million and is expected to be commissioned by the end of the 2017
calendar year. The expansion work follows on the extension of Northam's strategic partnership with
Heraeus Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG (Heraeus) and Heraeus South Africa Proprietary Limited in
terms of which Heraeus has agreed to contribute s20.0 million to the construction of the furnace.
The first s10.0 million was received in June 2016. The agreement also provides for the renewal of
the current refining arrangements and guarantees a supply of refined metal to Heraeus.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Revenue generated from sales increased by 1.0% to R6.1 billion (FY2015: R6.0 billion), reflecting
the lower prices received offset by higher sales volumes. Metal sold increased by 7.0% to
452 393 ounces 3PGE+Au (FY2015: 422 653 ounces), with the ZAR basket price received decreasing
by 6.1%.

The lower basket price achieved of R382 979/kg (FY2015: R407 864/kg) reflects a 25.0% decline
in the USD basket price from USD1 108/oz to USD831/oz offset by a weaker ZAR against the USD,
which fell from R11.45/USD the previous year to an average of R14.33/USD for the financial year.

From 1 June 2015, concentrate produced from Booysendal has been sold to Zondereinde at 88% of
the market value. On a group basis, revenue is generated by Zondereinde as all PGM sales between
Booysendal and Zondereinde are eliminated on consolidation. Previously, Booysendal sold its final
product directly to third party customers.

Cost of sales increased by 5.0% to R5.7 billion (FY2015: R5.4 billion). The higher cost of sales was as
a result of a 7.0% increase in volumes sold. Group operating costs, were up 15.3% to R5.0 billion
(FY2015: R4.3 billion) on the back of a 15.7% increase in metals produced from own operations.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 18.7% to R403.5 million (FY2015: R339.9 million) due
to the increased production, as depreciation and amortisation is calculated on a unit of production
basis. The value of concentrates purchased from external parties fell by 41.8% to R350.5 million
(FY2015: R602.4 million) largely due to lower deliveries from the seller.

Operating profit was negatively impacted by the lower basket price and decreased by 35.7% to
R383.3 million (FY2015: R595.8 million). Zondereinde generated an operating profit of R248.1 million
(FY2015: R398.4 million) and Booysendal generated an operating profit of R176.0 million
(FY2015: R195.2 million).

Share of earnings from associates and joint ventures decreased by 212.1% to a loss of R32.3 million
(FY2015: profit of R28.8 million). In the current year, Northam's share in the Pandora joint venture's
losses amounted to R12.6 million (FY2015: loss of R10.7 million) and its share of losses in Trans
Hex Group Limited amounted to R20.0 million (FY2015: profit of R39.5 million). The Pandora joint
venture also required a number of cash injections, with the group's share of cash calls amounting
to R10.6 million (FY2015: R9.7 million) with further cash calls expected in the new financial year.
Management is reviewing its options with regard to Northam's continued participation in the
Pandora joint venture.

During the year, the 20.3% shareholding in Trans Hex Group Limited was sold for R81.8 million
and a loss of R21.0 million was recognised on the sales transaction. In addition, Northam acquired
a 20% share in SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited for R10.0 million effective 29 February 2016.
This investment is recognised as an associate and has consequently been equity accounted for in the
group results. SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited is a company providing security services to both the
Zondereinde and Booysendal mines. Northam's share of SSG Holdings Proprietary Limited's profits for
the four months ended 30 June 2016 amounted to R0.4 million.

Investment revenue increased by 268.2% to R265.3 million (FY2015: R72.0 million) due to interest
earned on higher cash balances as well as interest received on an insurance contingency policy which
generated investment revenue of R50.0 million.

Finance charges decreased by 72.7% to R39.6 million (FY2015: R145.2 million). The Domestic
Medium Term Debt Notes (DMTN) of R1.4 billion were repaid on 3 September 2015, resulting in a
decrease in the finance costs in the current year. The new DMTN were issued during May and June
2016, resulting in an interest accrual of R4.8 million on these new notes plus R23.5 million worth of
interest paid on the old DMTN repaid in September 2015, compared to R132.9 million accrued for in
the prior year.

A 32.6% decrease to R180.9 million (FY2015: R268.3 million) was recorded in sundry income during
the year. An amount of R59.6 million was received as a result of the cancellation of an insurance
contingency policy and the refund of the original cash contribution plus interest. In the corresponding
period, an insurance refund of R183.8 million was received relating to the No. 1 shaft incident which
was then included in sundry income. Sundry income during the current year was also impacted by
the volatility of the ZAR as currency translation variances increased from R6.2 million during 2015 to
R26.2 million for the current year. Also included in sundry income is the write back of the Trans Hex
Group Limited impairment of R34.1 million previously accounted for in sundry expenditure.

Sundry expenditure decreased by 94.2% from R1 587.3 million in the previous year to R92.1 million.
Included in sundry expenditure in the prior year were once-off lock in fees paid to the BEE
participants amounting to R242.4 million, a once-off equity settled share based payment charge
of R874.4 million also relating to the Zambezi BEE transaction as well as corporate action costs of
R172.6 million. Also included in sundry expenditure in the prior year were the write down of non-
core assets of R261.5 million regarding the Pandora joint venture, Trans Hex Group Limited and
the Dwaalkop investment. During the current year, sundry expenditure includes an impairment of
R20.5 million relating to the Pandora Joint venture. Furthermore, in FY2016, care and maintenance
costs of R25.1 million (FY2015: R9.7 million) were incurred on the Everest plant acquired from
Aquarius Platinum (South Africa) Proprietary Limited as well as a R21.0 million loss made on the sale
of the Trans Hex Group Limited shares.

In terms of the May 2015 BEE transaction, the Zambezi preference shares accrue a cumulative
variable dividend at the South African prime interest rate plus 3.5% per annum. The accrued
dividend is recognised as a finance charge in profit or loss. The finance costs associated with the
preference shares for the current year amounted to R918.8 million (FY2015: R100.8 million) and are
consolidated into the accounts of Northam in terms of IFRS, together with the amortisation fees paid
over the 10 year lock in period.

The rise in the taxation charge compared to the previous year largely consists of non-mining tax of
R140.8 million accrued mainly on interest earned from third parties. Deferred tax was raised on all
temporary differences resulting in a tax charge of R96.1 million.

Cash flow movements
Cash flows generated from operating activities increased to R839.1 million (FY2015 R341.0 million),
largely as a result of the improved production results in comparison to the previous year.

Cash flows utilised in investing activities increased from R1 101.5 million in FY2015 to R1 126.8 million
during the current year. The movement relates primarily to the increase in expansionary capital,
relating largely to the R291.6 million incurred on the new 20MW furnace at Zondereinde,
R35.6 million spent on the furnace refractory lining for the existing furnace, R31.7 million spent on
co-processing (converting the Merensky concentrator to accommodate UG2 ore at Zondereinde),
R132.7 million spent on the deepening project at Zondereinde, R157.1 million on the Merensky
project at Booysendal, R55.2 million on the acquisition of the Everest mineral resource and costs
relating to Booysendal South and finally R178.0 million spent on the UG2 phase 1 mine and deepening
project at Booysendal.

Cash flows utilised from financing expenditure amounted to R745.4 million compared to an inflow of
R4 232.6 million in the prior year. The change relates to the repayment of the DMTN of R1.4 billion
during September 2015 as well as R4.6 billion generated from the issue of shares relating to the BEE
transaction in the prior year.

Excluding the repayment and issue of the new DMTN, the Northam group utilised cash to the value
of R82.4 million for the year.

OPERATIONS
Zondereinde
Zondereinde recorded five million fatality free shifts during the year, a commendable performance by
both employees and management at any operation, and particularly at a deep-level mine. The lost
time injury incidence rate (LTIIR) increased to 1.92 (FY2015: 1.31).

Merensky reef tonnes milled were 815 167 tonnes (FY2015: 795 884 tonnes) at a head grade of
5.9g/t, whilst the UG2 reef contributed 1 205 258 tonnes (FY2015: 1 064 499 tonnes) at a head
grade of 4.2g/t. The combined head grade for the year was 4.9g/t (FY2015 4.9g/t) illustrating the
impact of the higher UG2 contribution.

The overall operational performance of the Zondereinde mine was good. Mining flexibility on
the Merensky reef remains constrained owing to challenging geological conditions. With the
modifications to the processing plant, higher proportions of UG2 reef can be mined and processed
and therefore the targeted UG2:Merensky mining ratio has been adjusted to 60:40.

Production of equivalent refined metal from own operations increased by 10.6% to 8 795kg/
282 765oz (FY2015: 7 950kg/255 598oz). The quantities of purchased concentrates from external
parties decreased by 41.7% from 1 474kg received during 2015 to only 859kg received in the
current year.

Zondereinde's total operating costs were R3 464.4 million (FY2015: R3 147.0 million) representing
an increase of 10.1% based on higher total production of equivalent refined metal from own
operations. This resulted in an overall 1.0% decrease in the unit cash cost per equivalent refined
3PGE + Au/kg from R378 737/kg to R374 846/kg in the current year, demonstrating tight cost
control.

During the year, capital expenditure to the value of R554.1 million (FY2015: R303.2 million)
was incurred, relating mainly to the construction of the new 20MW furnace (R291.6 million),
R132.7 million spent on the deepening project and R127.2 million spent on other sustaining capital
expenditure. Management estimates that expansionary and sustaining capital expenditure will be
R379.1 million and R303.6 million respectively in FY2017.

Zondereinde's total resource estimate has increased to 84.1Moz (FY2015: 81.1Moz) with 11.7Moz
(FY2015: 10.6Moz) in the reserve category giving a life of mine of in excess of 20 years.

Booysendal
The Booysendal mine recorded two million fatality free shifts during the year. The LTIIR was
0.44 (FY2015: 0.54).

The mechanised mining method continues to be a significant safety differentiator. This is one of the
reasons why management believes the growth of the group should favour shallower, mechanisable
operations.

During the year the Booysendal North UG2 mine achieved its steady state run rate of 160 000oz
per annum. A total of 2 072 958 tonnes were milled at a head grade of 2.7g/t compared to
1 786 375 tonnes at a head grade of 2.6g/t in 2015.

The development of the Merensky North mine produced 92 645 tonnes during the year at a head
grade of 1.9g/t, with capital expenditure of R157.1 million spent during the current year on this project.

The total operating costs at Booysendal increased from R1 192.2 million to R1 541.0 million. The
increase of 29.3% can be attributable to the increase in metals in concentrate produced which
increased by 31.7% to 5 017kg/161 300oz (FY2015: 3 809kg/122 462oz).

The cash cost per equivalent 3PGE + Au kg in concentrate was R298 500/kg, a 1.4% decrease from the
prior year's unit cost of R302 695/kg.

Capital expenditure incurred amounted to R616.4 million (FY2015: R798.8 million) which related to
R55.2 million on the acquisition of the Everest mineral resource, R178.0 million spent on the UG2
phase 1 mine and deepening project, employee accommodation of R14.3 million, R89.1 million on sustaining
capital expenditure at the UG2 North mine and R63.5 million on the Booysendal South feasibility study.

Management estimates that expansionary and sustaining capital expenditure will be R527.0 million
and R86.9 million respectively in FY2017.

Notes to the mineral resource and reserve statement
There has been a reassignment of UG2 and Merensky resources at the Booysendal South mine. A Merensky and
UG2 reserve has been estimated for the Booysendal South mine. This follows the completion of a mining feasibility
study of both UG2 and Merensky reefs in portions of the Booysendal South area.

The UG2 resource and reserve contained within the Everest mining right has been incorporated, into the
Booysendal estimate. This follows the transfer of the Everest mining right to Booysendal Platinum Proprietary
Limited in October 2015.

The UG2 resource and reserve estimate at Zondereinde mine has increased. This is due to a decrease in geological
loss ascribed to potholing, and follows an extensive re-assessment of historical pothole losses and exploration data.


CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Mr R Havenstein replaced Mr AR Martin as lead independent director on 18 August 2015.
Mr KB Mosehla was appointed a non-executive director on 19 August 2015.
Mr ME Beckett retired as an independent director on 11 November 2015.
Ms HH Hickey and Mr TI Mvusi's appointments as independent directors, effective 1 January
2016, were announced on 11 December 2015. Ms Hickey is also a member of the audit and risk
committee.

PROSPECTS*
The global economic outlook remains uncertain resulting in volatile metal markets and exchange
rates. The group's financial performance will depend on achieving higher metal sales prices and
a stable operating performance. Cost saving and productivity improvement initiatives are in place
at both Zondereinde and Booysendal. Management is confident that the group's strong financial
position, prudent financial controls and the development of shallow, mechanisable operations at
Booysendal will place the group in a position to take advantage of improved market conditions
going forward.
* Information in this section has not been reviewed by the group's auditors.


DIVIDENDS
In view of the current challenging economic environment facing the platinum mining sector and
taking into consideration the cash requirements for the development of the group's project pipeline,
the board has resolved not to declare a dividend for FY2016.

Trading statement

Shareholders are advised that the group’s loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2016 is estimated
to range between 158.60 cents per share and 132.20 cents per share and the headline loss per share
is estimated to range between 152.20 cents per share and 131.90 cents per share, compared with the
loss per share of 264.30 cents and headline loss per share of 202.90 cents reported for the year ended
30 June 2015. The aforementioned range expressed in percentage terms is an increase in earnings per
share of between 40% and 50% and headline earnings per share of between 25% and 35%.

The anticipated loss is attributable to the higher Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (“Zambezi”)
preference share dividends consolidated in the group’s results compared to the previous year. In line
with International Financial Reporting Standards, Zambezi’s results are consolidated into the Northam
group results, as a result of it having effective control over Zambezi. The Zambezi preference shares
accrue dividends at a cumulative variable dividend of 3.5% over the prime overdraft interest rate in
South Africa.

Shareholders are reminded that 159,905,453 Northam shares are held for settlement of the Zambezi
preference share liability and that the accrued dividends consolidated into the Northam results are a
non-cash item for Northam.

The group’s platinum group metal production was substantially higher year on year with both
Zondereinde mine and Booysendal mine recording an operating profit. However, the group’s total
operating profit was between 30% and 40% lower than the previous comparable year owing to a lower
average basket price achieved.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the year ended 30 June 2016 was 349,875,759
(F2015: 391,834,708).

The information contained in this trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
group’s auditors, Ernst & Young Inc.

NORTHAM SECURES NEW R1.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY


Northam is pleased to advise shareholders that it has secured a new R1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility
to replace its existing R1.0 billion revolving credit facility which matures in November 2016.

The new facility further strengthens Northam’s balance sheet capability in support of the group’s key strategic
initiatives, including the development of the Booysendal expansion projects. Together with existing cash
reserves, the new facility provides Northam with increased financial flexibility, ensuring that the group’s growth
initiatives remain fully funded in the medium-term.

The salient terms of the new facility are as follows:

   -   Five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
   -   Facility limit of R1.0 billion for the first 18 months from inception, whereafter the new facility limit
        automatically increases to R1.5 billion for the remainder of the five year period.
   -   Voluntary prepayments and redraws are permitted.
   -   Other terms, conditions and covenants are typical for a facility of this nature.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s Chief Executive Officer, said “the new and increased long-term revolving credit facility,
combined with Northam’s DMTN Programme and the equity raised in our empowerment transaction with Zambezi
Platinum (RF) Limited, gives the company significant long-term balance sheet certainty and flexibility. Northam
is well placed to pursue its strategic growth projects and to implement sound long-term strategies.”

The management of Northam’s Zondereinde mine has urged employees to return to work now that
calm has been restored at the mine.

Underground mining activities were suspended in the immediate aftermath of the death of a
Zondereinde employee in the town of Northam on Sunday 5 June 2016. Another employee was
killed near the mine on Monday morning 6 June in continued disruptions.

In the meantime, talks with all parties to reach a constructive conclusion to the current impasse
continue. Northam chief executive Paul Dunne has called on all parties to act responsibly, saying,
“We urge all parties to exercise leadership following these tragic incidents, in the interests of safety
for all.”

Mine management will assist the authorities in their investigations into the deaths where required,
and is seeking to administer to the needs of the families of the deceased.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: DISPOSAL BY NORTHAM OF ITS 20.3% INTEREST IN TRANS HEX GROUP LIMITED

Shareholders are advised that Northam has disposed of its 20.3% interest in Trans Hex Group Limited
(“Trans Hex”) with effect from 9 May 2016 (“Transaction”) for a total cash consideration of
R81.8 million (“Proceeds”).

The Proceeds equate to a 7.6% premium to the 30 day volume weighted average price of a Trans Hex
share traded on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited (“JSE”) calculated on the day
prior to Northam entering into the Transaction.

Trans Hex is a diamond producer and marketer listed on the JSE. Northam’s minority interest in
Trans Hex originated from its acquisition of Mvelaphanda Resources Limited in June 2011 and was not
considered core or material to Northam’s platinum group metal (“PGM”) business.

Paul Dunne, Northam’s chief executive officer, said:

“The disposal of a non-core asset for cash provides additional funding for Northam to pursue its growth
strategy in a focused PGM portfolio.”

The Proceeds represent less than 5% of Northam’s current market capitalisation and therefore the
Transaction is not classified as a “categorised transaction” in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements. This announcement is provided to shareholders for information purposes only.

Preparation
These reviewed interim results have been prepared under the supervision of the chief financial officer,
Mr AZ Khumalo CA (SA).

Auditor Review 
The financial results of the group have been reviewed by Ernst & Young Inc., under the supervision of Mr M Herbst
CA (SA), a registered auditor. A copy of their unmodified reviewed report is available for inspection at Northam's
registered office.

Accounting policies - basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments
that are stated at fair value. The group interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), its interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, the SAICA
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, presentation and disclosures
as required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the JSE Listings Requirements and the requirements of the
Companies Act No. 71 of 2008, and incorporates the accounting policies which are consistent with those
adopted in the financial year ended 30 June 2015.

There have been no amendments, standards or interpretations impacting the group which became effective
for the year beginning 1 July 2015.

Related parties
The group enters into various sales, purchase, financing and lease transactions in the ordinary course of
business with a large number of entities, some of which are related parties.

Going concern
Mining operations have a finite life and are also dependent amongst other things on geological, technical as
well as economic factors such as commodity prices and exchange rates. The global economic outlook and
low US dollar metal prices are a concern as Northam is an exporter of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) to global markets. Operations
continue to be under pressure due to increasing input costs (mainly power and labour) and lower metal prices.

In the current cycle of low PGM US dollar metal prices, operations are under pressure to remain viable.
Management has undertaken initiatives to improve efficiency and to reduce costs as far as possible and
where necessary has engaged external experts to assist. Based on the said interventions, management is
of the opinion that the group remains a going concern despite the current difficult operating conditions.

Events after the reporting period
On 5 February 2016 shareholders were advised by way of a SENS announcement that Northam had entered into

RESULTS COMMENTARY

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW – CONSOLIDATED GROUP

Revenue
Revenue generated from sales increased by 5.4% to R3.2 billion (H1 F2015: R3.0 billion), reflecting
the group's increasing sales volumes. Sales volumes were 19.3% higher, at 7 716kg or 248 075oz
(H1 F2015: 6 468kg; 207 951oz).

The lower basket price received of R415 196/kg (H1 F2015: R469 740/kg) reflects the significant decline in
the PGM US$ basket price realised which was offset to some extent by the 23.6% weakening of the ZAR
against the US dollar.

From 1 June 2015, concentrate production from Booysendal has been sold to Zondereinde at 88% of the
market related price. On a group basis, revenue is generated by Northam as all sales between Booysendal and
Zondereinde eliminate on consolidation. Previously, Booysendal sold its final product directly to customers.

Cost of sales and operating costs
The cost of sales increased by 17.8% to R3.1 billion (H1 F2015: R2.6 billion), in correlation with the
increase of 19.3% in volumes sold. Group operating costs increased by 14.0% to R2.4 billion (H1 F2015:
R2.1 billion). However, overall costs were well contained, with the rise in group unit cash costs increasing
only 0.3% to R340 274/kg (H1 F2015: R339 129/kg). The significant contributors to cost increases were
labour, electricity and general mining inflation. Included in the operating costs are smelting and base metal
removal plant costs which, when combined with refining costs, recorded a marginal increase compared to
H1 F2015. Royalty charges have decreased due to the lower profits earned in the current period compared
to H1 F2015. Also included in the change in metal inventories are metals on hand that were written down
by R186.5 million (H1 F2015: R63.3 million) to net realisable value as a result of depressed PGM prices
during the period under review.

Operating profit
As a result of the above, the group operating margin decreased from 13.1% to 2.9% which resulted in
the operating profit declining to R93.4 million (H1 F2015: R399.0 million). Zondereinde generated an
operating profit of R50.0 million (H1 F2015 R279.4 million) whilst Booysendal made an operating profit
of R43.3 million (H1 F2015: R119.4 million) with the balance relating to the operating profit made on the
sale of houses in Norplats Properties Proprietary Limited.

Share of losses from associates, interest and finance costs as well as sundry income
and expenditure
The share of losses from associates declined to a loss of R11.6 million (H1 F2015: profit of R13.5 million).
Northam's share of losses in the Pandora joint venture and in Trans Hex Group Limited amounted to
R7.2 million (H1 F2015: R5.1 million) and R4.4 million (H1 F2015 profit of R18.6 million) respectively.
Management continues to assess its options regarding Northam's holdings in both these investments.

Investment revenue rose to R163.6 million (H1 F2015 R18.3 million). This is associated with interest earned
on higher cash balances resulting from the BEE transaction concluded in May 2015, as well as interest
received on an insurance contingency policy.

Finance costs of R459.7 million (H1 F2015: R77.7 million) were incurred owing to the non-cash finance
charge resulting from the structuring of the BEE transaction in terms of which dividends associated with
the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (Zampezi Platinum) preference shares are consolidated into the group financial statements of Northam.
The Zambezi Platinum preference shares accrue a cumulative variable dividend at the South African
prime interest rate plus 3.5% per annum. The accrued dividends are recognised as a finance charge. The
finance costs associated with the preference shares for the six month period under review amounted to
R430.4 million (H1 F2015: Rnil). The domestic medium-term debt notes (DMTN) of R1.4 billion were repaid
on 3 September 2015.

Sundry income of R127.0 million (H1 F2015: R191.5 million) includes a cash amount of R59.6 million received
on the cancellation of the insurance contingency policy as mentioned above. Accounted for in the comparable
H1 F2015, was an insurance refund of R150.0 million relating to the No. 1 shaft incident. Sundry income
was also impacted by the ZAR currency translation which increased from R7.8 million during H1 F2015 to
R28.8 million.

Sundry expenditure increased by 74.9% from R44.5 million to R77.8 million. Included in sundry expenditure
was the impairment of the investment in the Pandora joint venture of R34.7 million as well as an impairment
of the investment in Trans Hex Group Limited amounting to R5.3 million.

In addition, care and maintenance costs of R12.9 million were incurred at the Everest plant acquired
from Aquarius Platinum (South Africa) Proprietary Limited (AQPSA). Sundry expenditure also includes the
amortisation of liquidity fees payable on the BEE transaction concluded in the prior year (a liquidity fee of
2.5% was paid to the Public Investment Corporation SOC Limited and Coronation Asset Management
Proprietary Limited) on the full value of the preference shares. The liquidity fee, which was classified as
a transaction cost in terms of IAS 39 and included in the initial measurement of the financial liability, is
amortised over the 10 year lock-in period of the preference shares. The amortisation of R8.5 million is
included in sundry expenditure and relates to the said liquidity fee.

Taxation
Tax payable is lower than the comparable period owing to the lower profits achieved. Taxation consists of
non-mining tax of R81.7 million accrued mainly on interest earned. Deferred tax was raised on all temporary
differences resulting in a tax charge of R18.2 million.

Cash flow movements
Cash flow generated from operating activities rose to R684.4 million (H1 F2015: R55.5 million), largely as a
result of the movement in working capital. The working capital movement amounted to a positive inflow of
R236.5 million compared with the negative outflow of R530.0 million in the previous period. Contributing
to the positive movement in working capital was Value Added Tax of R187.7 million, (part of which
had been outstanding since April 2014), refunded by the South African Revenue Service during the period
under review. Metal debtors also declined by some R52.1 million due to the lower metal prices achieved
during the current period.

Cash flows utilised in investing activities were up 46.2% from R352.2 million to R515.1 million. The increase
relates primarily to the increase in expansionary capital on the following projects: R41.5 million spent on
employee accommodation both at Zondereinde and Booysendal; R37.3 million on the Merensky feasibility
project at Booysendal UG2 North mine; R65.2 million on the acquisition of the Everest mineral reserves and
costs relating to the development of Booysendal South mine; and R150.6 million on the completion of the
capital footprint at Booysendal UG2 North mine.

Cash flows utilised in financing expenditure increased significantly from R133.5 million in H1 F2015 to
R1.4 billion owing to the repayment of the DMTN during September 2015. Excluding the repayment of the
DMTN, the group generated net positive cash in-flows of R138.2 million for the six month period
ended 31 December 2015.

OPERATIONS

Zondereinde
Health and safety
Zondereinde recorded four million fatality-free shifts during the reporting period, a commendable performance
at any operation, and particularly at a deep-level mine like Zondereinde. The lost time injury rate was higher
at 1.67 injuries per 200 000 hours worked (30 June 2015: 1.31) and the reportable injury rate was 1.02
(30 June 2015: 0.94). Operational management is focused on reducing both the number and severity of
injuries through interventions involving employees, their representatives and operational structures.

Production
Merensky reef tonnes milled were 433 572 tonnes (H1 F2015: 431 714 tonnes) at a head grade of 5.8g/t,
whilst the UG2 reef contributed 619 044 tonnes (H1 F2015: 556 399 tonnes) at a head grade of 4.2g/t.
The combined head grade for the period was 4.9g/t (H1 F2015: 5.0g/t), illustrating the effect of the higher
UG2 contribution.

Production of equivalent refined metal increased by 15.4% to 4 823kg (H1 F2015: 4 179kg). The quantities
of purchased concentrates from third parties decreased slightly to 609kg (H1 F2015: 622kg).

Mining flexibility on the Merensky reef horizon remains constrained. Increased production from the UG2
horizon is expected to partially compensate for the Merensky constraints until the deepening section is
completed. The rebalancing of the Merensky/UG2 mining mix to a 40:60 ratio has resulted in the life of
Zondereinde increasing to 21 years.

Costs and capital expenditure
The total operating costs at Zondereinde for the period were R1.7 billion (H1 F2015: R1.5 billion) which
represents a 10.1% rise in costs. The rise in aggregate operating costs reflects primarily increased
production volumes which has resulted in lower unit cash costs of R342 288/kg (H1 F2015: R358 104/kg),
an improvement of 4.4%.

Management has adopted a cautious approach to capital expenditure in order to preserve cash resources. This
does not mean that essential and strategic development will not be done. The total capital expenditure for the
period was R161.9 million, comprising R33.2 million and R128.7 million for expansionary and sustaining capital
respectively. We anticipate spending a further R570.0 million for the remainder of the year.

Processing and refining
In line with our objective of adding smelter capacity and progressively reducing the group's operating
risk, work has started on the building of a new furnace. The total cost of the project is expected to be
R750.0 million and it is expected to be commissioned by December 2017.

This expansion work follows on the extension of Northam's strategic partnership with Heraeus
Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG (Heraeus) and Heraeus South Africa Proprietary Limited in terms of which
Heraeus has agreed to contribute EURO 20.0 million to the construction of the furnace. The agreement
also provides for the renewal of the current toll refining agreements and guarantees supply of material
to Heraeus.

Booysendal
Health and safety
The Booysendal mine recorded 2 million fatality free shifts on 17 September 2015.

The lost time injury rate (per 200 000 hours worked) improved to 0.52 (30 June 2015: 0.54) whilst the
reportable injury rate (per 200 000 hours worked) was marginally higher at 0.43 (30 June 2015: 0.41).

The mechanised mining method continues to be a significant safety differentiator.

Production
Production at Booysendal during the reporting period was affected by sporadic community protests during
the period.

A total of 985 727 tonnes were milled at a head grade of 2.7g/t compared to 929 262 tonnes at a head
grade of 2.6g/t during the comparable period.

Having been in ramp-up phase since July 2013, the Booysendal UG2 North achieved its steady-state run rate
of 160 000oz per annum within the reporting period.

The Merensky project at Booysendal North advanced satisfactorily with the development of the access
decline and the extraction of a bulk sample for metallurgical test work. This test work is expected to be
completed early in the second half of the financial year.

Costs and capital expenditure
The total operating costs at Booysendal for the period were R667.4 million (H1 F2015: R531.6 million).
This increase of 25.6% is attributed mainly to the higher production volumes and mining contract rates.
The rand per tonne milled for the period is in line with expectations at R661/t.

Total capital expenditure during this period has been R55.5 million and R266.6 million for sustaining and
expansionary capital respectively. Capital expenditure for the remainder of F2016 is likely to absorb a further
R205.6 million.

The unit cash cost of metal in concentrate at R291 772/kg (H1 F2015: R251 914/kg) is now a more
realistic reflection of the operating costs at Booysendal following the completion of the ramp-up to
steady state levels.

CORPORATE ACTION
R50.0 million was paid to AQPSA for the Everest mining right when the Section 11 consent was granted by
the Minister of Mineral Resources during the period.

In September 2015, Northam signed a heads of agreement with Heraeus, in terms of which Heraeus will
contribute Euro 20.0 million to the construction of a 20MW furnace at the Zondereinde smelter complex. This
amount will be payable in two equal tranches, the first in June 2016 and the other in June 2017. Northam
will pay a research and development fee of R9.2 million per annum for 20 years beginning in the current
financial year.

MINERAL RESOURCES AND RESERVES
The process of estimating the group's mineral resource and reserve is conducted on an annual basis. The
latest mineral resource and reserve estimation is included in the 2015 annual integrated report, which was
published in September 2015 and is available on the company's website.

CHANGES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Mr R Havenstein took over from Mr AR Martin as lead independent director on 18 August 2015.
Mr BK Mosehla was appointed as a non-executive director on 19 August 2015.
Mr ME Beckett retired as a director on 11 November 2015.
Ms HH Hickey and Mr TI Mvusi's appointments as independent non-executive directors, effective
1 January 2016, were announced on 11 December 2015. Ms Hickey is also a member of the audit and
risk committee.

PROSPECTS*
The outlook for the PGM industry remains challenging with persistent weak metal prices and poor economic
fundamentals in developed economies. The group's financial performance will depend on achieving higher
metal prices and a stable operating performance. Despite the adverse market conditions, Northam's strong
balance sheet and prudent financial controls will enable the company to continue with strategic project
development which will position the company to benefit from improving market conditions in the future.

* Not audited or reviewed by the group's auditors.
    
DIVIDEND
Given the continuing difficult conditions in the mining industry, and the cash requirements for
the development of the group's assets, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for
H1 F2016 (H1 F2015: Rnil cents per share).

TRADING STATEMENT

Shareholders are advised that the group’s consolidated loss per share and headline loss per share for
the six months ended 31 December 2015 are estimated to range between 63.2 cents a share and
81.0 cents per share, compared with the earnings per share of 89.2 cents and headline earning per
share of 89.4 cents reported for the six months ended 31 December 2014. The aforementioned
range expressed in percentage terms, is a decrease of between 171% and 191%.

The anticipated decline in earnings is attributable to:

    -   the consolidation of the Zambezi Platinum (RF) Limited (Zambezi Platinum) preference share
        dividends into the Northam group results;
    -   lower metal prices; and
    -   the impairment of non-core assets.

Zambezi Platinum’s preference share dividends were not a feature of the comparable H1 2014
results, as the Black Economic Empowerment transaction had not yet been concluded.

Despite the difficult economic circumstances prevailing during the reporting period, both of Northam’s
mining operations posted an operating profit. The total operating profit is expected to be between 60%
and 70% lower than the comparable period in F2014.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the six months ended 31 December 2015 was
349 875 750 shares (H1 2014: 397 586 096 shares).

This trading statement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s auditors. The interim
results for the six months ended 31 December 2015 are anticipated to be published on or about
26 February 2016.
