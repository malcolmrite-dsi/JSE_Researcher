Operational update for the quarter ended 30 September 2020

SALIENT FEATURES
- 557,000 ounces of attributable gold production
- US$1,070 per ounce of all-in-cost

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Q3 2020 was a period of recovery for our operations that were most severely disrupted by COVID-19, namely South Deep
and Cerro Corona. The business in general performed well during the quarter and continues to settle into the 'new' 
normal created by COVID-19. While the impact of COVID-19 has been largely contained at our operations, a second wave has
commenced in certain parts of the world (mainly in the Northern hemisphere). However, we cannot rule out a second wave in 
the countries in which we operate and we must ensure that the necessary protocols are maintained across the business. 

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q3 2020 was 557koz, up 7% YoY (up 1% QoQ). All-in costs (AIC) decreased by
1% YoY (flat QoQ) to US$1,070/oz, while all-in sustaining costs (AISC) increased 2% YoY (and decreased 3% QoQ) to
US$964/oz. 

The Australian region produced 250koz at AIC of A$1,363/oz (US$984/oz) and AISC of A$1,288/oz (US$931/oz). Our mines
in Ghana produced 211koz (including 45% of Asanko) at AIC of US$1,068/oz and AISC of US$1,030/oz. Cerro Corona in Peru
produced 51koz (gold equivalent) at AIC of US$1,146 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of US$953 per gold equivalent
ounce.

South Deep had a strong recovery after a disrupted Q2 2020, producing 65koz at an AIC of R583,344/kg (US$1,075/oz) and
AISC of R572,447/kg (US$1,055/oz). The mine is generating meaningful cashflow at current prices. 

COVID-19 update
As at 9 November 2020, the number of active cases among Gold Fields' workforce was only 26 with none in hospital.
Since the beginning of the pandemic in March, Gold Fields has conducted more than 41,000 tests among its workforce, 
of which 1,745 were positive.

* ""Awaiting results"" and ""Active cases"" refers to the current figures.

The high level of testing is a tribute to the work done by our operations to keep our employees safe. Remarkably, we
have had no single positive case in our Australian operations. Other key activities to ensure safe operations include:
- Strict adherence to all government regulations/protocols;
- Closure of offices and imposition of travel restrictions;
- Standard operating procedures on return to work;
- Social distancing, sanitisation and mask wearing mandatory;
- Regular communication to employees about COVID-19, assisting them to work remotely and how to deal with the
  fall-out of the pandemic;
- Dedicated COVID-19 information portal;
- Mental health support programmes; and
- Social media awareness and return-to-work communication campaigns for employees, communities and others.

JOHANNESBURG 12 November 2020: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) is pleased to provide an operational update for 
the quarter ended 30 September 2020. Detailed financial and operational results are provided on a six-monthly basis 
i.e. at the end of June and December.    

Balance sheet 
Gold Fields remains in a strong financial position. During Q3 2020, there was a further decrease in the net debt
balance (including leases) to US$1,159m at 30 September 2020 from US$1,239m at 30 June 2020, after taking into account 
the interim dividend payment of US$85m. This implies a net debt to EBITDA of 0.68x, compared to 0.84x at end June 2020. 
The net debt balance (excluding leases) decreased to US$796m from US$876m at the end of June 2020. 

Post quarter end, Gold Fields repaid the 2020 bond that were outstanding from a combination of cash resources and by
drawing on our US$ debt facilities. 

In a report released on 2 November 2020, Standard and Poor's Global ratings revised its outlook on Gold Fields to
positive from stable, and affirmed the 'BB+/B' global scale ratings and 'zaAAA/zaA-1+' South Africa national scale ratings.

Salares Norte
The Salares Norte project continued its positive momentum during Q3 2020. Year-to-date, US$78m has been spent on the
project, including pre-development costs of US$11m (incurred during Q1 2020), district exploration of US$11m, camp Phase
1 construction costs of US$13m and initial capex of US$43m. At the end of September 2020, engineering progress was 85.3%
compared to plan of 83.0%. 

At the end of Q3 2020, construction progress stood at 8.8% vs. plan of 4.9%, contributing towards total project
progress of 19.4% coming in slightly ahead of plan of 18.1%. Camp Phase I construction was completed during Q3 2020 while
Phase II construction was three months ahead of schedule at the end of the quarter. The diversion channel earthworks and
precast installation progressed as planned during Q3 and the bulk earthworks contractor commenced activities on 21
September. The mining contractor completed mobilisation and began pioneering works on 1 October, as planned. The pre-strip 
and construction of the process plant is expected to commence at the end of the year. 

Although no district exploration drilling was planned for Q3 2020, 1,650 metres were drilled during September. This
allowed the team to catch up on the metres that were planned but not drilled during Q2 due to COVID-19 related
restrictions. At the end of Q3 2020, total district exploration metres stood at 10,108 metres for the year compared to 
plan of 9,084 metres.

At the end of September 78% of the project Estimate at Completion (EAC) budget (excluding remaining contingency) had a
fixed and firm price (excluding inflation factors) through contracts and purchase orders awarded, significantly
reducing the risk of price differences.

Outlook and guidance
FY 2020 production and cost guidance remains unchanged from the update in August 2020. Attributable equivalent gold
production for 2020 for the Group is expected to be between 2.200Moz and 2.250Moz (original guidance: 2.275Moz -
2.315Moz).

AISC is expected to be between US$960/oz and US$980/oz (original guidance: US$920/oz - US$940/oz) and AIC is expected
to be between US$1,070/oz and US$1,090/oz (original guidance: US$1,035/oz - US$1,055/oz). 

Potential further COVID-19 related disruptions increases the risk to Group production and cost guidance.

We have maintained the view that the appropriate level of sustaining capital expenditure for our business is
US$250-300/oz. In recent years, we have spent at the lower end of this range due to high project capital expenditure. 
However, our most recent business planning process shows that for next year, we will be required to spend closer to the upper 
end of the range. This will enable us to spend on key projects that will allow us to sustain our production base for the next
8-10 years. Specifically in Australia, to ensure that we maintain the 1Moz production base, we will need to spend
additional capital to extend the mine life at Agnew; develop a second decline at Wallaby at Granny Smith; and continue to
invest in the ever-growing Invincible complex at St Ives.

South Deep was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown restrictions during Q2 2020. The
mine has slowly ramped up production as labour numbers returned to normal, while adherence to COVID-19 protocols has
continued in order to manage the pandemic.   

Gold production increased by 63% to 2,019kg (64,900oz) in the September quarter from 1,238kg (39,800oz) in the June
quarter due to an increase in volume mined.  

Underground reef grade mined decreased by 6% to 6.37g/t in the September quarter from 6.74g/t in the June quarter as a
result of an increase in destress mining as well as mining lower grade stopes compared to Q2. The reduction in broken
grade is in line with the mining sequence. Reef yield increased by 5% to 6.07g/t in the September quarter from 5.80g/t 
in the June quarter.  

Development increased by 56% to 995m in the September quarter from 638m in the June quarter, while destress increased
by 83% to 10,533m2 in the September quarter from 5,751m2 in the June quarter. These increases are mainly as a result of
production ramp-up post COVID-19 restrictions. Similarly, secondary support and backfill increased by 161%
quarter-on-quarter and 122% quarter-on-quarter, respectively. 

All-in cost decreased by 21% to R583,344/kg (US$1,075/oz) in the September quarter from R738,079/kg (US$1,231/oz) in
the June quarter mainly driven by higher gold sold, partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and
depreciation and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 12% to 127,300oz in the September quarter from 144,500oz in the June quarter mainly due
to lower tonnes milled as a result of lower production days. Yield decreased by 3% to 1.14g/t in the September quarter
from 1.17g/t in the June quarter. The difference between the mined grade of 1.40g/t and the yield of 1.14g/t is
attributable to lower grade stockpiles processed.

Ore processed in the September quarter included 1.0Mt of stockpiles at an average head grade of 0.78g/t compared to
1.1Mt of stockpiles at an average head grade of 0.80g/t processed in the June quarter.

All-in cost increased by 12% to US$1,099/oz in the September quarter from US$982/oz in the June quarter due to lower
gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.
Capital expenditure increased by 7% to US$41.5 million in the September quarter from US$38.8 million in the June
quarter.

All-in cost for Tarkwa is expected to be US$1,020/oz, above original guidance for 2020 (US$970/oz), mainly as a result
of higher royalties on the back of a higher gold price realised and additional COVID-19 costs. The higher cost guidance
is already factored into Group guidance.

Gold production increased by 22% to 61,900oz in the September quarter from 50,800oz in the June quarter mainly due to
higher yield. Yield increased by 33% to 1.65g/t in the September quarter from 1.24g/t in the June quarter due to higher
grades fed from the Damang Pit Cutback as the mining transitioned from the Huni Sandstones to the better mineralised
lithologies. Mining transitioned through the bulk of the Huni Sandstone during the quarter, with minimal volumes of Huni
Sandstone remaining.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 3% to 7.9Mt in the September quarter from 8.1Mt in the June quarter mainly due to less
production days following the change in the production calendar in the June quarter. However, ore tonnes mined
increased by 54% to 2.3Mt in the September quarter from 1.5Mt in the June quarter due to improved equipment availability 
and mining in exposed ore areas.

Gold mined increased by 61% to 115koz in the September quarter from 71koz in the June quarter due to higher ore tonnes
and grade mined.

All-in cost decreased by 36% to US$732/oz in the September quarter from US$1,149/oz in the June quarter mainly due to
higher gold sold and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by higher capital
expenditure. 

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 152% to US$5.3m in the September quarter from US$2.1m in the June quarter
mainly due to expenditure incurred on engineering projects, gravity screens and a Knelson concentrator. Non-sustaining
capital expenditure decreased by 33% to US$1.4m in the September quarter from US$2.1m in the June quarter due to timing
of capital expenditure for the second phase of the Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) raise.

All figures in table on a 100% basis.

Gold production decreased by 29% to 49,000oz (100% basis) in the September quarter from 69,000oz (100% basis) in the
June quarter mainly due to lower yield and tonnes milled. Yield decreased by 21% to 1.04g/t in the September quarter from
1.31g/t in the June quarter.

Total tonnes mined increased by 29% to 12.3Mt in the September quarter from 9.5Mt in the June quarter on the back of
increased stripping at the Esaase and Akwasiso pits. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 30% to 1Mt in the September quarter
from 1.4Mt in the June quarter. The Nkran Cut 2 west wall failure has forced the team to look for other ore sources and as
a result has required the acceleration of stripping activities to expose more ore.

Waste tonnes mined increased by 39% to 11.3Mt in the September quarter from 8.1Mt in the June quarter due to
accelerated stripping of the Esaase main pit to expose ore source for Q4. Further updates will be given in the March 2021 
quarter after review of the long term plan.

The accelerated stripping to expose new ore sources has significantly increased costs. This increased stripping
together with increased exploration activity has resulted in a 35% increase in all-in cost to US$1,760/oz in the September
quarter from US$1,305/oz in the June quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 31% to US$7.0m in the September quarter from US$10.2m in the June quarter
mainly due to timing of expenditure on the TSF raise. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 3% to US$12.1m in
the September quarter from US$12.5m in the June quarter due to timing.

Gold equivalent gold production increased by 9% to 50,500oz in the September quarter from 46,300oz in the June quarter
due to higher gold grades processed, together with a higher price factor, resulting from the higher copper price during
the September quarter.

 Total tonnes mined increased by 68% to 4.3Mt in the September quarter from 2.6Mt in the June quarter due to the
increase in the workforce and mining fleet after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. A waste recovery plan has been
implemented, which includes progressive increase of the mining fleet and building an access ramp on the north of the pit to
implement an additional mining front in 2021. 

Gold yield increased by 6% to 0.56g/t in the September quarter from 0.53g/t in the June quarter due to a 6% increase
in gold head grade processed to 0.83g/t in the September quarter from 0.78g/t in the June quarter. The copper yield
decreased by 5% to 0.36% in the September quarter from 0.38% in the June quarter on the back of a decrease in copper head
grade processed.

All-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 24% to US$594/oz in the September quarter from US$783/oz in the June quarter
driven by lower operating expenses and the positive impact of inventory movement resulting from higher closing
concentrate stocks, partially offset by lower by-product credits, lower gold ounces sold and higher capital expenditure. 
All-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 1% to US$1,146 per equivalent ounce in the September quarter from US$1,152 per
equivalent ounce in the June quarter driven mainly by the positive impact of the inventory movement.

Capital expenditure increased by 64% to US$12.6 million in the September quarter from US$7.7 million in the June
quarter due to increased construction activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities following the impact of
COVID-19 restrictions in the June quarter.

All-in cost for Cerro Corona is expected to be US$1,120/oz gold equivalent (US$790/oz gold), above original guidance
for 2020 (US$830/oz gold equivalent, US$575/oz gold), mainly as a result of lower production on the back of COVID-19
interruptions, additional COVID-19 costs and additional royalties due to higher metal prices. The higher cost guidance 
is already factored into Group guidance.

Gold production decreased by 5% to 90,500oz in the September quarter from 94,900oz in the June quarter as an 18%
decrease in tonnes milled was partially offset by a 16% increase in yield. 

Total tonnes mined at the underground mines decreased by 10% to 628,000t in the September quarter from 698,000t in the
June quarter due to less production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter. During the September
quarter the underground development fleet was rationalised and emphasis shifted to ore production. 

Total waste tonnes mined in the open pits decreased by 50% to 1.6 Mt in the September quarter from 3.3Mt in the June
quarter. Capital waste tonnes decreased by 99% to 11,000t in the September quarter from 1.3Mt in the June quarter,
following the conclusion of pre-strip activities at Neptune stage 6 pit early in the September quarter. Operational waste
tonnes decreased by 17% to 1.6Mt in the September quarter from 2.0Mt in the June quarter. Year-to-date the open pit
production is in line with the planned mining sequence and during Q3 the mining fleet was also utilised to focus on 
additional progressive rehabilitation. In addition the current quarter had a reduced number of days compared to the 
previous quarter.

Ore tonnes mined at the open pits decreased by 42% to 461,000t in the September quarter from 791,000t in the June
quarter, with all open pit ore being sourced from Neptune pit stages 5 and 6. Pre-strip activities of Neptune stage 
7 pit will commence in November 2020.

Surface mined grade increased by 45% to 1.76g/t in the September quarter from 1.21g/t in the June quarter with high
grade ore sourced from Neptune stage 6 pit.

Total tonnes processed decreased by 18% to 1.12Mt in the September quarter from 1.36Mt in the June quarter due to less
production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter and a four day planned mill shutdown to replace
liners.

All-in cost decreased by 17% to A$1,149/oz (US$839/oz) in the September quarter from A$1,388/oz (US$900/oz) in the
June quarter due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower capital expenditure, partially
offset by lower gold sold.

Capital expenditure decreased by 27% to A$22 million (US$16 million) in the September quarter from A$30 million 
(US$19 million) in the June quarter following the conclusion of Neptune stage 6 pre-strip activities during the 
September quarter.

Mine physicals in table on a 100% basis.

Gold production decreased by 22% to 55,900oz in the September quarter from 71,900oz in the June quarter due to
decreased ore processed and decreased yield.

Ore tonnes mined decreased by 13% to 1.86Mt in the September quarter from 2.13Mt in the June quarter as mining
activity focused on stripping in stages 2 and 3 of the pit.

Yield decreased by 10% to 0.92g/t in the September quarter from 1.02g/t in the June quarter due to the processing of
low grade stockpiles together with a decrease in grade of ore from source.

Tonnes processed decreased by 14% to 1.89Mt in the September quarter from 2.19Mt in the June quarter with decreased
availability at the processing plant due to less production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter,
combined with an extended planned shutdown to perform a full reline on the SAG mill and crusher. A ball mill bearing
failure on restarting the process plant after the shutdown impacted production for a further seven days. A specialist team
was mobilised and the root cause of the failure was determined and rectified prior to the installation of a replacement
bearing.   

All-in cost increased by 11% to A$1,518/oz (US$1,085oz) in the September quarter from A$1,363/oz (US$886/oz) in the
June quarter due to lower gold sold and increased capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sale before
amortisation and depreciation.

Capital expenditure (on a 50% basis) increased by 15% to A$13 million (US$9 million) in the September quarter from
A$11 million (US$7 million) in the June quarter with pre-strip activities at the Gruyere pit stage 3 continuing during the
quarter. 

All-in cost for Gruyere is expected to be A$1,350/oz (US$945/oz), above original guidance for 2020 (A$1,150/oz,
US$795/oz), mainly as a result of lower production due to plant downtime resulting from a ball mill motor bearing failure
(previously reported on by Gold Road) and mill configuration changes to cater for increased fresh rock processing, higher
processing and COVID-19 relating expenditure, as well as additional royalties due to a higher gold price realised. The
higher cost guidance is already factored into Group guidance.

Certain forward-looking statements
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933
(the Securities Act) and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) with respect to Gold
Fields' financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies, competitive position,
growth opportunities for existing services, plans and objectives of management, markets for stock and other matters.

These forward-looking statements, including, among others, those relating to the future business prospects, revenues,
income and production and operational guidance of Gold Fields, wherever they may occur in this report, are necessarily
estimates reflecting the best judgement of the senior management of Gold Fields and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. 
As a consequence, these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of various important factors, including
those set forth in this report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: 
- changes in the market price of gold, and to a lesser extent copper and silver;
- material changes in the value of Rand and non-US Dollar currencies;
- difficulties, operational delays, cost pressures and impact from labour relations following its restructuring at the
  South Deep operation in South Africa;
- the ability of the Group to comply with requirements that it provide benefits to affected communities;
- the effect of relevant government regulations, particularly labour, environmental, tax, royalty, health and safety,
  water, regulations and potential new legislation affecting mining and mineral rights;
- court decisions affecting the South African mining industry, including, without limitation, regarding the
  interpretation of mineral rights legislation and the treatment of health and safety claims;
- the challenges associated with replacing annual mineral reserve and resource depletion as well as growing its
  reserve and resource base to extend the life of operations;
- the ability to achieve anticipated efficiencies and other cost savings in connection with past and future
  acquisitions or joint ventures;
- the success of the Group's business strategy, development activities and other initiatives, particularly at Damang
  and the Salares Norte project;
- changes in technical and economic assumptions underlying Gold Fields' mineral reserve estimates;
- supply chain shortages and increases in the prices of production imports;
- changes in health and safety regulations that could lead to claims or liability for regulatory breaches;
- the occurrence of operational disruptions such as stoppages related to environmental and industrial accidents and
  pollution incidents;
- loss of senior management or inability to hire or retain sufficiently skilled employees or sufficient representation
  among Historically Disadvantaged Persons in management positions;
- power cost increases as well as power stoppages, fluctuations and usage constraints;
- regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change;
- high debt levels posing a risk to viability and making the Group more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive
  conditions;
- the ability of the Group to protect its information technology and communication systems and the personal data it
  retains as well as the failure of such systems;
- the ability to obtain, renew and comply with, water use licences and water quality discharge standards;
- the occurrence of future acid mine drainage related pollution;
- geotechnical challenges due to the ageing of certain mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex,
  often deeper underground, deposits;
- economic, political or social instability in the countries where Gold Fields operates;
- downgrades in the credit rating of South Africa and its impact on Gold Fields' ability to secure financing;
- reliance on outside contractors to conduct some of its operations;
- ageing infrastructure, unplanned breakdowns and stoppages that may delay production, increase costs and industrial
  accidents;
- the inability to modernise operations and remain competitive within the mining industry;
- the effects of regional re-watering at South Deep;
- the effects of a failure of a dam at a tailings facility and the closure of adjacent mines;
- actual or alleged breach or breaches in governance processes, fraud, bribery or corruption at Gold Fields'
  operations that leads to censure, penalties or negative reputational impacts;
- the occurrence of labour disruptions and industrial actions;
- the adequacy of the Group's insurance coverage;
- financial flexibility could be limited by South African exchange control regulations;
- difficulty controlling theft of gold and copper bearing materials and illegal mining on some Gold Fields properties;
- the costs and burdens associated with tenements in Australia which are subject to native title claims, including any
  compensation payable to native title holders;
- the impact of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and the spread of other contagious diseases, such as coronavirus (COVID-19);
- the identification of a material weakness in disclosure and internal controls over financial reporting;
- difficulty with participating in future issues of securities, or in bringing an action against Gold Fields, for
  shareholders outside South Africa;
- liquidity risks in trading ordinary shares on JSE Limited;
- Gold Fields' ability to pay dividends or make similar payments to its shareholders; and
- shareholders' equity interests in Gold Fields becoming diluted upon the exercise of outstanding share options.

Further details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting Gold Fields are described in Gold Fields' filings with
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Integrated
Annual Report 2019 and the annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019. Gold Fields undertakes no
obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Remarks by the Gold Fields Chair, Ms Cheryl Carolus, at the Gold Fields
AGM on 20 August 2020:


    Good afternoon. As has become customary let me start by providing
    a brief summary of the key developments at Gold Fields not just
    for 2019 but for the year to date as well. 2020 has indeed been a
    year that we will not forget  both in our professional and in our
    personal capacities. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to live
    outside of our comfort zones and, for Gold Fields, to operate well
    outside its business-as-usual parameters.

    I would like to pay tribute to how our 17,000 people have managed
    this crisis.

    To date 1,443 of our workforce have been infected and, tragically,
    three colleagues have died as a result of Covid-19. We cannot name
    two of them, but our heartfelt condolences go out to their
    families and friends. I also want to express my condolences on the
    death of Josephat Zvaipa, COO of Galiano Gold, our partners at the
    Asanko gold mine.

    Of the employees and contractors that have tested positive, 784
    have recovered, in part due to the exceptional medical care and
    assistance provided by our facilities and support given by the
    mines as well as the public health institutions we work with.

    The situation could have been worse had the company not acted
    swiftly to introduce a range of strategies and programmes to
    prevent our people getting infected, including strict adherence to
    all government protocols, sanitation, distancing, wearing of
    masks, travel restrictions and extensive educational campaigns for
    our workforce.

    Our operations have also gone out of their way to assist
    communities and governments as they battle the pandemic. They have
    done so voluntarily by providing much-needed equipment, PPE and
    resources to hospitals and clinics, funded awareness campaigns on
    community radio stations and organised sanitation of public
    facilities, amongst many other initiatives. A number of our
    directors, managers and employees have also been donating in their
    personal capacity to funds and organisations that assist people
    who are directly impacted by the pandemic. I thank them for this.

    All this and our employees have managed to keep our operations
    running relatively smoothly and profitably. As you would have seen
    from our interim results announcement this morning, the impact of
    the pandemic on production has been limited  we expect to be
    within 3% of our original production guidance for 2020. As a
    result of Covid-related costs, such as testing and site
    adjustments, and higher royalties due to the surging gold price,
    we have upped our cost guidance for the year, but marginally so.
    Amid the continued strong operating performance, and with the help
    of the strong gold price, our cash-inflow for the six months was a
    very healthy US$320m.


                                    4
A positive development emerging from the current crisis is the
strong focus on the health of our workers and our communities. We
have always prioritised safety at our operations, but this crisis
has reminded us to give equal attention to the health and wellness
of our people. Its highly unlikely that measures such as social
distancing will remain with us once the crisis is over, but what
we will retain are the ability to test our workers, support them
as they deal with occupational and non-occupational diseases and
focus on their mental wellbeing.
The pandemic has also seen a surge in violence against women. Our
Corporate Office and South Deep teams used Mandela Day to express
their support and raise funds for organisations that seek to help
victims of gender-based violence, a cause the Board and I
personally whole-heartedly support. Turning to safety, tragically
we had a fatal incident at South Deep in June this year. Abel
Magajane, a shaft timberman, succumbed from injuries sustained in
an underground accident. He leaves behind his wife and three
children. His death follows that of Maria Ramela, also at South
Deep, almost exactly a year earlier. We once again extend our
heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of
Abel and Maria.

We firmly support our management teams efforts to reduce
fatalities and serious injuries. I believe that our two key safety
programmes  Courageous Safety Leadership and Vital Behaviours 
are critical to achieving Zero Harm, together with strict
adherence to and implementation of our stringent safety standards
and rules.

In my Chairs Report in the latest Integrated Annual Report, I
wrote that I considered 2019 the most successful in my tenure as
Chairperson of Gold Fields. It was an exceptional year, during
which the companys reinvestment strategy, which commenced in late
2016, came to fruition. The impact of the companys three-year,
US$1bn investment programme, is significant. We essentially built
two new mines  Gruyere in Australia and Damang in Ghana  bought
45% of the prospective Asanko mine in Ghana and have taken a
greenfields project  Salares Norte in Chile  to a positive
construction decision. There is also the continued investment in
near-mine exploration at our Australian operations to secure their
longevity.

I was privileged to attend the opening of Gruyere last year. It
was heartening to see the efforts by our team at the mine to
integrate the Indigenous people into the workforce and share the
benefits of mining with the community.
Our portfolios performance was also boosted by the progress made
at South Deep. After a difficult 2018, in which we undertook a
significant restructuring process, the mine has reported material
and steady progress towards sustainable growth. These developments
have been further entrenched during 2020, despite the impact of
Covid-19.

Our portfolio is now in a strong position to maintain sustainable
production of 2 million to 2.5 million ounces per year for the
next 10 years and continue to generate cash sustainably into the

                                5
foreseeable future. The cash already generated by our mines has
not only enabled us to invest in the Companys future growth but
also pay off debt and create significant value for our
stakeholders. During 2019, Gold Fields' total value distribution
to our stakeholders amounted to US$2.6bn in the form of payments
to governments, capital providers, business suppliers and our
workforce. Significantly, about a third of this value remained
with our host communities.

My optimism about the future of the Company is not only based on
its sound operational and financial performance, but also on its
firm commitment to excellent environmental, social and governance
systems and performance. During 2019 and 2020 to date, Gold Fields
reported no serious environmental incidents. We are building on
our successful forays into renewable energy at our Australian
mines, particularly the microgrid at our Agnew mine. With almost
60% of the mines energy now coming from renewables, Agnew has
become a landmark renewables project not only in Australia, but
also for the global mining sector. As we expand the use of
renewables to our other mines, together with our energy efficiency
initiatives, this will make a significant contribution to reducing
our energy costs, securing energy supplies and reducing our carbon
footprint.

The Board is also working closely   with management in ensuring that
the governance and management       of Gold Fields 34 tailings
facilities are monitored closely.   This includes the implementation
of the stringent Global Industry    Standard on Tailings Management
released this month.

We have made reasonable progress on improving the diversity of our
workforce. Around 20% of our workforce and management are now
female, half of whom work in core mining activities. We aim to
improve on this as we seek to attract more women to our mines
around the world and further entrench diversity among our
workforce.

There have been no recent changes to the Board or Executive
Committee of the Company. I am confident that we can maintain this
stability and retain this team of dedicated, able women and men.
Their experience, knowledge and commitment was undoubtedly a key
reason for Gold Fields success in 2019 and the way the company
has managed the challenges of 2020. However, this does not absolve
the Board from its critical duty to ensure succession for the most
critical roles within the Company. Succession planning has moved
up in the Boards agenda over recent years, and we are applying
our minds to ensure continuity when key members of the executive
retire or leave.

On this note, I would like to state that Nick Holland, after 24
years as executive director and 13 years as CEO, will retire from
his position in September 2021. This is in line with the Companys
retirement policy, as has been disclosed to shareholders regularly
in the Companys Remuneration Report. A global search for a
suitable replacement will commence soon.


                                6
    I would like to end by thanking my fellow directors and Gold
    Fields executive leadership team, along with the employees of
    this Company, for their dedication and commitment to the
    sustainability of our business.

Remarks by the Chair of the Gold Fields Social, Ethics and Transformation
Committee, Dr Carmen Letton, at the Gold Fields AGM on 20 August 2020,

    Good afternoon, Shareholders and our Management Team

    I want to start by echoing our Chairpersons praise for the strong
    commitment Gold Fields employees have shown in assisting each
    other, their communities and their governments during the current
    COVID-19 crisis.

    These are very challenging times for all of us both personally and
    professionally. But it has also brought out the very best in our
    employees. They have not only ensured that our mines continue to
    run safely, profitably and sustainably, but that stakeholders,
    particularly our communities, receive the help they need to deal
    with this pandemic and the country crisis.

    I would also like to express my sincere          condolences to the
    relatives, friends and colleagues of those      lost to COVID-19 or
    mining-related accidents. It remains the GFL    Board and Management
    teams continual and determined focus to keep   our people safe.

    Before reviewing the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committees
    recent work, it is worth reiterating its wide-ranging mandate
    built around our key stakeholders  our employees and contractors,
    communities, governments, shareholders and business partners. This
    mandate comprises:
     - Social and Economic Development;
     - Good corporate citizenship;
     - Strong environmental, health and safety custodianship, though
       oversight of this rests with the SHSD Committee;
     - Labour and employment practices;
     - Transformation;
     - Communication, reputation and branding; and
     - Risk oversight related to SET.

    It is the responsibility and has been the focus of, this Committee
    to ensure that Gold Fields has sound relationships with our
    stakeholders through responsible business practices in line with
    industry-leading guidelines.

    Strong stakeholder relationships are at the heart of Gold Fields
    activities and the Committee seeks to ensure that the company
    continues to engage with stakeholders. We discuss and negotiate
    key decisions, mitigate any adverse environmental and social
    impacts and, most critically, share the benefits of mining.

    During 2019, Gold Fields generated revenue of almost US$2.6
    billion, which was distributed to our key stakeholders as follows:
     - Our workforce: US$395 million;
                                    7
 - Our capital providers and shareholders: US$162 million;
 - Governments, in the form of taxes and royalties: US$254
   million;
 - Our business partners: US$1.74 billion; and,
 - Our communities in the form of Socio-Economic Development
   spending: US$22 million.

In the first half of 2020, total distributed revenue was US$1.3
billion and stakeholder distributions were maintained at 2019
levels.

In addition to our Socio-Economic Development spend, our
operations supported host communities and governments through
donations and other contributions during the current COVID-19
crisis. To date, our help for communities and governments to
combat the pandemic has totalled almost US$2 million. Initiatives
have included donations of medical and sanitisation equipment,
food provisions to our most vulnerable, protective gear for our
front line people and educational campaigns in the community.
These contributions demonstrate the commitment of our mines to
going beyond compliance in safeguarding the health and wellbeing
of their communities.

Our investment in communities goes well beyond Socio-Economic
Development spending and donations. Gold Fields seeks to help
alleviate unemployment and create sustainable economies through
our community employment and procurement programs. As at June
2020, some 53% of our workforce  thats 8,200 employees and
contractors  lived in our host communities, while about 30% of
total supplier spend was with local community enterprises.

Quantifying this impact across Gold Fields businesses shows that
overall, almost 30% of the revenue we generate was distributed to
our host communities. Now, our mine management teams have been
incentivised to maintain and develop this level of support into
the future.

Among the few positives to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic is
the development of a closer working relationship with host
governments in supporting their health efforts, by providing
facilities, resources and much-needed funding. Equally positive,
governments have declared mining an essential service, which
enables us to continue operating. We hope to extend this working
relationship beyond the pandemic, in order to address issues
holding back mining sector growth in the many countries in which
we operate.

For many years, our CEO has spoken out for governments, trade
unions and mining companies to enter a social compact to grow the
total mining pie for the benefit of all stakeholders, rather than
battle over slices of an ever-shrinking pie. This has been
particularly evident amid the recent wave of resource nationalism
in many mineral-rich nations. Agreements needed to boost the
mining sector have not been forthcoming with most stakeholders
pursuing their own self-interest. We hope that the Covid-19 crisis
acts as a catalyst for this much needed dialogue.
                                8
Turning now to our People strategy. We continue to focus on
building a more diverse and inclusive workforce, with particular
emphasis on employing more women, residents from our host
communities and, in South Africa, historically disadvantaged
people. A diversity and inclusion strategy was approved by the
Board last year. The strategy, in addition to increasing the
attraction and retention of female employees, emphasises the
importance of ensuring that all people are treated with dignity
and respect. It focuses on workplace inclusiveness and diversity
as well as workplace sustainability and accountability.

The Companys diversity and inclusiveness strategy sets out our
people goals for the next five years. This will create a
foundation for building a truly diversified and inclusive company,
reflective of the societies in which we operate. This year, the
management team is working with the regions to set up a global
gender program, while supporting the increased representation of
youth, Historically Disadvantaged South Africans, and Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia. Unconscious bias and
diversity training has been rolled out across the Group to assist
employees in understanding their biases and raise awareness. This
strategy is live and each year we seek to improve and strengthen
our approaches and goals.

In some of these areas, we are making good progress. Currently,
women make up 20% of our global workforce, including in our core
mining activities. Youth representation is approximately 30%,
representation of Historically Disadvantaged South Africans at
South Deep 72% and, as I reported earlier, 53% of our workforce
live in our communities. Clearly, at the end of our 5-Year
strategy we hope to have maintained or potentially raised these
numbers markedly.

You may ask why the focus on our youth as an integral strategy
foundation. The future of work, the workplace in general and
mining in particular are changing  and changing at an
unprecedented rate. As we progress towards the mine of the future,
it is inevitable that we will rely increasingly on new entrants
into the labour market who possess the technical and non-technical
skills necessary to prosper at the digital edge. It also requires
us to retrain, where possible, existing employees to succeed in an
environment where automation, modernisation, mechanisation and
digitisation are key. In the past six years, the company has
invested almost US$90 million in targeted human resources
development and training programs.

Now, just a few words on our increasing focus on Indigenous
Peoples issues in Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples are key stakeholders at all our mines and we already have
an excellent relationship and formal Native Title Agreement with
the Yilka and Sullivan Edwards People at the Gruyere mine.      We
have also just embarked on a program to develop a similar
framework to support and engage with the Tjwarl People, who hold
native title rights and interests over a large area of the


                                9
Northern Gold Fields. This includes land on which the Agnew Mine
and exploration tenure are located.

Gold Fields Australia is making good progress implementing its
Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan that seeks to develop
respectful relations and develop formal consultation processes. We
want to create meaningful opportunities, such as employment and
contracting, with Indigenous people.

In this context, heritage management at our mines is also
critical, particularly in the wake of the Juukan Gorge incident on
May 24 this year. Rio Tinto blasted an area of Juukan Gorge, in
accordance with regulatory approvals.        Still, it destroyed
Aboriginal rock shelters thought to be about 46,000 years old. The
incident has received extensive media coverage, with significant
reputational damage to Rio Tinto and the broader Australian mining
industry.

As a direct response to the Juukan Gorge incident, Gold Fields has
undertaken a review of our own heritage management processes,
including the legal approvals that each operation holds for the
destruction of Aboriginal heritage sites. Destruction is the
unfortunate word used in the formal legal framework in Australia.
We are also following closely the Western Australian Governments
efforts to refresh the existing Aboriginal heritage laws and will
participate in the consultation process regarding the proposed new
legislation.

Moving to our communications, reputation and branding efforts. In
the past two years, Gold Fields has changed gears on this front in
order to enhance stakeholder experience and improve peoples daily
lives.    We have adopted and developed a range of social,
professional and commercial media platforms. These support our
employees, raise awareness of our support efforts and communicate
with a much broader audience.     This program has us very highly
placed in terms of brand and recognition, with some 4.8 million
impressions, 370,000 engagements with our content, and 300,000
followers of our publishing.     The key purposes in all of our
communications, reputation and branding efforts are:
 - Keeping our employees, their families and communities safe;
 - Keeping employees informed about what is happening in their
   company and specific countries;
 - Keeping our employees connected, energised, motivated and
   productive (which is especially important in our remote and on-
   mine workers);
 - Safeguarding our employees mental health;
 - Keeping stakeholders informed; and
 - Informing our communities of initiatives and empowering them
   with that information.

Finally, I would like to talk briefly about the issue of artisanal
and small-scale mining at and around our Damang and Tarkwa mines
in Ghana. This issue poses a potential risk in a pre-election and
high gold price environment. Although the number of these miners
is small and we adopt a zero-tolerance approach to such property

                               10
    encroachment, we have revised our strategy to reflect a changing
    context with increasing gold price.

    As part of this strategy we have intensified consultation with
    affected stakeholders, particularly traditional leaders, and
    intensified the creation of non-mining jobs to provide community
    members with alternative opportunities. Furthermore, we have
    updated our protection services strategies to better identify and
    manage the infiltration of these miners. In order to support
    Ghanas community mining program, we are ceding a portion of our
    Damang concession to the government. This is awaiting formal
    government approval.

    In conclusion, I would like to express my deep personal
    appreciation and gratitude to my co-directors, our management team
    and all Gold Fields employees around the world. They have ensured
    that the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee continues to
    meet its performance objectives, thereby contributing to the
    companys sustainability and success. Their passionate advocacy of
    social performance, ethical business and the transformation of our
    company is what underpins our success both today and into the
    future. Gold Fields shareholders have much to be proud of as part
    owners of this incredible company.

    Chairs special mention:
    For a number of years now, Gold Fields has supported Not-For-
    Profit organisations that help victims of gender-based and
    domestic violence. In 2020, the Board and Executive spoke out and
    put their names and faces to this cause. This advocacy from Gold
    Fields and these individuals promises to improve the plight of
    victims of gender-based and domestic violence wherever we are able
    to touch them with a bold and public statement that:
     - There is no place for domestic violence generally and that it
       is unacceptable in our community;
     - Everyone has the right to live free from harm and without fear
       of violence or abuse.
     - All victims need compassionate and highly responsive support;
       and
     - Help is here for those who are desperate and vulnerable.

    There are many more examples of generosity and advocacy by teams
    and individuals in the group, too many for me to mention here.
    However, this act is an insight into the way in which the
    individuals in our company align with our values and the intent to
    do the right thing. This lies at the core of our social, ethics
    and transformation mandate and the culture of Gold Fields.

              Trading statement for H1 2020

Johannesburg, 5 August 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that basic earnings per share for the six
months ended 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) are expected to be between
US17.1-18.9 per share, an increase of 90-110% (US8.1-9.9 per
share) from the basic earnings of US9.0 per share reported for the
six months ended 30 June 2019 (H1 2019).

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for H1 2020 are expected to be
US19.5-20.5 per share, 290-310% (US14.5-15.5 per share) higher
than the US5.0 per share reported for H1 2019.

Normalised earnings for H1 2020 are expected to be US35.5-38.5
per share, 137-157% (US20.5-23.5 per share) higher than the
US15.0 per share reported for H1 2019.

The increase in earnings for the period is driven largely by the increase
in the gold price received.

Attributable gold equivalent production for the six months ended 30
June 2020 increased marginally YoY to 1,087koz (H1 2019:
1,083koz), with the contribution from Gruyere (only commenced
production in July 2019) and increased production days, largely offset
by the impact of Covid-19 stoppages at South Deep and Cerro Corona
as well as the impact of the lower copper price at Cerro Corona, which
resulted in lower gold equivalent ounces.
The increase in production days relates to a decision that was taken,
during Q2 2020, to align the production months with the calendar
months, which resulted in an extra 10 production days in H1 2020.
These 10 extra production days also impacted Q2 2020. This once-off
adjustment has no impact on H2 2020.
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the Group for H1 2020 is US$986/oz,
compared to US$891/oz in H1 2019, an increase of 11% YoY, driven
by an increase in net operating costs (mainly driven by a move of
waste tonnes from capital to operating costs at Damang following
intersection of the main orebody), sustaining capital expenditure and
royalties (approximately US$15/oz) as well as lower by-product credits
(due to the lower copper price). Covid-19 related costs are estimated
at approximately US$20/oz for H1 2020 and are embedded in the
AISC.

All-in costs (AIC) for H1 2020 was 4% lower YoY at US$1,065/oz (H1 2019: US$1,106/oz) as project
capital was US$137m lower in H1 2020 compared to H1 2019, which more than offset the increases
relating to AISC, discussed above.

For Q2 2020 attributable group gold-equivalent production was 550koz (Q1 2020: 537koz),with AISC of
US$997/oz (Q1 2020: US$975/oz) and AIC of US$1,069/oz (Q1 2020: US$1,060/oz).

Revised cost guidance for FY 2020
FY 2020 Production guidance, as updated with the Q1 2020 operating update, remains intact at between
2.200Moz and 2.250Moz.

In light of the increase in costs in H1 2020, we are increasing our cost guidance for the year. AISC is
expected to be between US$960/oz and US$980/oz (original guidance: US$920/oz - US$940/oz) and
AIC is expected to be between US$1,070/oz and US$1,090/oz (original guidance: US$1,035/oz -
US$1,055/oz). The revised cost guidance is based on an estimated rand exchange rate of R17.00 and
A$ exchange rate of 0.70 for H2 2020. Increased royalties (due to the higher gold price) account for
US$15/oz of the cost increase, while Covid-related costs account for US$10/oz. Potential further Covid-
19 related disruptions increases the risk to Group production and cost guidance.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and reported
on, by the Companys external auditors.

Gold Fields is expected to release H1 2020 financial results on Thursday, 20 August 2020.

DISPATCH OF SUPPLEMENTARY NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 25 May 2020 with
regard to the publishing and distribution to shareholders of the Company's notice
of annual general meeting (""Original AGM Notice""), and are advised that a
supplementary notice to the Original AGM Notice (""Supplementary Notice"") had been

The purpose of the Supplementary Notice is to notify Gold Fields' shareholders
that due to the continuing impact of COVID-19, Gold Fields is of the view that,
in the interests of the safety of its shareholders, staff and the public, it would
be prudent to hold its annual general meeting (""AGM"") entirely by electronic
communication and not physically and to update shareholders on the procedure to
follow so as to participate by electronic communication at the AGM. The content
of the Original Notice, including the record dates and last date of trade, will
remain in all respects valid, and save for the information relating to the holding
of the AGM purely by electronic communication as set out in the Supplementary
Notice, has not changed.

""Companies Act"") and no physical meeting will be held.

Shareholders are reminded that in terms of section 59(1) (b) of the Companies Act,
71 of 2008, the record date for the purpose of determining which shareholders are
entitled to participate in and vote at the AGM (being the date on which a
shareholder must be registered in the Companys securities register in order to
participate in and vote at the AGM) is Tuesday, 11 August 2020. Therefore the last
day to trade in order to be registered in the Companys securities register as at
the record date is Wednesday, 5 August 2020.

account of the JSE or the Company. Neither the Company nor the JSE can be held
accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other network failures
due to insufficient airtime or data, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth
and/or power outages, which prevents any such shareholder from participating in
and/or voting at the AGM.

-  US$1,060 per ounce of all-in costs

JOHANNESBURG. 23 April 2020: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) is pleased to provide an operational update for the quarter ended 
31 March 2020. Detailed financial and operational results are provided on a six-monthly basis i.e. at the end of June and December.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
2020 will go down in history as being a year when a global pandemic disrupted and changed the world as we know it. Over the past 
months, the effects of Covid-19 have been pervasive. In addition to the devastating effect on the health and well-being of people 
around the world, the global economic and social impacts have been severe.

During the quarter, Gold Fields recorded no fatal accident at its operations compared with one fatality for the 2019 full year. 
While the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) regressed to 3.39 in Q1, compared with the 2.19 average for 2019, this was 
the result of a higher number of less serious incidents. The number of Serious and Lost Time Injuries at 2 and 9, respectively, were 
significantly lower than the same category of injuries in Q4 2019.

Gold Fields had got off to a solid operational start in Q1 2020, with all regions tracking the annual guidance as provided on 
13 February in terms of both production and AIC. While most of our operations have continued to operate largely as normal, production 
at South Deep and Cerro Corona will likely be impacted by Covid-19 related stoppages in Q2 2020. For Q1 2020, Group attributable 
equivalent gold production was 537koz, largely flat YoY (down 9% QoQ), taking into account production is not evenly weighted between 
quarters. AIC for the Group was US$1,060/oz, marginally lower YoY (up 9% QoQ). AIC for Q1 2020 excluding expenditure on Salares Norte 
was US$1,019/oz.

The Australian region produced 237koz at AIC of A$1,390/oz (US$925/oz) and AISC of A$1,316/oz (US$876/oz). Our mines in Ghana produced 
194koz (including 45% of Asanko) at AIC of US$1,130/oz and AISC of US$1,105/oz. Cerro Corona in Peru produced 62koz (gold equivalent) 
at AIC of US$837 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of US$714 per gold equivalent ounce. Finally, South Deep produced 61koz at AIC of 
R597,181/kg (US$1,236/oz) and AISC of R592,925/kg (US$1,227/oz). South Deep continues to perform ahead of expectations and is 
generating meaningful cashflow.

Balance sheet
Gold Fields remains in a strong financial position. During Q1 2020, there was a further decrease in the net debt balance (including 
leases) to US$1,260m at 31 March 2020 from US$1,664m at 31 December 2019. This implies a net debt to EBITDA of 0.94x, compared to 
1.29x at end December 2019. The net debt balance (excluding leases) decreased to US$957m from US$1,331m at the end of Q4 2019. 
At the end of the quarter, Gold Fields had approximately US$800m in cash on hand and in excess of US$1.5bn of committed, unutilised 
debt facilities.

Post quarter end, Gold Fields entered into two new R500m revolving credit facilities (RCF) with two South African banks. These 
facilities will mature in April 2023 and will replace the two facilities that are expiring in May 2020.

Impacts and potential impacts of Covid-19 on our operations
To date, the impact of the pandemic has been relatively muted on our operations, with production only slightly affected. However, the 
situation is fluid and there is the possibility of further lockdowns and restrictions in the countries in which we have a presence 
which may lead to production disruptions in future. The Group has put in place contingency plans in order to deal with these potential 
eventualities.

In line with the national lockdown in South Africa, our South Deep mine was placed on care and maintenance from 27 March 2020 to 
19 April 2020. Certain essential services at the mine continued and the majority of employees were sent home and have continued to 
receive their base pay during the lockdown period. While the national lockdown was extended by a further two weeks to the end of April, 
Government revised the regulations for mining during the extended lockdown, with mines allowed to operate at a maximum capacity of 50% 
of employees. As such, South Deep has commenced a staged incremental ramp up plan which includes recalling employees, making the mine 
safe and implementing Covid-19 standard operating procedures.  The initial plan will be to operate at employment levels of 
50%.  Employment levels beyond this will be subject to further South African government restrictions being lifted. Over the entire 
period of the lockdown and ramp up (should South Deep be allowed to build up to full production by end of May 2020), the lost 
production at the mine is expected to be up to 32koz (1,000kg).

Peru imposed a 15-day curfew on 16 March 2020. There have been two extensions to the curfew, which is now in place until 26 April 2020. 
Our Cerro Corona mine continued to operate largely as normal until Monday, 13 April 2020. From this point until the end of the curfew, 
the mine will be restricted to about 30% of the workforce (total workforce comprises 700 people) being on site focused on essential 
services and processing stockpiled material. Post 26 April 2020, there are likely to be restrictions on the number of people at site. 
We expect to have 50-60% of the workforce on site in May, increasing to 80% in June and a return to full capacity by end-June 2020.

At present, we estimate the impact on gold equivalent production to be approximately 25koz. In addition, rebasing the price ratio using
US$1,494/oz for gold and US$4,855/t for copper (previous guidance was based on US$1,300/oz for gold and US$5,730/t for copper),
production will be negatively impacted by approximately 30koz.

The Ghanaian government has implemented a partial lockdown, primarily in the main metropolitan areas of the country. Our Tarkwa and 
Damang mines in Ghana have continued to operate at normal levels and production has not been impacted. The partial lockdown has since 
been lifted.

While Australia is not under full lockdown, interstate travel has been halted and flights within Western Australia (WA) restricted 
to a degree. The majority of our people who live outside of WA are now temporarily based in Perth, and we have changed the 
Fly-in-Fly-out roster and de-densified flights. Our Australian mines are operating at normal levels. 

In Chile, a three-month curfew-based lockdown was imposed on 19 March 2020. Certain project activities at Salares Norte continue, 
specifically with regards to the camp expansion, which is a critical lead item to facilitate construction which is scheduled to 
commence later this year. Non-critical employees have been demobilised. 

All corporate office employees have been working from home since 27 March 2020 and will continue to do so until the lockdown period in 
South Africa is lifted.

Our response and contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic
The Covid-19 pandemic has provided a unique and unprecedented challenge in managing a global mining business. While governments in our 
operating jurisdictions have implemented varying degrees of social distancing and lockdown measures, Gold Fields has endeavoured to 
comply with all of the protocols and directives that have been imposed to contain the spread of the virus. In addition, all of our 
operating sites have developed contingency plans to deal with any incidents of Covid-19 and have set up isolation facilities should 
there be any positive cases.

Over the past month Gold Fields? operations around the globe have contributed to campaigns to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 
pandemic by funding government initiatives, continuing to support employees and suppliers, and investing in healthcare programmes in 
communities.

At the Corporate Office in Johannesburg, executives and employees have made voluntary donations to South Africa?s Solidarity Fund, 
which is supporting government programmes to fight the pandemic and other Covid-19 relief programmes. This includes donations of 
one-third of their salaries or fees for a three-month period by our CEO, CFO, Chairperson and other directors and executives.

The South Deep mine in South Africa also made a R15m contribution to the Solidarity Fund, with the mine executives and employees 
donating over R1m in their personal capacity to date. The mine has been on care and maintenance since the beginning of the lock-down 
in South Africa on March 27, which requires only about 7% of employees to be on duty for basic maintenance. The mine continued to pay 
base wages to all staff at a cost of R96m and also paid R22m to SMME contractors and service providers. It is continuing to pay the 
base wages to the 50% of the workforce that are not yet allowed back at the mine until end-April at a further cost of R60m, while 
SMMEs are receiving a further R17m during the last two weeks of April. 

Our Ghana region has contributed over US$830,000 in funding, of which US$433,000 was part of the Ghana Chamber of Mines? US$2m donation 
to the Ministry of Health to fight the pandemic. Another US$400,000 was committed to support employees and host communities around our 
Tarkwa and Damang mines with the purchase of healthcare equipment. We have also developed and sponsored community awareness programmes.

In Australia, Gold Fields committed A$250,000 (US$150,000) to the Covid-19 Community Support Initiative set up by Council for Mining 
and Energy, which is funding three organisations that are assisting rural communities: Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, 
Foodbank Australia and Lifeline WA. Among community initiatives, our St Ives mine donated A$23,500 to the Meals and Wheels programme 
in neighbouring Kambalda, to provide seniors with eight meals per month over a six-month period.

Our Peru region has contributed US$162,000 with the focus on providing medical and healthcare equipment to government and regional 
hospitals as well as NGOs operating in our host communities. This includes contributing to the purchase of 500,000 Covid-19 testing 
kits donated to the government by the National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy. Our Salares Norte project in Chile is funding 
sanitising and healthcare programmes in Diego de Almagro, the closest town to the project about 200km away.

Guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2020
Although production has been relatively uninterrupted at this stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are in full support of our host 
governments? measures and any potential future measures which might be imposed to curb the spread of the virus. Any further actions 
taken by Gold Fields going forward will be also determined by the nature and extent of incidences of infections at our mines and in 
the countries in which we operate. We believe that the Group is in a strong financial position with significantly reduced debt 
compared to prior periods and sufficient liquidity to withstand prolonged production shut downs, should they occur. Buoyant gold 
prices are expected to enhance the earnings potential of the Group.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the path that the Covid-19 virus might take going forward, together with the impact that this 
would have on production, we have only adjusted the full year guidance to take into account the production losses estimated for 
South Deep and Cerro Corona. Attributable equivalent gold production for 2020 for the Group is expected to be between 2.200Moz and 
2.250Moz (previous guidance: 2.275Moz - 2.315Moz). Cost guidance is unchanged with AISC expected to be between US$920/oz and 
US$940/oz and AIC expected to be between US$1,035/oz and US$1,055/oz. Further Covid-19 related disruptions increases the risk to 
Group guidance.

Gold production decreased by 13% to 1,885 kilograms (60,600 ounces) in the March quarter from 2,159 kilograms (69,400 ounces) in the 
December quarter due to a decrease in volume and grade. Volumes decreased as a result of 10 less production days in the March quarter 
(-11%) due to the Christmas break together with a slow production build-up post the December break.

Underground reef grade mined decreased by 10% to 5.89g/t in the March quarter from 6.54g/t in the December quarter as a result of 
increased mining in the eastern lower grade distal portion of the ore-body and reduced mining in the high grade proximal part of the 
orebody per the mine plan and schedule. 

In line with the mine plan, development decreased 20% quarter-on-quarter to 902m as a result of the re-allocation of resources to 
destress activities which increased 13% quarter-on-quarter to 9,207m2. Secondary support decreased subsequent to re-allocation of 
resources to other activities and a reduction of backlog activities on which significant emphasis was placed in 2019.

Backfill placement decreased as a result of plant maintenance stoppages, campaign milling due to Eskom?s stage 4 load curtailment and 
to a lesser extent to the reduction of fillable stopes.

All-in costs increased by 35% to R597,181/kg (US$1,236/oz) in the March quarter from R443,563/kg (US$932/oz) in the December quarter. 
The cost increases were driven by lower gold sold, some preparation costs on infrastructure for starting up of non-sustaining capital 
expenditure in the new mine development and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Gold production increased by 5% to 127,100 ounces in the March quarter from 120,900 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to higher 
yield. Yield increased 4% to 1.14g/t in the March quarter from 1.10g/t in the December quarter, driven by a 7% increase in grade mined 
to 1.29g/t in the March quarter in line with the mining sequence.

Total tonnes mined, including capital waste stripping, increased by 7% to 21.4 million tonnes in the March quarter from 20.1 million 
tonnes in the December quarter. 

All-in costs increased by 1% to US$994/oz in the March quarter from US$989/oz in the December quarter due to higher cost of sales 
before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by higher gold sold. The increase in cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation was mainly due to the increase in operational waste tonnes mined in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 5% to US$28.7m in the March quarter from US$30.1m in the December quarter mainly due to timing of 
infrastructure projects.

Gold production decreased by 21% to 36,900 ounces in the March quarter from 46,900 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to lower 
yield. Yield decreased by 20% to 1.00g/t in the March quarter from 1.25g/t in the December quarter due to lower grades mined together 
with higher levels of lower grade stockpile being fed to supplement ore tonnes mined. The lower gold production was, however, in line 
with the plan for the quarter. As previously guided, the March quarter was again impacted by the transition through the Huni sandstone 
lithology, which is associated with higher than usual grade variability. The transition through the Huni sandstones will continue 
during Q2 2020 and be completed by mid-year, when mining will occur in the higher (and more consistent) grade Tarkwa phyllites. Mine 
grade for H2 2020 is therefore expected to improve to approximately 1.80g/t. Damang is on track to deliver the 2020 production 
guidance. 

Capital waste tonnes, included in total waste tonnes, decreased by 99% to 0.01 million tonnes in the March quarter from 1.5 million 
tonnes in the December quarter. This decrease in capital waste tonnes was due to the completion of capital waste mining at the Damang 
Complex ahead of plan.

All-in costs increased by 37% to US$1,804/oz in the March quarter from US$1,313/oz in the December quarter mainly due to lower gold 
sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower capital expenditure. Cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation increased by 19% to US$57 million in the March quarter from US$48 million in the December quarter mainly 
underpinned by a higher GIP cost of US$11 million in the March quarter compared with US$3 million in the December quarter. AIl-in costs 
are in line with the 2020 plan and are expected to decrease significantly in H2 2020 when mining will occur in the higher grade ore 
body at the Damang pit.

Capital expenditure decreased by 45% to US$4.2 million in the March quarter from US$7.6 million in the December quarter due to lower 
capital waste tonnes mined as the strip ratio continues to reduce at depth.

All figures in table on a 100 per cent basis

Gold production increased marginally to 66,300 ounces (100% basis) in the March quarter from 66,100 ounces (100% basis) in the 
December quarter mainly due to higher yield. Yield increased by 4% to 1.47g/t in the March quarter from 1.41g/t in the December quarter 
driven by higher grade ore fed during the quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 41% to 9.0 million tonnes, in the March quarter, due to improved contractor equipment performance at 
both the Nkran and Esaase pits. Ore tonnes mined increased 36% to 1.9 million tonnes coming mainly from the Nkran and Esaase pits. 
Waste tonnes mined increased by 42% to 7.1 million tonnes mainly because of the accelerated stripping of the Esaase pit to expose ore 
earlier due to the wall failure at the Nkran pit.

All-in cost decreased by 19% to US$881/oz in the March quarter from US$1,094/oz in the December quarter underpinned by a 3% increase in 
gold sold, lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower capital expenditure. The lower cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation was due to a credit from GIP because of the higher ore tonnes mined. Total capital expenditure decreased 
by 48% mainly due to expenditure on the LOM Study, Esaase haul road upgrade and pit establishment as well as Akwasiso pit preparation 
capital that was incurred in the December 2019 quarter but not repeated in the March 2020 quarter.

Gold production decreased by 9% to 36,900 ounces in the March quarter from 40,400 ounces in the December quarter due to lower grades 
processed and a reduction in ore tonnes milled. Copper production decreased by 10% to 6,905 tonnes from 7,708 tonnes due to lower 
grades processed and lower tonnes milled. Equivalent gold production decreased by 12% to 62,300 ounces in the March quarter from 
70,800 ounces in the December quarter underpinned by the lower gold and copper production in line with the mining sequence and lower 
price factor. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 15% to 6.0 million tonnes in the March quarter from 5.2 million tonnes in the December quarter in line 
with strategy and the mine sequence of stockpiling the low grade ore, which will be treated at the end of the life of the mine. There 
has been an increase of low grade ore stocks of 1.2 million tonnes to 6.1 million tonnes in the March quarter from 4.9 million tonnes 
at the end of the December quarter. Total low grade ore stockpiled has an average gold grade of 0.66 grams per tonne and an average 
copper grade of 0.32 per cent. Gold and copper mined grades are lower in the March quarter than the December quarter, in line with the 
mine sequence.

Gold yield decreased by 7% to 0.71g/t in the March quarter from 0.76g/t in the December quarter due to a 7% decrease in gold head grade 
processed to 1.06g/t in the March quarter from 1.14g/t in the December quarter.

All-in cost per gold ounce increased by 3% to US$647/oz in the March quarter from US$628/oz in the December quarter mainly due to lower 
by-product credits driven by lower copper sales and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure. All-in cost per 
equivalent ounce decreased by 11% to US$837 per equivalent ounce in the March quarter from US$940 per equivalent ounce in the December 
quarter driven by lower capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure decreased by 52% to US$11.6 million in the March quarter from US$24.2 million in the December quarter due to a 
decrease in construction activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the rainy season.

Gold production decreased by 14% to 93,100 ounces in the March quarter from 107,800 ounces in the December quarter. The ounce reduction 
was the result of lower grade ore delivery from open pit mines and some draw-down of lower grade surface stockpiles. The December 
quarter also included the release of approximately 4,000 ounces left within the circuit at the end of the September quarter.

Ore tonnes mined at the open pits decreased by 31% to 633,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 919,000 tonnes in the December quarter. 
The decrease was due to the final 287,000 tonnes of ore being extracted from the Invincible open cut stage 6 during the December 
quarter with the pit now closed. Open pit mining is now sourced from the Neptune pit only.

Surface mined grade decreased by 23% to 1.63g/t in the March quarter from 2.13g/t in the December quarter, following the conclusion of 
mining activities at the high grade Neptune stage 2 pit early in the March quarter that was mined slightly ahead of schedule late in 
December 2019 and early January 2020.

The Invincible Underground Mine and Hamlet North underground ramp up has progressed according to schedule as St Ives transitions to 
predominantly high grade underground ore feed. 

All-in cost increased by 14% to A$1,364/oz (US$907/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,197/oz (US$817/oz) in the December quarter due to 
decreased gold sold and the costs of stockpiles drawn down, partially offset by reduced capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure decreased by 23% to A$27 million (US$18 million) in the March quarter from A$35 million (US$24 million) in the 
December quarter with the completion of underground infrastructure and the associated spend at Hamlet North mine during the December

Gold production decreased by 15% to 47,400 ounces in the March quarter from 55,700 ounces in the December quarter due to a decrease 
in grade of ore mined and processed, as well as a decrease in tonnes processed. 

Mined grade decreased by 16% to 4.77g/t in the March quarter from 5.69g/t in the December quarter. There was increased ore development 
at Waroonga during Q1 which in part contributed to the lower grade in the quarter. The focus for the first half of 2020 is to develop 
into the Waroonga North Lower, Kath and Sheba areas. This emphasis on developing into these new areas has seen a 58% increase in waste 
material moved in the March quarter from the December quarter. The mined grade is expected to improve in the June quarter as the 
delivery of ore from Waroonga North Lower and Kath areas increases as per the mine plan.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5% to 322,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 338,000 tonnes in the December quarter due to a planned 
maintenance shutdown performed at the processing plant.

All-in cost increased by 18% to A$1,637/oz (US$1,090/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,385/oz (US$943/oz) in the December quarter due 
to decreased gold sold and increased capital expenditure, partially offset by decreased cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation.

Capital expenditure increased by 78% to A$16 million (US$11 million) in the March quarter from A$9 million (US$6 million) in the 
December quarter due to increased capital development in the Sheba and Kath areas, as well as increased exploration drilling in the 
March quarter.

Gold production decreased by 6% to 66,600 ounces in the March quarter from 71,100 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to a 
decrease in ore processed. 

Ore mined decreased by 4% to 418,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 437,000 tonnes in the December quarter and waste mined decreased 
by 22% to 123,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 158,000 tonnes in the December quarter. The decrease in mining activity was due to 
focus on ore drive development in the Z100 area early in the March quarter and increased infrastructure, ground support and project 
development activities in Z110 & Z120 levels, in preparation for production later in the year.   

Ore processed decreased by 9% to 429,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 471,000 tonnes in the December quarter. During the December 
quarter 34,000 tonnes of ore were also processed from existing stockpiles (March quarter - nil).

All-in cost decreased by 5% to A$1,338/oz (US$890/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,411/oz (US$966/oz) in the December quarter due to 
lower capital expenditure, partially offset by a reduction in gold sold.

Capital expenditure decreased by 38% to A$20 million (US$13 million) in the March quarter from A$32 million (US$22 million) in the 
December quarter following the close-out of underground infrastructure projects and conclusion of mobile equipment purchases in the 
December quarter.

Mine physicals in table on a 100 per cent basis

Gold production decreased by 15% to 59,600 ounces in the March quarter from 70,000 ounces in the December quarter due to a decrease in 
yield and a decrease in tonnes processed.

Ore tonnes mined reduced 16% in the March quarter to 1,837,000 tonnes from 2,190,000 tonnes in the December quarter as the mine 
transitions into fresh rock ore. Production drill rig availability was an issue early in the quarter but was subsequently resolved.

Ore grade mined increased 15% to 1.06g/t in the March quarter from 0.92g/t in the December quarter. The grade result is a function of 
mining location in the pit as grade gradually improves when mining from south through to north. There was also less low grade ore 
defined.

Yield decreased by 9% to 0.96g/t in the March quarter from 1.06g/t in the December quarter. Gruyere had built up stockpiles of higher 
grade material during the first nine months of 2019 while construction of the processing facility was being completed and during the 
early stages of commissioning.  This higher grade material was preferentially treated and  contributed to an uplift in the yield during 
the December quarter with the same material not available in the March quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 6% to 1,926,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 2,051,000 tonnes in the December quarter due to an 
extended planned shutdown in the March quarter to replace mill liners,  conduct necessary works to enhance the durability of high wear 
areas in the crushing and grinding circuits and conduct reliability improvements at the processing plant.

All-in cost increased by 21% to A$1,188/oz (US$791/oz) in the March quarter from A$983/oz (US$684/oz) in the December quarter due to 
decreased gold sold and planned shutdown costs, partially offset by decreased capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure (on a 50% basis) decreased by 50% to A$4 million (US$3 million) in the March quarter from A$8 million 
(US$5 million) in the December quarter following the close-out of mining and processing infrastructure projects in the December 
quarter and due to a move from mining capital waste to operating waste.

   Historically Disadvantaged Persons in management positions;

   as the failure of such systems;
-  the ability to obtain, renew and comply with, water use licences and water quality discharge standards;

-  the adequacy of the Group?s insurance coverage;
-  financial flexibility could be limited by South African exchange control regulations;

-  difficulty with participating in future issues of securities, or in bringing an action against Gold Fields, for shareholders 
   outside South Africa;

COVID-19 update

The IAR also provides an update by CEO Nick Holland on the impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic on Gold Fields and its operations, detailing
the actions taken by the Company to date, both in response to
government directives and on its own accord. This include putting
the South Deep mine in South Africa on care and maintenance for the
current three-week lockdown period in South Africa from 27 March
2020 to 16 April 2020.

Apart from South Deep, the rest of the Group production has been
largely uninterrupted. However, increasingly stricter regulations
are being put in place by governments around the world. As a result,
we caution that our production and cost guidance for the 2020
financial year provided in February 2020 has an elevated level of
risk.

On the position of the Company going forward, Holland says: We have
evaluated the potential effects of a three-month operational closure
period across the Group (period used is based on periods of lockdown
experienced China and South Korea). Over this period there could
potentially be no production and approximately 50% savings on cost
and capital. Gold Fields is of the view that it will be a stable,
going concern for the foreseeable future. However, this estimate is
inherently uncertain as it is based on expectations of future
events, including the length of the closure period, which is
currently unknown.

The CEO report is on pages 30-34 of the IAR.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Supplement 2019

The Gold Fields Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Supplement
2019 contains a comprehensive overview of Gold Fields Mineral
Resource and Mineral Reserve status as well as a detailed breakdown
for its operations and projects.

As at 31 December 2019, Gold Fields had attributable gold-equivalent
Mineral Reserves of 51Moz (2018: 50Moz) and gold-equivalent Mineral
Resources of 116Moz (2018: 108Moz). The contribution to Group gold-
eq Reserves from operation outside of South Africa increased to
22Moz in 2019 (2018: 20Moz), representing 42% of the Groups Reserve
base. As recently as 2015 only 28% of Reserves were not from South
Deep, our only South African operation.

The Groups attributable copper Mineral Reserves totalled 616
million pounds in 2019 (2018: 691 million pounds) and copper Mineral
Resources 882 million pounds (2018: 844 million pounds). The copper
Resources and Reserves exclude Far Southeast. Attributable silver
Reserves were 39Moz and silver Resources 44Moz, both unchanged from
2018. Stated figures are net of annual production depletion.

The SAMREC Code (2016 edition) compliant Mineral Reserves are based
on gold, copper and silver prices of US$1,200/oz (A$1,600/oz,
R550,000/kg), US$2.60/lb for 2020 and US$2.80/lb from 2021 owards
and US$17.50/oz respectively. Relevant modifying factors, tonnes,
grades, classification, reconciliations and Competent Persons are
detailed in the Supplement.

MEDIA RELEASE


GOLD FIELDS OPERATIONS  UPDATE ON COVID-19 IMPACT


Johannesburg, 24 March 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) fully supports the measures and policies to curb the
Covid-19 pandemic implemented by the countries in which we operate.

The world finds itself facing an unprecedented situation - the
Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments across the globe to take
decisive actions to safeguard the lives of their people. Gold Fields
is fully committed to first and foremost protecting the health and
safety of our people and communities, and supports all governments
efforts to contain the spread of the virus, says Gold Fields CEO
Nick Holland.

In particular, we note yesterdays announcement by South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa of a 21-day lockdown commencing this
Friday. It is a painful, but necessary and bold decision and one
that we support to the fullest, he adds.

The nature and extent of incidences of infections at our global
operations will determine the companys action with regards to
continued operations at the mine sites.

The following provides an update on the situation in each Region and
the additional measures we have now put in place:

-   Our South Deep mine in South Africa will be safely put on
    care and maintenance as from 27 March 2020. South Deep is seeking
    permission from the regulator for the following activities to
    continue: pumping, security, essential plant maintenance,
    managerial oversight and medical services. Employees who will be
    providing these essential services will be accommodated in our
    residences. The majority of employees will be sent home as from
    Thursday and will continue to receive their base pay during the
    21-day lock-down period. Where possible, select employees will
    work from home. Based on the current run-rate, the 21-day
    lockdown is expected to result in 16koz (500kg) of lost
    production at South Deep.
-   Peru imposed a 15-day curfew on 16 March 2020. Our Cerro
    Corona mine is still continuing operations as the workforce stays
    in a self-contained camp on-site. We have just over 700 employees
    currently at Cerro Corona. Once the curfew period has ended we
    will reassess our ability to safely continue operations depending
    on the governments next actions.
-   Our Tarkwa and Damang mines in Ghana continue operating and
    production has to date not been impacted.
-   While there are restrictions on interstate travel in
    Australia, this currently does not apply to our Fly-In Fly-Out
    employees who continue to travel to and from our mines in Western
    Australia. Production has also not been impacted to date.
-   In Chile, a three-month curfew-based lockdown was imposed on
    19 March 2020. Project activities at Salares Norte continue, with
    construction only scheduled to begin later this year. Non-
    critical employees have been demobilized.
-   All corporate office employees will be working from home from
    27 March 2020 until the lockdown period in South Africa is
    lifted.

The company is in a strong financial position with significantly
reduced debt at the end of December 2019. At the time of this
release Gold Fields had approximately US$600m in cash and in excess
of US$1.5bn of committed, unutilised debt facilities. We have
sufficient liquidity to withstand an interruption to our operations
for a considerable period of time, but will work towards minimising
the impact of Covid-19 on our operations, Holland says

We will review the situation at regular intervals to decide on
further actions if required and will keep the market updated
accordingly.

RESULTS OF SHARE PLACING

Johannesburg, 13 February 2020: Gold Fields (Tickers JSE: GFI and NYSE:
GFI) is pleased to announce the successful completion of the placing
announced yesterday on SENS (the ""Placing"").

A total of 41,431,635 new ordinary, no par value shares in the authorised
but unissued share capital of Gold Fields have been placed with existing
and new institutional investors (the ""Placing Shares"") at a price of ZAR
90.20 per share (the ""Placing Price""). Gross proceeds of approximately
ZAR3.7 billion / US$252 million were raised through the Placing. The net
proceeds from the Placing will be used to continue predevelopment work
and commence construction of the Salares Norte project, an exciting
project in an established mining jurisdiction with an initial 11.5 year
life of mine and an average annual production of 450koz of gold
equivalent (over the first seven years) at an all-in sustaining cost of
US$552/oz (over the life of mine).


J.P. Morgan Securities plc acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint
Bookrunner and BMO Capital Markets Limited (together with J.P. Morgan
plc, the ""Managers"") acted as Joint Bookrunner in respect of the Placing.

The Placing Shares being issued represent, in aggregate, approximately
5 per cent of the Company's issued ordinary share capital prior to the
Placing. The Placing Price represents a discount of 3.8 per cent to the
30 day VWAP prior to 12 February 2020, which is in compliance with
Section 5.52 of the JSE Listings Requirements. The Placing Shares, when
issued, will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Gold
Fields ordinary shares in issue, including the right to receive all
dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date
of issue thereof.

An application will be made to the JSE Limited (""JSE"") for the listing
of the Placing Shares. Subject to approval by the JSE, listing and
trading (""Admission"") of the Placing Shares are expected to occur on the
JSE on or around 18 February 2020 (or such later date as may be agreed
between the Company and the Sole Global Coordinator) and dealings in the
Placing Shares are expected to commence at the same time. The Placing
is conditional upon, amongst other things, Admission of the Placing
Shares on the JSE becoming effective and the placing agreement between
the   Company   and   the   Managers  (""Placing   Agreement"")    becoming
unconditional and not being terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to Admission.

Placing Shares purchased by persons outside the United States may not
be offered, sold, resold, delivered or otherwise distributed in or into
the United States or to any U.S. person (as defined by Regulation S under
the Securities Act) or deposited into the Company's ADS program for a
period of 40 days after the settlement of the Placing and the Company's
ADSs may not be used in any hedging transaction that includes the Placing
Shares.   Further, the Placing Shares may not be deposited into the
Company's ADS program for so long as they are restricted securities
(within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act) and therefore
are not tradeable on the New York Stock Exchange.        Please read the
important notice at the end of this announcement for further details in
relation to these restrictions.

Following Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise
870,064,342 ordinary no par value shares. This figure may be used by
shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by
which they will determine if they are required to notify their beneficial
interest in, or a change to their beneficial interest in, the Company's
ordinary shares under section 122 of the South African Companies Act of
2008.

Pursuant to the terms of the Placing Agreement, Gold Fields has agreed,
subject to certain exclusions, to a lock-up arrangement in respect of
Gold Fields's equity securities for a period of 90 days from 13 February
2020.

PROPOSED PLACING OF NEW ORDINARY SHARES

Johannesburg, 12 February 2020: Gold Fields announces its intention to
conduct a non pre-emptive cash placing through the issue of up to
41,431,635 new ordinary no par value shares in the authorized but
unissued share capital of the Company (the ""Placing Shares"") to
certain institutional investors (the Placing).

The Placing Shares represent approximately 5 per cent of the Companys
existing issued ordinary shares and is the maximum number of shares
that may be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its
existing general authority to issue shares for cash, as described in
the JSE Listings Requirements, granted by shareholders at the 2019
annual general meeting of the Company held on 21 May 2019.

It is expected that the gross proceeds from the Placing will amount to
approximately ZAR4.0bn / US$269m, based on the closing share price of
ZAR96.39/share as at 11 February 2020.

The Placing is being conducted through an accelerated bookbuild
process (the Bookbuild), which will be launched immediately
following   this  announcement   (the  Announcement).   J.P.  Morgan
Securities plc will act as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint
Bookrunner and BMO Capital Markets Limited (together with J. P. Morgan
Securities plc, the Managers) will act as Joint Bookrunner in
respect of the Placing.


Transaction background and use of proceeds

In line with the Companys strategy of reinvesting for the future,
Gold Fields has decided to begin initial construction of its Salares
Norte project (the Project). Salares Norte is an exciting project in
an established mining jurisdiction with an initial 11.5 year life of
mine and an average annual production of 450koz of gold equivalent
(over the first seven years) at an all-in sustaining cost of US$552/oz
(over the life of mine). The Project is expected to generate an
internal rate of return (IRR) of 23% at a US$1,300/oz gold price and
US$17.50/oz silver price with a 2.3 year payback period and a capital
cost estimate of US$860m.

In order to progress with the construction of the Project, the board
of directors of Gold Fields (the Board) has been formulating its
funding strategy. Following a review of the alternatives available to
the Company and consistent with the Companys prudence regarding its
debt position, the Board believes that a combination of the proceeds
of the Placing, operational cash flow and existing debt facilities
will allow the Company to fully fund the construction of Salares
Norte, and allow Gold Fields to maintain a 100 per cent interest in
this world-class project and exploration district. The net proceeds
from the Placing will be used to continue predevelopment work and
commence full construction of the Project in Q42020, with first gold
expected in Q12023.

Structure of the Placing

The Placing will be made outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S (Regulation S) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act) to persons who are not U.S. persons
(as defined in Regulation S), and within the United States only to
persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers
within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. No American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing
ordinary shares of the Company are being offered in the Placing.

The Placing Shares purchased by persons outside the United States may
not be offered, sold, resold, delivered or otherwise distributed in or
into the United States or to any U.S. person (as defined by Regulation
S under the Securities Act) or deposited into the Companys ADS
program for a period of 40 days after the settlement of the Placing
and the Companys ADSs may not be used in any hedging transaction that
includes the Placing Shares.   Further, the Placing Shares may not be
deposited into the Companys ADS program for so long as they are
restricted securities (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act) and therefore are not tradeable on the New York Stock
Exchange.    Please read the important notice at the end of this
announcement for further details in relation to these restrictions.

In South Africa, the Placing will be made only by way of separate
private placements to: (i) selected persons falling within one of the
specified categories listed in section 96(1)(a) of the South African
Companies Act, 2008 (the ""South African Companies Act""); and (ii)
selected persons, acting as principal, acquiring Placing Shares for a
total acquisition cost of R1,000,000 or more, as contemplated in
section 96(1)(b) of the South African Companies Act (""South African
Qualifying Investors"").
The price per ordinary share at which the Placing Shares will be
placed (the ""Placing Price"") will be decided at the close of the
Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild, the Placing
Price and allocations are at the discretion of the Company and the
Managers. The Placing Price will be announced as soon as practicable
on the Stock Exchange News Service of the exchange operated by the JSE
Limited (""JSE"") after the close of the Bookbuild.

The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari
passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of no par
value in the issued share capital of the Company, including the right
to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or
paid after the date of issue of the Placing Shares.

Subject to the approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placing
Shares on the JSE is expected to commence at 9a.m. on Tuesday, 18
February 2020 (or such other time and/or date as may be agreed between
the Company and the Sole Global Coordinator). Investors will receive
Placing Shares which are listed and traded on the JSE in ZAR.

Pursuant to the terms of the placing agreement entered with the
Managers, Gold Fields has agreed, subject to certain exclusions, to a
lock-up arrangement in respect of Gold Fields equity securities for a
period of 90 days from 13 February 2020.

Information to Distributors

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements
contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial
instruments, as amended (MiFID II); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of
Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II;
and (c) local implementing measures (together, the MiFID II Product
Governance Requirements), and disclaiming all and any liability,
whether   arising  in   tort,   contract   or   otherwise,   which   any
manufacturer (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance
Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Placing
Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has
determined that such securities are: (i) compatible with an end target
market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of
professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in
MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution
channels   as  are  permitted   by   MiFID   II  (the   Target   Market
Assessment).
Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note
that: the price of the Placing Shares may decline and investors could
lose all or part of their investment; the Placing Shares offer no
guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the
Placing Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a
guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in
conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and
who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may
result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to
the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling
restrictions in relation to the Placing.     Furthermore, it is noted
that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, the Managers will
only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients
and eligible counterparties.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not
constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for
the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or
group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action
whatsoever with respect to the Placing Shares.
Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Placing Shares          and determining
appropriate distribution channels.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THE FOREGOING, NO PUBLIC OFFERING OF THE
PLACING SHARES IS BEING MADE BY ANY PERSON ANYWHERE AND THE COMPANY
HAS NOT AUTHORISED OR CONSENTED TO ANY SUCH OFFERING IN RELATION TO
THE PLACING SHARES.

Johannesburg, 6 February 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that headline earnings per share for the
12 months ended 31 December 2019 (FY 2019) are expected to
range from US$0.19-0.21 per share, 171-200% (US$0.12-0.14 per
share) higher than the headline earnings of US$0.07 per share
reported for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018 (FY 2018).

Basic earnings per share for FY 2019 are expected to range from
US$0.19-0.21 per share, 145-150% (US$0.61-0.63 per share) higher

share) higher than the normalised earnings of US$0.03 per share
reported for FY 2018.

The increase in basic and headline earnings is driven by higher

be 590koz (Q3 2019: 523koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) -
original interpretation - of US$922/oz (Q3 2019: US$1,018/oz) and
US$864/oz (Q3 2019: US$947/oz) on the revised interpretation. All-
in costs (AIC) for the quarter are expected to be US$974/oz (Q3
2019: US$1,084/oz).

Attributable gold equivalent production for 2019 is expected to be
2,195koz, 8% higher than 2018 (FY18: 2,036koz), exceeding the
upper end of the guidance range of 2,130-2,180koz. Production once
again exceeded the annual guidance provided at the start of the
year.

AIC for 2019 are expected to be US$1,064/oz, 9% lower than 2018
(FY18: US$1,173/oz) and below guidance for 2019 of US$1,075/oz
to US$1,095/oz. AISC on the original WGC interpretation are
expected to be US$970/oz (FY18: US$981/oz) and US$897/oz on
the revised interpretation. AISC guidance (original interpretation) for 2019 was between US$980/oz
and US$995/oz.


Notable cash generation and net debt reduction for 2019
Net cash flow is expected to be US$249m for FY 2019, after growth expenditure of US$193m,

MEDIA RELEASE

SALARES NORTE RECEIVES ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVAL

Santiago de Chile, 18 December 2019: Gold Fields Limited (Gold
Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce that the Atacama
Environmental Assessment Commission today approved the
environmental impact study for its Salares Norte project in Chile.

The environmental approval for the project is a crucial step for Gold
Fields as it evaluates a construction decision. ""The company will now
formulate a funding plan, update the feasibility study completed earlier
this year and proceed to a construction decision during H1 2020,"" says
Nick Holland, CEO of Gold Fields.

The potential mine would present a boost for the regional economy
with respect to job creation, procurement of goods and services as
well as payments of taxes and royalties. It is estimated that about
2,700 jobs would be created during construction of the mine, which -
if given the go-ahead by Gold Fields - would be completed by end-
2022. About 900 workers would be employed once the mine is
operational.

Operational parameters for Salares Norte
The Salares Norte project is located in the Diego de Almagro
municipality in the Atacama Region in northern Chile, at between
3,900m and 4,700m above sea level.

Key findings of the feasibility study, announced in February 2019,
were:
   * Capital cost of US$834m for construction
   * A maiden Mineral Reserve of 3.5Moz of gold and 39Moz of
       silver was declared in December 2018. The gold-equivalent
       Mineral Reserve is 4.0Moz.
   * Initial 12-year life-of-mine
   * Annual throughput of 2Mt of ore
   * Life-of-mine production of 3.7Moz gold-equivalent
   * Average annual production of 450koz gold equivalent for the first seven years at AISC of
          US$465/oz
