NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Argentina Operations

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti has taken the decision to voluntary
suspend operations at its Cerro Vanguardia mine for 10 days due to the detection of COVID-19 cases
among the workforce.

Local health and labour authorities are being engaged and a full sanitisation process of the site will
commence. Essential activities will continue for the duration of the voluntary suspension.

Operations at Cerro Vanguardia are expected to resume on 20 November 2020, however, movements
to and from the site will be restricted to essential personnel only, until 30 November 2020. The
production impact of this precautionary stoppage is estimated to be 8,000oz.

The balance of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate as normal, employing a suite of
measures to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

The health and safety of employees and host communities remains a priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and is committed to working with and supporting
the Argentinian government, particularly in the Santa Cruz province, to combat the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak and remains
in close contact with authorities in each country, with our employees and with our key suppliers and
other business partners, to help ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may
occur.

For additional information on AngloGold Ashanti’s response to COVID-19, please refer to our website.

prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project

statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory
environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or
epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of
such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti, Barrick Conclude Morila Sale to Firefinch

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti Limited and Barrick Gold Corporation
today concluded the sale of their interest in Morila Limited, which owns 80% of the Morila gold mine in
Mali, to Firefinch Limited (previously named Mali Lithium Limited) for $28.8 million cash. The state of
Mali continues to hold the remaining 20%.

The net proceeds to AngloGold Ashanti’s account will be $3.6 million taking into consideration
shareholder loans and intercompany payables.

Firefinch will seek to extend Morila’s life by accessing satellite resources and adapting the mine’s
infrastructure. The company will employ all of Morila’s workforce, providing ongoing benefit to the mine’s
local stakeholders. The mine had been scheduled for closure in 2021.

The sale of Morila is aligned to AngloGold Ashanti’s strategic objective of streamlining its portfolio to
focus its capital allocation on assets with longer life and lower costs.

Since it went into production in October 2000, Morila produced 6.9 million ounces of gold and paid more
than $2.5 billion to stakeholders in the form of dividends and taxes. Morila, which was operated by
Barrick Gold, transitioned to a stockpile treatment operation in 2009 and began processing tailings in
2013.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Q3 2020 Free Cash Flow Rises 290%; Doubles Dividend Payout Ratio

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti delivered a near fourfold
increase in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2020, driving its Adjusted net debt to its
lowest level in almost a decade and supporting the decision to double its dividend payout
ratio.

The Company will pay shareholders 20% of its free cash flow before accounting for capital
expenditure in growth projects, up from 10% previously. The Company will also double the
frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.
“We’ll continue to enforce capital and cost discipline to deliver strong cash flows in this
elevated gold price environment,” said Christine Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s Interim Chief
Executive Officer. “Doubling our dividend payout ratio demonstrates confidence in our ability
to both improve direct returns to shareholders and to self-fund our growth projects and
sustaining capital requirements.”

Free cash flow rose to $339m for the quarter ended 30 September 2020, a 290% increase
from the $87m generated in the comparable quarter of last year, helped as a result of lower
costs from continuing operations, lower capital expenditure and a 30% higher gold price
received. This figure excludes the $200m of proceeds received for the sale of its South
African operating assets on 30 September 2020. Cash inflow from operating activities was up
56% to $551m from $354m in the same period last year.

AngloGold Ashanti has streamlined its portfolio, having completed the sale of its operating
assets in South Africa and progressing the sales processes in Mali, while prioritising
reinvestment in its portfolio to increase reserves, extend mine lives and improve operating
flexibility. The Obuasi Redevelopment Project, financed from internal cash flows, continued its
ramp-up during the third quarter of 2020, delivering a 52% quarter-on-quarter increase in
output, taking total pre-production output to approximately 100,000oz.

Adjusted net debt almost halved year-on-year to $875m at the end of September 2020, while
adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (“Adjusted EBITDA”)
rose 72% over the same period to $803m, from $468m in the third quarter of 2019. The ratio of
Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA fell to 0.36 times, its lowest level since 2011. The
Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet with an Adjusted net debt
to Adjusted EBITDA target ratio of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Operating Performance

Production in the three months ended 30 September 2020 was 837,000oz at a total cash cost
of $801/oz, compared to 825,000oz at a total cash cost of $786/oz in the same period in 2019.
The solid production result was underpinned by strong performances at most sites, with
standout performances at Sunrise Dam in Australia and AGA Mineração in Brazil.

All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) were $1,044/oz in the third quarter of 2020, compared to
$1,031/oz in the third quarter of 2019. This largely reflected higher cash costs. COVID-19
related impacts resulted in AISC being approximately $51/oz higher in the third quarter of 2020
due to approximately $22m COVID-19 related costs incurred ($33/oz) and approximately
18,000oz lost production at the South African operations ($18/oz).

Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends are calculated, more than
doubled to $361m during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $177m in the third quarter of
2019. This free cash flow figure does not reflect a portion of the cash flows from Kibali, which
remains in the joint venture bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The
Company’s attributable share of the outstanding cash balance that has not yet been repatriated
from the DRC grew by $66m in the third quarter of 2020 to $359m. Barrick Gold Corporation,
the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding
remittance of this cash balance.

The sale transaction with respect to the South Africa mines was completed on 30 September
2020, resulting in Harmony Gold taking full ownership of the assets and associated liabilities
from 1 October 2020 and making the cash payment of $200m. Closing of the sale transaction
of the Morila Gold Mine in Mali to Mali Lithium is conditional on, among others, Mali Lithium
securing acquisition finance and that the deal be acknowledged without objection by the
Government of Mali. On 28 October 2020, we were advised that Mali Lithium had secured the
required acquisition finance and that this condition has been satisfied. Closing of the transaction
is anticipated to take place soon.

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD Corporation and
Allied Gold Corp) remain committed to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent and completion
of the transaction. Notwithstanding political instability, all parties are actively working to achieve
a solution and closing as soon as possible.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued
reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 September 2020
was 0.36 times compared with 1.06 times as at 30 September 2019. This is the lowest point for
this ratio since 2011, reflecting disciplined reduction in debt and robust cash generation from
the business.
Safety

Regrettably, AngloGold Ashanti had one fatality for the quarter ended 30 September 2020. Our
safe production strategy continues at all operations, with a focus on intensifying our employees'
focus on safety practices in all workplaces in an effort to continue AngloGold Ashanti's
sustainable safety improvement.

All operations remain on high alert with respect to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and
we are actively dealing with both the operational challenges and psychological effects
associated with the virus as well as related protective measures, including lockdown
arrangements.

Guidance*

On 21 September 2020, the Company reinstated its annual guidance given improved operating
certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of its
South African assets, which occurred at the end of September 2020.

For 2020, the group is expected to produce between 3.030Moz and 3.100Moz, including nine
months of production from the South African producing assets, or between 2.800Moz and
2.860Moz on a continuing operations basis. AISC is expected to be between $1,060/oz and
$1,120/oz, including contributions from the South African assets to the end of September 2020,
or between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz on a continuing operations basis. Total capital expenditure
is expected to be between $890m and $950m, including the South African assets to 30
September 2020, or between $850m and $905m on a continuing operations basis.

(Assuming average exchange rates against the US dollar of ZAR16.66/$ (South African Rand);
A$1.45/$ (Australian Dollar); and BRL5.12/$ (Brazilian Real); AP70.00/$ (Argentinian Peso);
with Brent crude oil at $44/bbl on average for the year).
* Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further changes to asset
portfolio and/or operating mines and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have
material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove
to have been correct. Measures taken at our operations together with our business continuity plans aim to enable our operations to deliver in
line with our production targets; we however remain mindful that the Covid-19 pandemic, its impacts on communities and economies, and the
actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation
may be significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December
2019 and the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti’s Prospectus Supplement dated 28 September 2020, each filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

table on page 1.

The South Africa assets sale was completed on 30 September 2020 resulting in Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited taking full ownership of the
assets and associated liabilities from 1 October 2020. As such, AngloGold Ashanti's results for periods subsequent to 1 October 2020 will no longer
include the South African assets. Results from our Mali operations, including Morila and Sadiola, which are in limited operations and under separate sales
processes, are no longer included in our production and ""Non-GAAP"" cost metrics.

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW
THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW

During the third quarter of 2020, AngloGold Ashanti made strong progress executing on all aspects of its strategy, despite the continuing
global spread of COVID-19. Delivery on key objectives continued through the recent leadership change, with meaningful delivery on key
objectives to improve the foundation of the business, including:

  -   Sale of the South African portfolio to Harmony Gold completed on 30 September 2020 and $200m proceeds received                   
  -   Guidance reinstated, providing greater certainty on annual production, costs and capital expenditure                             
  -   Obuasi Phase 1 has been completed, while the project remains within budget and Phase 2 construction on track for completion 
      towards the end of the first quarter of 2021
  -   Achieved commercial production at Boston Shaker underground at Tropicana, on schedule and on budget                              
  -   Sought to maximise benefit of higher gold price through cost management, seeking to limit increases of costs year-on-year        
  -   Near quadrupling of free cash flow to $339m helped drive adjusted net debt down to $875m, its lowest since 2011                  
  -   Further increasing liquidity through issue of $700m 10-year bond at a record low coupon for AGA of 3.75% per annum               
  -   Continued progress towards replacing ore reserves, extending mine lives and improving operating flexibility through exploration  
  -   Increased the dividend payout ratio from 10% to 20% of free cash flow generated before growth capital                            
 
The Company continues to focus on safe production and the health of employees across all operations and ended the quarter with one
fatality and a 31% improvement in the all-injury frequency rate (AIFR), placing it at an all-time low at 2.23 per million hours worked.

Production improved by 1% year-on-year to 837,000oz and total cash costs increased by 2% to $801/oz, compared with 825,000oz at a total
cash cost of $786/oz in the same period in 2019. The solid production result was underpinned by strong performances at most sites, with
standout performances at Sunrise Dam and AGA Mineracao. The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued its ramp up, delivering a 52%
quarter-on-quarter increase in pre-production ounces. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose by only 1%, or $13/oz, to $1,044/oz in the third
quarter of 2020, compared to $1,031/oz in the third quarter of 2019. This largely reflected higher cash costs. COVID-19 related impacts 
resulted in AISC being approximately $51/oz higher for Q3 2020 due to approximately $22m COVID-19 related costs incurred ($33/oz) and 
approximately 18,000oz lost production at the South African operations ($18/oz).

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) increased by 72% to $803m, from $468m in the
third quarter of 2019. Cash flow was robust, demonstrating significant support from the rising gold price. Cash inflow from operating 
activities was up 56% to $551m, from $354m in the same period last year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends 
are calculated, increased by 104% to $361m during the quarter, compared to $177m in the third quarter of 2019.

Free cash flow after growth capital was $339m in the third quarter of 2020, this was a near fourfold increase from the $86m generated in the
comparable quarter of last year, as a result of a 30% higher gold price received, lower costs from continuing operations, lower capital
expenditure, partially offset by higher taxes paid. This free cash flow figure does not reflect a portion of the cash flows from Kibali, which
remain in the joint venture bank account in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Cumulative cash receipts from the DRC for the
third quarter of 2020 totaled $38m, taking cumulative cash receipts received from Kibali (Jersey) Limited for the nine months ended
30 September 2020 to $92m. The Company's attributable share of the outstanding cash balance that has not yet been repatriated from the
DRC grew by $66m in the third quarter of 2020 to $359m. Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture,
continues to engage with the DRC government regarding remittance of this cash balance.

Cash flows were further impacted by VAT receivables that continue to be locked up at Geita ($130m) and Kibali ($68m) as well as by an
increase in lock-up of recoverable export duties at Cerro Vanguardia ($25m). The Finance Act 2020 (No. 8) became effective
on 1 July 2020 in Tanzania, amending the Value Added Tax Act, 2014 (No. 5) without retrospective effect, thereby allowing for the recovery of
VAT refunds for mineral exporters from July 2020 onwards. In Argentina, legislation was adopted to decrease the export duty rate from 12% to 
8% effective from the end of September 2020.

Adjusted net debt decreased to $875m at the end of September 2020, a 39% decline from the end of the previous quarter, and a 47%
reduction year-on-year. At quarter end, we concluded a 10-year $700m bond offering, priced at 3.75% per annum - the lowest achieved by
the Company for a bond offering - with the net proceeds directed to repaying a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the $1.4bn 
multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility in the next quarter. The initial proceeds of $200m received from the sale of the South 
African-producing assets were utilised to further reduce net debt. The balance sheet remains robust, with strong liquidity comprising the $1.4bn 
US dollar RCF of which approximately $700m is undrawn, the undrawn R4.0bn South African RCFs (the R2.5bn RCF was cancelled voluntarily
on 19 October 2020), and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1bn at 30 September 2020. The undrawn $1.0bn syndicated bridge
loan facility, originally entered into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, was
fully cancelled in early October. The Company remains committed to maintaining a flexible balance sheet with an Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA target ratio of 1.0 times through the cycle.

The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 30 September 2020 was 0.36 times compared with 1.06 times as at 30 September
2019. This is the lowest point for this ratio since 2011, reflecting disciplined reduction in debt and robust cash generation from the business.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) decreased by 31% year-on-year to $161m in the third quarter of 2020,
compared to $234m in the third quarter of 2019. This decrease was largely due to lower project spend at Obuasi due to the impact of the
pandemic on delivery of supplies and restrictions on contractor movements and capitalised pre-production revenue offsetting a portion of the
growth capital spend during the quarter. As a result growth capital (non-sustaining) expenditure has declined 76% to $22m in the third quarter
of 2020, compared to $90m in the third quarter of 2019.

Total sustaining capital expenditure declined 3% to $139m in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $144m in the third quarter of 2019. 
Full-year guidance on sustaining capital expenditure for the continuing operations is forecast between $570m and $605m. The strategy of
improving operating flexibility through investment in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological
potential over the next two to three years, remains firmly on track.

OUTLOOK 2020

In line with historical trends, we expect a strong finish to the year, especially at Geita, as well as at the operations in Australia and Brazil. As
we previously flagged during the year, COVID-19 has resulted in some capital expenditure deferrals across the portfolio. At Obuasi, we
expect $70m to $90m of Phase 2 project capital rolling over into 2021.

We expect a significant step up in sustaining capital expenditure in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we invest in waste stripping at Iduapriem
and Tropicana and commence the planned developmental portal of a third underground mining area at the Geita Hill orebody. The portal will
commence from the west and the development will proceed along strike to the eastern extent of the orebody. Geita Hill underground mining
is forecast to start in 2021, having received the necessary regulatory approvals. These investments will be made in parallel with the ongoing
investments in Ore Reserve Development and Exploration.

In addition to tailings storage facilities (TSF) legislation passed in Brazil in 2019, further legislation specifically addressing the acceleration of
the decommissioning of existing TSFs and conversion thereof into dry-stacking structures was promulgated in the third quarter of 2020. It is
anticipated that the additional legislation will result in additional sustaining capital expenditure in 2020 of between $25m and $30m,
increasing to between $70m and $85m in 2021.

For the year-end Reserve declaration, we expect that Ore Reserve pricing will increase by $100/oz to $1,200/oz, reflecting the increased
long term gold price.

For the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to enforce capital and cost discipline across the business, ensuring that we continue to
deliver strong cash flow generation in the elevated gold price environment, while prioritising the health and wellbeing of our employees and
our host communities.

On 21 September 2020, the Company reinstated its annual guidance given improved operating certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and
in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of its South African assets, which occurred at the end of September 2020.

See the announcement : AngloGold Ashanti Reinstates 2020 Guidance on Growing Certainty and Anticipated Conclusion of SA Assets Sale

For 2020, in line with the unchanged reinstated guidance, the group is expected to produce between 3.030Moz and 3.100Moz, including nine
months of production from the South African-producing assets, or between 2.800Moz and 2.860Moz on a continuing operations basis. AISC
is expected to be between $1,060/oz and $1,120/oz including contributions from South African assets to the end of September 2020, or
between $1,050/oz and $1,100/oz on a continuing operations basis. Sustaining capital expenditure is forecast between $610m and $650m,
and non-sustaining capital expenditure between $280m and $300m, or between $570m and $605m and between $280m and $300m on a
continuing operations basis, respectively. Total capital expenditure is expected to be between $890m and $950m, or between $850m and
$905m on a continuing operations basis.

Measures taken at our operations together with our business continuity plans aim to enable our operations to deliver in line with our
production targets; we however, remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts on communities and economies, and the actions
authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

Tragically, AngloGold Ashanti had one fatality for the quarter ended 30 September 2020. The group AIFR, the broadest measure of
workplace safety, improved by 31% year-on-year to 2.23 injuries per million hours worked for the quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 3.23 in the same period in 2019. AIFR measures workplace safety in terms of the total number of injuries and fatalities that
occur per million hours worked (by employees and contractors). Our safe production strategy continues at all operations, with a focus on
intensifying our employees' focus on safety practices in all workplaces in an effort to continue AngloGold Ashanti's sustainable safety
improvement.

All operations remain on high alert with respect to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and we are actively dealing with both the
operational challenges and psychological effects associated with the virus as well as related protective measures, including lockdown
arrangements. The Company remains focused on the execution of its Safe Production Strategy as we aim to continually improve our safety
practices to ensure safe workplaces. Close tracking of High Potential Incidents and low-frequency, high consequence safety events remain
an important source of learning and encourage heightened awareness.

COVID-19

AngloGold Ashanti has taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and business, in line with the
Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in
which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our employees and our host communities remains our key priority. A cross-functional team,
including operations, technical, finance, health, community, government relations and other support disciplines, is helping to guide AngloGold
Ashanti's response to the crisis.

The Company has for some time employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped nonessential travel, instituted
mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures
to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It has also worked with local communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These
initiatives have complemented government responses in each of its operating jurisdictions. We remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic,
its impacts on communities and economies, and the actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

The impact from COVID-19 during the third quarter on production was estimated at 18,000oz, and $51/oz on AISC, an impact on costs of
around 5% ($33/oz impact related to costs incurred and $18/oz related to estimated lost production impacts). All of AngloGold Ashanti's
mines are now operating normally subject to updated protocols and various travel restrictions, except for Cerro Vanguardia which is currently
running at approximately 80% mining capacity due to continuing inter-provincial travel restrictions in Argentina currently preventing certain
employees to get to site. Production targets are still being achieved through processing existing stockpiles.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

Continuing operations

The Continental Africa region delivered a 6% increase in performance year-on-year, with gold production of 411,000oz (inclusive of
47,000oz of capitalised pre-production at Obuasi) at a total cash cost per ounce of $717/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 387,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $740/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
little changed at $903/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $900/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

In Ghana, gold production at Iduapriem was 69,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $646/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September
2020, compared to 73,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $854/oz for the same period last year. Production decreased by 5% year-on-
year due to reduced plant availability related to a longer-than-planned downtime. This was partially offset by 7% higher recovered grade, as a
result of higher feed grade to the plant in line with optimised grade control practices. Costs were favourably impacted by the higher grades,
efficiency gains and lower mining costs as well as favourable moves in stockpiles. These cost tailwinds were partially offset by the rise in
royalties linked to the higher gold price. 

A decision was taken to invest in and accelerate cut 2 waste stripping at the Block 7 and 8 pit, which will extend into 2021. A portion of the
high planned waste stripping in 2021 was brought forward to the fourth quarter in 2020. This will assist in reaching the ore zone earlier which
in turn would lead to a de-risked sequential mine plan in 2021. Further improvements in the crushing circuit via the addition of a tertiary
crusher has also been prioritised for the fourth quarter.

In Tanzania, Geita produced 152,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $628/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared
to 153,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $644/oz for the same period last year. Production was impacted by a 7% reduction in tonnes
treated, related to the installation of ball mill brackets and the annual mill inspection. This was largely offset by a 7% increase in recovered
grade, mainly due to the higher-grade ore sourced from the Nyankanga open pit. Mining at the pit bottom, which is nearing depletion,
continued and offset lower grades from underground operations. Costs were supported by the higher recovered grade and favourable
stockpile movements, which were partially offset by higher royalties, higher costs related to underground mining and an increase in freight
and clearing charges following the implementation by the Government of Tanzania, of a new clearing process for goods entering the country.

In the DRC, Kibali produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $651/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
91,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $586/oz for the same period last year. Production was flat year-on-year as higher throughput
offset the marginally lower recovered grades. Costs were negatively impacted year-on-year due to higher royalties, higher operational costs
and unfavourable movements in stockpiles.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 52,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,197/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared
to 51,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,075/oz for the same period last year. Production improved marginally year-on-year due to
5% higher recovered grade, which largely offset lower throughput. Throughput was lower due to power outages, as well as chute blockages
and a low feed rate to the mill. Total cash costs were 11% higher year-on-year due to an increase in processing costs as a result of the
increase in reagent consumption required for the high levels of carbon in the current period. Increases in the price of lime, cyanide and
activated carbon, as well as higher royalties paid, also negatively impacted costs.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Siguiri's production improved by 4%, which also resulted in a commensurate improvement in total cash costs
per ounce.

The Americas region produced 181,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $674/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 179,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $782/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$963/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,118/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

In Brazil, AGA Mineracao's production was 12% higher year-on-year at 103,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $683/oz for the third
quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to 92,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $847/oz for the same period last year. Production
was higher mainly due to 19% higher tonnes treated at Cuiaba, which was partially offset by lower recovered grade. Costs were favourably
impacted year-on-year due to higher gold production, a weaker exchange rate and lower acid production costs, partially offset by higher
inflation (mainly due to services, spare parts, fuel and power and mine contractors) as well as higher royalties paid.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, AGA Mineracao's production improved by 36%, with total cash costs per ounce improving by 21%.

At Serra Grande, production was 31,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $610/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 31,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $760/oz for the same period last year. Production was stable year-on-year, as higher
tonnes treated offset the lower recovered grade. Costs were 20% lower compared to last year, favourably impacted by an improvement in
efficiencies, a weaker exchange rate and a favourable movement in stockpiles, partially offset by higher inflation (mainly due to services and
power) as well as higher royalties paid.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia produced 47,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $692/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September
2020, compared to 56,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $686/oz for the same period last year. Production was 16% lower year-on-year
due to lower underground ore throughput as a result of limitations imposed on the site by COVID-19, and the impact of lower grades, in line
with the life-of-mine plan. Costs were marginally higher year-on-year mainly due to salary increases, and higher royalties. These costs were
partially offset by higher by-product income derived from a higher average silver price, weaker exchange rate and favourable efficiencies
mainly derived from lower consumption of energy, maintenance services, explosives, other materials and spare parts.

The Australia region produced 149,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $932/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 146,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $775/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$1,174/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,066/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 74,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $967/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 60,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,153/oz for the same period last year. Production was 23% higher year-on-year
mainly due to higher head grade and a 4.5% increase in metallurgical recovery. The higher gold production, along with favourable inventory
movement, contributed to lower total cash costs.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Sunrise Dam's production improved by 25%, with total cash costs per ounce improving by 10%.

The recently discovered Frankie ore body within the Western Ramps complex at Sunrise Dam continued to deliver significant mineralised
intercepts during the quarter and a drilling platform is being developed to enable the area to be drilled at tighter spacing. During the quarter,
open pit mining of the Golden Delicious satellite deposit, 12km from the Sunrise Dam processing plant, was approved. Pre-stripping is now
underway and it is expected that the first ore will be mined in the second quarter of 2021. The pit is expected to deliver approximately
136,000oz over a 2.7 year life.

Production at Tropicana was 75,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $830/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
86,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $521/oz for the same period last year. Production was 13% lower year-on-year as planned, mainly
due to lower ore sourced from open pit mining, as well as the completion of grade streaming activities in the same period of 2019. Mill
throughput and metallurgical recoveries were higher than the same period last year, with the mill feed grade lower at 1.6 g/t reflecting the
completion of grade streaming and the greater proportion of stockpiled ore in mill feed. The lower production, along with unfavourable
inventory movement, contributed to an increase in the Tropicana total cash cost for the September quarter.

The Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana achieved commercial production on schedule, within budget in September. The
underground mine is expected to be at full capacity by the second half of 2021, to contribute approximately 100,000oz p.a. (100%) to annual
gold production over a seven year life.

Discontinued and held for sale operations

Discontinued operations

The South African region produced 96,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,140/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020,
compared to 113,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $973/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019. The region's AISC was
$1,324/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to $1,132/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2019.

Mponeng produced 58,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,094/oz for the third quarter ended 30 September 2020, compared to
65,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $967/oz for the same period last year. Production was 11% lower year-on-year mainly due to poor
ground conditions and safety stoppages combined with the revision of the production schedule post the COVID-19 lockdown. Production was
further impacted due to the lower overall recovered grade as a result of higher marginal ore dump tonnes treated to offset underground
volume losses. Costs increased year-on-year due to lower production, increases in labour costs and the price of consumables, higher royalty
costs, and unfavourable gold-in-process movements. These cost headwinds were partially offset by higher surface volumes treated and
favourable foreign exchange movements.

Surface Operations, including Mine Waste Solutions, produced 38,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $1,213/oz for the third quarter
ended 30 September 2020, compared to 48,000oz at a total cash cost per ounce of $982/oz for the same period last year. Production was
21% lower year-on-year due to the processing of lower grade tailings at the West Wits surface sources and low ore receiving availability at
Vaal River surface sources. This in turn had a negative impact on the overall recovered grade, which declined by 31% year-on-year.

Held for sale operations

In Mali, both our Morila and Sadiola operations are currently under separate sales processes and as such are treated as held for sale. We no
longer include production and ""Non-GAAP"" cost metrics for these operations. At Morila the mine continues to reprocess tailings material
according to plan with the objective of concluding re-processing in early 2021. At Sadiola, which is currently in limited operations, the mine
continues its stockpile treatment plan.

UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Project

Obuasi's redevelopment project continues to make steady progress. As previously highlighted, the COVID-19 pandemic caused some
construction delays and had the effect of limiting mining volumes. At Obuasi, construction of Phase 1 has been completed within budget,
while construction of Phase 2 of the project (to achieve 4,000tpd capacity) remains within budget and on track for completion towards the
end of the first quarter of 2021.

Operational Readiness

Phase 1 (2,000tpd capacity) continued pre-production for the quarter. Pre-production gold production was 47,000oz. Mining rates continued
to be constrained by skilled labour shortages caused by Australian international travel restrictions, though the focus on in-country recruitment
and training has helped bridge the gap. The mine plan has been revised to account for the COVID-19 limitations. This plan intends to
achieve the required ramp up in production in parallel with the construction schedule. Good progress is being made in the second production
area at Block 8-Lower.

Phase 2 Construction

Phase 2 construction reached 78.1% completion, compared to 68.4% at end of the prior quarter. Commissioning of the Phase 2 mill
continues to target early 2021. The KRS shaft, paste-fill plant and the GCVS ventilation shaft continue to target completion at the end of the
first quarter of 2021. The ramp up of Phase 2 capacity to 4,000tpd (~1.7Mtpa) is planned to commence in the second quarter of 2021.

Tropicana - Boston Shaker

On 17 September 2020, we announced that commercial production has been declared at the Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana.
The first production stope was fired in June 2020 and underground ore production has now reached an annualised production rate of 0.7
Mtpa with the design production rate expected to be achieved in March 2021. Boston Shaker is expected to deliver approximately 1.1 million
tonnes of ore per annum at an estimated grade of 3.5 grams/tonne, contributing approximately 100,000 ounces per annum (100% basis) to
gold production over a seven-year mine life.

A decision was made in the second quarter of 2020 to invest in the next cutback of the Havana pit (Stage 2) which is expected to allow
access to the deeper Havana open pit ore from 2022 onwards. While this cutback is being completed, mill feed will be sourced from the
Boston Shaker open pit, resulting in a lower milled grade over the period. The lower grade will be partially offset by the Boston Shaker
underground mine, which is ramping up and is expected to be contributing at full capacity by the second half of 2021.

We still expect gold production (at 100%) in 2020 and 2021, to be between 400,000oz and 450,000oz. From 2022 onwards, annual gold
production is expected to normalise at between 450,000oz and 500,000oz as the low grade stockpile ore in the mill feed is displaced by a
larger proportion of Boston Shaker underground ore and an increasing contribution of higher grade ore from the Havana pit, as the cutback
progresses.

Colombian projects

Quebradona

At our fully owned Quebradona project, the Feasibility Study (FS) continues to progress. The operations team is continuing with construction
readiness, environmental impact assessment (EIA) permitting, optimisation of the capital expenditure requirements which is currently
estimated around $1.3bn and $1.4bn over the first four to five years, and reviewing operational excellence opportunities to improve operating
costs and further enhance the project returns. The work on the FS is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. The project is
expected to treat 6.2Mtpa to produce 3,000Mlb of copper and 1.5Moz of gold over a potential twenty three year life with first production
expected to start in 2025.

Gramalote

During the third quarter of 2020, work continued to advance for infrastructure design, process plant design, pit design and social initiatives.
Resource modelling is anticipated to be completed in November 2020 at which time the final phase of the Gramalote FS work will proceed
based upon updated project parameters. The Gramalote FS work, now managed by B2Gold, our 50% partner, is expected to be completed
in the first quarter of 2021.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Asset sales

South Africa assets

AngloGold Ashanti reached an agreement and concluded the sale of its remaining South African producing assets to Harmony Gold Mining
Company Limited (Harmony Gold). These assets include the Mponeng mine as well as the Surface Operations, including Mine Waste
Solutions. The sale was part of the process of streamlining the AngloGold Ashanti portfolio. The sale transaction was completed on
30 September 2020 resulting in Harmony Gold taking full ownership of the assets and associated liabilities from 1 October 2020 and making
the initial cash payment of $200m.

See the announcement: AngloGold Ashanti Announces Closing of South African Asset Sale, Receipt of Proceeds

Mali assets

On 31 August 2020, AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold agreed to sell their effective 80% stake in the Morila Gold Mine in Mali, to Mali
Lithium. The consideration payable for the purchase is estimated at between $22m and $27m, with the final amount determined with
reference to the closing balance of tax credits in Morila. AngloGold Ashanti estimates that its share of the net consideration will be
approximately $10m or less. On 28 October 2020, we were advised that Mali Lithium had secured the required acquisition finance and that
this condition has been satisfied. Closing of the transaction is anticipated to take place soon.

See the announcement: AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Agree to Sell Morila Mine Stake to Mali Lithium

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD Corporation and Allied Gold Corp) remain committed to the
fulfilment of the conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Progress has been made in the fulfilment of the various conditions
precedent, which include certain approvals by the Government of Mali. However, political instability and related events in Mali have delayed
the process from the originally anticipated timeline. All parties are nevertheless actively working to achieve a solution and closing as soon as
possible.

Bond Issue

On 1 October 2020, AngloGold Ashanti issued an aggregate principal amount of $700m 10-year bonds with a coupon of 3.75% per annum.
The notes were issued by AngloGold Ashanti Holdings plc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and are unsecured and fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by AngloGold Ashanti. The net proceeds from the bond financing have been used to repay a portion of the
outstanding borrowings under the US$1.4bn multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility, which is expected to remain the Company's
primary short-term funding facility. Subsequent to the bond issue, the undrawn $1.0bn syndicated bridge loan facility, originally entered 
into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, was fully cancelled.

Tanzania Arbitration Proceedings Update

The arbitral proceedings against the Government of Tanzania have been stayed at the request of the parties since 15 January 2019 in order
to afford them the opportunity to achieve an amicable resolution of the dispute. On 28 May 2020, the Arbitral Tribunal granted another
extension to stay the arbitral proceedings until 11 September 2020, which has since then been further stayed until 12 March 2021.

Dividend Policy Update

In recognition of the increase in profit margins and the ongoing reduction in borrowings and leverage, going forward, the Company will pay
shareholders 20% of free cash flow before growth capital expenditure, increased from 10% previously. Proceeds from asset sales are excluded 
from this formula. The Company will also double the frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.

The board will continue to exercise discretion in determining the quantum of the dividend, dependent on market conditions and capital requirements.

expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements,
growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of
commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold
Ashanti's liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental

forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially
from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and
operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome
of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and
operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the Risk

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Doubles Dividend Payout Ratio on Stronger Balance Sheet,
Improved Margins

(Press Release – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti will double its dividend payout ratio,
recognising the increase in profit margins and the ongoing reduction in borrowings and
leverage.

The Company will now pay shareholders 20% of its free cash flow before accounting for growth
capital expenditure, increased from 10% previously. The Company will also double the
frequency of payouts from the current annual dividend declaration, to semi-annual payments.
Proceeds from asset sales are excluded from this formula.

“This move demonstrates confidence in our ability to improve direct returns to shareholders
whilst self-funding our growth projects and sustaining capital requirements,” said Christine
Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s interim Chief Executive Officer.

AngloGold Ashanti has prioritised capital discipline and debt reduction over the past five years.
Over that period, it has reduced its Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio from a 2.29
times ratio at 30 September 2015, to a 0.36 times ratio at 30 September 2020. Over the same
period, margins have widened, helped by operating efficiencies and a rising gold price. The
Company has not issued new equity to shareholders for more than a decade.

The board will continue to exercise discretion in determining the quantum of the dividend,
dependent on market conditions and capital requirements.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Announces Closing of South African Asset Sale, Receipt of Proceeds

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that the sale of its remaining mines in
South Africa to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited has concluded, and the initial $200 million
cash payment has been received.

Harmony will now assume full ownership of the portfolio of assets and associated liabilities from
tomorrow, 1 October 2020. This follows the unconditional approval of the transaction by South
Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, earlier this month.

The proceeds from the transaction will be used to further reduce debt.

“Concluding this sale has been important to the execution of our strategy, while also providing
certainty for the long-term and responsible development of these assets,” said Christine Ramon, the
interim Chief Executive Officer of AngloGold Ashanti. “We wish the employees of our South African
operations all the very best in future as they embark on this new chapter in the life of these assets.”

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those
concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs,
all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth
prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project
milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and
production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity
and capital resources and capital expenditures and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or
regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s
operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements
to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking
statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory
environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or
epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and other factors. For a discussion of
such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.
Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes
no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All
subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are
qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce the pricing of an offering of US$700
million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). Subject to customary
conditions, the offering is expected to close on 1 October 2020. The Notes will be issued by AngloGold
Ashanti Holdings plc (the “Issuer”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and will be unsecured and
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The net proceeds from the bond financing will be used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings
under the US$1.4 billion multi-currency syndicated revolving credit facility, which will remain the Company’s
primary short-term funding facility. In addition, the undrawn US$1.0 billion syndicated bridge loan facility,
originally entered into in April 2020 to provide additional financial flexibility amid the uncertainty of the
COVID-19 pandemic, will be automatically canceled in an amount equal to the net proceeds from the
offering.

Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities, CIBC Capital Markets, Citigroup, Deutsche
Bank, J.P. Morgan, RBC Capital Markets, Scotiabank and Standard Chartered Bank are joint bookrunners

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Reinstates 2020 Guidance on Growing Certainty and Anticipated Conclusion of
SA Assets Sale

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti today reinstated annual guidance given
improved operating certainty amid the COVID-19 pandemic and in anticipation of the conclusion of the sale of
its South African assets at the end of this month.

On 14 September 2020, it was announced that all conditions precedent have been met with respect to the sale
of its remaining mines in South Africa (“the transaction”) to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited
(“Harmony”). Consequently, the transaction is scheduled to close in accordance with the transaction
agreement on 30 September 2020, upon which Harmony will assume full ownership and operation of all assets
and liabilities that form part of the transaction.

“We’re pleased to reintroduce guidance, which reflects our greater certainty in relation to full year operating
performance,” said Christine Ramon, AngloGold Ashanti’s interim Chief Executive Officer. “Our operators have
done an outstanding job managing through this period – limiting the impact of COVID-19 on production and
costs, while prioritising the health of our employees and host communities.”

Annual guidance on financial and operating metrics was withdrawn on 27 March 2020 as the pandemic
accelerated and many governments responded by restricting travel, closing borders and ordering some
businesses to cease or limit operations. The Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina, Serra Grande in Brazil and
all South African operations were ordered to close for varying periods, while border closures slowed down the
Obuasi Redevelopment Project. All subsequently returned to full production, whilst the completion date for the
Obuasi project was moved out by three months to the end of the first quarter next year and it remains on track
to meet that schedule.

The Company benefited from its diversified global portfolio and careful management during the intervening
period, with the impact in the first half of the year limited to 85,000oz – or approximately 3% of production –
and $53/oz, or approximately 5% of the all-in sustaining cost during the period. Most of this impact was related
to the South African assets, where the Mponeng mine was ordered to close from 26 March 2020 and only
resumed production on 4 May 2020, after which it was initially allowed to ramp up to just 50% of capacity. The
mine was closed again on 24 May 2020 until 1 June 2020.

AngloGold Ashanti has taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and
business, in line with the Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our
employees and our host communities remains our key priority. A cross-functional team, including operations,
technical, finance, health, community, government relations and other support disciplines, is helping to guide
the response to the crisis.

The Company has for some time employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped non-
essential travel, instituted mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness
across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It
has also worked with local communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These initiatives have
complemented government responses in each of its operating jurisdictions.

While we expect that these measures together with our business continuity plans will enable our operations to
deliver in line with our production targets, we remain mindful that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts on
communities and economies, and the actions authorities may take in response to it, are largely unpredictable.

NEWS RELEASE
Boston Shaker underground mine at Tropicana achieves commercial production

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, in conjunction with its joint venture partner IGO Ltd,
is pleased to announce that commercial production has been declared at the Boston Shaker
underground mine at Tropicana in Western Australia.

Tropicana, located 330 kilometres east-northeast of Kalgoorlie, is managed by AngloGold Ashanti
Australia (AGAA) with a 70% interest. IGO holds a 30% interest.

Development of the Boston Shaker mine was approved in March 2019, and the mine transitioned
into commercial production this month on schedule, below the A$105.7 million (US$77 million)
budget and importantly, with no recordable safety incidents.

Boston Shaker will deliver approximately 1.1 million tonnes of ore per annum at an estimated grade
of 3.5 grams/tonne, contributing approximately 100,000 ounces per annum1 to gold production
over a seven-year mine life.

“Underground mining at Boston Shaker will leverage further value from this high performing
operation, achieving payback in just over three years with upside potential as the deposit remains
open at depth,” AngloGold Ashanti SVP Australia Michael Erickson said.

“The underground mine will contribute higher grade mill feed from the current quarter onwards,
improving the gold production profile and enhancing cash flow during calendar 2021-2023 when
the mine plan includes periods of higher waste stripping in the Havana open pit.”

The first production stope was fired in June 2020 and underground ore production has now
reached an annualized production rate of 0.7 Mtpa with the design production rate expected to be
achieved in March 2021.

The commercial production milestone at Boston Shaker comes after Tropicana produced its 3
millionth ounce in March this year, just seven years after pouring first gold in September 2013.

1   At 100%.

Tropicana strategy and production outlook

From commencement of the operation at Tropicana the mining strategy has been designed to
optimize cash flow, NPV and the delivery of ore.

The Tropicana, Havana, Havana South and Boston Shaker open pits have been mined as a series
of cutbacks, sequenced and scheduled to maximize value at a mining rate that delivers the best
mining unit cost for the scale of the operation. Up until June 2020 ore production from the open
pits exceeded the plant capacity, allowing higher grade ore to be preferentially treated (grade
streaming) while lower grade ore was accumulated on stockpiles.

Over the course of H2 2019 and H1 2020 the Tropicana pit and Havana pit were completed, in line
with the mine plan. As a result, grade streaming came to an end and stockpiled ore is currently
being used to supplement the mill feed from the Havana South and Boston Shaker pits.

A decision was made in the June 2020 quarter to invest in the next cutback of the Havana pit
(Stage 2) which will allow access to the deeper Havana open pit ore from 2022 onwards. While
this cutback is being completed, mill feed will be sourced from the Boston Shaker open pit,
supplemented by approximately 4 Mtpa of low grade (0.85 – 1.05 g/t) stockpiled ore, resulting in a
lower milled grade over the period.

The lower grade will be partially offset by the Boston Shaker underground mine, which is ramping
up and will be contributing at full capacity by the second half of calendar 2021. The plan remains
for gold production (at 100%) in 2020 and 2021, to be between 400,000 and 450,000 oz, compared
to 513,785 oz last year.

From 2022 onwards, annual gold production will normalize at between 450,000 – 500,000 oz as
the low grade stockpile ore in the mill feed is displaced by a larger proportion of Boston Shaker
underground ore and an increasing contribution of higher grade ore from the Havana pit, as the
cutback progresses.

For Figure 1 illustrating tonnes milled by ore source, please refer to the PDF version of the
announcement: https://www.anglogoldashanti.com/investors/announcements/

Cost guidance

Operating costs from 2020 onwards increase with the addition of the Boston Shaker underground
mine. All other costs remain stable, with open pit mining volumes being maintained year-on-year.
All-in-sustaining costs (AISC) increase due to four factors:

•   Lower production – lower year-on-year production spreading fixed costs over a smaller
    volume of production

•   Investment in Havana Stage 2 cut back – Total open pit mining costs are consistent with
    prior years. The focus shifts to waste movement as the Havana stage 2 cut-back continues
    through 2021 and into 2022. The benefit of the cut-back can be seen from the second half of
    calendar 2022 onwards as ore mining and gold production ramps back up.

•   Underground mining costs – additional mining costs with the inclusion of underground
    mining costs from the Boston Shaker underground mine into the operation’s cost structure
•      Non-cash cost elements – In prior years where the operation has mined and built stockpiles,
       costs incurred were accounted for as inventory adjustments and have had the effect of
       enhancing (decreasing) AISC. In 2020 and 2021, as stockpiles are drawn down, the
       associated costs are transferred from the balance sheet to the profit and loss statement, which
       has the effect adding a largely non-cash component to AISC.

Growth Opportunities

Significant potential remains to unlock known extensions of mineralisation beneath the Tropicana
and Havana open pits and the extensions at depth of the Boston Shaker Underground.

Development of an underground drill drive from the Boston Shaker Decline is well advanced with
a total of 240 m completed to date. The drill drive is well positioned to also provide production
access to the Tropicana underground reserve should the drilling prove successful. Underground
diamond drilling is scheduled for the December 2020 quarter with a decision to mine expected
during 2021.

Final trade-off studies are currently being completed on the Havana Stage 3 open pit cut-back and
Havana underground to determine the optimal open pit – underground interface. A decision on the
way forward for Havana Stage 3 is expected to be made during 2021.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Receives Unconditional Approval for the Sale of its South African Mines

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that all conditions precedent have
been met with respect to the sale of its remaining mines in South Africa (“the transaction”) to Harmony
Gold Mining Company Limited (“Harmony”). This includes the unconditional approval by the Department
of Mineral Resources and Energy (“DMRE”) for the transfer of the West Wits mineral rights from
AngloGold Ashanti to Harmony. Consequently, the transaction is scheduled to close in accordance with
the transaction agreement on 30 September 2020, upon which Harmony will assume full ownership and
operation of all assets and liabilities that form part of the transaction.

AngloGold Ashanti is well-positioned to safely deliver better returns as its focus narrows on growing
free cash flow and shareholder dividends, while investing in its next generation of opportunities. “While
the decision to sell our South African assets was not an easy one, we are pleased that the assets are
going to Harmony, a capable and responsible operator that will ensure their long-term sustainability,”
Christine Ramon, Interim CEO of AngloGold Ashanti said. “We can now sharpen our focus to pursue
high return projects at several of our key assets, deliver new ounces from the world class Obuasi mine
in Ghana, and advance studies in Colombia, a new frontier for our business.”

Consideration for the transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around
$300 million, subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits are
developed below current infrastructure. Harmony will pay US$200 million in cash on completion of the
transaction. Furthermore, Harmony has agreed to pay to AngloGold Ashanti:

    • a contingent compensation of US$260 per ounce on underground gold production from the
        Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona mines that exceeds 250,000 ounces per annum for a period
        of six years commencing on 1 January 2021. This is valued at approximately US$100 million
        based on AngloGold Ashanti's current production forecast; and
    • a contingent compensation of US$20 per ounce in relation to underground production sourced
        within the West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona mines)
        below the current infrastructure if it is developed.

The transaction is in line with AngloGold Ashanti’s aim to continually improve its portfolio and supports
its disciplined approach to the allocation of capital and other resources to ensure maximum value
generation for all shareholders. This, together with the pending sales of the Company’s assets in Mali,
will result in a streamlined, high-margin business with quality assets and a robust pipeline for growth.
Gross cash proceeds from the transaction will be applied to further debt reduction.

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Agree to Sell Morila Mine Stake to Mali Lithium

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold have agreed to sell their effective 80% stake
in the Morila Gold Mine in Mali, to Mali Lithium.

Mali Lithium will buy Morila Limited, a Jersey-based company, which is equally owned by AngloGold
and Barrick. Morila Limited owns 80% of Société des Mines de Morila SA (Morila SA), a Malian
registered company in which the State of Mali owns a 20% interest, and in turn owns the Morila Gold
Mine. The transaction is consistent with AngloGold Ashanti’s strategy of rationalising its portfolio to
focus its capital and other resources to maximise returns to its shareholders and other stakeholders.

Morila Gold Mine halted mining operations in 2019, and is currently processing only ore stockpiles. It
produced 27,000oz of gold in 2019. Mali Lithium, based in Perth, Western Australia, aims to increase
sustainable production at Morila Gold Mine as quickly as possible after acquisition. Under the new
ownership structure, the mine has the potential to utilise existing infrastructure to access additional
resources and extend the life of mine using different planning and evaluation criteria, benefiting Morila’s
in-country stakeholders.

The consideration payable for the purchase is estimated at between US$22 million and US$27 million,
with the final amount determined with reference to the closing balance of tax credits in Morila SA. The
consideration received will be allocated against the interests that AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold
hold in Morila Limited, as well as intercompany loans that Barrick Gold Group holds against Morila SA.

AngloGold Ashanti estimates that its share of the net consideration will be approximately US$10m or
less in accordance with the above. Accordingly, this is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements.

The closing of the transaction is conditional on, among others, Mali Lithium securing acquisition finance
and that the deal be acknowledged without objection by the Government of Mali.

Barrick Gold, the operator of Morila Gold Mine, has agreed to work with Mali Lithium on a transition plan
to ensure continuity of key mine management personnel and operations.

AngloGold Ashanti Weathers COVID-19 Disruptions to Post Surge in Free Cash Flow

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti withstood COVID-19-related
disruptions to deliver a solid first half production performance and a surge in free cash flow
generation to $177m, most of it coming in the three months to June 2020.

Free cash flow rose to an inflow of $177m for the first six months of the year, compared to an
outflow of $31m in the same period last year. Of that amount, $173m was generated in the
second quarter of the year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends
are calculated, rose 376% - or nearly fivefold - to $324m.

“The business is in excellent shape - cash flows are extremely robust, demonstrating the
significant operating leverage we have to this strong gold price,” Kelvin Dushnisky, outgoing
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AngloGold Ashanti, said. “While the recent rally in the gold
price is welcome, tight cost and capital management will continue to be the key focus areas
for us as we work to capture this widening margin and increase reserves.”

AngloGold Ashanti is investing in the redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, as well as
exploration and ore reserve development to increase its operating flexibility and increase
reserves. Interim CEO Christine Ramon will continue to focus on the inward investment
programme, with rigorous capital allocation guidelines including leverage and return targets.

Operating Performance

Production in the six months ended 30 June 2020 was 1.469Moz at a total cash cost per ounce
of $810/oz, compared to 1.554Moz at $792/oz for the first six months of last year. Geita
delivered an outstanding performance, Serra Grande posted a strong recovery from the first
quarter while Kibali, Iduapriem, Tropicana and AGA Mineração delivered steady production.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,031/oz for the first six months of 2020, compared to an
AISC of $1,002/oz for the corresponding period last year.

The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on production in the first half of the year was limited to an
estimated 85,000oz, of which 63,000oz related to the South African operations. AISC were
impacted by $53/oz.

Second quarter production increased 5% over the first quarter of 2020, rising to 753,000oz
from 716,000oz. Quarter-on-quarter production improvements were recorded at Sunrise Dam,
Serra Grande, Iduapriem, Obuasi, Geita, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA).
Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of the year increased by 59% to $1.096bn compared
to $689m during the first half of last year, helped by a 26% year-on-year increase in the gold
price received and weaker local currency impacts.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued to ramp up, delivering 50,000oz in the first half
of 2020 despite delays in receiving equipment and the arrival of certain critical skills to the site
as a result of lockdowns in various jurisdictions, with Phase 2 ramp-up expected by the end of
the first quarter of next year.

Free cash flow before growth capital – the metric on which dividends are calculated –
increased significantly to $324m in the first half of 2020, compared to $68m for the same
period in 2019. Cash flows were impacted by VAT that continues to be locked up at Geita and
Kibali, with balances owing at the end of June 2020 of $131m and $71m respectively. At the
end of June 2020, the Company’s attributable share of the outstanding cash balances awaiting
repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)amounted to $293m. Barrick
Gold Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with
the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining Code and the cash repatriation.

The sale processes related to South Africa and Mali continue to progress, with final conditions
precedent to be fulfilled, and the decision was taken to retain CVSA.

The first production stope in Tropicana’s Boston Shaker underground mine was fired in June
2020 and the project remains on track to achieve commercial production in the second half of
2020. The work on the Feasibility Study at the Quebradona project is progressing and is now
expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. At the Gramalote project, our joint venture
partner, B2Gold Corp expects to complete the Feasibility Study in the first quarter of 2021.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued
reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2020
was 0.67 times, well below the targeted level of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 18% to $1.428bn at 30 June 2020, from $1.739bn at 30 June
2019. In order to safeguard the balance sheet during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company
took proactive steps to further bolster liquidity. As at 30 June 2020, the Company’s liquidity
remained strong with approximately $2.47bn available, including cash and cash equivalents
of $1.29bn.

Safety

Regrettably, there was one fatality in the second quarter, involving a Long-haul Dump operator
who was fatally injured in a Heavy Mobile Equipment related incident at Obuasi. Subsequent
to the end of the second quarter, a security guard was fatally injured at the Obuasi mine when
he was struck by a private vehicle that veered off the road. In addition, we have previously
reported four fatalities in the first quarter, which occurred in two separate safety incidents in
March at the Mponeng mine. The tragic occurrence of these fatal incidents remains a stark
reminder that we must continue to redouble our efforts to make sure our employees return
home safely each day.

CEO Change and Executive Team Update

On 30 July 2020, AngloGold Ashanti announced that Mr. Kelvin Dushnisky decided to step
down as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Director, effective 1 September 2020.
The Board of Directors of the Company (Board) thanks Kelvin for his role in advancing
AngloGold Ashanti’s strategy and wishes him the very best in the future. Kelvin will remain in
Toronto to spend time with his family but will be available to assist the group with a smooth
handover until 28 February 2021.

“Kelvin has done an excellent job in delivering on the Company’s strategy and leaves
AngloGold Ashanti in solid shape, with an improving portfolio, robust cash flows and ongoing
debt reduction,” Sipho M. Pityana, AngloGold Ashanti’s Chairman, said.

The Board is also pleased to announce the appointment of Ms. Christine Ramon, currently
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Executive Director, as Interim CEO. Christine will assume
the role from 1 September 2020, while the Board embarks on a comprehensive
recruitment process to find a new permanent CEO. Mr. Ian Kramer, currently Senior Vice
President: Group Finance, will assume the role of Interim CFO for the duration of the

The information on this page is provided for the AngloGold Ashanti group as a whole. Following the announcement of the South Africa assets sale, the South African
operations are classified as an asset held for sale and recorded as a discontinued operation in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months
ended 30 June 2020.
AngloGold Ashanti withstood COVID-19-related disruptions to deliver a solid first half production performance and a surge in free cash flow
generation to $177m, most of it coming in the three months to June 2020.

Free cash flow rose to an inflow of $177m for the first six months of the year, compared to an outflow of $31m in the same period last year.
Of that amount, $173m was generated in the second quarter of the year. Free cash flow before growth capital, the metric on which dividends
are calculated, rose 376% - or nearly fivefold - to $324m.

“The business is in excellent shape - cash flows are extremely robust, demonstrating the significant operating leverage we have to this
strong gold price,” Kelvin Dushnisky, outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AngloGold Ashanti, said. “While the recent rally in the gold
price is welcome, tight cost and capital management will continue to be the key focus areas for us as we work to capture this widening
margin and increase reserves.”

AngloGold Ashanti is investing in the redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, as well as exploration and ore reserve development to
increase its operating flexibility and increase reserves. Interim CEO Christine Ramon will continue to focus on the inward investment
programme, with rigorous capital allocation guidelines including leverage and return targets.

Operating Performance

Production in the six months ended 30 June 2020 was 1.469Moz at a total cash cost per ounce of $810/oz, compared to 1.554Moz at $792/
oz for the first six months of last year. Geita delivered an outstanding performance, Serra Grande posted a strong recovery from the first
quarter while Kibali, Iduapriem, Tropicana and AGA Mineração delivered steady production.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were $1,031/oz for the first six months of 2020, compared to an AISC of $1,002/oz for the corresponding
period last year.

The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on production in the first half of the year was limited to an estimated 85,000oz, of which 63,000oz related
to the South African operations. AISC were impacted by $53/oz.

Second quarter production increased 5% over the first quarter of 2020, rising to 753,000oz from 716,000oz. Quarter-on-quarter production
improvements were recorded at Sunrise Dam, Serra Grande, Iduapriem, Obuasi, Geita, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA).

Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of the year increased by 59% to $1.096bn compared to $689m during the first half of last year,
helped by a 26% year-on-year increase in the gold price received and weaker local currency impacts.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project continued to ramp up, delivering 50,000oz in the first half of 2020 despite delays in receiving equipment
and the arrival of certain critical skills to the site as a result of lockdowns in various jurisdictions, with Phase 2 ramp-up expected by the end
of the first quarter of next year.

Free cash flow before growth capital – the metric on which dividends are calculated – increased significantly to $324m in the first half of
2020, compared to $68m for the same period in 2019. Cash flows were impacted by VAT that continues to be locked up at Geita and Kibali,
with balances owing at the end of June 2020 of $131m and $71m respectively. At the end of June 2020, the Company’s attributable share of
the outstanding cash balances awaiting repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) amounted to $293m. Barrick Gold
Corporation (Barrick), the operator of the Kibali joint venture, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining
Code and the cash repatriation.

The sale processes related to South Africa and Mali continue to progress, with final conditions precedent to be fulfilled, and the decision was
taken to retain CVSA.

The first production stope in Tropicana’s Boston Shaker underground mine was fired in June 2020 and the project remains on track to
achieve commercial production in the second half of 2020. The work on the Feasibility Study at the Quebradona project is progressing and
is now expected to be completed in the first half of 2021. At the Gramalote project, our joint venture partner, B2Gold Corp. expects to
complete the Feasibility Study in the first quarter of 2021.

Balance Sheet

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued reduction in debt. The ratio of Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA at the end of June 2020 was 0.67 times, well below the targeted level of 1.0 times through the cycle.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 18% to $1.428bn at 30 June 2020, from $1.739bn at 30 June 2019. In order to safeguard the balance sheet
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took proactive steps to further bolster liquidity. As at 30 June 2020, the Company’s liquidity
remained strong with approximately $2.47bn available, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.29bn.

Safety

Regrettably, there was one fatality in the second quarter, involving a Long-haul Dump operator who was fatally injured in a Heavy Mobile
Equipment related incident at Obuasi. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, a security guard was fatally injured at the Obuasi mine
when he was struck by a private vehicle that veered off the road. In addition, we have previously reported four fatalities in the first quarter,
which occurred in two separate safety incidents in March at the Mponeng mine. The tragic occurrence of these fatal incidents remains a
stark reminder that we must continue to redouble our efforts to make sure our employees return home safely each day.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI CEO TO STEP DOWN

(JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti announces that Kelvin Dushnisky will step down as chief
executive officer (CEO), effective 1 September 2020. The Board thanks Kelvin for his contribution in
delivering on its strategy and wishes him well in the future. Kelvin will remain in Toronto to spend time
with his family but will be available to assist the group with a smooth handover until 28 February 2021.

“I would like to thank Kelvin for his role in advancing our strategy, and wish him the very best for the
future,” AngloGold Ashanti Chairman Sipho Pityana said. “AngloGold Ashanti is well positioned to
further improve returns for shareholders, through improved operational performance and our rigorous
approach to capital allocation.”

Kelvin leaves AngloGold Ashanti in solid shape, with robust cash flows aiding ongoing debt reduction.
The quality of the portfolio continues to improve, with the agreed sale of our South African assets in
progress, the Obuasi Redevelopment Project ramping up to full production, our two high-quality
Colombia projects progressing through feasibility-study stage, and initiatives to increase reserve life at
key assets, progressing well.

“I’ve enjoyed the challenge of leading AngloGold Ashanti over these past two years, during which time
we’ve made tremendous progress on many fronts, from safety, to effective capital deployment and
streamlining the asset base, all while continuing to deliver strong returns,” Dushnisky said. “I’d like to
thank my executive team and employees across the business for their hard work and dedication, and
the Board for its support.”

Transitional Arrangements

The Board is pleased to announce that Christine Ramon currently chief financial officer (CFO), has
been appointed Interim CEO, whilst the Board embarks on a comprehensive recruitment process to
find a new CEO to deliver on the Group’s strategy for enhanced value creation. Christine will assume
the role on 1 September 2020. The recruitment process will be designed to search for the candidate
with strong leadership skills and relevant industry experience as well as values which are aligned with
AngloGold Ashanti’s.

Christine brings extensive experience and knowledge of the business to the interim role. A chartered
accountant, she has been an executive director of AngloGold Ashanti’s Board and a member of its
executive management team for the past six years. Prior to that, Christine held senior management and
executive positions in various companies, including CFO at Sasol from 2006 to 2013 after having served
as CEO of Johnnic Holdings. Ian Kramer, currently Senior Vice President: Group Finance, will assume
the role of Interim CFO for the duration of the transition period.
During this transitional period the Board, primarily through the Investment Committee and Audit and
Risk Committee, will provide additional guidance and support to the executive management team.

Looking ahead, the Board and executive management have maintained a clear set of near-term
priorities, including safe navigation of the Covid-19 pandemic, prioritising the welfare and safety of our
people and the support of healthcare systems in host communities, while also ensuring continued
operating improvements.

NEWS RELEASE
ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (the “Period”) on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 7 August 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

Expected Headline Earnings and Basic Earnings

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that headline earnings for the
Period are expected to be between $392 million and $416 million, with headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) of between US 94 cents and US 99 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative
period in 2019 were $120 million and US 29 cents, respectively.

The total basic earnings from continuing and discontinued operations (“basic earnings”) for the Period
are expected to be between $410 million and $432 million, resulting in total basic earnings per share
from continuing and discontinued operations (“EPS”) of between US 97 cents and US 102 cents. The
basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were $114 million and US 27 cents, respectively.

The expected overall increases in headline earnings and basic earnings for the Period compared to the
comparative period were primarily due to the following reasons:

•      The gold price received increased by more than 25%;
•      Weaker local currencies mitigated increases in cost of sales;
•      Higher foreign exchange gains of $19 million;
•      Income from joint ventures, mainly Kibali, increased by $41 million (post-tax) or US 10 cents per
       share; and
•      Care & maintenance costs of $21 million (post-tax) or US 5 cents per share incurred at Obuasi
       in the prior year were not repeated in the current Period.

The increases in earnings were partly offset by:
•      Higher taxes, withholding taxes and royalties paid in most jurisdictions and deferred taxes raised
       in Brazil on foreign exchange movements relating to non-monetary assets;
•      Negative movements on realised and unrealised oil and gold derivatives of $18 million (post-
       tax) of US 4 cents per share;
•      Discounting of the Argentine export duties receivable resulted in a decrease in earnings of $11
       million (post-tax) or US 3 cents per share; and
•      A Brazilian power utility legal settlement received in April 2019 of $11 million (post-tax) or US 3
       cents per share not repeated in the current period.

In addition to the above, earnings were favourably impacted in the current Period by $17 million (post-
tax) relating to the non-cash impairment reversal on the South African producing assets and related
liabilities classified as held for sale as a result of the agreement to sell these assets to Harmony Gold
Mining Company Limited. For headline earnings purposes, the impairment reversal is excluded.

South African asset sale and impact of IFRS 5

On 12 February 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited for consideration in
cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of $300 million, subject to subsequent
performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits assets are developed below current
infrastructure.

In terms of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, the Company has determined that the sale of its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities are required to be treated as non-current assets held for sale
and disclosed as discontinued operations. This accounting treatment resulted in the separation of the
earnings disclosures between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the current period
results. Comparative periods will be restated on the same basis.

The effect of the application of IFRS 5 on the current and comparative period earnings will be explained
in the Company’s results announcement on 7 August 2020, which shareholders should consider in
order to gain a full appreciation of the Company’s financial performance.

Operational Performance – Continuing and Discontinued Operations

Production for the six months ended 30 June 2020 is expected to be 1.469Moz, compared to 1.554Moz
for the first six months of 2019. AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid production performance for the first
half of the year, especially given the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance
was supported by strong second-quarter performances from Geita, Iduapriem and Serra Grande, as
well as steady production from Kibali and AGA Mineração. Notable production improvements quarter-
on-quarter were recorded at Sunrise Dam, Siguiri and Cerro Vanguardia (CVSA). The Obuasi
Redevelopment Project continues to ramp up and was impacted by the delays in receiving equipment
and in the arrival of certain critical skills to site due to Covid-19.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or reported
on by AngloGold Ashanti’s external auditors.

all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth
prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project

unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements
to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking
statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and
forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results
could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in

environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates,
the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or

such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the
important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results.
Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes
no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All

Certain statements contained in this document, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, those concerning the economic outlook for
the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating
results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth prospects and outlook of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, individually or in the aggregate, including
the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain of AngloGold Ashanti’s exploration and production
projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti’s liquidity and capital resources and capital expenditures
and the outcome and consequence of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental health and safety issues, are forward-looking
statements regarding AngloGold Ashanti’s operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that
the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have
been correct. Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in
economic, social and political and market conditions, the success of business and operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other
government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings,
any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other business and operational risks and
other factors. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2019, which has
been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause
AngloGold Ashanti’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also
have material adverse effects on future results. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold
Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking
statements attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.

This communication may contain certain “Non-GAAP” financial measures. AngloGold Ashanti utilises certain Non-GAAP performance measures and ratios in
managing its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the reported operating results or cash flow
from operations or any other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the presentation of these measures may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures other companies may use.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti provides further update on COVID-19 cases at Mponeng Mine

25 May, Johannesburg - AngloGold Ashanti advises that, following the announcement made
on 24 May 2020, the full processing of tests from the COVID-19 testing initiative at its Mponeng
Mine is now complete, with 651 tests completed and processed, yielding 196 positive cases.

In the vast majority of these cases, the individuals were asymptomatic, with the balance
showing very mild symptoms. The initiative was undertaken following the detection of a
positive COVID-19 case at the mine last week, after which a comprehensive screening,
contact tracing and testing programme was embarked upon. All positive cases continue to be
isolated in line with national health protocols, with on-site isolation facilities available for those
who may need them.

Operations at Mponeng Mine continue to be voluntarily suspended to enable contact tracing,
further engagement with all relevant stakeholders, and deep cleaning and sanitisation of
workplaces and key infrastructure.

The Department of Health, Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, regional health
authorities and labour unions continue to be fully engaged in the process. The management
of the mine and its medical team are working closely with the regional health authorities in our
joint efforts to slow the rate of infection and to protect those who may be most vulnerable.

Mponeng's COVID-19 risk management plans and protocols remain in place and include:
  o appropriate screening of staff arriving at work;
  o social distancing measures;
  o a cleaning schedule for designated infrastructure;
  o hand-sanitising facilities at the appropriate locations on site, and
  o availability of Personal Protective Equipment for employees, including gloves and face
     masks.

While the Company is well-placed to detect infections and to manage the social and medical
responses required, it recognises that it needs to continue to play a proactive role in the
community in which it is located. To this end, AngloGold Ashanti continues to support a range
of initiatives to provide resources for healthcare providers and communities. This includes
making two hospitals available to the health departments in the North West and Gauteng
provinces for public use; a partnership to provide bulk sanitiser to state hospitals; providing
handwashing stations in high traffic areas and major taxi ranks in Gauteng; distributing care
parcels to vulnerable members of its host communities; procuring ICU beds; and contributing
R20 million to South Africa's Solidarity Response Fund.

the outcome of pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or

Financial and Operating Report

FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE REVIEW

FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW

AngloGold Ashanti recorded a solid operational and financial start to 2020. In February, the Company announced that the year ahead would
be an important transitional year for the business, with investments in our ore bodies to improve operating flexibility and further increase
reserves; progressing the redevelopment of the Obuasi Gold Mine; completing the announced sales of our Sadiola mine and our South
African portfolio; continuing the reduction of debt; and progressing the feasibility studies for the future development of our Colombian
projects. Excellent progress was made in each strategic area of focus despite the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world during the
quarter.

The Company prioritised protection of employees, communities and assets, along with support for government measures to help fight the
pandemic. The geographically diverse portfolio, comprising 14 operating assets across nine countries, provided a measure of protection
against disruptions caused by COVID-19, and the measures employed by governments to slow its spread. In order to further assist with
business continuity, inventories of critical items were built across all sites to an average of four months and ore stockpiles were built to
improve operating flexibility. The Company will continue to regularly update the market on its activities and developments as they unfold.

Production for the first quarter of 2020 was 716,000oz at a total cash cost of $814/oz, compared with 752,000oz at a total cash cost of
$791/ oz in the same period in 2019. AngloGold Ashanti delivered a solid performance, despite the temporary COVID-19 related stoppages
at Serra Grande in Brazil, Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina and the South African operations, which together impacted production by 11,000oz.
Strong performances were delivered by Kibali, Geita and Iduapriem. As a result of lower production year-on-year, combined with higher cash
costs, rehabilitation expenses and sustaining capital expenditure, All-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose by 4%, or $38/oz, to $1,047/oz in the
first quarter of 2020, compared to $1,009/oz in the first quarter of 2019.

Cash flow was robust, demonstrating significant leverage to the rising gold price. Cash inflow from operating activities was up 227% to
$219m in the first quarter of 2020, from $67m in the same period last year. Free cash flow before growth capital - the metric on which
dividends are calculated - increased by 231% to $94m during the first quarter of 2020 versus an outflow of $72m during the same period in
the prior year.

The improvement in free cash flow was achieved despite higher capital expenditure with total growth capital spend of $90m, of which $53m
was spent at Obuasi as its redevelopment project continued, alongside higher operating costs and outstanding cash balances awaiting
repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Company's attributable share of the cash balance available in the DRC
amounted to $252m at the end of March 2020. AngloGold Ashanti received a quarterly dividend of $25m from Kibali at the end of March.
Barrick, the operator of Kibali, continues to engage with the DRC government regarding the 2018 Mining Code and the cash repatriation.

Cash flows were further impacted by VAT which continues to be locked up at Geita and Kibali, and export duties at Cerro Vanguardia.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) increased by 54% to $473m in the first quarter of
2020, from $307m in the first quarter of 2019.

Adjusted net debt decreased by 10% to $1.6bn at 31 March 2020, from $1.78bn at the same time last year. At 31 March 2020, the group had
a cash position of approximately $1.9bn after fully drawing on the US dollar RCF, whilst R1.55bn remains available on the R4bn South
African RCFs. On 15 April 2020, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, AngloGold Ashanti repaid the principal and final coupon of the $700m
10-year bond, which was issued in April 2010. The group is in a strong cash position, and to further bolster available liquidity following the
repayment of the 2010 bonds, has secured additional credit facilities by signing a new standby credit facility of $1bn with a term of 364 days
that can be extended for a further six months with the participating syndicated banks' consent.

The ratio of Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 31 March 2020 was 0.85 times compared with 1.27 times as at 31 March 2019.

Total capital expenditure (including equity accounted investments) increased by 41% year-on-year to $199m in the first quarter of 2020,
compared to $141m in the first quarter of 2019. This increase was largely due to growth capital expenditure at Obuasi, where $53m was
spent in the first quarter of 2020 on the redevelopment of the project, as well as $25m on advancing the Quebradona project. Total sustaining 
capex increased by 5% to $109m in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $104m in the first quarter of 2019. The strategy of improving operating 
flexibility through investment in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological potential over the next two to 
three years, remains intact.

COVID-19

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The accelerating spread of the COVID-19
virus and the extraordinary steps taken by governments across the world to slow it down, have caused significant disruption to normal
operating conditions for businesses across the world.

AngloGold Ashanti has worked alongside authorities and key stakeholders in each operating country to assist public health efforts and to
help slow the spread of the virus. Comprehensive measures have been taken to help protect the well-being of our employees and
communities. Details of our initiatives and the impacts to the business can be found at https://www.anglogoldashanti.com/covid-19/.

The impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 to production and AISC, was 11,000oz and $18/oz respectively. Of the $18/oz AISC impact, 
$16/oz related to the production impact, while additional cost impacts were $2/oz. All of AngloGold Ashanti's mines are now operating normally, 
other than the Mponeng mine in South Africa which started its ramp-up to 50% capacity on 22 April 2020. It will continue to produce at around 
that level until current restrictions are lifted.

We took the step of withdrawing our annual guidance on 27 March 2020, given the prevailing uncertainty caused by the pandemic. We
confirm that our performance year to date is consistent with our prior guidance. Nonetheless, while the prevailing uncertainty persists - in 
respect of the length or severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, or the government actions to stop its spread - guidance will remain suspended.

Plans are in place to ensure business continuity under a range of scenarios. Liquidity has been bolstered as described above.

Inventories of critical spares have been built to cover between three and six months of operations, depending on a number of factors
including the resilience of the supply chains in each jurisdiction, lead times for specific items and available storage capacity. Those stocks
are now at an average of four months across the portfolio. We remain in close contact with our suppliers, many of which are maintaining
inventories in the respective regions for critical items.

We have also identified contingency plans to counter potential disruptions across a wide range of activities in connection with the ongoing
COVID-19 outbreak and are building ore stockpiles to provide additional operating flexibility where possible.

We have further worked closely with our associate partners of Rand Refinery (Pty) Limited in Johannesburg to ensure inbound transport of
gold dore from our African operations through accredited private charters when commercial airlines have suspended operations. The
transport of refined gold from Johannesburg to clients and bullion banks abroad has been ensured by the same means, achieving seamless
refining and sale of our product despite challenges caused by border closures.

Temporary suspensions that were in place during the months of March and April at Serra Grande in Brazil, at Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina
and at the South African operations have since been lifted. Serra Grande has since restarted and is back to operating at normal levels and
Cerro Vanguardia is processing stockpiles and operating at near-planned production rates. In South Africa, surface processing operations
have restarted, since being cleared to restart on 6 April 2020 and the Mponeng underground mine started its ramp-up on 15 April 2020 with
health screening processes, taking the entire South Africa portfolio to 50% of its operating capacity, in line with government regulations.

From a capital allocation standpoint, our strategy and clear approach to managing capital remains unchanged and continues to serve the
Company well - even through this challenging time - as we:

   -  prioritise the safety and health of our employees;
   -  ensure financial flexibility of our business with the aim to generate free cash flow sustainably;
   -  maintain the integrity of our orebodies and the sustainability of our operations;
   -  preserve the long-term options within our portfolio; and
   -  provide returns to our stakeholders, before we invest in growth.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REPORT

SAFETY UPDATE

Regrettably, there were four fatalities in the first quarter of the year which occurred in two separate safety incidents in March at the Mponeng
mine. The first incident occurred on 5 March 2020 when three of our colleagues were fatally injured by a fall of ground, caused by a large
seismic incident roughly 3.6km below surface. The second took place on 16 March 2020 in a tragic accident during an underground
horizontal transport incident, which fatally injured one employee. Subsequent to the quarter end, an employee of Covalent Water, a wholly
owned subsidiary in South Africa, passed away as a result of injuries sustained in an electricity-related incident.

We continue our vigilance and seek to further improve our safety practices to ensure safe workplaces for our colleagues. The All-injury
frequency rate (AIFR), the broadest measure of workplace safety, for the group has improved by 2% to 2.75 injuries per million hours
worked in March 2020, compared to 2.80 injuries per million hours worked in the fourth quarter of 2019. AIFR for the first quarter in 2019
was 4.22 injuries per million hours worked. The safe production strategy which aims towards our goal of zero harm and is aided by safety
campaigns has yielded significant improvements overall, with 22 consecutive months having passed without a fatality across any of our
operations before the tragic incidents during the first quarter of 2020.

AngloGold Ashanti recognises that all our stakeholders have a direct and material interest in the way in which we, as a business, prepare for
and respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, our communities and the regions and countries in which we
operate. We are guided by our values and aim to protect the health of our employees and host communities, while working to ensure
business continuity.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

Continuing operations

The Continental Africa region produced 360,000oz at a total cash cost of $717/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to
338,000oz at a total cash cost of $819/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The region's AISC was $879/oz for the quarter ended 
31 March 2020, compared to $969/oz for the same period in 2019.

In Tanzania, Geita delivered another strong performance, increasing production by 24% year-on-year to 135,000oz at a total cash cost of
$657/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 109,000oz at a total cash cost of $939/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019.
The production performance was boosted by a 35% year-on-year increase in tonnes milled mainly as a result of the planned maintenance of
the ball mill in the first quarter of 2019. Consistent blend feed resulted in higher recoveries in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same
period in 2019. Total cash cost benefitted from higher production volumes, improved mining rates and an increase in the ore stockpile
movement compared to the same period last year. These were partly offset by higher royalty costs and lower recovered grades in the first
quarter of 2020.

In the DRC, Kibali produced 91,000oz at a total cash cost of $583/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 93,000oz at a total
cash cost of $575/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. Production was lower year-on-year as a result of a planned reduction in plant
throughput and the processing of lower grade material from the Sessenge and KCD pits in the first quarter of 2020. Total cash costs
increased due to lower production and higher stockpile utilisation compared to the same period in the prior year. The higher hydropower mix
achieved during the first quarter of 2020 delivered benefits in lower power cost compared to the same period last year.

In Ghana, Iduapriem's production increased by 5% year-on-year to 67,000oz at a total cash cost of $689/oz for the quarter ended 31 March
2020, compared to 64,000oz at a total cash cost of $693/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. Production increased as a result of a 5%
increase in grade due to mining higher grade ore from Blocks 7 and 8 in the Teberebie pit, as per the mining plan. Total cash costs
decreased in line with increased production volumes, partly offset by higher mining costs and royalties paid during the first quarter of 2020.

In Guinea, Siguiri produced 48,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,183/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 49,000oz at a
total cash cost of $1,078/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The mine saw an increase in tonnes treated during the first quarter of 2020,
reflecting the added hard rock processing capacity that came on stream at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Recovered grades were 18%
when compared to the same period last year. This is attributable to the type of ore blend fed to the Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) Combination Plant 
which resulted in high washed residues and increasing solution tail values. Total cash costs increased mainly due to higher processing costs 
and other costs attributable to the operational challenges that were experienced at the mine compared to the same quarter of 2019.

In Mali, at Morila, the mine continues to reprocess tailings material according to plan with the objective of concluding re-processing by end
of 2020. At Sadiola, which is currently in limited operations, the mine continues its stockpile treatment plan.

The Americas region produced 140,000oz at a total cash cost of $829/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to 165,000oz at
a total cash cost of $719/oz in the quarter ended 31 March 2019. AISC for the first quarter of 2020 was $1,157/oz, compared to $967/oz for
the same period in 2019. Total cash costs were higher reflecting lower production and cost escalations across the region. Production for the
region was impacted by lower grades, geotechnical issues in the underground areas in Brazil, unexpected heavy rainfalls and the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary suspension of mining activities at Serra Grande and Cerro Vanguardia.

In Brazil, at AngloGold Ashanti Mineracao, production was 77,000oz at a total cash cost of $834/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020,
compared to 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $733/oz for the same period last year. Production was lower due to the impact of model
changes affecting the access to the high grade orebody at Cuiaba as well as the unexpectedly long and heavy rain season which affected
output from the open pit mine at the Corrego do Sitio (CdS) complex. At Cuiaba, the mine introduced a new underground support standard
and revised mining sequence to address the deteriorating ground conditions which were previously flagged in 2019. Longer and heavier
than normal rains, which extended from October 2019 to March 2020, were the strongest rainfalls experienced in the State of Minas Gerais
in the last 110 years. The underground section was impacted by geotechnical issues, reworks which delayed blasts, low utilisation of
equipment due to absenteeism caused by COVID-19 and a shutdown of the autoclave for unplanned maintenance.

Serra Grande produced 18,000oz at a total cash cost of $993/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 26,000oz at a total cash cost of
$736/oz in the same quarter last year, due to lower grades. Ramp-up of production began on 5 April 2020, following the suspension of
operations which took effect on 27 March 2020 as a result of measures taken by the State of Goias to limit the spread of COVID-19. Total
cash costs were higher year-on-year as a consequence of lower production, partially offset by a favourable movement in the exchange rate
of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar.

In Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia's production decreased by 13% to 45,000oz at a total cash cost of $754/oz for the first quarter of 2020,
compared to 52,000oz at a total cash cost of $677/oz for the first quarter of 2019. Production was mainly impacted by planned lower grades
according to the current life of mine plan and by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension of operations which took
effect on 21 March 2020 as a result of the Argentinean government's measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cerro Vanguardia
restarted milling operations on 6 April 2020. Total cash costs increased year-on-year mainly due to inflationary pressures as a result of
salary increases, higher energy consumption and higher costs for maintenance services, explosives and other materials and spare parts.
This increase was partially compensated by a weaker exchange rate of the Argentinean Peso against the US Dollar, higher by-product
income derived from higher volumes sold as well as higher average silver price. Lower heap leach costs and favourable stockpile
movements due to higher tonnes mined also had a positive impact on total cash costs.

The Australia region produced 130,000oz at a total cash cost of $923/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 158,000oz at a total
cash cost of $687/oz in the first quarter of 2019. AISC for the first quarter of 2020 was $1,184/oz, compared with $919/oz for the same
period in 2019.

Production at Sunrise Dam was 57,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,026/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 72,000oz at a total cash
cost of $854/oz for the first quarter of 2019. The lower head grade in the first quarter of 2020, which was in line with the mine plan, impacted
production negatively. This was however, partially offset by a 3% increase in mill throughput. Stoping flexibility continues to improve and 
underground exploration drilling was ahead of forecast for the first quarter of 2020. As previously flagged, a key focus for Sunrise Dam is 
to deliver the development and drilling needed to grow its Ore Reserves. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, exploration drilling is on track.

Tropicana produced 73,000oz at a total cash cost of $753/oz for the first quarter of 2020, compared to 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $541/oz 
for the first quarter of 2019. The planned 15% drop in production followed the completion of grade streaming in 2019 and reflected a 16%
drop in the mill feed grade to 1.52 g/t, which was offset by minor increases in mill throughput. In line with the mine plan, ore mined from the 
Havana South, Boston Shaker and Havana 02 pits was supplemented by stockpile drawdowns to fill the mill as waste mining was carried out as part 
of the Havana Stage 1 cutback. The Boston Shaker underground mine remains on track to begin production in the second half of 2020 with key 
underground infrastructure progressing to schedule.

During the first quarter of 2020 Tropicana gold production reached the 3-million-ounce milestone, just seven years after the mine poured first
gold. When construction of the mine was approved Ore Reserves (at 100%) totaled 3.3Moz and since then the operation has averaged
production of approximately 470,000oz per annum.

Discontinued operations

The South African region produced 86,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,107/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2020, compared to
92,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,036/oz for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. The AISC for the quarter ended 31 March 2020 was
$1,227/oz, compared to $1,197/oz in 2019, due to lower gold production and higher total cash costs.

Mponeng produced 49,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,087/oz in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 53,000oz at a total cash cost of
$1,073/oz in the first quarter of 2019. Production decreased compared to the same quarter last year mainly because of the extended
Christmas break, with later start-up in January. Production was also impacted by poor ground conditions, safety stoppages due to fatalities
and the unplanned closure beginning on 27 March 2020 due to government restrictions related to COVID-19. Preparation for production from the 
Mponeng underground operation resumed on 22 April 2020, facilitated by no more than half of the usual staff complement, in compliance with the
South African lockdown regulations as amended on 16 April 2020. Production from the mine resumed on 4 May 2020 after following safe start-up procedures.

Surface Operations produced 37,000oz at a total cash cost of $1,137/oz in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 39,000oz at a total cash
cost of $987/oz in the first quarter of 2019. Mine Waste Solutions processed lower tonnes during the first quarter of 2020 due to increased
floor cleaning activities at Sulphur Pay Dam (SPD) tailings storage facility (TSF), which negatively affected throughput, despite the higher-
grade profile of the floor cleaning material. Inclement weather disruptions further contributed to the low tonnage performance. Initiatives are
being investigated to assist with the tonnage shortfall which include high volume trucking contracts to supplement the SPD volume with
Buffels TSF material as well as remote mining operations to mitigate inclement weather stoppages.

The West Wits surface operations' production declined due to poor mill availability, the mining mix which had higher TSF proportions
resulting in lower plant efficiency and the Eskom electricity load shedding. A lower recovery factor was achieved at Vaal River Surface
sources while inefficiencies with fine carbon management were also experienced, which further contributed to the lower recovery achieved.
The carbon management problem has since been rectified. Access to Margaret and Scott marginal ore dumps was secured for ore
treatment, which will maintain a higher grade and better recovery compared to the treatment of TSF material. Despite the nationwide
lockdown, effective on 27 March 2020, AngloGold Ashanti was granted permission by the South African Department of Mineral Resources
and Energy for the limited restart of its Surface Operations in South Africa, which recommenced operations on a limited basis on 6 April
2020.
 
UPDATE ON CAPITAL PROJECTS

Obuasi Redevelopment Project
In Ghana, the Obuasi redevelopment project continued to make good progress, following the first pour of gold in December 2019,
considering the country's responses and restrictions implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Construction of Phase 2 (to achieve a capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day) reached 54.9% completion. Concrete works, structural steel
erection, mechanical equipment installation and tailings facility earthworks progressed well. While procurement is almost complete, some
manufacturing and deliveries have been delayed due to lockdowns in supply countries, while international travel restrictions and country
lockdowns have also hampered mobilisation of critical skills. The areas most impacted are the KRS shaft which is required to increase
mining capacity to 4,000 tonnes per day, and the SAG/Ball Mill installation which is required for the process plant to achieve 4,000 tonnes
per day. Based on current circumstances it is expected that Phase 2 commissioning and ramp-up will be delayed towards the end of the first 
quarter of 2021. However, the cost of the delays is expected to be managed within the project contingency, and the project remains on budget.

Ramp-up of Phase 1 operations (2,000 tonnes per day) progressed well. The process plant achieved design parameters by the end of the
first quarter. Plan run time progressively improved as commissioning issues in a refurbished plant were resolved. However, international travel
restrictions and the encouragement by home countries for expatriates to return home, had some impact on mining operations. The mining
contractor (a 70:30 Joint Venture between African Mining Services and Rocksure International, a Ghanaian company) has been extremely
supportive and most skilled expatriate operators have remained on site. The training focus and skills transfer to the Ghanaian workforce are
achieving good outcomes. Nevertheless, the mine is currently operating at approximately 80% capacity. As a result of the COVID-19
impacts, the declaration of Phase 1 commercial production is now expected in the third quarter of 2020.

Last month, AngloGold Ashanti Ghana partnered with national and local health authorities to increase proactive testing in the Obuasi town
and at the mine, which included voluntary tests of asymptomatic individuals. Proactive testing has identified asymptomatic cases, including
individuals at mine site. All positive cases are required to self-isolate for four weeks per Ghana's national health protocols, while their
contacts must self-quarantine. The early detection of asymptomatic individuals has been key to contain the spread of the disease and to
help ensure minimised impact on the business. The mine's management is awaiting delivery of additional testing equipment, in order to
continue its own ongoing proactive testing of employees with quick turnaround of results.

Tropicana - Boston Shaker
At Tropicana, the Boston Shaker underground mine remains on track to begin production in the second half of 2020. The primary escape
way was successfully installed in the first quarter of 2020 after raise boring finished on target in February 2020. The overhead power line,
high voltage electrical feed and underground power distribution was commissioned in the first quarter of 2020. The primary ventilation fan
chamber has been prepared and installation of the fans is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2020. Surface infrastructure remains
on target to be completed in the second half of 2020. A third drilling jumbo has been mobilised in line with the mining plan. Optimisation work
on level spacing and other initiatives to maximise gold extraction are ongoing.

Colombian projects
At Quebradona, the Feasibility Study (FS) continues to progress and during the first quarter of 2020 the National Environmental Licensing
Authority of Colombia conducted a site evaluation as part of the Environmental Impact Study (EIA). While the work on the FS is still
progressing, the COVID-19 context will likely result in a delay in the completion of the FS, which was previously expected to be completed
by the end of the year.

At Gramalote, it was decided to suspend drilling of the Inferred Mineral Resource following extensive consultation with the surrounding
communities and the Colombian government in view of the national state of emergency and government-mandated quarantine measures.
Our joint venture partner, B2Gold Corp, which manages the project, will continue to progress the FS where possible and expects that the
suspension of drilling will likely delay the completion of the FS to the first quarter of 2021.

CORPORATE UPDATE

Asset sales
The sale processes for our South African portfolio and Sadiola continue to progress.

In respect of the sale of the South African portfolio, both AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony Gold remain committed to the fulfilment of the
conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Certain conditions precedent have already been fulfilled, including the South African
Competition Tribunal approving the transaction, without conditions, on 29 April 2020, based on the recommendation of the South African
Competition Commission. The parties continue to target a completion date of 30 June 2020, subject to any impact that the COVID-19
pandemic may have on the fulfilment of the remaining conditions precedent.

In respect of the sale of Sadiola, all parties (AngloGold Ashanti, IAMGOLD and Allied Gold) remain committed to the fulfilment of the
conditions precedent and completion of the transaction. Good progress has been made in the fulfilment of conditions precedent, including
positive discussions with the Government of Mali and despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, which have
delayed the progress against the originally anticipated timeline when the sale agreement was executed in December 2019.

At Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina, after an extensive sale process and thorough review of the offers received, it has been concluded that the
maximum potential value from the remaining resource endowment of the operation will be better realised inside the AngloGold Ashanti

portfolio, resulting in the decision to retain the asset. Cerro Vanguardia's management team will focus on seeking opportunities to unlock
further reserves and extend the life of mine.

Moody's Investor Services update
AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has affirmed the Company's Baa3 credit rating, with a
stable outlook. Moody's cited the favourable geographic diversification of the Company's portfolio, which offers a de-risked production profile
linked to multiple streams of free cash flow generation. Furthermore, it cited the conservative financial policies in place and the proactive
measures that the Company has taken to manage the COVID-19 impacts. Moody's also noted a strong liquidity position.

Newmont litigation
On 18 March 2020, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed all causes of actions in the lawsuit filed
by Newmont Corp. (formerly Newmont Mining Corp.), against AngloGold Ashanti and certain related parties in 2017, and ordered the case to be closed. 
Newmont Corp. did not appeal the judgement.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Trebles Q1 Cash Flow from Operating Activities; Bolsters
Liquidity to $2bn

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti bolstered its
available liquidity to more than $2bn, improved leverage and more than trebled first
quarter cash flow from operating activities as key mines delivered solid
performances.

A diverse portfolio of 14 mines in nine countries helped limit the impact of COVID-19-
related stoppages to 11,000oz during the first quarter of 2020. First quarter free cash
flow before investment in growth projects – the measure on which dividend
payments are based - rose 231% year-on-year to $94m. Cash flow from operating
activities rose by 227 % from $67m to $219m over the same period.

“Cash flow is strong, leverage is down, and all operations are running,” Chief
Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky said. “We’re making good progress on achieving
our core strategic objectives – including asset sales and the redevelopment of
Obuasi – and have worked hard to ensure we have the liquidity to weather potential
disruptions.”

AngloGold Ashanti received a strong tailwind from bullion prices which averaged
$1,506/oz during the first quarter of 2020 and have continued to rise in subsequent
weeks as investors sought a safe haven. The Company secured an additional $1bn
credit facility to supplement cash on hand of around $1.1bn* as it increased its
liquidity position to withstand any potential disruptions from the COVID-19 epidemic.

AngloGold Ashanti has made good progress in achieving its strategic objectives,
namely the ongoing redevelopment of its Obuasi Gold Mine, investment in the
increase of reserves and mine lives of its key assets, and the process to conclude
the announced sales of assets in South Africa and Mali. These milestones were
achieved despite disruption caused by COVID-19-related stoppages at Serra
Grande, Cerro Vanguardia and the South Africa operations, which straddled the first
and second quarters and have since been lifted.
The announced sale of the South African Operations to Harmony Gold crossed an
important hurdle after the South African Competition Tribunal approved the
transaction, without conditions, on 29 April 2020. AngloGold Ashanti will no longer be
selling its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina, after concluding it can derive more
value for shareholders by developing the remaining potential in the ore body.

The ramp-up of Obuasi’s mining rate to 4,000 tonnes per day, from 2,000 tonnes per
day, is now expected to occur in the first quarter of next year. This is due to slower
shipments of certain equipment to Ghana and difficulties in ensuring key, skilled
employees can travel to the site amidst COVID-19-related border closings. The
project remains on budget.

The Company has taken a pragmatic approach in limiting the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on its operations by building inventories of critical spares and ore stockpiles
to improve the ability to respond to operational disruptions. The Company has also
implemented innovative relief interventions across all host countries, working closely
with governments, peers, and communities to help slow the spread of the pandemic.

PRODUCTION

Production was 716,000oz at a total cash cost of $814/oz for the quarter ended 31
March 2020, from 752,000oz at $791/oz in the same period last year. All-in sustaining
cost (AISC) was $1,047/oz for the three months ended 31 March 2020, compared with
$1,009/oz in the same period last year. Geita and Iduapriem delivered stand out
performances, offsetting lower production at Siguiri, Sunrise Dam and AGA
Mineração.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA) jumped 54% to $473m while free cash flow, before capital expenditure on
growth projects, soared by 231% to $94m. Free cash flow improvements were
achieved despite higher capital expenditure, with growth investment of $90m --
principally at the Obuasi project as its redevelopment continued and outstanding cash
balances available of $252m awaiting repatriation from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

BALANCE SHEET

The balance sheet continues to improve as strong cash flows helped with the
continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was
0.85* times at 31 March 2020, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle.
Adjusted net debt was 10% lower at $1.6bn at quarter end, from $1.78bn at the
same time last year.

The Company is in a strong cash position of $1.1bn after it redeemed the 10-year
$700 million bond and the coupon and has secured additional credit facilities of
$1bn, providing further liquidity in the event of operational disruptions.

SAFETY

Tragically, we lost four colleagues in the first quarter of the year in two separate
incidents in March at the Mponeng mine. The first incident occurred on 5 March 2020
when three of our colleagues were fatally injured by a fall of ground, caused by a large
seismic event roughly 3.6km below surface. The second took place on 16 March 2020
in a tragic accident during an underground horizontal transport incident, which fatally
injured one employee. Subsequent to the quarter end, an employee of Covalent
Water, a wholly owned subsidiary in South Africa, passed away as a result of injuries
sustained in an electricity-related incident.

Despite these fatalities, our pursuit of zero harm remains the priority. The Company
is absolutely focused on this critical area of our business and no effort will be spared
to not only understand the cause of each of these incidents, but also the root cause
of other high potential incidents that could have resulted in fatalities.

The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the
Company’s external auditors

(*) The above results include continuing and discontinued operations.

EXTENTION OF ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (“AGM”)

Shareholders are advised that the Company has applied to the JSE Limited (“JSE”), requesting an extension
for the issue date of the Company’s notice of AGM which, in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, is
required to be distributed by no later than 30 April 2020. The JSE has granted AGA permission to delay the
issue of the notice of AGM and summarised Annual Financial Statements to on or about 20 May 2020.

The rationale for the request to the JSE was due to the current uncertainties with respect to future
developments, including duration, of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited operations of the South African
Post Office, which impacts the Company’s ability to distribute the notice of AGM to its shareholders.

A further announcement providing details of the notice of the AGM will be made at the appropriate time.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides an Update on Restart of Certain Operations

(PRESS RELEASE – JOHANNESBURG) – AngloGold Ashanti recognises the significant global challenge
presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are working closely with governments and civil society groups
in each of our operating jurisdictions to help slow the spread of the virus, mitigate the risks of infection,
ensure the sick receive treatment and cushion the economic impact caused by necessary government
measures to slow its spread. Throughout this process, we continue to prioritise the safety and health of our
employees and host communities.

This update provides details on the restart of production that had been suspended in Argentina, Brazil and
South Africa, highlights the recent affirmation of our credit rating outlook by Moody’s Investor Service and
today’s repayment of the 10-year, $700m bond, which has now matured.

“A diverse portfolio and proactive management of our balance sheet has given us flexibility during this
unprecedented time,” said Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky. “We’re focused on the health of our
employees and our communities, while ensuring we have the ability to contribute meaningfully to a range of
vital public health and economic initiatives in each of our operating jurisdictions.”

Update on operations in Latin America

AngloGold Ashanti’s sole mine in Argentina, Cerro Vanguardia, successfully restarted milling operations on
6 April 2020. The operation has now ramped up capacity and will initially process stockpiles, allowing
production to remain near planned levels with a significantly smaller staff complement. The mining operation
had been suspended since 21 March 2020 as a result of countrywide COVID-19 related restrictions on travel
and border closings.

In 2019, Cerro Vanguardia produced 225,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $859/oz.
In Brazil, at Mineração Serra Grande S.A. (Serra Grande), operations resumed based on the Municipality
Decree and Federal Statement (Ordinance) from the Mining Minister. Ramp up of production began on 5
April 2020 following a suspension that took effect on 27 March 2020 in response to measures taken by local
authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19.

In 2019, Serra Grande produced 123,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,105/oz.

In each case, the resumption of operations has occurred alongside stringent screening, hygiene, social
distancing and other measures designed to mitigate the risk of infection.

The Company’s operations in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil (AGA Mineração) continue as they do in
Australia, Tanzania, the DRC, Guinea, Ghana and Mali. Exploration work in the USA has been suspended
for a time. The situation related to COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly and the Company will continue to
assess developments and provide updates as they occur.

Update on the South African operations

AngloGold Ashanti has been granted permission by the Department of Mineral Resources & Energy for the
limited restart of its Surface Operations in South Africa, which have now recommenced operation on a
limited basis. This includes the processing of marginal ore dumps at the West Wits Operations and the
reclamation of tailings at the Mine Waste Solutions business unit, in the Vaal River region.

The restart of these operations on 6 April 2020 has been facilitated by about 500 employees, spread across
both the West Wits and Vaal River regions. This is less than a third of the usual staff complement for these
business units, and roughly 8% of our total South Africa workforce. All sites have the requisite Covid-19 risk
management plans in place. The limited restart will help safeguard technical infrastructure and enable a
safe and quick resumption of all remaining operations once the lockdown is over.

In 2019, the marginal ore dumps business produced 70,000oz at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,272/oz and
Mine Waste Solutions produced 106,000oz at an AISC of $894/oz.

Production from the Mponeng underground operation remains suspended during the lockdown which is
currently expected to continue to 30 April 2020. This is now the only one of AngloGold Ashanti’s 14
operations where production is currently suspended.

Moody’s Investor Service and Bond Repayment

AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the Company’s
Baa3 credit rating, with a stable outlook.

Moody’s cited the favourable geographic diversification of the Company’s portfolio, which offers a de-risked
production profile which links to multiple streams of free cash flow generation. Furthermore, it cited the
conservative financial policies in place and the proactive measures that the Company has taken to manage
the COVID-19 impacts. Moody’s also noted a strong liquidity position.
AngloGold Ashanti will today repay the principal of $700m on its 10-year bond issued in April 2010, which
has now matured. As announced on 27 March 2020, the funds for the repayment of the bond have been
drawn from the $1.4 billion revolving credit facility. The Company is in a strong cash position after the bond
repayment, and as mentioned on the 27 March 2020 is procuring additional credit facilities to further bolster
available liquidity. Further updates in this regard along with the release of its first quarter market update, on
11 May 2020.

Background

AngloGold Ashanti remains in a state of high-alert and preparedness to deal with the global challenge
presented by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Company has created heightened awareness around the
COVID-19 virus and steps to prevent its spread, stepped up screening and surveillance of employees,
banned non-essential travel, instituted clear self-quarantine measures where applicable and increased
hygiene awareness and facilities across its operations, in addition to a range of other measures taken to
mitigate the risks presented by the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak as it unfolds and
remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our employees and with our key suppliers and
other business partners, to help ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Measures taken in Response to COVID-19

(PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti recognises that the COVID-19 pandemic represents an
unprecedented global challenge that requires cooperation from all members of society.

To date, we have taken a number of proactive steps to protect our employees, our host communities and
business, in line with the Company's values, guidelines and advice provided by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and with the requirements of the countries in which we operate. The health and wellbeing of our
employees and our host communities remains our key priority.

A cross-functional team, including operations, technical, finance, health, community, government relations and
other support disciplines, is helping to guide the response to the crisis. The Company has for some time
employed increased screening and surveillance of employees, stopped non-essential travel, instituted
mandatory quarantine for arriving travellers and increased hygiene awareness across its operations, in addition
to a range of other measures to mitigate the risks presented by the virus. It has also worked with local
communities to help bolster their responses to the outbreak. These initiatives have complemented government
responses in each of its operating jurisdictions.

As a precaution against the potential effects of the pandemic on our ability to secure spares and consumables,
our supply chain teams have proactively placed orders to build increased safety stocks on critical items at our
operations. Specific inventories depend on the level of risk identified in each region, lead time considerations,
and storage capacity. In general, we are targeting inventories of three to six months on primary consumables,
while recognising we have the support of strategic partnerships with key suppliers who themselves are
maintaining inventories in the respective regions for many critical items.

On 21 March 2020, following the Argentinian government’s decision to impose a nationwide lockdown
(quarantine) until 31 March 2020, including temporary travel restrictions, border closings and suspension of
most industries, Cerro Vanguardia S.A. (CVSA) was required to temporarily suspend mining activities.

On 23 March 2020, the South African government announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown, effective from
midnight on 26 March 2020, resulting in the temporary suspension of mining activities of the company’s South

                                                       
African operations particularly Mponeng, and the partial suspension of mining activities at Mine Waste
Solutions and Surface Operations.

On 26 March 2020, the State of Goiás, in Brazil, extended a set of restrictions on the operation of non-essential
business, to include mining. These restrictions are set to run through 4 April 2020. Mineração Serra Grande
S.A. will temporarily suspend its operations.

In each case, the suspension of mining activities will continue for the period during which the respective
restrictions remain in force.

The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines in its diversified portfolio of 14 assets in nine countries, continue to
operate. For the sites where production has been suspended, plans for a safe and smooth ramp-up, and for
safely regaining part of the delayed production, are being developed.

“We have been proactive in positioning ourselves to respond to the impact of the outbreak,” said CEO Kelvin
Dushnisky. “We will respond quickly and work in deep partnership with stakeholders whilst doing our part in
fighting this global pandemic.”

The pandemic, if prolonged, would have a wide range of impacts, including the direct consequences of the
virus on the health of employees and communities, but also the consequent restrictions to travel and work put
in place by governments to slow its spread. There would also be other consequences, including temporary
mine site closures, and the reduced ability to effectively move people, supplies and equipment to sites amongst
others. These may cause production interruptions or delays to projects. These risks are being continually
evaluated and we have – and are developing -- the necessary contingency plans to mitigate them.

The Company had a good start to the year, and – notwithstanding an anticipated impact of 30,000oz – 40,000
oz from operations that are suspended at this stage (less than 2% of annual production) – AngloGold Ashanti
currently remains on track to meet its annual guidance. Nonetheless, given the uncertainties with respect to
future developments, including duration, severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary
government responses to limiting its spread, AngloGold Ashanti has decided to withdraw its market guidance
at this time.

The Company will continue to focus on the necessary steps to protect people, work to meet production targets
and to secure the longer-term future of the business during this period of uncertainty.

AngloGold Ashanti is implementing cash conservation measures, including focused capital prioritisation and
reducing non-essential spending across the business and is well positioned to weather the current market
uncertainty. At the end of 2019, the Company had $463m of cash, $2.0bn of debt and revolving credit facilities
with $1.42bn and R4.65bn available.

The Company has drawn down $1.4bn on its US Dollar RCF to cater for the $700m bond redemption due mid-
April 2020 and to provide additional liquidity headroom. After the drawdowns, cash on hand is approximately
$1.8bn (excluding cash lock-up positions at Kibali and Sadiola, where AngloGold Ashanti’s combined share
totals about $300m). Management will continue to take a prudent and proactive approach to managing the
Company’s liquidity, which may include procuring additional credit facilities or debt over and above its current
facilities.

The Company will continue to provide updates to the market as developments unfold. For additional
information on AngloGold Ashanti’s response to COVID-19, please refer to our website.

PRESS RELEASE

24 March 2020

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Status of South African Assets

(Press Release) – AngloGold Ashanti notes the announcement on Monday evening by
South Africa’s State President Cyril Ramaphosa that the country would go into a nationwide
lockdown for 21 days in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The health and safety of our employees remains our first priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, and is working alongside the
authorities in this regard.

As a result of the President’s order, AngloGold Ashanti will temporarily suspend production
from its South African Operations for three weeks as of midnight on 26 March 2020. These
operations will be safely placed into care and maintenance over that period. Plans will be
developed to help safely regain production delayed by this shutdown, where possible.
The South African operations include the Mponeng Mine, Mine Waste Solutions and surface
rock-dump processing operations. These operations produced 419,000oz for the year ended
31 December 2019.

An agreement has been reached to sell these assets to Harmony Gold Mining Co., a
transaction which is expected to close on about June 30 of this year, subject to certain
conditions precedent. Both parties remain committed to the transaction.

AngloGold Ashanti announced on Friday, 20 March 2020, that it would suspend production
at its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina until the end of the March, in line with a suite of
COVID-19-related work and travel restrictions imposed by the Argentinian Government.
The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate, employing a suite of measures
to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak
as it unfolds and remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our
employees and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help ensure business
continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

(Press Release) – AngloGold Ashanti notes the announcement on Monday evening by
South Africa’s State President Cyril Ramaphosa that the country would go into a nationwide
lockdown for 21 days in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The health and safety of our employees remains our first priority. AngloGold Ashanti is fully
supportive of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, and is working alongside the
authorities in this regard.
As a result of the President’s order, AngloGold Ashanti will temporarily suspend production
from its South African Operations for three weeks as of midnight on 26 March 2020. These
operations will be safely placed into care and maintenance over that period. Plans will be
developed to help safely regain production delayed by this shutdown, where possible.
The South African operations include the Mponeng Mine, Mine Waste Solutions and surface
rock-dump processing operations. These operations produced 419,000oz for the year ended
31 December 2019.

An agreement has been reached to sell these assets to Harmony Gold Mining Co., a
transaction which is expected to close on about June 30 of this year, subject to certain
conditions precedent. Both parties remain committed to the transaction.
AngloGold Ashanti announced on Friday, 20 March 202020, that it would suspend
production at its Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina until the end of the March, in line with a
suite of COVID-19-related work and travel restrictions imposed by the Argentinian
Government.

The rest of AngloGold Ashanti’s mines continue to operate normally, employing a suite of
measures to mitigate the risk of the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
AngloGold Ashanti is continually monitoring the situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak
as it unfolds and remains in close contact with authorities in each country, with our
employees and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help ensure business
continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Provides Update on Argentina Operations

(PRESS RELEASE) – AngloGold Ashanti provides an update on its operations in Argentina given the
recent countrywide restrictions on travel and border closings to the end of this month.

There are no COVID-19 cases at the Cerro Vanguardia mine, the company’s only operation in
Argentina, and which is set to account for about 6% of this year’s production.

Cerro Vanguardia will be required to suspend mining activities during the period of these current
restrictions, which are scheduled to last to the end of March. Safety and environmental monitoring
activities will continue. Plans are being developed to help regain delayed production once mining
operations resume.

This situation related to COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and the Company will continue to assess
developments as they occur.

Background

AngloGold Ashanti remains in a state of high-alert and preparedness to deal with the global
challenge presented by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company has created heightened awareness
around the COVID-19 virus and steps to prevent its spread, stepped up screening and surveillance of
employees, banned non-essential travel, instituted clear self-quarantine measures where applicable
and increased hygiene awareness and facilities across its operations, in addition to a range of other
measures taken to mitigate the risks presented by the virus.

AngloGold Ashanti has a multi-disciplinary COVID-19 taskforce directing the company’s global
response to the crisis, with input from its health, operational, travel, human resources, community
relations, finance and supply teams, among others. Each office and site have emergency
preparedness plans in place, developed in line with national protocols and plans. The first aim is to
protect employees, their families and our host communities.

The worldwide outbreak has thus far not impacted AngloGold Ashanti’s production. The company is,
however, constantly monitoring the situation as it unfolds, all the time remaining in close contact
with authorities in each country and with our key suppliers and other business partners, to help
ensure business continuity and mitigate any interruptions that may occur. The company is also
working with community groups and local authorities, to understand where it can provide support to
healthcare systems as they gear up to manage the pandemic.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Free Cash Flow Jumps 90% to $127m; Lifts Dividend

(PRESS RELEASE - JOHANNESBURG) - AngloGold Ashanti nearly doubled free
cash flow in 2019 to $127m, raised its dividend and improved leverage to below its
target level after a higher gold price and improved efficiencies helped ensure
exceptional performances at a number of its key mines. The Company's safety
performance was also the best on record.

The Company worked to deliver its strategic objectives, meeting guidance on its key
operating metrics for the seventh straight year; concluding agreements to sell its
South African portfolio and the Sadiola mine in Mali; lowering debt; adding reserves
at its retained assets after accounting for depletion; and restarting its Obuasi mine in
Ghana on schedule and on budget. The annual dividend increased by 74% to 165
ZAR cents per share (approximately US 11 cents per share).

""We're working hard to deliver on our strategy and to capture the wider margin in this
strong gold price environment,"" Chief Executive Officer, Kelvin Dushnisky said.
""We're generating strong cash flow from our operations, and that's allowing us to
increase returns to shareholders, strengthen our balance sheet and invest in our ore
bodies.""

AngloGold Ashanti invested sustaining capital of $494m in 2019 and has forecast an
increase to between $640m and $670m in 2020. The additional investment will help
the Company convert existing resources into additional ore reserves and increase
development at its key mines. The added reserves extend mine lives, while more
development will allow greater operating flexibility, which in turn will translate into
more efficient and predictable cost and production outcomes.

Production was 3.281Moz at a total cash cost of $776/oz in the 12 months through
31 December 2019, from 3.400Moz at $773/oz in the previous year. All-in Sustaining
Cost (AISC) was $992/oz for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to
$976/oz for the previous year. Headline earnings of US 91 cents per share, were up
72% from the previous year, while free cash flow before capital expenditure on
growth projects, rose 106% to $448m.
The Company reported exceptional performances from its Geita, Kibali, Tropicana
and Iduapriem mines, with production and efficiency gains partly offset by operating
challenges at its Siguiri and Sunrise Dam mines.

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the
continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was
0.91 times at year end, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle.
Adjusted net debt was 5% lower at $1.581bn at year end, down from $1.659bn at 31
December 2018.

SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE

Production for the second half of 2019 was 1.727Moz at a total cash cost of
$762/oz, compared to 1.772Moz at $726/oz for the last six months of 2018. AISC
was $981/oz for the last six months of 2019, compared to $936/oz for the same
period in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,033m during the second half of 2019, compared to $756m
during the second half of 2018. Free cash flow of $159m was generated in the
second half of 2019, compared to $118m for the second half of 2018.

SAFETY

AngloGold Ashanti's safe production strategy, along with targeted safety campaigns,
have helped ensure a record safety performance for the Company. For the first time
in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a calendar year without a workplace fatality
and injury rates declined by almost two thirds since 2012. While these are important
milestones, the pursuit of zero-harm remains in sharp focus.

GUIDANCE 2020**

Production guidance for the 2020 year is estimated to be between 3.050Moz and
3.300Moz. Total cash costs are estimated to be between $775/oz and $825/oz and
AISC between $1,040/oz and $1,100/oz at average exchange rates against the US
Dollar of 15.00 (South Africa Rand), 3.95 (Brazil Real), 0.70 (Australia Dollar) and
70.00 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $65/bbl average for the year, based on market
expectations.

Total capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $920m and $990m, with the
Company prioritising investment in growing its Ore Reserves and improving
operating flexibility by investing in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve
Conversion at sites with high geological potential. The increase in sustaining capital
for 2020 includes around $30/oz to facilitate additional exploration and development.
Two projects are being advanced simultaneously in Colombia, with the completion of
feasibility studies expected by year end 2020 for both Quebradona and Gramalote,
the latter now managed by B2Gold Corp.


Ends
**Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further
changes to asset portfolio and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated sales in South Africa
and Argentina) and have not been reviewed by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have
material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold
Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from guidance and any deviation may be
significant. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in AngloGold Ashanti's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended
31 December 2018, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Assuming an exchange rate of R1/¢0.3540, the gross dividend payable per share, which is subject to a 20% South African withholding tax, is
equivalent to c.0.5841 cedis. However, the actual rate of payment will depend on the exchange rate on the date for currency conversion.
AngloGold Ashanti nearly doubled free cash flow in 2019 to $127m, raised its dividend and improved leverage to below its target level after a higher
gold price and improved efficiencies helped ensure exceptional performances at a number of its key mines. The Company’s safety performance
was also the best on record.

The Company worked to deliver its strategic objectives, meeting guidance on its key operating metrics for the seventh straight year; concluding
agreements to sell its South African portfolio and the Sadiola mine in Mali; lowering debt; adding reserves at its retained assets after accounting
for depletion; and restarting its Obuasi mine in Ghana on schedule and on budget. The annual dividend increased by 74% to 165 ZAR cents per
share (approximately US 11 cents per share).

“We’re working hard to deliver on our strategy and to capture the wider margin in this strong gold price environment,” Chief Executive Officer, Kelvin
Dushnisky said. “We’re generating strong cash flow from our operations, and that’s allowing us to increase returns to shareholders, strengthen our
balance sheet and invest in our ore bodies.”

AngloGold Ashanti invested sustaining capital of $494m in 2019 and has forecast an increase to between $640m and $670m in 2020. The additional
investment will help the Company convert existing resources into additional ore reserves and increase development at its key mines. The added
reserves extend mine lives, while more development will allow greater operating flexibility, which in turn will translate into more efficient and predictable
cost and production outcomes.

Production was 3.281Moz at a total cash cost of $776/oz in the 12 months through 31 December 2019, from 3.400Moz at $773/oz in the previous
year. All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) was $992/oz for the year ended 31 December 2019, compared to $976/oz for the previous year. Headline
earnings of US 91 cents per share, were up 72% from the previous year, while free cash flow before capital expenditure on growth projects, rose
106% to $448m.

The Company reported exceptional performances from its Geita, Kibali, Tropicana and Iduapriem mines, with production and efficiency gains partly
offset by operating challenges at its Siguiri and Sunrise Dam mines.

The balance sheet continues to improve as stronger cash flows helped with the continued reduction in Adjusted net debt. Adjusted net debt to
Adjusted EBITDA was 0.91 times at year end, below targeted levels of 1.0 times through the cycle. Adjusted net debt was 5% lower at $1.581bn
at year end, down from $1.659bn at 31 December 2018.

SECOND HALF PERFORMANCE

Production for the second half of 2019 was 1.727Moz at a total cash cost of $762/oz, compared to 1.772Moz at $726/oz for the last six months of
2018. AISC was $981/oz for the last six months of 2019, compared to $936/oz for the same period in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,033m during the second half of 2019, compared to $756m during the second half of 2018. Free cash flow of $159m was
generated in the second half of 2019, compared to $118m for the second half of 2018.

SAFETY

AngloGold Ashanti’s safe production strategy, along with targeted safety campaigns, have helped ensure a record safety performance for the
Company. For the first time in its history, AngloGold Ashanti passed a calendar year without a workplace fatality and injury rates declined by almost
two thirds since 2012. While these are important milestones, the pursuit of zero-harm remains in sharp focus.

GUIDANCE 2020**

Production guidance for the 2020 year is estimated to be between 3.050Moz and 3.300Moz. Total cash costs are estimated to be between $775/
oz and $825/oz and AISC between $1,040/oz and $1,100/oz at average exchange rates against the US Dollar of 15.00 (South Africa Rand), 3.95
(Brazil Real), 0.70 (Australia Dollar) and 70.00 (Argentina Peso), with oil at $65/bbl average for the year, based on market expectations.

Total capital expenditure is anticipated to be between $920m and $990m, with the Company prioritising investment in growing its Ore Reserves
and improving operating flexibility by investing in Ore Reserve Development and Reserve Conversion at sites with high geological potential. The
increase in sustaining capital for 2020 includes around $30/oz to facilitate additional exploration and development. Two projects are being advanced
simultaneously in Colombia, with the completion of feasibility studies expected by year end 2020 for both Quebradona and Gramalote, the latter
now managed by B2Gold Corp.

**Both production and cost estimates assume neither operational or labour interruptions, or power disruptions, nor further changes to asset portfolio
and/or operating mines (and thus do not give effect to any of the contemplated sales in South Africa and Argentina) and have not been reviewed
by our external auditors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results and no assurance
can be given that any expectations expressed by AngloGold Ashanti will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, actual results could differ from

NEWS RELEASE

ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

AngloGold Ashanti will release results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"") on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange News Service on 21 February 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next, will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous
corresponding reporting period.

Expected headline earnings and basic loss

Shareholders are advised that the Company has reasonable certainty that the headline earnings for the
period are expected to be between $357 million and $401 million, with headline earnings per share
(""HEPS"") of between 86 cents and 96 cents. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period
were $220 million and 53 cents, respectively.

The total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations) for the period is expected to be
between $26 million and $0 million, resulting in a total basic loss per share of between 6 cents and 0
cents. Basic earnings and basic earnings per share for the comparative period were $133 million and
32 cents, respectively.

The total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations) for the period was negatively
impacted by a non-cash impairment charge of $385 million (post-tax) or 92 cents per share related to
the sale of the South African operations as described below.

South African asset sale and impact of IFRS 5

On 12 February 2020, the Company announced an agreement to sell its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited. Consideration for
the transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around $300 million,
subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West Wits assets are developed
below current infrastructure.

In terms of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations, the Company has determined that the sale of its remaining South African
producing assets and related liabilities are required to be treated as non-current assets held for sale
and disclosed as discontinued operations. This accounting treatment will result in the separation of the
earnings disclosures between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the current period
results. The earnings disclosures for all comparative periods presented will also be separated between
continuing operations and discontinued operations to align with the current year disclosures as required
by IFRS 5.

The effect of the application of IFRS 5 on the current and comparative period earnings will be explained
in the Company's results announcement on 21 February 2020, which shareholders should consider in
order to gain a full appreciation of the Company's financial performance.

The classification of the remaining South African producing assets and related liabilities to held for sale
resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $385m (post-tax) or 92 cents per share accounted for in
order to reflect these assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell,
therefore negatively impacting the total basic loss for the current period.

Headline earnings

The expected overall increase in headline earnings for the period compared to the comparative period
was primarily due to the following reasons:
*      The higher gold price received on gold sold during the period, coupled with weaker local
       currencies assisted the improved financial performance of the Company and more than negated
       the lower gold output, higher operating costs mainly due to inflation and lower grades, and the
       payment of higher royalties and taxes.
*      Income from Kibali and other equity investments increased by $46 million (post-tax) or 11 cents
       per share.

Total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations)

In addition to the effects on headline earnings, total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued
operations) was negatively impacted by the non-cash impairment charge of the South African asset
sale as described above.

This was partially off-set by the non-recurrence of significant once-off items affecting basic earnings for
the prior period as follows:
*       A non-cash impairment of the Uranium plant relating to Mine Waste Solutions of $66 million
        (post-tax) or 16 cents per share.
*       Retrenchment costs related to the restructured South African operations of $25 million (post-
        tax) or 6 cents per share.

The current period headline earnings and total basic loss (from continuing and discontinued operations)
were also negatively impacted by the recognition of an increase in the non-cash environmental
rehabilitation obligation of $15m (post-tax) or 4 cents per share as a result of the changes in
environmental legislation in Brazil relating to tailings storage facilities.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed or
reported on by AngloGold Ashanti's external auditors.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti Agrees South African Asset Sale to Harmony Gold

1. Introduction

AngloGold Ashanti is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement (the
""Agreement"") to sell its remaining South African producing assets and related liabilities
to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (""Harmony""). Consideration for the
transaction is in cash and deferred payments with expected proceeds of around $300
million, subject to subsequent performance, and with additional proceeds if the West
Wits assets are developed below current infrastructure (the ""Transaction"").

AngloGold Ashanti announced in May 2019 that it was undertaking a process to review
sale options for the portfolio of assets, principally comprising the Mponeng
underground mine, where further capital, necessary to extend the mine life was in
competition with other, higher-return AngloGold Ashanti priorities; Mine Waste
Solutions, the mine waste retreatment operation; and a surface rock dump processing
business. The sale is part of the process of streamlining AngloGold Ashanti's portfolio,
in line with its clear capital allocation framework, to create a more focused business
with enhanced operating and financial metrics.

A rigorous nine-month sales process identified Harmony as the most suitable party to
acquire these assets, given its financial capacity and proven technical capability in
operating ultra-deep, hard-rock mining assets in South Africa.

""From the beginning of the process an objective has been to sell our SA assets to a
strong, capable and responsible operator that will ensure their long-term sustainability;
we believe that this transaction achieves that,"" Kelvin Dushnisky, CEO of AngloGold
Ashanti said. ""This sale helps deliver on our commitment to sharpen our management
focus and capital allocation on the highest return investment options available to us.""

AngloGold Ashanti will continue its work to position the Company to deliver long-term
value for stakeholders through performance, disciplined capital allocation, as
demonstrated by this pro-active portfolio management, and ongoing review of all
aspects of its corporate structure.

AngloGold Ashanti has 14 gold-producing operations in nine countries. Its mines
include differing ore-body types, located in key gold-producing regions around the
world. Its business activities span the full spectrum of the mining value chain - from
exploration through mining to the production of refined gold and its sale.

2. Transaction Details

     2.1. Relevant assets and liabilities

The Transaction will include the following assets and liabilities:
   * The Mponeng mine and its associated assets and liabilities;
   * The Tau Tona and Savuka mines and associated rock-dump and tailings
      storage facility reclamation sites, mine rehabilitation and closure activities
      located in the West Wits region and their associated assets and liabilities;
   * First Uranium (Pty) Limited which owns Mine Waste Solutions (Pty) Limited and
      Chemwes (Pty) Limited as well as associated tailings assets and liabilities;
   * Covalent Water Company (Pty) Limited, AngloGold Security Services (Pty)
      Limited and Masakhisane Investments (Pty) Limited; and
   * Certain rock-dump reclamation, mine rehabilitation and closure activities
      located in the Vaal River region and their associated assets and liabilities.

Together these assets produced revenue of ZAR8,047 million and profit after tax of
ZAR331 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. The book value of these assets
as at 31 December 2019 was ZAR9,901 million.1

AngloGold Ashanti will retain its interest in Rand Refinery Limited as well as its
obligations relating to the post-retirement medical cost for its applicable retired and
remaining employees and its obligations under the Silicosis Class Action Settlement
Agreement.

     2.2. Consideration

The Transaction consideration comprises three elements:
   * US$200m in cash payable at closing; and
   * Two components of deferred consideration, payable as follows
      a. US$260 per ounce payable on all underground production sourced within
         the West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and
         TauTona mines) in excess of 250,000 ounces per annum for 6 years
         commencing 1 January 2021. This was agreed between the parties on the
         basis that it is expected to deliver aggregate nominal proceeds to AngloGold
         Ashanti in the order of US$100 million using AngloGold Ashanti's

1
  The results form part of the unaudited historical combined information for the year ended 31 December 2019, prepared of the
assets and liabilities forming part of the transaction, which has been based on management accounts. AngloGold Ashanti is
satisfied with these management accounts which form part of its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

In preparing the unaudited historical financial statements of the assets and liabilities forming part of the transaction, the recognition
and measurement principles of IFRS, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee,
and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council have been applied, however,
since IFRS do not provide for the preparation of unaudited historical combined financial information, in preparing these results
certain accounting conventions commonly used in the preparation of unaudited historical combined financial information have
been applied.

           assumptions regarding production from Mponeng Mine during this period;
           and
        b. US$20 per ounce payable on underground production sourced within the
           West Wits mineral rights (comprising the Mponeng, Savuka and TauTona
           mines) below the datum of current infrastructure. This currently constitutes
           8.53 million ounces of reserves. If all these reserves were mined it would
           therefore deliver additional aggregate nominal proceeds of approximately
           US$170 million to AngloGold Ashanti over the period that the ounces are
           mined.

AngloGold Ashanti intends to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce net debt.

   2.3. Significant terms of the Agreement

The Agreement provides for terms customary in agreements of this nature and is
subject to customary conditions precedent. Key conditions precedent includes:

   *    Approval from the South African Competition Authorities in terms of the
        Competition Act, 1998; and
   *    Section 11 approval from the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy in
        terms of the MPRDA in relation to West Wits Mineral Right.

   2.4. Timing and Effective Date

AngloGold Ashanti and Harmony have committed to engage with the relevant
authorities and other stakeholders in order to ensure the conditions precedent are
fulfilled as soon as possible with earliest closing anticipated on or about 30 June 2020.

The Transaction is deemed a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited.

               operating cost per ounce

1   AngloGold Ashanti will publish its own pricing sensitivities upon completion of the Feasibility Study

                                                                                                                               1
       o   Average LOM all-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") of $648 per ounce of gold, and
           average LOM all-in costs (including pre-production capital costs) of $882 per ounce
           of gold
       o Annual processing rate of 11.0 million tonnes per annum (""Mtpa"")
       o Average LOM gold recovery of 94.3% from conventional milling, flotation and
           cyanide leach of the flotation concentrate
       o Estimated pre-production capital cost of $901 million (includes approximately $160
           million for mining equipment)
       o LOM pre-tax net cash flow of $1,827 million, and after-tax net cash flow of $1,283
           million
       o Assuming a discount rate of 5%, net present value (""NPV"") pre-tax of $1,027 million
           and NPV after-tax of $671 million, generating an after-tax internal rate of return
           (""IRR"") of 18.1% at the project construction decision date (estimated to be January
           1, 2021), with a project payback (including construction capital) of 3.6 years
       o Assuming a gold price of $1,500 per ounce and a discount rate of 5%, NPV pre-
           tax increases to $1,394 million and NPV after-tax increases to $928 million,
           generating an after-tax IRR of 21.9% at the project construction decision date
           (estimated to be January 1, 2021), and reducing the project payback (including
           construction capital) to 3.2 years
   *   Continue ongoing feasibility work to optimize the PEA results and a final feasibility
       study expected to be completed by December 31, 2020
   *   Amended and restated shareholders agreement signed by B2Gold and AGA on
       December 23, 2019 under which B2Gold agreed to sole fund the next $13.9 million of
       expenditures on the Gramalote Project, following which B2Gold and AGA will each
       hold a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture (currently 48.3% B2Gold and 51.7%
       AGA)
   *   Exploration drilling is ongoing at the Trinidad deposit, with additional drilling at the
       Monjas zone to commence later in 2020

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered
too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would
enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA
based on these Mineral Resources will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral
Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

B2Gold is currently completing approximately 42,500 metres of infill drilling at Gramalote
Ridge to convert existing Inferred Mineral Resources to an Indicated category, and 7,645
metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure.

PEA Overview

The Gramalote Project is located in central Colombia, approximately 230 kilometres (""km"")
northwest of Bogota and 120 km northeast of Medellin, in the Province of Antioquia which has
expressed a positive attitude towards the development of responsible mining projects in the
region. The PEA was prepared by B2Gold and evaluates recovery of gold from a an open pit
mining operation that will move up to 143,000 tonnes per day (""tpd"") (50.0 Mtpa), with a
30,137 tpd (11.0 Mtpa) processing plant that includes crushing, grinding, flotation, with fine
grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of both the flotation concentrate and
the flotation tails followed by a carbon-in-pulp recovery process to produce dore bullion. The
PEA is based solely on production from the Gramalote Ridge deposit and does not include
potential production from the nearby Trinidad deposit, which has a current Inferred Mineral
Resource estimate (see above), and the Monjas West zone. The Mineral Resource estimate
for Gramalote Ridge that forms the basis for the PEA includes Indicated Mineral Resources of
70,110,000 tonnes grading 0.92 g/t gold for a total of 2,070,000 ounces of gold, and Inferred
Mineral Resources of 79,030,000 tonnes grading 0.79 g/t gold for a total of 2,010,000 ounces
of gold.

The PEA updates and enhances the previous studies on the Gramalote Project in several
areas, including:
*      For Gramalote Ridge, additional drilling has been completed, and a new Mineral
       Resource model has been developed
*      The PEA is based solely on Gramalote Ridge Mineral Resources, where the previous
       studies included mining and processing ore from Trinidad deposit and the Monjas West
       zone
*      Recent metallurgical test work has resulted in slightly lower processing costs and
       improved economics
*      The new Mineral Resource model for Gramalote Ridge includes new interpretations of
       higher grade ore zones and has allowed more efficient mine optimization, which has
       resulted in higher grade ore being fed to the plant during the first years of production,
       significantly improving project economic
*      Due to better defined high-grade zones in Gramalote Ridge in the block model, the
       overall gold grade for the PEA is 0.85 g/t, which is significantly higher than previous
       studies

Accelerated mining is planned in the early years of production to provide higher grade feed to
the plant while stockpiling lower grade material. The final four years of plant feed are from low
grade stockpiles and oxide ore. Oxide ore, which only makes up about 3% of the plant feed,
will be stockpiled and processed at the very end of the project life as blending this material
with the fresh ore does not yield optimal gold recoveries.

The PEA assumptions include revenues using a gold price of $1,350 per ounce and current
prices for fuel, reagents, labor, power and other consumables. The key parameters of the
PEA are presented in the following table (100% basis):

Based on the positive results from the PEA, B2Gold believes that the Gramalote Project has
the potential, to become a large low-cost open pit gold mine, subject to completion of ongoing
infill drilling and the results of a final feasibility study expected by the end of 2020. The
Gramalote Project has several key infrastructure advantages, including:
*      Reliable water supply - high rainfall region and located next to the Nus River
*      Adjacent to a national highway, which connects directly to Medellin and to a major river
       with port facilities, capable of bringing supplies by barge to within 70 kilometres of the
       site
*      Proximity to the national electricity grid with ample low-cost power and stable record
       of hydroelectric power
*      Skilled labor workforce within Colombia

In addition, B2Gold expects the Gramalote Project to benefit from several key operational
advantages, including:
*      Excellent metallurgical characteristics of the ore, which results in high recovery rates
       at low processing costs
*      Relatively low strip ratio in the mine (1.9:1)
*      Ability to mine and process higher grade ore in the initial years of the mine life resulting
       in improved project economics

The PEA is subject to a number of assumptions and risks, including among others, that a
Modified Environment Impact Study and a Modified Project Implementation plan will be
approved within the required timeline, all required permits and other rights will be obtained in
a timely manner, the Gramalote Project will have the support of the local government and
community, the regulatory environment will remain consistent and no material increase will
have occurred to the estimated costs.

Economic Sensitivities

Gramalote is a large, low grade, low cost project and sensitive to the gold price, as
demonstrated in the following table:

Project Next Steps

B2Gold and AngloGold have agreed on a budget for the feasibility study on the Gramalote
Project of approximately $37 million through the end of 2020. This budget will fund 42,500
metres of infill drilling to convert existing Inferred Mineral Resources to the Indicated category,
and 7,645 metres of geotechnical drilling for site infrastructure. The Company currently
expects to complete all drilling by the end of May 2020. In addition, the budget will fund
feasibility work including an updated Mineral Resource estimate, detailed mine planning,
ongoing environmental studies, additional metallurgical test work, engineering and detailed
economic analysis.

The Gramalote joint venture will continue to advance resettlement programs, establish
coexistence programs for small miners, work on health, safety and environmental projects and
continue to work with government and local communities on social programs. B2Gold, as
manager, plans to continue the feasibility work with the goal of B2Gold completing a final
feasibility study by December 31, 2020. Due to the amount of work completed by AGA over
the past several years, including extensive testing programs, the work with local communities
and small miners, and the high level of engineering performed in 2017 for an internal study,
the work remaining to reach final feasibility is not extensive. The main work program for
feasibility is infill drilling to confirm and upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resources to the Indicated
category.
The Environmental Impact Study and Project Implementation Plans for the Gramalote Project
have been fully approved by the National Authority of Environmental Licenses of Colombia.
Due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations, a
Modified Environment Impact Study and a Modified Project Implementation plan were
submitted and are currently in the final approval process. If the final economics of the feasibility
study are positive and the joint venture makes the decision to develop Gramalote as an open-
pit gold mine, B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine
and mill facilities and operate the mine on behalf of the joint venture.

NEWS RELEASE

AngloGold Ashanti's Obuasi Gold Mine Pours First Gold - On Time and On Budget

(JOHANNESBURG - PRESS RELEASE) - AngloGold Ashanti (Ghana) Limited (the
Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti, has achieved its first pour of
gold from the Obuasi Gold Mine, signaling the successful redevelopment of the mine into a
modern, mechanized mining operation since mining activities were suspended five years
ago.

The Obuasi Redevelopment Project, which seeks to access Obuasi's 30-million-ounce ore
body over the next two decades and beyond, has completed the first phase of construction
on time and on budget. Refurbishment of an existing plant and construction of new
infrastructure and underground development, in line with a new mine plan, has taken place
over the past 18 months.

""Producing first gold on budget and on a tight schedule is a significant achievement for the
Company, for the community at Obuasi and for Ghana as a whole,"" said AngloGold Ashanti
Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Dushnisky. ""Restarting this important mine is testament to the
focused execution by our team on the ground, as well as the clear investment framework
and supportive environment created by the President of Ghana and his government, and the
King of Ashanti.""

Following a ramp-up period, AngloGold Ashanti estimates mining at a rate of 2,000 tons per
day from Obuasi during 2020, climbing to 4,000 tons per day by year-end. The mine will be
producing gold at an average run-rate of 350,000oz - 400,000oz per year for the first ten
years, and above 400,000oz over the life of mine at all-in sustaining costs of around
$800/oz.

""The team has done an excellent job completing the first phase of this project and will be
focused on ramping up production through next year,"" said Graham Ehm, AngloGold
Ashanti's Executive Vice President of Group Planning and Technical, who is overseeing the
project. ""The difficult decision was made to suspend production in 2014 to rebuild the mine's
foundation for a sustainable long-term future that will bring benefit to the region over the
coming decades. We are tremendously proud of what has been achieved since then.""

The underground mine development is ongoing, with deepening of the Obuasi Deeps
Decline and access to the KRS shaft on schedule for mid-2020. The construction of new
plant and infrastructure will continue in 2020. The initial project capital for Obuasi remains in
the range of $495m to $545m, spent between 2018 to the end of 2020

AngloGold Ashanti is working closely with government and community stakeholders to
ensure that the Obuasi mine is developed sustainably, fuelling growth for Ghana and
benefitting the communities around the mine. A committee, including local stakeholders and
regulators, has been created to track execution of the reclamation of the mine site and the
mine will also be contributing $2/oz of gold produced to a Community Trust Fund, over its
life, to facilitate development projects in the local area.

The project has placed a premium on local content, with 80% of the capital thus far spent in-
country, according to the Managing Director of the Obuasi Mine, Eric Asubonteng. Ghanaian
companies have been given preference in the procurement of goods and services, from the
large-value underground mining contract all the way to catering and security contracts.
Employment has also prioritised Ghanaians from the immediate area around the mine
wherever possible, with Ghanaians from elsewhere in the country next in line for recruitment
in available roles.
