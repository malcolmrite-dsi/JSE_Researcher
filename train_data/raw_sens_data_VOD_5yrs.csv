Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Having responded rapidly to help curb the spread of COVID-19 earlier in the year, Vodacom Group has turned its attention to
contributing meaningfully to the economic recovery in markets where we operate following the often devastating impacts of
the global pandemic on society.

Through a wide range of initiatives, including free devices and airtime for healthcare workers, cash donations and strategic
partnerships, we continue to deliver on our Social Contract with stakeholders to contribute positively to a number of
pressing societal challenges. For example, we prioritised the resilience of our networks, accelerated support to governments
via donations of handsets, connectivity and medical equipment and made contactless payments more accessible through
zero-rated services and an expanded M-Pesa ecosystem to address social distancing challenges. In addition, and given that
collaboration is instrumental to the economic recovery, we remain committed to establishing innovative partnerships with
an emphasis on health, education, free public benefit services, big data analytics and financial services to complement those
already concluded in recent times with Alipay, Discovery Health and Microsoft.
To help cope with sharp increases in data traffic and shifts in customer behaviour patterns, we accelerated network
infrastructure spend over the six-month period to R6.6 billion, including R5.0 billion in South Africa, keeping families
connected, enabling businesses to operate, facilitating online learning and assisting governments in providing critical
services.
In South Africa, data usage surged +86%, as connectivity demands changed with a need to work, entertain and educate from
home, and as we made substantial reductions in monthly data bundle tariffs. Also, the launch of ConnectU, which provides
zero-rated access to a wide range of websites, including jobs portals and online learning platforms and discounted offers for
poor communities, supported higher usage.
Considering the magnitude of challenges arising from the pandemic in the past six months, it is particularly pleasing that we
recorded a solid financial performance at Group level, where service revenue increased 7.0%. This was underpinned by
strong growth from our Consumer and Enterprise businesses in South Africa, where service revenue rose 7.1% despite
reductions of up to 40% in monthly data bundles which came into effect on 1 April 2020.
In line with our strategy of delivering great value and an exceptional experience to our customers, we recently launched our
loyalty programme “VodaBucks” to complement personalised and segmented offers to customers. These draw on our
expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance customer engagement and provide financial relief at a
time when consumers are increasingly under pressure.
Investment into digital innovation is key to the Group’s growth outlook of which our Financial Services business is an
important enabler. In partnership with Alipay, Vodacom Financial Services is developing a single lifestyle app for both
customers and merchants that promotes greater financial inclusion. Already, our execution in the financial services space in
South Africa is evidenced by the rapid growth of Airtime Advance and insurance services. Airtime advance customers
increased 14.1% to
10.1 million.
While initiatives such as free peer-to-peer (P2P) M-Pesa transactions at the onset of COVID-19 impacted the financial
performance of our International portfolio, it played an important role in facilitating economic activity in addition to being
the right thing to do for customers. Subsequently, this has supported accelerated platform growth and customer adoption of
digital channels to the point where the M-Pesa ecosystem now processes US$20.5 billion a month in transactions across our
International markets, including Safaricom, and contributed R8 billion in revenue in the period.
Following a sustained period of very strong growth, the performance of our International operations was impacted by
disrupted economies and livelihoods on the back of COVID-19, resulting in a 5.2%* decline in service revenue in constant
currency terms. Our reported results show service revenue growth of 5.8%, benefitting from rand weakness. We expect
consumer spend to recover as trading and economies re-open from lockdowns.
Our strategic investment in Safaricom delivered a 52.2% boost in our operating profit, buoyed by currency factors and a one-
off deferred tax rate adjustment of R0.8 billion. Safaricom’s local currency results reflect the impact of depressed economic
activity and lower M-Pesa P2P monetisation, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Safaricom accelerated capital expenditure
by 25.5%, supporting platform growth and a notable financial improvement into the second quarter compared with the first
quarter.
Looking forward, we remain cautious about the pace of economic recovery across our markets as disposable income will
remain under pressure as a result of unemployment and depressed economic activity. Still, we remain steadfast in our quest
to entrench Vodacom Group as a leading pan-African technology company and firmly believe that our investment into
financial, digital and lifestyle services will increasingly provide opportunities to deepen our relationship with the 120 million
customers who choose to use the Vodacom Group network across our footprint.

Dividend policy

intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend received, net of
withholding tax.

The Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining such sums and repaying such
borrowings owing to third parties as shall be necessary to meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan,
taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement to dividends
arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE
Listings Requirements.

Vodacom Group Limited trading update for the quarter ended 30 June 2020 (short form announcement)
Highlights

- Group service revenue was up 7.6% (2.6%*) and Group revenue grew by 5.6% (1.3%*), benefitting from strong growth
  in South Africa with customer demand increasing during the lock down period, while the International operations were
  negatively impacted by lower economic activity from the effects of COVID-19.
- South Africa service revenue growth was solid at 6.4% for the quarter, supported by strong demand for data and
  connectivity services in the period.
- International service revenue grew by 10.7% benefiting from the rand devaluation. Underlying performance was
  subdued with a 5.3% decline, as a result of lower economic trading activity, free M-Pesa services and customer
  registration requirements in these businesses.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
In the face of an unprecedented global pandemic, Vodacom Group has responded rapidly to assist governments where it
operates in curbing the spread of COVID-19 while also adapting to significant changes in customer demands and behaviour
patterns. In South Africa, the combination of increased demand for data following significant tariff reductions of up to 40%
effected on 1 April and more people working and being educated remotely, resulted in a significant increase in mobile and
fixed traffic in the first quarter.

As a result, we accelerated network infrastructure spend by R500 million to R2.7 billion in Q1 and used the temporary
assignment of spectrum by ICASA to rapidly increase network capacity to ensure that we continue to deliver a high quality
experience to customers. The temporary spectrum assignment also allowed us to fast track the launch of South Africa’s first
mobile 5G network and our fixed 5G commercial service.
Collaboration is instrumental in defeating COVID-19 and it is for this reason we have concluded a number of innovative
partnerships in recent months with particular emphasis on health, education, free public benefit services, big data analytics
and financial services to support citizens and governments.

Certain financial information presented in this results announcement constitutes pro-forma financial information in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The applicable criteria
on the basis of which this pro-forma financial information has been prepared is set out in the full announcement.
The pro-forma financial information has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by external auditors.
The quarterly information has not been audited or reviewed by Vodacom’s external auditors.

All growth rates quoted are year-on-year and refer to the quarter ended 30 June 2020 compared to the quarter ended 30 June 2019.
Amounts marked with an * in this document represent normalised growth which presents performance on a comparable basis. This excludes merger and acquisition activity and
adjusting for trading foreign exchange and foreign currency fluctuation on a constant currency basis (using the current year as base).
In addition to zero-rating numerous essential service and education websites, we donated 20 000 smartphones plus 100
terabytes of data and 10 million voice call minutes to the National Department of Health to collect and transmit data in real
time for resource planning purposes as part of Government’s accelerated COVID-19 testing campaign.

We partnered with Discovery Health, the country’s largest administrator of medical schemes, to offer free virtual
consultations with doctors to the general public to help alleviate pressure on the country’s healthcare system by assisting in
diagnosing COVID-19 as well as treating it.

More recently Vodacom South Africa partnered with Microsoft to launch the Connected Digital Education Platform which
provides participating educational institutions, from schools through to universities, with significantly discounted data
bundles and educators with the ability to deliver classes to learners where access to Microsoft Teams is provided for free.
Earlier this week we announced a ground-breaking technology partnership with Alipay, the world’s leading digital daily
lifestyle services platform, to bring inclusive mobile solutions to South African consumers and merchants, especially small
businesses, through innovative digital technologies. In terms of the partnership, Vodacom Financial Services will work
closely with Alipay to develop a single, affordable payments app for both customers and merchants that promotes greater
financial inclusion within the communities in which we operate.

As part of a broader Vodacom Group programme to create a Social Contract with its stakeholders that addresses pressing
societal challenges, we will continue to do everything in our power to support all governments throughout our African
operations in whatever way we can.

Strong demand for voice, data and financial services contributed to the 6.4% increase in service revenue growth in South
Africa while our International portfolio benefited significantly from currency changes to grow service revenue by 10.7%. This
resulted in a 7.6% increase in service revenue across the Vodacom Group despite tougher economic trading conditions in
most of our markets.

Excluding currency gains, underlying growth in our International portfolio declined by 5.3% as economic activity declined
across these operations. We also reduced pricing on a temporary basis on a number of M-Pesa transactions to assist
customers in contactless payment in light of social distancing initiatives.

While I am particularly pleased with the performance of our South African business, we remain cautious about the impact of
COVID-19 on our operations and uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery in each of the countries where we
operate as disposable income will increasingly come under pressure as a result of rising unemployment and reduced
economic activity.

That said, we are fully focussed on delivering great value and an exceptional experience to our customers and committed to
a prudently sustainable investment programme that continues to yield positive results.
Looking ahead, the long anticipated award of high-demand spectrum in South Africa remains instrumental in the data pricing
dynamic in our largest market. Lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum continues to
curb the pace at which data prices could have fallen. ICASA is expected to complete its spectrum allocation process by
December 2020.

Covid-19 – annual general meeting – Tuesday 21 July 2020

Shareholders are referred to the 25th annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday 21 July
2020 at 10:00 at Vodacom World, 082 Vodacom Boulevard, Midrand, Johannesburg to
consider, and if deemed fit, to pass with or without modification, the resolutions as set in the
notice of annual general meeting which was posted to shareholders on Friday 12 June 2020
and which notice is available on the company’s website www.vodacom.com.

Vodacom reiterates that the health and wellbeing of our staff and shareholders are paramount.
Notwithstanding the declaration by the South African Government of an advanced level 3
lockdown set of regulations which do allow for conferencing, subject to strict health
requirements, Vodacom has taken note of the continued increase in the infection rate for
COVID-19. To protect shareholders and staff, the 25th annual general meeting will now be held
in electronic form only as permitted by the company’s memorandum of incorporation.

Logistical arrangements for an electronic annual general meeting

   1. Vodacom has retained the services The Meeting Specialist Proprietary Limited (“TMS”)
      to host the 25th annual general meeting on an interactive electronic platform to facilitate
      remote participation and voting by shareholders.

   2. Shareholders who wish to participate electronically in and/ or vote at the 25th annual
      general meeting are required to contact TMS on proxy@tmsmeetings.co.za or
      alternatively contact their office on +27 11 520 7950/1/2 as soon as possible, but for
      administrative purposes no later than 10:00 Friday 17 July 2020.

       Shareholders are strongly encouraged to submit votes by proxy before the meeting. If
       shareholders wish to participate in the 25th annual general meeting, they should instruct
       their CSDP or broker to issue them with the necessary letter of representation to
       participate in the 25th annual general meeting, in the manner stipulated in your custody
       agreement. These instructions must be provided to the CSDP or broker by the cut-off
       time and date advised by the CSDP or broker, to accommodate such requests.

   3. TMS will assist shareholders with the requirements for electronic participation in, and/or
      voting at, the 25th annual general meeting. TMS is further obliged to validate (in
      correspondence with Vodacom and, in particular, the transfer secretary, (Computershare

      and/or vote at the 25th annual general meeting, before providing it with the necessary
      means to access the 25th annual general meeting and/or the associated voting platform.

       Shareholders will be liable for their own network charges in relation to electronic
       participation in and/or voting at the 25th annual general meeting. Any such charges will
      not be for the account of the JSE, Vodacom and/or TMS. None of the JSE, Vodacom or
      TMS can be held accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other
      network failure due to insufficient airtime, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth and/or
      power outages which prevents any such Shareholder from participating in and/or voting
      at the 25th annual general meeting.

       Voting by Proxy

      Notwithstanding the above, shareholders are reminded that they are still able to vote
      normally through proxy submission, despite deciding to participate either electronically or
      not at all in the 25th annual general meeting. Shareholders are strongly encouraged to
      submit votes by proxy in advance of the 25th annual general meeting.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
An improved second half performance in South Africa and the sustained growth of our International businesses contributed
to the Group’s 8.9% increase in headline earnings per share to 945cps and a dividend return of 845cps to shareholders.
This follows last year’s substantial investment in South Africa’s largest ever Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
transaction in the telecommunication sector. Group service revenue rose 5.0%.
The past year has been characterised by strong customer growth - we now connect 116 million customers across the
Group, including Safaricom – and the benefits of prudent portfolio diversification.

In South Africa, sharp data price reductions, specifically out-of-bundle data rates, announced in the first quarter led to a
steady increase in data traffic as the year progressed with 1.9 million more data customers connecting to the Vodacom
network, a 9.7% increase to 21.9 million.
While it is still early days, the trend of increased data usage has continued into the current financial year following reductions
in
30-day data bundle tariffs of up to 40% from 1 April 2020 and the launch of our ConnectU platform, which provides easy
access to numerous zero-rated essential service websites. These initiatives will provide savings of R2.7 billion to customers
at a time when economies around the world are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite deteriorating economic pressures and the proactive price cuts to our out-of-bundle rates, service revenue rose 2.3%
in our biggest market, where initiatives to deliver greater value to customers through pricing transformation and sustained
investment in network infrastructure and IT systems are being rewarded.

As part of our strategy to build diverse and sustainable revenue streams, our efforts to introduce “one more service” to
customers continue to gain momentum. For instance, revenue from our Financial Services business in South Africa jumped
by 21.5% to R2.0 billion, on the back of our popular Airtime Advance, insurance and VodaPay services. Our digital services
business has also produced solid growth, contributing R1.5 billion in revenues on the back of increasing purchases of our
video-on-demand offering and our music, sports, gaming and other video services.
It has been another stellar year for our International portfolio, where we recorded margin expansion for a second year, and
further diversifies our currency exposure from the South African rand. An additional 4.0 million customers and increased
demand for data and M-Pesa services in each of our operations contributed to a 12.5% increase in service revenue across
our International operations.

Our investment in Safaricom, Africa’s second biggest Telco by market capitalisation after Vodacom, delivered a 30.4% boost
in profits from this associate, with growth bolstered by currency factors and inclusion of the new M-Pesa joint venture.
Significant investments in network and infrastructure, an acceleration in pricing transformation and a 17.2% underlying
increase in revenue from M-Pesa, all contributed to Safaricom’s success.

M-Pesa continues to deliver on its promise of delivering financial inclusion, while at the same time positively contributing to
economic growth in markets where it is ubiquitous. Having expanded the M-Pesa ecosystem, customers in our International
markets, including Safaricom, now process more than US$14.7 billion a month in transactions through the platform.
We currently have 40 million customers transacting on M-Pesa across all our operations, generating total revenue of R16.2
billion and growing at 22% a year. Our focus, with our newly created joint venture, is to ensure that we align all product
roadmaps across our operations and continue to expand the M-Pesa ecosystem across all countries. This will include the
roll-out of nano lending platforms and getting the system ready for a smartphone world, where we can on-board more
partners in this space. Our nano lending platform is already being used by 17 million customers in Kenya and Tanzania
where it is driving our commitment to promote financial inclusion.

Over the past 12 months, the Group has made significant progress on a number of regulatory matters, including finality on
the Competition Commission’s data services market inquiry in South Africa. The assignment of available high-demand
spectrum seems imminent, with ICASA indicating that this process will be concluded by the end of this year. Looking ahead,
our immediate collective emphasis is to assist in addressing pressing societal challenges in each of the markets where we
operate, particularly as the world strives to halt the spread of COVID-19 and recovers from the economic impacts of the
pandemic. We remain committed to supporting governments where we operate in whatever way we can. Through numerous
public and private sector partnerships across our footprint, Vodacom’s teams are working hard in difficult conditions to keep
communities, businesses and governments connected. The assignment of temporary spectrum in South Africa and
elsewhere is welcomed and will assist in alleviating network congestion as more people work and are entertained at home.
At the same time, we are executing on our robust, scalable operational continuity plans by anticipating and reacting to the
current extraordinary environment to ensure our long-term sustainability.

We believe that collaborative efforts will be instrumental in defeating the pandemic, which is why we have partnered, for
example, with Discovery Health to launch a simple but powerful online healthcare platform to help citizens understand their
personal risk for COVID-19 and to immediately schedule free healthcare professional consultations where necessary. We
have also partnered with the National Department of Health a to deploy 20 000 smartphones with free voice call minutes
and data, to be used by frontline health workers to collect and transmit data in real time for resource planning purposes, as
government accelerates its COVID-19 testing campaign.

We have consolidated all our existing zero-rated data services with new essential services aimed at social upliftment into our
single ConnectU platform. This social platform provides Vodacom customers with access to a wide range of zero-rated
content that will assist customers during the lockdown and recovery period. The platform includes free access to job portals,
where youth can search for employment and upload their CVs as well as access to our e-School platform that provides
CAPS curriculum aligned content from Grades R – 12. In addition to launching special tariffs for virtual classrooms, we have
expanded our zero-rated offering to all public schools, universities and T-Vet colleges across the country to ensure that
students enrolled into these institutions will be able to access relevant information for free via these portals. In our
International operations, we have zero-rated M-Pesa and greatly reduced fees below certain thresholds for person to person
transfers, to minimise the use of cash for payments.

These are just some of the numerous activities that we have implemented across our markets to assist governments in their
response to COVID-19. We continue to prioritise network quality so that we deliver on our purpose of connecting people to a
better tomorrow.

COVID-19 update

Shareholders are referred to the announcement made by Vodacom on 17 March 2020, in
relation to Vodacom’s operations following the state of disaster announced by the president
on 20 March 2020 in response to the COVID-9 pandemic.

In a subsequent announcement the president issued a national lock down for 21 days, which
has since been extended for a further two weeks. Vodacom fully supports government’s
initiatives in containing this pandemic. In our operations outside of South Africa, there are
various degrees of actions taken by governments. These vary between full lock downs,
partial lock downs and “business as usual”, but with emphasis on social distancing.
Vodacom’s priority is the health and safety of our employees while continuing to deliver
services and support to our customers.

Vodacom is working under strict conditions, across all our operations to limit and minimise
the potential for COVID-19 transmission, and will continue to support and educate our
people on the appropriate hygiene standards to follow. Notwithstanding the critical nature of
our operations, most of our employees have been empowered to work from home.
Telecommunications has been classified as an essential service in South Africa. We have
obtained the necessary approvals and permits to ensure that South Africans remain
connected during this period.

The extent of the shutdown and the effect of COVID-19 on our business is continually being
reassessed, with relevant task teams being established and business continuity plans being
prepared and executed to deal with anticipated outcomes.

The situation remains fluid albeit that the following measures have been taken by the
business to ensure that the business continues during these volatile times.

Financing
Vodacom’s conservative funding approach ensured that we have well managed balance
sheet. Our leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA-aL 1(excluding lease liabilities) at 30
September 2019 was 0.9 times.

  •   Short term debt was refinanced during the year and repayment periods extended.
      Vodacom has no significant debt repayments due during the next 12 months.
  •   The company continues to monitor its debt exposure between fixed and variable
      rates, to ensure a balanced portfolio in an uncertain and volatile environment.


             1
                 Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation; and after lease accounting





 •   In order to ensure that short term liquidity can be met and volatility absorbed, existing
     committed facilities with banks have been doubled by converting shadow facilities to
     committed facilities resulting in a total of R8 billion committed facilities.


     Supply chain


     To date we have not experienced significant device and / or hardware supply disruptions that
     would have negatively impacted business. We are putting further measures in place to avoid
     disruptions and are working closely with our suppliers and partners in order to maintain
     critical supplies during this period. Where possible we have stockpiled some critical network
     and device elements to ensure that the network can remain available, while ensuring that
     customers will get access to devices while working from home.


     Demand
     Overall we have noted increased traffic across our operations. Driven by increased working
     from home initiatives and entertainment at home. Following the implementation of lock down
     regulations in South Africa we noted a surge in data traffic on the network of up to 40% in
     comparison to pre-lock down implementation due to increased traffic as people work and
     entertain from home, but also due to zero-rating certain education, government and health
     sites to assist during the crisis. We are expecting this trend to continue in the short to
     medium term as more customers work from home and people using technology to remain
     connected, educated and entertained.
     
        Network
        Our engineers are ensuring that the network can cater for additional demand to ensure an
        efficient communication channel. Where necessary we have the opportunity to offload more
        of our capacity to the Rain network in terms of our existing 4G roaming agreement with this
        partner. This allows for capacity alleviation on the Vodacom network. In order to increase the
        resilience of our network, we increased investment into capacity upgrades and batteries
        already in March and will continue with this to handle increased traffic and ensure
        availability.

        Separately, we have submitted a request for additional spectrum as per the minister of
        Communications and Digital Technologies invitation to apply for temporary spectrum
        allocations. As per the departments’ timetable we expect to receive feedback during the
        week. This will further ensure that network throughput remains optimal for all customers
        during this period, while being able to expand into certain underserved areas as well.

        Distribution
        In South Africa, where full lock down is in place, customers can continue purchasing airtime
        at a number of service stations, retail shops and spaza outlets, which have been allowed to
        sell food and other essential services during this period. We also offer services such as
        airtime transfer for customers to be able to transfer airtime between family and friends, while
        airtime advance will allow customers to remain connected, until such time that airtime
        recharge is required. Our online channels, including the MyVodacom app and Vodapay also
        make it possible for customers to continue to purchase.


             The longer term effects that lock downs across the globe will have on the world economy as
             well as the South African economy remains unknown. While we expect a short term increase
             in demand for our services, medium term economic downturn is not good for any business.
             We are attempting to manage the crisis in a responsible and sustainable way to ensure we
             minimise financial impact.

             At this time of uncertainty, we are extending a hand of support to the South African
             government in various ways. The ConnectU platform is used as a tool to ensure that
             customer remain connected and kids can stay educated through our e-school learning
             platform. Vodacom has partnered with Discovery health, to provide an on-line health care
             screening process for COVID-19. Citizens can access the portal free of charge and get an
             assessment based on questionnaire on whether further consultation is required. This can
             then be done via a virtual online doctor consultation which is provided for free by Vodacom
             and Discovery for up to 100 000 consultations. This will assist in relieving some of the
             pressure experienced by the health authorities. Vodacom has donated 20 000 smartphones
             plus 100 terabytes in data and 10 million voice call minutes to the National Department of
             Health. This will be used by frontline health workers to collect and transmit data in real time
             for resource planning purposes as government accelerates its COVID-19 testing campaign.
             We are also supporting governments with Big Data analytics using anonymised data to
             model and monitor the spread of the virus. We have also made M-Pesa person to person
             transactions below a certain amount free across a number of our markets. We also support
             governments across our markets with various initiatives during the crisis.

             We continue to monitor the effects that various actions will have on our economies as well
             as the resultant effects on our business. Vodacom will be releasing its results on or about 11
             May 2020 for the year ended 31 March 2020 at which time more information will be
             presented to shareholders and stakeholders.

Shareholders are referred to the announcement by the South African Government on Sunday
15 March 2020 which declared a national state of disaster in response to the Covid-19
pandemic.

Vodacom’s priority is the health and safety of our employees while continuing to deliver services
and support to our customers.

We continue to closely monitor the latest guidance from the WHO, national, regional and local
health authorities and have well developed business continuity plans in place for dealing with
such events. These include co-ordinated regional and international incident management,
response strategies and the increased ability for Vodacom employees to work remotely without
disruption. We have a dedicated team working to maintain the level of service our customers
expect from us and have made available various digital offerings to assist enterprise clients. Our
day-to-day operations will continue and should not be affected during this period.

The data, voice and connectivity services that we offer, will allow customers to continue to stay
connected while reducing social contact, thereby assisting in curbing the spread of the virus. We
are ensuring that we have sufficient network capacity to enable people and businesses to
seamlessly work from home as South Africa, and our other operations, are very dependent on
mobile services due to limited fixed line connectivity.

Given the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible to quantify with certainty the future impact
Covid-19 may have on the business - both from an operational and financial perspective.
Management is monitoring the situation and proactively dealing with the related challenges. To
date we have not experienced significant supply disruptions, we are however monitoring the
situation closely and putting the necessary measures in place to avoid disruptions. We are
confident that we have the right strategy in place and that we are well positioned to navigate
through this period.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Vodacom will assist governments and do what is possible, in
order to cope with the Covid-19 situation.

Voluntary announcement - Competition Commission data pricing enquiry

Shareholders are advised that Vodacom Group has reached an agreement with the Competition Commission
and has issued the following media statement outlining details of the agreement reached:


R2.7 billion boost for customers as Vodacom cuts data prices, launches free data service
On 1 April 2020, Vodacom South Africa will introduce a range of initiatives that will result in R2.7 billion in
additional savings for customers. This forms part of a broader Vodacom Group programme to create a Social
Contract with its stakeholders that will address pressing societal challenges in each of the markets in which it
operates.

Commenting on the latest Competition Commission announcement, Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub,
said: ""Following the release of the Competition Commission's Final Data Market Inquiry Report in December last
year, Vodacom decided to engage constructively with the Commission on the issues arising from the report. The
agreement struck with the Commission provides us with an opportunity to enter into a Social Contract with the
regulators, our customers and the people of South Africa to bring down the cost to communicate and promote
digital inclusion. In terms of the agreement, and following confirmation by the Tribunal, Vodacom will introduce
price reductions across all its monthly bundles and provide free access to basic internet, essential services and
cheaper pricing to the poorest communities. This will promote greater digital inclusion and assist with societal
problems in education and unemployment.""

Over the past three years, Vodacom has made significant progress in reducing the cost to communicate and
making data more accessible, particularly for poorer consumers and communities. For example, in 2019, we
announced substantial cuts in out-of-bundle tariffs and introduced hourly, daily and weekly bundles with much
lower effective prices to drive affordability in addition to overall reductions in bundle prices. These measures
contributed to R2 billion in savings for customers and the circa 50% reduction in effective data prices in the past
two years.

In line with our purpose of connecting people to a better future, education has been and remains integral to
Vodacom in driving digital inclusion. To this end, Vodacom has already connected over 3000 schools and, in
partnership with the Department of Basic education, runs 92 teacher training centres and 10 youth centres.
Vodacom also provides free access to the portals of most of the country's public universities.
""Having heard the concerns raised by the Competition Commission, we proactively entered into a Social Contract
with government and the public. We did this at a time when South African consumers are under increasing
financial pressure and on the understanding that action will be taken by ICASA and Government to auction high
demand spectrum. Delays in assigning spectrum and completing the digital migration has curbed the pace at
which data prices could have fallen,"" adds Shameel.

The data price cuts and free data services that Vodacom will introduce on 1 April 2020 includes:

    *   Accelerating our data pricing transformation on our 30-day bundles by reducing prices by up to 40%.
        Notably, 1GB of data valid for 30 days - often referred to as the ""headline price"" - will reduce by 34%
        from R149 to R99 on all channels. Discounts will be provided on all 30-day bundles while further
        decreases will be effected on 1 April 2021.

    *   With regard to access to free data services, we will be consolidating all existing zero-rated data services
        with new essential services aimed at social upliftment into a single platform called ""Connect U"". This
        social platform will provide Vodacom customers with:
             o    Free access to job portals, where youth can search for employment and upload their CVs.
             o    Free educational content like our e-School platform which provides CAPS curriculum aligned
                  content from Grades R - 12.
             o    Free Health and wellness information through our Mum & Baby platform focused on equipping
                  mothers and caregivers with advice on pregnancy, neonatal and childcare through SMS,
                  educational articles, tutorials, videos and other tools.
             o    Free access to Facebook Flex, the low data alternative to Facebook that enables customers to
                  stay socially connected.
             o    Access to two free SMS's per day to customers, provided they have made a purchase in the
                  past month and they can access these on the new portal.
             o    Extending further discounted bundle offers to pre-paid customers in areas where the majority
                  of people living beneath the food poverty line. This will benefit more than 2000 suburbs and
                  villages, ensuring that this benefits people that really need it most.
             o    Zero-rated access to select government sites to assist members of the public in accessing
                  government services such as Home Affairs, Ambulance Services, Education sites and
                  Government Communication Services. This will assist everyone in gaining access to much
                  needed government services as these are now moving into the digital space as well.
             o    Expanding our zero-rated offering to all schools, universities and T-Vet colleges across the
                  country. This will ensure that learners and students enrolled into these institutions will be able
                  to access relevant information for free via their portals.
             o    A full zero-rated internet search function powered by Wikipedia. This will allow customers
                  access to the entire Wikipedia database of knowledge free of charge.
             o    Free access to other essential information such as local and international headlines, trends
                  and the weather.

""We believe these commitments, as part of our social contract, will go a long way in assisting customers in these
tough economic times and driving digital inclusion for all,"" concludes Shameel.

Vodacom Group CEO, Shameel Joosub, will host a conference call at 16:00 (SA time), 14:00 (London time) and

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
Our sustained investment programme, aimed at delivering a better experience for customers in each of the countries where
we operate, continues to yield results. This is reflected in the additional 2 million customers that we connected during the
quarter, contributing to growth of 6.6% in revenue for the Vodacom Group. We now serve over 117 million customers1
across the Group.

As expected, growth trends improved across a number of metrics in South Africa following the significant impacts over the
past year from our ongoing pricing transformation strategy. These included substantial cuts in out-of-bundle tariffs and lower
bundle prices, resulting in a circa 50% decline in effective data prices since March 2016.
A highly successful Summer campaign, which delivered 334 million free rewards to 17 million customers, contributed to an
uplift in activity across our customer base. This increase in data customers and usage is evidence of our success in

transforming data pricing in South Africa. Notable contributions from our Financial Services and Enterprise businesses saw
service revenue in South Africa rise by 4.6% despite a subdued economy.

I am particularly pleased with the consistency in the performance of our International portfolio, which produced solid results
on the back of strong demand for data and M-Pesa services, resulting in a 9% growth in service revenue. Our operations
outside South Africa now contribute over 40%1 to Group service revenue. In January we had to disconnect 1.7 million
customers in Tanzania, as a result of customer registration requirements, primarily due to the lack of government approved
identification documents. This will have an impact on our growth in Tanzania, however we expect to reconnect many of
these customers over the short to medium term once biometrically registered.
Looking ahead, customers can expect to experience the benefit of our revised roaming deal with Rain, which will further
expand our 4G capacity in an environment where delays in assigning available spectrum will constrain capacity for all
networks.

Having been the first network to commercially launch 5G in Africa through Vodacom Lesotho, we expect to be able to launch
5G services in South Africa this year. This is possible thanks to a recent roaming agreement with Liquid Telecom, as 5G
spectrum is largely unassigned in South Africa.
Vodacom remains committed to delivering on its pricing transformation strategy and has engaged constructively with
relevant authorities, including the Competition Commission, to share the measures we intend to introduce in due course to
further reduce data prices.

Highlights
- Group revenue up 3.9% (2.5%*) supported by Group service revenue growth of 4.2% (2.5%*).

  combined 115 million customers across the Group.

  boosting reported Group growth.
- Earnings per share were up 19.4% and headline earnings per share was up 18.9%, due to the one-off BEE costs of R1.5 billion (including
  transaction costs) included in the prior period.

previous statement IAS 17, while the period ended 30 September 2019 is presented in accordance with IFRS 16. The reported
change reflected in this document is done on this basis while normalised growth adjusts for differences in reporting of the current
year and the prior year, to give the reader a like-for-like comparison of underlying performance.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Following last year's substantial investment in South Africa's largest-ever Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment transaction
in the telecommunication sector, this year Vodacom Group posted an 18.9% increase in headline earnings per share to 460c and
returning a dividend of 440 cps to shareholders. Other key highlights include an improved second quarter performance in South
Africa and the sustained growth of our International businesses.

In South Africa, an increase in data usage, following sustained efforts to reduce data prices and the onboarding of our new
roaming partner in the second quarter, more than offset the service revenue decline reported in the first three months of the
financial year. On a like-for-like basis, this resulted in service revenue growth of 1.5% during the half year, despite ongoing
economic pressures and the implementation of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulations.

Having announced sharp reductions in out-of-bundle tariffs by up to 70% in March, we continue to drive down the cost to
communicate through various initiatives. These include the recent introduction of a Vodacom-branded 4G smart feature phone
priced at just R299, and reducing the price of 1GB of data valid for 30 days from R149 to R99 for users of Vodapay and the
MyVodacom App.

Ongoing initiatives to enhance customer experience through pricing transformation, modernisation of IT systems and sustained
investment in network infrastructure, continue to pay dividends. This is evidenced by the additional 691 000 customers who joined
Vodacom in the period. There are now 43.9 million customers connected through South Africa's leading network each enjoying
access to a wide array of financial and digital services.

Measures to introduce ""one more service"" to customers, as part of our strategy to build diverse revenue streams, are quickly
gathering momentum. Revenue from our Financial Services business jumped by 37.1% to almost one billion rand, as Airtime
Advance, insurance and our recently launched VodaPay service all gained in popularity. More than one million people have made
video-on-demand purchases, while our music, sports, games and other video services - all in their infancy phase - are contributing
to solid growth in our digital services business.

Our International portfolio remains a star performer, growing service revenue by 15.5% in a period characterised by macro and
political stability and high demand for data and M-Pesa services in each operation. We connected an additional 2.0 million
customers, boosting the total to 36.6 million customers outside South Africa and Safaricom.

M-Pesa customers in our International markets now process more than US$2.8 billion a month in transactions through the service,
underpinning M-Pesa's promise of delivering financial inclusivity and positively contributing to economic growth in countries where
it has become ubiquitous. Initiatives to further expand the M-Pesa ecosystem contributed to the 797 000 increase in customers, up
to 14.3 million.
Our strategic investment in Safaricom continues to perform in line with our expectations having reported strong interim results at
the beginning of November. They reported a 5.3% rise in service revenue growth, largely on the back of an 18.2% increase in

revenue from M-Pesa and an overall increase in market share for the first time since 2017. Safaricom continues to invest
significantly in its network and infrastructure while accelerating its pricing transformation strategy.
Looking ahead, we expect the benefits from our acquisition of a strategic stake in IoT.nxt1 will become increasingly evident in both
our Consumer and Enterprise businesses. The same can be said for the other partnerships we have put in place in recent times,
including our agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS), to ensure we bring best-in-class services and products to customers
right across the Group.

We will also expand M-Pesa internationally and our Financial Services and Digital Lifestyle businesses in South Africa with the
expectation that these will increasingly contribute to revenue growth.

In South Africa, a key focus remains on the policy and regulatory environment where we will continue to participate in the various
processes currently underway to assign available high-demand spectrum. While we have made significant progress in our pricing
transformation journey, spectrum availability is a key lever to accelerating data price declines.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
Growth from our International portfolio offset the anticipated slower performance in South Africa, which was impacted by new data usage
regulations, significant data price cuts and a subdued economy weighing on consumer spend.
Revenue and service revenue at a Group level grew by 4.2% and 3.9% respectively. Excluding Safaricom, we added 1.2 million customers
in the three-month period, serving 79 million customers across the Group, having added 2.4 million customers in total to the Vodacom
network over the past year.
Despite the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, International service revenue increased by 19.6% (8.1%*), largely driven
by a 42.7% (28.4%*) increase in M-Pesa revenue and data demand. M-Pesa revenue of R905 million accounted for 17.7% of International
service revenue, boosted by an overall improved trend in each of our International markets and Tanzania in particular.
In South Africa, service revenue was negatively impacted by the further substantial reduction in out-of-bundle tariffs announced in March as
part of our sustained pricing transformation strategy to bring down the prices of our data services. The impact from three months of ICASA's
data usage regulations, the transition between national roaming partners and the tough retail operating environment, were other contributors
to the 1.2% decline in service revenue in South Africa. Acceleration in the growth in data

traffic of 52%, and the 45% jump in revenue from our Financial Services business were among the key highlights in South Africa
from the quarter.
We are encouraged by President Cyril Ramaphosa's commitment, made in his address at the Fourth Industrial Revolution
South Africa Digital Economy Summit, to award new spectrum. This is a vital part of reducing input costs and further bringing
down data prices in South Africa, where lengthy delays in completing the digital migration and allocating 4G spectrum has
curbed the pace at which data prices could have fallen. Clear policy direction for the country's telecommunications industry is
also expected to restore investor confidence in South Africa and boost economic growth.
Looking ahead, we expect to conclude the acquisition of the M-Pesa brand and platform and together with the recent launch of
VodaPay, to further enhance the performance of our Financial Services business. We are also encouraged by the growth
potential from the IoT.nxt 1 acquisition and AWS partnership agreement announced earlier this year. We expect growth in the
second half of the year to improve in South Africa, benefitting from the completion of the national roaming partner switch over
and improved commercial momentum in financial services.
It is with deep sadness that we received the news that our colleague Bob Collymore, CEO of Safaricom passed away in July. On
behalf of our Board and staff at Vodacom, I extend our deepest condolences to Bob's family and all the staff of Safaricom.

Following the cumulative retrospective adoption of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 April 2018, the Group's results for the year ended 31 March 2019 are on
an IFRS 15 basis, whereas the results for the year ended 31 March 2018 are (as previously reported) on an IAS 18 basis. Comparisons between the two bases of reporting are not
meaningful and to ensure appropriate disclosure during the period of transition to IFRS 15, results for the year ended 31 March 2019 has been disclosed on both an IFRS 15 and IAS
18 basis. Our commentary describing our operating performance in the Operating Review has been provided solely on an IAS 18 basis. The accounting standard applied is clearly
marked in the heading of relevant columns in this results announcement. To aid in the understanding of the transition from IAS 18 to IFRS 15, we have provided commentary on
the main differences between the two standards below. Further disclosure is also included in Note 2: Changes in accounting policies and in Note 3: Segment analysis of
the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019.


Vodacom Group CEO commented:
Shameel Joosub

This year we have given back significant value to stakeholders. We unlocked R7.5 billion in value for YeboYethu shareholders, and in September 2018 concluded the largest ever
Broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) transaction in the South African telecommunications sector.

A sharp reduction in our out-of-bundle tariffs, contributed to the 37% decline in effective data prices since the end of March last year. In addition to enabling customers to manage
their spend and utilise their data, virtually worry-free. This translates into a further R2 billion in savings enjoyed by customers as part of our ongoing pricing transformation strategy.
Over a three-year period, data prices have fallen by 57%; despite not having access to further available spectrum.

The financial impacts of delivering on our promise of further reducing the cost-to-communicate in South Africa, combined with costs associated with concluding our new R16.4 billion 
BEE ownership deal, is evident in the subdued increase in our operating profit. This masks an otherwise solid operational performance for the Group, where service revenue
grew by 5.0%, led by strong performance in our International portfolio. Excluding one off BEE costs, Group headline earnings per share (HEPS) rose by 4.2%µ.

In August last year, through Vodacom Lesotho, we laid claim to being first in Africa to connect customers to a commercial 5G network. Vodacom South Africa remains ready to
follow Lesotho's lead as soon as the requisite 5G spectrum is secured, a crucial step in ensuring that the country doesn't get left behind from participating in the Fourth Industrial
Revolution.

We connected an additional 6 million customers to the Vodacom and Safaricom networks, a 5.8% increase to 110 million in total. At the same time, we invested close on R13 billion in network 
and IT infrastructure to ensure all customers benefit from superior service and network experience across our footprint.

Despite the low economic growth environment in South Africa and our deliberate actions to reduce prices for all segments, service revenue in South Africa rose by 2.1%. We are
particularly encouraged by the noticeable rise in new contract customers in the fourth quarter in both the Consumer and Enterprise segments.

It was a stellar year for our International portfolio where economic and political environments have improved, although it remains challenging in various aspects. We grew service
revenue by 15.6% and expanded margins. Other significant achievements include the 25.8% growth in data revenue, and another year in which M-Pesa helped to empower
inclusive growth by supporting economic development in Mozambique, Lesotho, DRC and Tanzania.

Our strategic investment in Safaricom contributed R2.8 billion to Vodacom Group's operating profit, with Safaricom reporting a 7.0% increase in service revenue and a 13.1%
improvement in EBIT, underpinned by strong customer growth and M-Pesa revenues.

The Safaricom acquisition has proven to be a catalyst for extending our mobile money leadership position on the African continent and in ensuring that Financial Services have
become a significant contributor to the Group's revenues. In the past year, we effected 11 billion transactions worth R2.0 trillion to 36.1 million customers across our Financial
Services network, including Safaricom. In South Africa, our profit before tax from Financial Services doubled to R1.0 billion, while M-Pesa revenue grew by 32.2% to R3.1 billion in
our International operations and now makes up one-sixth (15.8%) of that portfolio's entire service revenues.

Looking ahead, we continue to make good progress on our key strategic pillars. We expect the solid momentum from our digital services platforms to continue. Further, the
strategic partnerships being formed by our Enterprise business will strengthen our IoT offers and Enterprise propositions, ultimately to the benefit of consumers. We are in the
process of concluding the acquisition of the M-Pesa brand and platform related assets from Vodafone through a joint agreement with Safaricom1, we expect this will further
accelerate our mobile money growth plans in Africa. The commercialisation of our recently-launched payment gateway and digital wallet will assist in sustaining Financial Services
growth in South Africa.

We have updated our medium-term targets to reflect these opportunities and the benefits of our Safaricom acquisition, and now expect a mid-high single digit growth rate in
operating profit on average for the next three years. As this target is based on operating profit instead of EBIT, we also capture Vodacom's share of the growing associate profits
generated by Safaricom.


Operating review

South Africa (IAS 18 commentary)

Data pricing transformation continues, to the benefit of our customers, with a number of changes that increase affordability and improve spend control. This has helped our more
than 43 million customers get connected more affordably and in the way that is most suitable to their needs.

Service revenue grew at 2.1%, despite the implementation of deliberate pricing transformation and a low economic growth environment. Growth in the second half of the year was
negatively impacted by the transition between national roaming partners and the change in call termination rates.

Customer revenue increased 1.3% to R47.4 billion# supported by a growth in our customer base of 3.7% to 43.2 million with positive net additions of 1.5 million.

Contract customer revenue increased 0.6% with contract customers increasing 8.9% to 5.8 million. We are pleased with the acceleration of net customer additions during the
fourth quarter in both the Consumer and Enterprise segments. We worked with the Department of Education to connect 80 000 teachers during the year. These are mainly data
contracts, to a lower contract ARPU. We reduced out-of-bundle spend from customers following the implementation of the Regulator's End-user and Subscriber Service Charter (EUSSC).

Prepaid customer revenue increased 2.0%. Prepaid customer net additions were 1.1 million with ARPU declining by 6.9%, ARPU declines are as a direct result of new additions being
attracted at a lower spend. Our efforts to reduce the one off use of SIM in the market are showing signs of success.

Data revenue grew 3.9% to R24.3 billion, contributing 43.5% to service revenue. The effective price per MB has reduced 23.3% following the implementation of the EUSSC
regulations in March, as well as a further out-of-bundle rate reduction of 50%. The implementation of the EUSSC allows consumers to manage their spend and utilise their data,
virtually worry free. Data bundle purchases have increased 13.1% to 866 million as more affordable data bundles with shorter validity periods are available for customers.

Overall data usage drivers were encouraging. Data traffic was up 35.6%. Active smart devices on the network were up 7.6% to 19.9 million, of which 10 million are 4G devices.
Average usage on these smart devices has improved 23.2% to 966MB.

Our platform strategy, designed to stimulate reasons to consume data, is gaining momentum. Take up of the video play service is encouraging with 869 000 active users on the
platform. Our music platform, My Muze, is steadily gaining customers, and our gaming platform PlayInc. has now been launched.

Our Financial Services business continues to accelerate, contributing R1.6 billion of revenue, growing at 67.1% and R1.0 billion profit before tax. Our insurance business continues
to grow, adding more services such as life and funeral cover during the year. Total policies increased 38.1% to 1.3 million. Airtime Advance is now used by just under 10 million
customers.

Enterprise has delivered good growth, with service revenue up 4.8% to R14.7 billion. Our fixed-line service revenue increased 24.7%, underpinned by solid growth in connectivity,
cloud and hosting and IPVPN revenues. IoT connections continue to gain momentum with a 24.4% growth in customers to 4.5 million.

We continue to drive our 'Own the home' strategy resulting in good traction on fibre to the home/business, almost doubling the connections in the year.

EBITDA declined 1.3% to R27.7 billion#, while the EBITDA margin of 38.9% contracted by 1.2ppts partially as a result of the roaming agreement with Rain. This affected margins by
0.7ppts, as we continue to scale up on the roaming agreement, and move cost of capacity from depreciation to direct expenses. Technology expenses increased 7.5% due to 8.1%
more sites being deployed, and annual price escalations in lease, rental and energy expenses. This was slightly offset by our 'Fit for growth' initiatives delivering savings in excess of
R1.4 billion. Our digital transformation is starting to yield results. The implementation of process automation has resulted in the automation of 86 processes. The introduction of
Chatbot's and improving call resolutions at root cause has reduced call volumes by 25% in line with our targets.

Our capital expenditure of R9.6 billion was utilised to drive our strategy of being the leading digital telco. For the year we focused on improving the overall mobile network
performance and customer experience with network modernisation and capacity upgrade initiatives. We delivered substantial cost savings through the introduction of Digital
Technologies for smart planning, smart deployment and smart operations. Our continued investment in infrastructure resulted in over 90% coverage on 4G and 99.5% coverage on
3G.

We spent R2 billion on IT during the year. Our focus is to become smarter and more agile in delivering products to our customers. We continued to deepen our Digital IT capabilities
through our IT acceleration programme. We continue to invest in Cloud infrastructure and migrating applications, IT services and network functions into Cloud platforms to
enhance flexibility and improve scalability, availability and performance of services.

International (IAS 18 commentary)

Driving our strategy of Financial Services inclusion and connecting customers has supported a return to double digit service revenue growth of 15.6% (10.3%*). Macro and political
environments have improved, although is remains challenging in various aspects. DRC had a peaceful election during the second half of the year. In March 2019, Mozambique was
affected by cyclone Idai. We mobilised efforts to restore communication services as soon as possible, to enable customers to get in contact with affected family members and to
aid relief efforts. To assist during this crisis, we free-rated calling from 21 March 2019 to 1 April 2019 and we have also donated USD1 million to aid in humanitarian efforts.
We continue to see good customer growth, adding 2.2 million customers in the year, up 6.8% to 34.6 million customers.

Data revenue grew strongly at 25.8% (19.6%*), supported by the roll out of 4G services, now available in all our operations. We added 1.1 million data customers during this period,
as we continue to drive availability of affordable data devices across all operations. We have started rolling out content services in all operations and continue to provide
personalised pricing through our 'Just 4 You' platform. Data now contributes 15.7% of service revenue.

M-Pesa continues to deliver on its promise for financial inclusion empowering customers to transact easily and thereby contributing to the economy. M-Pesa revenue grew by
32.2% (26.5%*) to R3.1 billion# contributing 15.8% to service revenue. We continue to expand the eco systems to more services such as micro loans, merchant payment systems
and further interconnection with banks and other operators. We launched a number of initiatives during the year to drive the uptake of the M-Pesa in all operations. We added 
1.7 million customers during the period up 14.8% to 13.5 million. We now process USD2.8 billion in transactions a month across our operations.

EBITDA grew 26.8% (21.0%*), while margins expanded by 3.1ppts. This was as a result of strong revenue growth and continued focus on cost containment through our 'Fit for
growth' programme. Savings on commissions from airtime purchases through M-Pesa, continued savings in network operating expenses through site sharing, contract negotiations
and savings from lower interconnect costs, are key drivers for margin growth.

We were awarded a 4G licence in the DRC, in Mozambique we unified and renewed our licences for 20 years and acquired 2x10MHz of 800MHz and in Tanzania we acquired an
additional 2x10MHz of 700MHz 4G spectrum which will enable us to progress further in delivering on our strategic data ambitions. The total costs of these spectrum acquisitions
were USD65.0 million across our operations.

We invested R3.4 billion in rolling out 4G services, improving capacity and widening our network reach and quality. We added 984 4G sites and 371 3G sites and lead in network NPS
in most of our operations.

We are in the process of concluding the acquisition of the M-Pesa brand and platform related assets from Vodafone through a joint agreement with Safaricom(1). We expect this will
further accelerate our mobile money growth plans in Africa.


Safaricom

Safaricom continues to report solid growth and margin expansion, with service revenue increasing 7.0% and EBIT increasing 13.1%. Underpinning the results was a strong recovery
in growth of Safaricom's customer base, with total customers growing 7.7%, for the year to 31.9 million customers. Strong growth in M-Pesa revenue continues as 30-day active
M-Pesa customers increased 10.2% to 22.6 million. M-Pesa revenue grew 19.2% and now contributes 31.2% to service revenue, up from 28.0%. Data revenue grew at 6.4% a slight
easing of growth during the second half of the year, as consumer offerings were repositioned at half year to provide more value in an increasingly competitive environment.
However opportunity exists for future growth by increasing both penetration and usage of mobile data. Investment in capital expenditure of KES37.3 billion in the period resulted in
3G sites increasing 17%, 4G sites increasing 69%, and the number of homes passed with fibre more than doubling to 300 000.

Regulatory matters

Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA Bill)

On 17 November 2017, the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published an invitation to provide comments on the ECA bill, having its origins in the Integrated
Information and Communication Technology ICT Policy White Paper of 2 October 2016. Following written submission and public hearings on the proposed ECA Bill, the Minister
withdrew the bill on 12 February 2019. The ECA Bill is unlikely to be re-submitted to the new Parliament in its current form given the new emphasis on the Fourth Industrial
Revolution - which is likely to require further policy, legislative and regulatory changes. The effect of the withdrawal of the ECA Amendment Bill is that the licensing of High
Demand Spectrum can be managed under the existing legislation; in this regard the Ministry is contemplating issuing new Policy Directions to the Independent Communications
Authority of South Africa (ICASA).


Amendment to End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 30 April 2018, ICASA published final amendments to the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations with the objective of addressing consumer concerns on
out-of-bundle charges and data bundle expiry rules. Vodacom complied with the regulation and implemented required changes from 1 March 2019, including those related to the
transfer and rollover of unused data and the prohibition on defaulting of an end-user onto out-of-bundle charges upon the depletion of data bundles without consent from the
customer.


ICASA priority market review

In June 2017, ICASA gave notice of its intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECS). The purpose of the enquiry is to
identify relevant wholesale and retail markets or market segments in the ECS that are generally prone to ex ante regulation, and to determine from these markets and market
segments those that the Authority intends to prioritise for market reviews and potential regulation. On 17 August 2018, ICASA published a findings document in which it listed
broad markets that will be prioritised for potential market review:

- Wholesale fixed access, which includes wholesale supply of asymmetric broadband origination, fixed access services and relevant facilities;
- Upstream infrastructure markets incorporating national transmission services, metropolitan connectivity and relevant facilities; and
- Mobile services, which includes the retail market for mobile services and the wholesale supply of mobile network services, including relevant facilities.

On 16 November 2018, ICASA commenced a market inquiry into mobile broadband services. The purpose of the market inquiry is to assess the state of competition and determine
whether or not there are markets or market segments within the mobile broadband services value chain which may require regulatory intervention.

Competition Commission data service market inquiry

The Competition Commission initiated a market inquiry into data services on 30 November 2017. The purpose of the inquiry is to understand what factors or features of the
market(s) and value chain may cause or lead to high prices for data services, and to make recommendations that would result in lower prices for data services. This inquiry covers all
market participants involved at any point in the value chain for any form of data services that are provided to customers such as government, businesses and consumers in South
Africa. The Competition Commission issued a summary of provisional findings and recommendations on 24 April 2019, inviting comments from stakeholders by 14 June 2019. The
date for completion of the data market inquiry is 31 December 2019.


DRC proposed traffic monitoring system

On 11 December 2018, a decree to implement a new traffic monitoring system levying additional charges on operators was signed off by all relevant government authorities. In
February 2019, the new President instructed cancellation of the decree. The industry continues engagement on this matter with relevant authorities.


Broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) ownership transaction

We concluded our new BEE ownership transaction on 14 September 2018. At a deal value of R16.4 billion the transaction was the largest deal of its kind in the ICT sector.

The structure of the deal created significant value for current holders, through a major liquidity event of a special dividend, as well as the opportunity to remain invested in
Vodacom Group, through a mutually beneficial structured deal. This secures Vodacom's Level 3 BEE status, and an effective black ownership of c20%, a key consideration for
spectrum allocation, government contracts and corporate business.


Outlook

The Group has embarked on its digital transformation journey. The strategy positions Vodacom to be a leader and key partner in the 4th Industrial Revolution, and to change from a
traditional telco to a digital services company.

We are leading in the implementation of Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation, to optimise revenue, operate more efficiently and maximise our
investment returns.

Our strategy has the following key pillars:

1. Best customer experience
2. Segmented propositions
3. Financial services
4. Digital content platforms
5. Best technology
6. Digital organisation and culture
7. Our brand and reputation

We are making good progress with these pillars, with good take up of our digital services platform. We continue to expand our Financial Services proposition in South Africa as well
as M-Pesa mobile money in Safaricom and our International operations. We are now strengthening our leading mobile money position on the continent.

As we expand our Enterprise business we are forming strategic partnerships to deliver integrated solutions. These partnerships are strengthening our offerings in IoT and Enterprise
services, by expanding on our customer value propositions. These services are set to drive data growth and new revenue streams.

We are continuing to transform data pricing to the benefit of our customers while limiting negative financial impacts in South Africa through increased demand. We have
implemented ICASA's End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulation. This gives customers more confidence and control in engaging with our services and reduces the risk of
overspending.

These pricing transformation efforts will continue to create short term pressure on data revenue growth in South Africa. Underlying demand however, remains strong and we
anticipate a recovery in growth to start materialising during the second half of the new financial year.

Following the Safaricom acquisition, our profitability target has been expanded to include Safaricom and hence, has changed to Operating profit (previously EBIT), which includes
our share of associate profits in Safaricom. Our capex target range has been updated to reflect changes in revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of IFRS 15.
With the above in mind we update our medium term targets to the following:

1. Mid-single digit Group Service revenue growth
2. Mid-high single digit Group Operating profit** growth (including profit from associate - Safaricom)
3. 13.0%-14.5% of Group Capital expenditure as a % of Group revenue

These targets are on average, over the next three years and are on a reported basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases, exceptional items and any merger and
acquisition activity. Targets are based on IFRS 15, as well as the adoption of IFRS 16: Leases from 1 April 2019.

** In the first year, if we normalised for the prior year one off BEE IFRS 2 charge of R1.4 billion, in the 2019 financial year, we expect to remain in this target range.

Understanding the impacts of IFRS 15:

The difference between IFRS 15 and IAS 18 is mainly noticeable in the contract segment where goods and services delivered under a contract are identified as separate
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised at the point in time the Group delivers the goods or renders the service to the customer.

One of the key changes is the recognition of equipment revenue when control of the device has either transferred to the customer or the intermediary. Previously, equipment
revenue on transfer of a device to a customer was limited to the cash received on inception of the contract. Going forward a device revenue contract asset will be recognised on
inception, which will be recovered over the term of the contract. During the year, R634 million (of which R563 million relates to South Africa) was reclassified from service revenue
to equipment revenue, with total revenue remaining largely unchanged with regards to this element.

In addition, qualifying incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract, previously expensed on payment, is now capitalised as deferred customer acquisition cost and
amortised over the lifetime of the contract (typically 24 months). Amortisation charges of R3.5 billion (relating to South Africa) were netted against service revenue during the
current period, as they are considered to be customer discounts under IFRS 15.


Commentary based on IAS 18:

Group service revenue grew 5.0% (3.8%*) to R74.2 billion#, with strong growth in International offset by a slow down in South Africa.

In South Africa, service revenue increased 2.1% to R55.7 billion# benefitting from strong growth in Enterprise, both in mobile and fixed service revenue, offset by the impact of
pricing transformation and subdued consumer spending.

During the period, we adjusted our revenue deferral methodology in line with the usage insights from our customers and updated our rules with regard to the rollover of unused
minutes and megabytes, resulting in acceleration of revenue recognition of R292 million in the period.

On 1 March we implemented ICASA's End-User and Subscriber Service Charter regulation. The negative financial impact of the regulation was partly offset by a R97 million deferral release
on certain packages where rollover was reduced from five to two months to align with rollover rules applied to all contracts.

In our International operations, service revenue increased 15.6% (up 10.3%*) to R19.5 billion#. Growth came from strategic growth areas such as data and M-Pesa revenue as well
as an increase in customer net additions.

Service revenue grew by 7.0% in Safaricom, driven by growth in customers and M-Pesa.

Understanding the impacts of IFRS 15:

Incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract, previously expensed at inception of the contract under IAS 18, are now capitalised as deferred customer acquisition costs.
Cost amounting R3.4 billion for the year was recognised as a contract asset and will be amortised to the income statement over the contract period (typically 24 months). Certain
types of these customer acquisition costs are considered to be customer discounts under IFRS 15, and netted against service revenue when amortised to the income statement.
Commentary based on IAS 18:

Group total expenses increased 5.2% to R56.3 billion#, which includes a net trading foreign exchange loss of R66 million (2018: profit of R56 million). These costs also include
R124 million in BEE related transaction costs. Growth was outside of our targeted objective of keeping cost growth below revenue growth, mainly as a result of subdued revenue
growth in South Africa.

In South Africa expenses were contained well below inflation, increasing by 4.5%. This was achieved despite the 8.1% growth in our network sites, higher energy costs and site
rental increases. We have limited staff expenses to 2.7% and achieved publicity savings of 4.0%, while also reducing distribution costs related to airtime commissions.

In our International operations, total expenses increased by 7.3% (2.2%*) below revenue growth of 14.4% (9.1%*). This was enabled by continued focus on cost containment
through initiatives such as 'Fit for growth' and the increase of airtime purchases through our M-Pesa platform, which results in a reduction of distribution costs.

Group EBIT increased 1.2% (up 1.8%*) with the Group EBIT margin decreasing by 0.8ppts to 26.0%. This was impacted by the BEE ownership transaction costs of R124 million,
reducing EBIT by 0.5ppts. Group EBITDA growth of 2.4% was slightly offset by depreciation and amortisation which grew at 6.9%. South Africa EBIT declined 4.2% with margins
contracting 1.8ppts to 28.4%. South Africa EBITDA declined 1.3%, with the EBITDA margin contracting primarily due to our roaming agreement with Rain of 0.7ppts. In our
International operations, EBIT increased 63.6% (56.1%*) with the EBIT margin expanding by 5.2ppts to 17.2% and EBITDA margins by 3.1ppts to 31.3% .This includes an insurance
claim received in the DRC in relation to network damage in a fire in the previous year of USD21.5 million. Margins were supported by strong revenue growth and continued
execution on cost containment.

In Safaricom, EBIT increased 13.1% for the financial year as a result of the higher service revenue contribution and commission savings as a result of direct voucher sales through
M-Pesa.

from our associate Safaricom of R2.8 billion. In South Africa, operating profit decreased by 9.5% to R18.9 billion# mainly due to the allocation of R1.2 billion of the IFRS 2 charge to
our South African operation. Excluding this impact and trading foreign exchange (R3.0 million gain); operating profit declined 3.6%*. International operations' operating profit
increased 67.8% to R3.4 billion#, higher than EBIT growth as a result of higher restructuring costs in the DRC in the prior year as well as one off charges relating to the listing in
Tanzania, partially offset by an impairment recognised in the current year relating to assets lost during the cyclone in Mozambique.

Safaricom contributed R2.8 billion# in net profit for the year. This represents our share of attributable profits of R3.4 billion and the related amortisation of fair valued assets
recognised on acquisition of R624 million, before minority interest.

Net finance costs of R2.4 billion# increased 12.8%, mainly contributed by seven months of finance cost for the BEE ownership deal of R171 million and an increase in net interest
paid on bank accounts of R84 million. This was slightly offset by a saving in interest on the Group entity's long-term borrowings of R74 million following a repayment of a 
R2.6 billion loan during the year. The average cost of debt was slightly down to 8.2% from 8.3%.

The change in the net loss on remeasurement and disposal of financial instruments to R23 million is mainly attributable to an increase in gains on the revaluation of foreign
denominated cash balances in the Group offset by the remeasurement of a derivative relating to the agreement to acquire shares in our Tanzania subsidiary from our local partner
and a decrease in a net loss from the remeasurement of foreign exchange contracts in South Africa.


Taxation

The tax expense of R6.7 billion was 2.2% higher than the prior year (2018: R6.5 billion) mainly due to the increase in taxable income and an increase in withholding tax suffered on
dividend income received.

The Group's effective tax rate increased by 0.6% to 30.2% (2018: 29.6%) mainly due to the non-cash, non-recurring IFRS 2 charge; the non-tax deductible transaction costs and the
recurring non-deductible finance costs relating to the BEE ownership transaction (+2.2ppts). This was partially offset by the inclusion of a full year after tax profits from our
associate Safaricom in profit before tax, compared to eight months after tax profits included in the prior year (-1.3ppts). Excluding the non-recurring non-tax deductible BEE costs
the effective tax rate would be 28.2%.

The Group's capital expenditure was R13.0 billion, representing 14.4% of revenue. Slightly outside of our guidance range, as we readied our network for our new roaming partner,
and spend relating to backup power for loadshedding in South Africa. Capital expenditure was focussed on improving the overall mobile network performance and customer
experience with network modernisation and capacity upgrades initiatives and strengthening our IT capabilities. In South Africa, we extended 4G coverage to over 90% of the
population. In our International operations, we added 984 4G sites, 371 3G sites and 292 2G sites since March 2018. In Safaricom, capital expenditure was focused on increasing 3G
and 4G sites by 17% and 69% respectively.


Statement of financial position

Property, plant and equipment increased 8.5% to R44.0 billion and intangible assets increased 19.5% to R10.8 billion compared to 31 March 2018. The combined increase is mainly
as a result of net additions of R14.3 billion and net foreign currency translation gains of R2.1 billion, offset by depreciation and amortisation of R10.6 billion.

Net debt increased by R3.5 billion to R23.3 billion. Total borrowings increased by R2.0 billion to R34.2 billion, mainly due to R4.7 billion preference shares issued to fund the BEE
transaction, partly offset by a R2.6 billion early repayment on one of the Group's Vodafone Luxembourg facilities. Bank and cash balances decreased by R1.5 billion mainly used to
fund capital expenditure.

Safaricom special dividend

Safaricom has proposed a special dividend of KES24.84 billion in addition to an ordinary dividend of KES50.08 billion subject to approval of such dividends at its AGM in August 2019. 
It is the Vodacom Group board's intention to pass this special dividend (net of withholding tax) on to its shareholders at the time of its interim results announcement for the 2020 financial year, 
subject to the receipt of such dividend by Vodacom Group.


Dividend policy

The Board maintains its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of adjusted headline earnings which excludes the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom
and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, the Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend received,
net of withholding tax.
The Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining such sums and repaying such borrowings owing to third parties as shall be necessary to
meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan, taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement to
dividends arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE Listings Requirements.

Notes to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements

for the year ended 31 March 2019

1.      Basis of preparation

        These preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the recognition and measurement criteria
        of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and in accordance with and containing the information required by the International Accounting Standard 34: Interim
        Financial Reporting (IAS 34) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the South African Institute of
        Chartered Accountants' (SAICA) Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Limited (JSE)
        Listings Requirements and the requirements of the Companies Act of 2008, as amended. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial
        instruments which are measured at fair value or at amortised cost, and are presented in South African rand, which is the parent Company's functional and presentation
        currency.

        The significant accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the previous year, except as disclosed in Note
        2. The significant accounting policies are available for inspection at the Group's registered office.

        The preparation of these preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements was supervised by the Chief Financial Officer, Dr. phil. T Streichert.

        These preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements have been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified review conclusion. A copy of 
        the auditor's review report is available for inspection at the Group's registered office, together with the financial statements identified in the auditor's report.

        PwC has acted as auditors to the Group for the past 5 years. In terms of best practice, the Audit, Risk and Compliance (ARC) Committee issued a Request for Proposal (RFP)
        during the year in respect of external audit services. Following the conclusion of the RFP process, it is the recommendation of the ARC Committee, supported by the Board
        that, subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting, Ernst & Young Inc. be appointed as auditor of the Group and as auditor of its subsidiaries in South Africa
        and certain of its African subsidiaries for the financial year ending 31 March 2020.


2.      Changes in accounting policies

        The Group adopted the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the IASB, which were effective and applicable to the Group from 1 April 2018.
        The accounting pronouncements considered by the Group as significant on adoption are IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (IFRS 15) and IFRS 9 ""Financial
        Instruments"" (IFRS 9) as set out below.

        Other IFRS changes adopted on 1 April 2018 have no material impact on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group. Full details on changes in
        accounting policies will be disclosed in the Group's consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019, which will be available on-line.


        IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)

        IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity
        on the date of adoption. The Group's IAS 18 accounting policy, and the key differences between the Group's IAS 18 and IFRS 15 accounting policies, are disclosed in the
        Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.

        IFRS 15 Accounting policy

        When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations
        (obligations) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from
        other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services do not meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations, they are aggregated with
        other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts,
        but might typically be separately identified for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed
        line communication services.

The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled, in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed
contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer contracts on behalf of the Group and receive
commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when
determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs. The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations
according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to
the prices that the Group would achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone
selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs.
Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and payment remains probable.

-   Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service during the
    agreed service period.
-   Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as
    indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to
    receive a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.

When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will
typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or
receivable from a customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is
recognised.
When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided
to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a
significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest is recognised in revenue over the customer's payment period
using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.


Contract related costs

When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to
deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as
expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the
Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an
expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group. Typically this is over the contract period as new commissions are
payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation relating to IFRS 15

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is significantly more complex than under previous reporting requirements and necessitates the collation and processing of very large
amounts of data and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below. Other accounting judgements and estimations made by management are not considered to be individually
critical or material, but cumulatively have a material impact on reported costs and revenues particularly as the Group offers a large variety of bundled goods and services.

Where the Group doesn't sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis it is necessary to estimate the standalone price. When estimating
the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods
and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach
(which is sometimes the case for handsets and other equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to lack of observable standalone sales
or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone
prices of other obligations in the contract. The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts
the timing of revenue when obligations are provided to customers at different times - for example, the allocation of revenue between handsets, which are usually delivered
up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period.

When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. As a principal, receipts from, and
payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer then the
Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised
revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by
management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported
revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or
an agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers third-party branded services (such as premium music or TV content) to customers.

2.1   Mobile device revenue acceleration and deferred customer acquisition costs amortised to revenue

      The main impact of IFRS 15 on the Group's revenue results from service agreements entered into with customers which contain both devices and services as deliverables.
      Under IAS 18, revenue allocated to devices on inception of a customer contract was limited to the amount received. IFRS 15 requires revenue to be recognised for devices
      on inception of the contract, irrespective of the amount received, with a corresponding contract asset representing the unbilled portion, or a contract liability in cases where
      revenue recognised under IFRS 15 is less than the actual invoiced amount for any obligation as a result of an advance payment received. The remainder of the subscription
      fee is recognised over the contract term as services are delivered.

      Contract assets are also raised for the impact of capitalising customer incentive bonuses (CIB). Under IAS 18, incremental costs such as CIB were expensed in the income
      statement as incurred. Under IFRS 15, CIB costs incurred in acquiring a contract customer are deferred and recognised as an asset at inception and amortised against
      revenue over the term of the contract.

2.2   Deferred customer acquisition costs amortised to direct costs

      Under IAS 18, incremental costs were expensed in the income statement as incurred. Under IFRS 15, incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract customer are
      deferred and recognised as an asset at inception. Certain of these costs are subsequently amortised against direct costs over the term of the contract.


2.3   Impairment of contract assets

      IFRS 9 requires expected credit losses to be recorded in respect of amounts due from customers. On initial recognition, the upfront recognition of contract assets under
      IFRS 15 resulted in an increase in credit loss charges recorded in future periods.


2.4   Deferred tax

      A deferred tax liability has been recognised for contract assets and deferred customer acquisition costs recognised under IFRS 15 where applicable, at the enacted statutory
      tax rate in each jurisdiction in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS 12.


2.5   Reduction in revenue deferral

      The reduced subscription fee recognised over the contract term under IFRS 15 (see 2.1 above) leads to a reduction in revenue deferrals.


      IFRS 9 Financial instruments (IFRS 9)

      IFRS 9 impacts the classification and measurement of the Group's financial instruments, revises the requirements for when hedge accounting can be applied and requires
      certain additional disclosures. Whilst hedge accounting requirements are revised under IFRS 9, no material changes to the Group were identified. The Group has adopted
      IFRS 9 with the cumulative retrospective impact on the classification and measurement of financial instruments reflected as an adjustment to equity on the date of
      adoption. The key impacts were as follows:


      - The carrying values of trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables are reduced by the lifetime estimated future credit losses at the date of initial
        recognition, where previously credit losses were not recognised on such assets until there was an indicator of impairment, such as a payment default;
      - Customer receivables that are received in instalments, which are currently recorded at amortised cost, will be recorded at fair value through other comprehensive
        income for receivable portfolios that the Group sells from time to time to third parties.

      The impact on the consolidated statement of financial position at 1 April 2018 is set out below.

      1. Before adjusting for the impact of applying the expected credit loss model.
      2. The Group provides financing to customers to acquire devices at an additional contractual charge which is included in finance receivables. The business model under
         IFRS 9 for finance receivables has been determined to be ""hold to collect and sell"". As a result, the Group has reclassified finance receivables relating to device financing
         from loans and receivables to fair value through other comprehensive income. The full change in the carrying amount arises from a change in measurement attribute on

New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2020


IFRS 16: Leases

IFRS 16: Leases was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17: Leases. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be
adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019.

IFRS 16 will primarily change lease accounting for lessees and will have a material impact on the Group's financial statements in particular:

- Lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right to use the leased item and a liability for future lease payables.
- Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right of use asset and interest on the lease liability. Under IAS 17, operating lease rentals have been
  expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within operating expenses.

     Lessee accounting for finance leases will be similar under IFRS 16 to existing IAS 17 accounting. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is also similar to existing IAS 17
     accounting and is expected to be materially the same for the Group.

     IFRS 16 is being adopted with the cumulative retrospective impact recorded as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption.

     The Group's current estimate of the primary financial impact of these changes on the consolidated statement of financial position on adoption is the recognition of an
     additional lease liability at 1 April 2019 of between R9.1 billion and R9.7 billion. The right of use asset recognised at 1 April 2019 will be between R9.4 billion and 
     R10.0 billion. Overall, these transactions will have no impact on Group retained earnings.

     The Group cannot forecast the impact on the consolidated income statement for the year to 31 March 2020 as it will depend on factors that may occur during the year
     including new leases entered into, changes or reassessments of the Group's existing lease portfolio and changes to exchange rates or discount rates. However, it is expected
     that a similar amount of lease depreciation and interest, when compared to the current operating lease charge, would have been recognised had IFRS 16 been applied in
     the year to 31 March 2019.

     Applying IFRS 16 will not impact net cash flow, although net cash inflows from operating activities and payments classified within cash flow from financing activities will
     both increase, as payments made at both lease inception and subsequently will be characterised as repayments of lease liabilities.

      offset against the forfeitable share plan reserve, R8 million (31 March 2018: R6 million) expensed as staff expenses and R126 million (31 March 2018: R127 million) paid to
      Wheatfields Investments 276 (Pty) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary holding treasury shares on behalf of the Group. An amount of R452 million (31 March 2018: Rnil)
      was paid to YeboYethu Investment Company (RF) (Pty) Limited, a special purpose vehicle holding shares in Vodacom Group Limited on behalf of broad-based black
      economic participants (Note 8). The Group declared a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2019 after the reporting period (Note 13).

8.    Broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) transaction

      The existing Vodacom (Pty) Limited (Vodacom SA) BEE transaction (the previous BEE transaction) was replaced with a new BEE transaction designed to provide liquidity to
      participants through YeboYethu (RF) Limited (YeboYethu) declaring a special dividend, and the opportunity for Vodacom SA BEE shareholders, and the Vodacom Employee
      Share Ownership Trust (ESOP) to participate in a growth opportunity by holding their listed YeboYethu shares. The notional vendor funding of the previous BEE transaction
      was settled, after which YeboYethu exchanged their remaining shares in Vodacom SA for newly issued shares in Vodacom Group Limited (Vodacom Group), which are treated
      as treasury shares on a consolidated level, and are encumbered (Note 10).

      The key features of the BEE transaction include, inter alia:

      - transaction size of R16.4 billion;
      - equity swap ratio of Vodacom SA to Vodacom Group of 73.0%;
      - subscription price discount from Vodacom Group;
      - R3.9 billion equity reinvested by the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders;
      - R3.3 billion paid out to YeboYethu shareholders as a special dividend;
      - continued listing of YeboYethu on the BEE Segment of the JSE;
      - R1.05 billion contribution for YeboYethu ordinary shares by the Group's new employee empowerment trust (Siyanda); and
      - 60% gearing of YeboYethu (third party financing and vendor funding from Vodacom Group).

      Where equity instruments are issued to a BEE partner at less than fair value, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment transaction in terms of IFRS 2:
      Share-based payment (IFRS 2). The new BEE transaction was approved by Vodacom Group shareholders on 16 August 2018, and by YeboYethu shareholders on 17 August 2018. 
      This approval date marks the grant date of the share-based payment transaction, the value of which was originally determined as R2 580 million, being a non-cash,
      non-recurring BEE expense of R1 404 million and a staff component of R1 176 million. Subsequent to this determination, the staff component of the transaction was
      re-measured to R921 million at its final grant date, being 25 March 2019. The revised charge will be spread over the vesting period. Vesting will be in three equal tranches at
      the end of years 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

      The above-mentioned share-based payment charges have been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation based option pricing model. The economic substance of the BEE
      transaction mimics that of a call option, with the value of the outstanding debt at the maturity date of the transaction as the strike price of the option. The assumptions
      used in the model to calculate the IFRS 2 charges include:

      The Group facilitated the establishment of the Innovator Trust in 2014 with an original loan facility of R750 million (reduced to R200 million in the current year), an
      independent entity whose primary purpose is to develop and support black owned small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs) in the information and communication
      technology sector. The Innovator Trust used a portion of the facility to purchase shares in YeboYethu, and uses the income from interest and dividends to develop black
      owned SMME's in the information and communication technology sector and advancement of black owned suppliers in the Group's supply chain.

      The Group currently has no intention to settle the BEE transaction in cash. The Innovator Trust and a portion of the Vodacom ESOP will however be accounted for as
      cash-settled due to the accounting substance thereof. Of the total IFRS 2 charge of R2 325 million(1), R653 million(2) relates to these cash-settled share-based payment
      arrangements. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability relating to the non-recurring charge for Siyanda (R369 million(3), not yet included in the income statement as
      it will accrue over the vesting period) and the Innovator Trust (R285 million, included in the total charge in the income statement and in non-current trade and other
      payables) will be re-measured to fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation based option pricing model. Of the R1 404 million charge, R1 119 million was therefore
      credited to the reserve, and R285 million to an IFRS 2 liability. The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting period based on changes to the various valuation
      inputs. Due to the reduction in the loan facility available to the Innovator Trust, the IFRS 2 liability was reduced by R550 million, with the reserve increasing by the same
      amount, bringing the total reserve movement for the year to R1 669 million.

      1. Revised from R2 580 million due to the staff component being re-measured at its final grant date, being 25 March 2019.
      2. Revised from R755 million due to the staff component being re-measured at its final grant date, being 25 March 2019.
      3. Revised from R471 million due to the staff component being re-measured at its final grant date, being 25 March 2019.

      The unwind of the previous BEE transaction resulted in the special purpose vehicles created by Vodacom SA BEE shareholders being de-consolidated, and is accounted for

9.    Non-current assets held for sale

      The Group entered into agreements to dispose of certain subsidiaries within the Vodacom Business Africa group. The disposals are subject to regulatory approvals, but are
      expected to occur within twelve months from 31 March 2019.

10.   Borrowings

      YeboYethu issued preference shares to the value of R4 654 million to ABSA Bank Limited, Depfin Investments (Pty) Limited and FirstRand Bank Limited in order to finance
      the Group's new BEE transaction (Note 8). These preference shares have a dividend rate of 68% of First National Bank Limited's prime overdraft lending rate, and have a
      maturity date of 14 September 2023. The borrowing is secured by the shares that YeboYethu Investment Company (RF) (Pty) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of
      YeboYethu, holds in Vodacom Group, with a target share cover ratio of above three times the debt. The share cover ratio at 31 March 2019, based on a five day volume-
      weighted average price of R112.18, was 2.84.

      During the current year, the Group refinanced three of its loan facilities received from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. as listed below:

      On 16 July 2018, a R2 000 million loan facility was renewed for a further 3 years at a rate of 3 months Jibar + 1.35%. The loan is repayable on the 16 July 2021.
      The Group also refinanced a R3 000 million facility on 27 September 2018. The loan facility bears interest at 3 month JIBAR + 1.30% and is repayable on 27 September
      2021.

      An existing fixed rate facility of R1 000 million was refinanced with a floating rate facility of R1 000 million at a rate of 3 month Jibar + 1.30% with a repayment date of 28 September 2021.

      On 25 July 2018, the Group made an early capital repayment of R757 million against the R2 576 million loan facility. This loan was then fully repaid with a further early
      capital repayment of R1 819 million on 25 January 2019. The loan was due for repayment on 25 April 2019.
       Vodacom Mozambique obtained a US$100 million loan facility on 30 November 2018 from Standard Bank South Africa, with US$30 million drawn as at 31 March 2019. The
      loan facility bears interest at 6 month LIBOR + 3.30% and is repayable on 30 November 2022.

11.   Contingent liabilities

11.1  Guarantees

      The Group has various guarantees in issue, relating to external financial obligations of its subsidiaries, which amounted to R138 million (31 March 2018: R116 million).
      Foreign denominated guarantees amounting to R1 082 million (31 March 2018: R889 million) are in issue in support of Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA relating to liabilities
      included in the consolidated statement of financial position.


11.2  Tax matters

      The Group is regularly subject to an evaluation by tax authorities of its direct and indirect tax filings. The consequence of such reviews is that disputes may arise with tax
      authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules to the Group's business. The tax laws are in some instances ambiguous and subject to a broad range of
      interpretations. To address and manage this tax uncertainty, good governance is fundamental to the Group's business sustainability. All major tax positions taken are subject
      to review by executive management and are reported to the Board. The Group has support from external advisors supporting the positions taken in respect of the significant
      tax matters which confirms the application and interpretation of the tax legislation. The Group has considered all matters in dispute and has accounted for any exposure
      identified, if required. These disputes may not necessarily be resolved in a manner that is favourable to the Group.


11.3  Legal contingencies

      The Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has, in consultation with its legal counsel, assessed the outcome of these proceedings. Following this
      assessment, the Group's management has determined that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal proceedings as at 31 March 2019.


12.   Other matters

12.1  Kenneth Makate (Mr Makate) vs Vodacom (Pty) Limited

      Following the failure of the parties to reach an agreement on the amount of reasonable compensation to be paid for a business idea that led to the development of a
      product known as 'Please Call Me', Mr. Makate declared a deadlock and referred the matter to the Group's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in his judicially sanctioned role as a
      deadlock breaking mechanism, to make a determination on the reasonable amount of compensation payable to him. The CEO has made such a determination, in
      accordance with the Constitutional Court order, but Mr Makate has rejected the CEO's determination. The Group has subsequently been informed by Mr Makate's attorneys
      that he intends to have the CEO's determination judicially reviewed.


12.2  Competition Commission investigations

12.2.1 Competition Commission data service market inquiry

       The Competition Commission initiated a market inquiry into data services on 30 November 2017. The purpose of the inquiry is to understand what factors or features of the
       market(s) and value chain may cause or lead to high prices for data services, and to make recommendations that would result in lower prices for data services. This inquiry
       covers all market participants involved at any point in the value chain for any form of data services that are provided to customers such as government, businesses and
       consumers in South Africa. The Competition Commission issued a summary of provisional findings and recommendations on 24 April 2019, inviting comments from
       stakeholders by 14 June 2019. The date for completion of the data market inquiry is 31 December 2019.


12.2.2 Competition complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile communications services

       On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government departments in
       South Africa. The tender was awarded to the Group, for the period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020, after an open and transparent process. The Competition
       Commission has initiated an investigation against the Group for alleged abuse of dominance, under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act, which investigation is
       ongoing.

       In the DRC, Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA was granted its 4G license and additional spectrum, pending Digital Terrestrial Television migration. In both Tanzania and
       Mozambique, additional spectrum was acquired via a spectrum auction. In Lesotho, the Communications Regulator approved and granted an application for additional
       spectrum, thereby enabling the launch of 5G services.


12.4   Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA bill)

       On 12 February 2019, the Minister of Communications informed the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee of her decision to withdraw the ECA Amendment Bill from the
       parliamentary process. The ECA Amendment Bill is unlikely to be re-submitted to the new parliament in its current form given the new emphasis on the fourth industrial
       revolution - which is likely to require further policy, legislative and regulatory changes. The effect of the withdrawal of the ECA Amendment Bill is that the licensing of high
       demand spectrum can be managed under the existing legislation and in this regard the Ministry is contemplating issuing new policy directions to ICASA.

12.5   ICASA priority market review

       In June 2017, ICASA published a notice of intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act. The purpose of the study is to
       identify markets to be prioritised for potential review and regulation. On 16 November 2018, ICASA commenced a market inquiry into mobile broadband services. The
       purpose of the inquiry is to assess the state of competition and determine whether or not there are markets or market segments within the mobile broadband services
       value chain which may require regulatory intervention. ICASA aims to finalise the inquiry during the 2020 financial year.


12.6   Amendment to End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

       On 7 May 2018, ICASA published the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Amendment Regulations (the amendments), which came into effect on 1 March 2019. The
       main objective is to address consumer concerns with regard to out-of-bundle charges and expiry of data. The amendments followed a consultation process between ICASA
       and industry stakeholders. Further amendments were published on 12 February 2019, which came into effect on 12 April 2019.

12.7   Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA (Vodacom Congo)

12.7.1 Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA)

       Vodacom Congo is not in compliance with the minimum capital requirements as set out under the OHADA. Vodacom Congo has to increase its share capital to meet the
       minimum OHADA requirements. In a bid to remedy this non- compliance, the shareholders of Vodacom Congo agreed on 28 December 2018 to convert the initial
       shareholder loans into equity. This recapitalisation resulted in a 32% improvement in the negative equity position. A non-compliance gap remains, but this matter is
       continuously being discussed by the Board and shareholders of Vodacom Congo.


12.7.2 Investigation on unpaid taxes for devices

       The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Customs Authority (DGDA) has instituted a criminal claim against Vodacom Congo for unpaid custom duties on alleged smuggled
       devices bought by Vodacom Congo from a local supplier, who subsequently closed its business in the DRC. The Group has objected to the claim, and is co-operating with
       the relevant authorities.


12.8   Vodacom Tanzania Public Company Limited (Vodacom Tanzania)

       The Group has entered into an agreement with its local Tanzanian partner, Mirambo Limited (Mirambo), and certain of Mirambo's shareholders, under the terms of which the
       Group will acquire all of Mirambo's 588 million shares in Vodacom Tanzania. This will result in the Group increasing its total interest in Vodacom Tanzania from 61.6% (direct
       and indirect) to 75% (direct). The transaction close is subject to conditions precedent.


12.9   10T Holdings (Pty) Limited and IoT.nxt B.V. acquisition

       The Group entered into an agreement to purchase a 51% equity interest in 10T Holdings (Pty) Limited and IoT.nxt B.V. (together ""IoT.nxt""). IoT.nxt creates data-connectivity
       between new data sources and legacy systems which allows for real-time data availability across a wide business segment. The transaction is subject to the approval of the
       Competition Commission.


13.    Events after the reporting period

       The Board is not aware of any matter or circumstance arising since the end of the reporting period, not otherwise dealt with herein, which significantly affects the financial
       position of the Group or the results of its operations or cash flows for the period, other than the following:


13.1   Vodacom Tanzania

       In April 2019, several of Vodacom Tanzania Plc's (Vodacom Tanzania) employees, including the Managing Director, were arrested by the Tanzanian Police in relation to a
       customer's alleged illegal use of network facilities. These employees were charged with a number of offences, including economic crimes which are non-bailable offences
       under Tanzania's Economic Organised Crime Act (EOCA).

       Vodacom Tanzania paid a fine of TZS 30 million (R0.2 million) as well as an amount of TZS 5.2 billion (R32 million), as compensation for the financial losses occasioned to
       the Tanzanian Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA), after pleading guilty to the offences of occasioning pecuniary loss to a specified authority and permitting use
       of network services in contravention of the Electronic and Postal Communications Act (EPOCA).

       Vodacom Tanzania, its parent companies Vodacom Group Limited and Vodafone Group Plc are committed to upholding the highest standards of business integrity, ethics
       and good corporate governance. The companies have retained global law firm, Squire Patton Boggs to assist with an internal investigation into the underlying facts in line
       with the companies' legal and corporate governance principles and to safeguard the company.


13.2   Safaricom dividends declared 2 May 2019

       Safaricom proposed a dividend of KES 50.08 billion for the financial year ended 31 March 2019. In addition, Safaricom proposed a special dividend of KES 24.84 billion. Both
       these dividends are payable to shareholders on or before 1 December 2019, subject to shareholders' approval at the annual general meeting. The Group's share of these
       dividend proposals, at a KES/ZAR exchange rate of 6.99, after withholding tax, amounts to R2 253 million and R1 118 million respectively.



13.3   Dividend declared after the reporting date and not recognised as a liability

       A final dividend of R7 343 million (400 cents per ordinary share) for the year ending 31 March 2019, was declared on 10 May 2019, payable on 24 June 2019 to
       shareholders recorded in the register at the close of business on 21 June 2019. The net dividend after taking into account dividend withholding tax for those shareholders
       not exempt from dividend withholding tax is 320.00000 cents per share.

       1. Level one classification is used when the valuation is determined using quoted prices in an active market.
       2. Level two classification is used when valuation inputs used to determine fair value are observable for the asset/(liability), either directly as prices or indirectly when
          derived from prices.
       3. The Group provides financing to customers to acquire devices at an additional contractual charge which is included in finance receivables. The business model under
          IFRS 9 for finance receivables has been determined to be ""hold to collect and sell"". As a result, the Group has reclassified finance receivables relating to device financing
          from loans and receivables to fair value through other comprehensive income. The inclusion in the fair value hierarchy arises from a change in measurement attribute
          on transition to IFRS 9.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things connections (IoT), is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
   customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
5. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during the period.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service
   revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

   adjustment was USD11.4 million for Q1 2018 and USD4.4 million for Q2 2018. Q1 2018 has not been restated for this change. This was partially offset by a refund of DRC sales
   tax (ICA) of USD9.9 million in Q2 2018.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things connections (IoT), is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
   customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
5. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during the period.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service
   revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during the period.
4. M-Pesa customers are based on the number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa during the last month.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include
   service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. The financial information relating to revenue, service revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and operating profit are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year
   ended 31 March 2019.
2. This column and related adjustments represents the reconciliation of IFRS 15 to IAS 18. For a more detailed explanation of the impact of the application of IFRS 15 on the Group
   refer to the applicable criteria set out in IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" as set out below.
3. Trading foreign exchange adjustments (FX) are foreign exchange gains/losses on foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulting from trading activities of entities
   within the Group, which is included with other operating expenses as per the condensed consolidated income statement.
4. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar,
   Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.
   Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being
   rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the year ended 31 March 2019 (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated
   rand value with the functional currency for the period) to 31 March 2018 numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange variances.
5. Merger and Acquisition relates to the net profit from associate and joint venture relating to Safaricom as disclosed in the condensed consolidated income statement and the
   IFRS 2 charge as disclosed in Note 8 in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
6. The percentage change relates to the year-on-year percentage growth on a comparable IAS 18 basis calculated as the percentage change between the year-to-date 31 March 2019 and year-to-date 31 March 2018 IAS 18 values.
7. The percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth on a comparable IAS 18 basis calculated as the percentage change between the
   quarter-to-date 31 March 2019 and the quarter-to-date 31 March 2018 IAS 18 values.

IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers""

IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity on the
date of adoption. The Group's IAS 18 accounting policy, and the key differences between the Group's IAS 18 and IFRS 15 accounting policies, are disclosed in the Group's annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019.


IFRS 15 Accounting policy

When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations (obligations) to
the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in
the agreement. Where individual goods and services don't meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations, they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the
agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified
for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communication services.

The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled to in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed
contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer contracts on behalf of the Group and receive commission,
any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the
transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs. The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative
standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would
achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not directly
observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs.

- Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and payment remains probable.
- Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service during the agreed
  service period.

Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as indirect
channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund;
otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.

When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be
recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a
customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised.


When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided to a
customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a significant
financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest is recognised in revenue over the customer's payment period using an interest rate
reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.


Contract related costs

When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to deliver an
obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with
the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the Group, are
recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line
with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group. Typically this is over the contract period as new commissions are payable on contract
renewal. Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised.


Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation relating to IFRS 15

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is significantly more complex than under previous reporting requirements and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts
of data and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant critical accounting judgements and key sources of
estimation uncertainty are disclosed below. Other accounting judgements and estimations made by management are not considered to be individually critical or material, but
cumulatively have a material impact on reported costs and revenues particularly as the Group offers a large variety of bundled goods and services.

Where the Group doesn't sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis it is necessary to estimate the standalone price. When estimating the
standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods and services
sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes
the case for handsets and other equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing,
which is sometimes the case for services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the
contract. The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue when obligations
are provided to customers at different times - for example, the allocation of revenue between handsets, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically
delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the
12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised.

When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to customer. As a principal, receipts from, and payments
to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer then the Group is acting as
an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the
margin earned by the Group. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and
substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact
reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those where the Group
delivers third-party branded services (such as premium music or TV content) to customers.

Additional financial and operational measures

This announcement contains certain financial (i.e. service revenue, enterprise service revenue, EBITDA and EBIT) and operational (i.e. customers, ARPUs and number of employees)
measures which are presented in addition to the financial information disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 which have
been prepared in terms of IFRS. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance of the Group or the
Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all
companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, although
these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed in isolation or as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as complementary to,
the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019. The financial measures have been extracted from the management accounts upon which the
condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 are based. Refer to above for details relating to service revenue, EBIT and headline
earnings per share and the supplementary information above for a reconciliation thereof to the reported results included in this announcement.

Following the prospective adoption of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 April 2018, the Group's results for the quarter
ended 31 December 2018 are on an IFRS 15 basis, whereas the results for the quarter ended 31 December 2017 are (as previously
reported) on an IAS 18 basis. Comparisons between the two bases of reporting are not meaningful and to ensure appropriate disclosure
during the period of transition onto IFRS 15, results for the quarter ended 31 December 2018 have been disclosed on both an IFRS 15 and
IAS 18 basis. Our commentary describing our operating performance in the Operating review has been provided solely on an IAS 18 basis.
The accounting standard applied is clearly marked in the heading of relevant columns in the trading update.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

A strong performance in our International operations helped to offset the slowdown in South Africa during the quarter. Growth in revenue
and service revenue at a Group level increased by 1.5% and 2.4% respectively. Excluding Safaricom, we added 198 000 customers in the
three-month period and now serve 79 million across the Group, having added a healthy 5.2 million customers to the Vodacom network in
the past year.

In South Africa, service revenue declined 0.9%, impacted by the effects of our pricing transformation strategy in order to reduce the cost to
communicate, as well as the transitioning of traffic between our roaming partners. We implemented a number of generous promotions in
the quarter, including our SummerGigs campaign, in addition to the introduction of lower-priced bundled offers during the course of 2018.
These efforts have impacted data revenue growth, as it did not yield the expected elasticity given a tougher than anticipated consumer
spending environment. However, our proactive efforts to keep customers in-bundle have reduced our future exposure to out of bundle
revenues.

In our International operations, service revenue increased by 13.2% on the back of sustained data revenue growth and M-Pesa's continued
success. Our International portfolio (excluding Safaricom) now contributes 27.5% to overall Group service revenue. The significant increase
in customers in the quarter and strong commercial execution contributed to data revenue growth of 25.4% and to the 30.3% growth
produced by M-Pesa.

Notes:
The quarterly information has not been audited or reviewed by Vodacom's external auditors.

All growth rates quoted are year-on-year and refer to the quarter ended 31 December 2018 compared to the quarter ended 
31 December 2017, which are based on IAS 18 accounting principles, unless stated otherwise.

Certain financial information presented in this results announcement constitutes pro-forma financial information in terms of the JSE
Listings Requirements. The applicable criteria on the basis of which this pro-forma financial information has been prepared is set out in the
supplementary information below. The pro-forma financial information includes:

- Financial information, on a comparable IAS 18 basis, for the quarter ended 31 December 2018, marked as '#' in this document.
- Amounts marked with an * in this document, represent normalised growth which presents performance on a comparable IAS 18 basis.
  This excludes foreign currency fluctuation on a constant currency basis (using the current reporting period as base).

The pro-forma financial information has not been audited or reviewed or otherwise reported on by external auditors.

Looking ahead, we will be implementing the End-User Subscriber Service Charter Regulations on 1 March, which will drag on data revenue
growth in the near-term. However, we are particularly encouraged by the positive momentum on the regulatory front in South Africa
following firm commitments by Government and the regulator to stage an auction of '4G spectrum' in the early part of this calendar year,
which together with the success of our pricing transformation strategy support the medium term outlook for data revenue growth. With
an enhanced M-Pesa platform and high speed 4G now available in all our International markets, we expect the solid performance in these
operations to continue gaining momentum.

Operating review

South Africa (IAS 18 commentary)

Service revenue declined by 0.9% (flat adjusting for the transition between national roaming partners and the change in call termination
rates), impacted by customers optimising promotional data as part of our Summer campaign and a subdued consumer spending
environment. Revenue fell by 1.3% following lower growth in equipment revenue, with device sales negatively impacted by the weaker rand
against the US dollar.

Customer numbers were up 5.4%. Prepaid customer growth was resilient, while efforts to reduce once-off use of SIM cards started to take
effect, resulting in lower gross additions in the quarter. During the period, we gained 86 000 contract customers to 5.6 million, up 5.7% yoy,
supported by gains in both the Consumer and Enterprise segments.

Contract customer service revenue was down 2.7%, impacted by reduced out-of-bundle data spend, as well as customers continuing to
migrate to more inclusive value contracts as part of our pricing transformation strategy. In the period we have also seen more customers
selecting from our lower value packages in order to control their spend, in the context of the weaker economic environment.

Prepaid customer service revenue grew 0.8%, lower than the previous quarters, with increased number of customer opting for lower priced
bundles with shorter validity periods, especially in data.

Voice revenue remained resilient, declining by only 0.5%, stimulated by strong demand supported by our Airtime Advance product, which
makes it easier to buy airtime when a customer is not close to traditional channels.

Data revenue was flat on the prior year, as customers used data rewards from our Summer campaign to offset their usual spend. Utilisation
remains encouragingly strong, with data traffic up 41.4%. Active smart devices on the network were up 13.3% to 20.2 million, with average
gigabytes per smart device increasing by 31.9% to 1.1GB. 4G customers increased 40.5% to 9.2 million. We sold 209 million data bundles
this quarter, as we continue to migrate customers to more in-bundle usage. We are managing out-of-bundle spend, with more inclusive
value contracts and affordable data bundles with shorter validity periods, both of which are increasing in popularity with customers. The
long-term benefit from this pricing transformation, is expected to offset the short-term growth impacts as customers migrate to offers with
lower effective rates, despite lower elasticity currently being experienced in the market.

Our platform strategy, designed to stimulate reasons to consume data, is gaining momentum. Our Videoplay platform now has over 
700 000 active users paying for services, and our recently launched music platform, Muze, is steadily gaining customers.

Fixed line service revenue grew 11.3% with strong growth in wholesale transit revenue. Internet of Things (IoT) connections increased
24.0% to 4.3 million. We have started the process of migration between Cell C and Telkom roaming on our network and are expecting
increased traffic from Telkom to start offsetting the reduced Cell C traffic within the next couple of quarters.

During this quarter, our capital expenditure spend of R2.6 billion was focused on increasing our network coverage and enhancing our IT
systems. Our data network reaches 99.5% of the population on 3G and 90% on 4G.

We maintained our lead on Net Promoter Score to our nearest competitor by 7ppts, based on best network performance, service and value.

International (IAS 18 commentary)

Overall, our International operations performed well, with, improved trends in Tanzania and strong growth in Mozambique and the DRC.

Service revenue growth in our International operations, which accounts for 27.5% of Group service revenue, remained robust at 13.2%
(9.4%*), underpinned by our strategic drivers of M-Pesa and data growth. Our mobile network operations, excluding Vodacom Business
Africa, grew 15.2% (11.1%*).

We added 449 000 customers in the quarter, reaching 35.2 million, up 9.3% yoy. We continue with our efforts to improve customer
registration processes in all our markets.

With high speed 4G now available in all markets, data revenue grew 25.4% (21.3%*) driven by a 15.7% increase in data customers to 
18.5 million, representing 52.7% of the customer base. Data traffic grew 40.3%, reflecting strong demand for mobile data services in all our
markets. Mobile data revenue comprised 16.5% (2018: 14.9%) of International service revenue.

We generated M-Pesa revenue of R851 million, with growth accelerating to 30.3% (26.4%*), contributing 16.4% of service revenue, as
we grow the ecosystem in all markets. We added 227 000 customers in the quarter, reaching 13.4 million. In Mozambique, we expanded
interoperability to a third bank, Mozambique's biggest retail bank, widening and enhancing the M-Pesa ecosystem for all our customers. On
average for the quarter, 237 million transactions were processed monthly through the M-Pesa system, growing at 24.2% yoy. Our merchant
payment platform has also been very successful across our markets as we expand our ecosystem.

In November, a spectrum auction for 800MHz spectrum in Mozambique was conducted and we were awarded with two blocks of 10MHz
bands at a cost of US$33 million. Capital expenditure in the quarter increased 41.9% to R894 million, mainly as a result of Mozambique
receiving their 4G spectrum and increasing their 4G rollout. During the quarter, 2G and 3G sites increased 4.2% and 6.6% respectively and
we closed the quarter with 1 584 4G sites.

Results for Vodacom's associate investment in Safaricom are disclosed on a bi-annual basis and therefore are not included in this quarterly
update.

Regulatory matters

Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA Bill)

On 17 November 2017, the Ministry published an invitation to provide comments on the ECA bill, having its origins in the Integrated
Information and Communication Technology ICT Policy White Paper of 2 October 2016. In December 2018 Parliament invited stakeholders
to submit written comments on the ECA Bill and to participate in public hearings. Prior to Parliament considering and passing the ECA
Bill into law, the Ministry has also issued a draft Policy Direction for public comment, which aims to enable the licensing of High Demand
Spectrum under the existing EC Act legislation. The Ministry and the Regulator have both indicated their intention to assign High Demand
Spectrum under the existing regulatory framework during the first half of this calendar year and to give more certainty with regard to policy.

Amendment to End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 30 April 2018, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) published final amendments to the End-User and
Subscriber Service Charter Regulations with the objective of addressing consumer concerns on out-of-bundle charges and data bundle
expiry rules. The implementation date has been set for 28 February 2019.

ICASA priority market review

In June 2017, ICASA gave notice of its intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in the Electronic Communications Sector
(ECS). The purpose of the enquiry is to identify relevant wholesale and retail markets or market segments in the ECS that are generally
prone to ex ante regulation, and to determine from these markets and market segments those that the Authority intends to prioritise for
market reviews and potential regulation. On 17 August 2018, ICASA published a findings document in which it listed broad markets that will
be prioritised for potential market review:

- Wholesale fixed access, which includes wholesale supply of asymmetric broadband origination, fixed access services and
  relevant facilities;
- Upstream infrastructure markets incorporating national transmission services, metropolitan connectivity and relevant facilities; and
- Mobile services, which includes the retail market for mobile services and the wholesale supply of mobile network services, including
  relevant facilities.

On 16 November ICASA published a notice of intention to conduct an inquiry into mobile broadband services. The inquiry will comprise
four phases, with the final phase being the publication of a Findings Document and Draft Regulations (if required), which is expected in the
second half of this calendar year.

DRC elections - Internet and SMS ban

The national elections in the DRC took place on 30 December 2018. Congo's electoral commission announced the provisional winner of
the presidential election on 10 January 2019.
On 31 December 2018, the Ministry of Communications directed a full internet and SMS ban for national security reasons. The ban was
lifted following the confirmation of the final presidential election results on 19 January 2019 by the Constitutional Court.

DRC proposed traffic monitoring system

On 11 December 2018, a Decree to implement a new traffic monitoring system levying additional charges on operators was signed off by
all relevant government authorities. The Decree has not yet been gazetted. The Industry is challenging the matter through the Federation
of Enterprises of Congo.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers
   paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are
   active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on
   integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle
   during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service
   during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or
   a central station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
5. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing
   international roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period.
   Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers
   paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are
   active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on
   integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle
   during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service
   during the reported month.
3. M-Pesa customers are based on the number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa during the last month.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly customers during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period.
   Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. This column and related adjustment represents the reconciliation of IFRS 15 to IAS 18.
2. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for
   example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange
   rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above. Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation
   of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being rand. The exchange
   variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the quarter ended 31 December 2018 (which is derived by dividing the
   individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the period) to 31 December 2017 numbers, thereby giving a
   user a view of the performance which excludes exchange variances.
3. The percentage change relates to the year-on-year percentage growth on a comparable IAS 18 basis calculated as the percentage
   change between the quarter ended 31 December 2018 and quarter ended 31 December 2017 IAS 18 values.


Additional financial and operational measures

This announcement contains certain financial (i.e. service revenue, enterprise service revenue) and operational (i.e. customers, ARPUs)
measures. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance
of the Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. However, this additional
information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it may not be
comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, although these measures are important in the
management of the business, they should not be viewed in isolation or as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as complementary.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement which sets out the quarterly results for Vodacom Group Limited for the quarter ended 31 December 2018 contains
'forward-looking statements', which have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors, with respect to the Group's financial
condition, results of operations and businesses and certain of the Group's plans and objectives. In particular, such forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: expectations regarding the Group's financial condition or results
of operations including the confirmation of the Group's targets, expectations for the Group's future performance generally; expectations
regarding the operating environment and market conditions and trends; intentions and expectations regarding the development,
launch and expansion of products, services and technologies; growth in customers and usage; expectations regarding spectrum licence
acquisitions; expectations regarding adjusted EBITDA, capital additions, free cash flow, and foreign exchange rate movements; and
expectations regarding the integration or performance of current and future investments, associates, joint ventures, non-controlled
interests and newly acquired businesses.

Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as ""will"",
""anticipates"", ""aims"", ""could"", ""may"", ""should"", ""expects"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""plans"" or ""targets"" (including in their negative form). By their
nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and
developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not
limited to, the following: changes in economic or political conditions in markets served by operations of the Group; greater than anticipated
competitive activity; higher than expected costs or capital expenditures; slower than expected customer growth and reduced customer
retention; changes in the spending patterns of new and existing customers; the Group's ability to expand its spectrum position or renew or

Shameel Joosub Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Following on from last year's extraordinary year for Vodacom, we delivered two strategic milestones during the first half of this year. In September, we concluded our second BEE
transaction under the YeboYethu umbrella to replace the highly successful R7.5 billion deal launched in 2008.

Valued at R16.4 billion, the new scheme is the biggest ever in the Telecommunications industry in South Africa and makes YeboYethu our third largest shareholder. As expected,
the costs associated with this transaction had a once-off impact on headline earnings per share. Excluding the charges relating to the BEE transaction and contribution from
Safaricom, HEPS rose 6.0%~. To facilitate the new BEE structure, we issued an additional 114.5 million shares yet increased our interim dividend to 395cps.

In September, Vodacom Lesotho became the first company to commercially launch 5G on the African continent. This makes Vodacom Lesotho amongst the first in the world to lay
claim to this innovation, paving the way for our other operations to follow suit once we secure the requisite spectrum.

Over 5 million customers joined the Vodacom and Safaricom networks, increasing the combined customer base to 109 million. This shows that our strategy of sustained and
targeted investment in customer and network experience across our operations is delivering strong results, contributing to the 5.8%* growth in service revenue across the Group.

In South Africa, underlying growth has weakened as the country's economic slowdown increasingly weighs on consumer spending in the market. Still, service revenue rose 4.6% as
anticipatory measures driven by the use of Big Data machine learning in more areas of the business has contributed to countering some of these pressures. The 2.5 million increase
in customers in South Africa since March, shows that our sustained effort to deliver greater value is working across prepaid and contract and is evidence that our personalisation
through Big Data is delivering results.

We invested R4 billion in South Africa alone in the past six months and at the same time we reduced effective voice and data prices by 8.5% and 16.4% respectively. We continue to
accelerate our rural coverage expansion programme to bridge the digital divide and will prioritise an additional 200 villages this year to add to the 101 communities that we
connected during the first quarter of this year.

Mozambique produced an excellent performance while the momentum from our commercial actions in Tanzania and DRC last year continues to gather pace. This contributed to
the strong performance in our International portfolio where normalised service revenue grew 11.4%*, led by rising customer numbers, accelerating demand for data and improved
growth in M-Pesa.

The contribution to the Group by our mobile money platform continues to improve. The combined customer base, including Safaricom, grew 13.7% to 34.2 million. In our
International operations, we processed M-Pesa transactions worth USD14 billion, supporting a 25.2% increase in revenue to R1.4 billion. M-Pesa now supports 21 million Safaricom
customers, an increase of 8.8%, and M-Pesa now constitutes nearly one-third of its service revenues.

Our strategic investment in Safaricom, concluded in the previous financial year, is exceeding our expectations having contributed R1.4 billion to the Vodacom Group's operating
profit. Safaricom reported a 7.7% increase in service revenue and an 18.7% rise in EBIT.

Looking ahead, the relative economic and currency stability in most of our International markets is pleasing and we will continue to invest heavily in our networks, artificial
intelligence and Big Data analytics to drive financial inclusion, further enhance customer experience and progress Vodacom's digital telco strategy. I am pleased that Telkom has
selected Vodacom as its new roaming partner, and we look forward to delivery on this long-term mutually beneficial agreement. Apart from the commercial benefit, this
partnership will also result in cost savings for Vodacom. Efforts to reduce the cost to communicate are contingent on having access to the right spectrum at reasonable market-
related prices. While we are encouraged by the significant progress in recent times regarding the licensing of 4G spectrum in South Africa, there are still a number of areas of
concern with the current draft Electronic Communications Act as well as inconsistencies in the proposed policy and policy directions to ICASA on licensing unassigned high
demand spectrum. We remain committed to engaging with relevant stakeholders to find a suitable outcome to move South Africa forward.

Following the prospective adoption of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 April 2018, the Group's results for the six months ended 30 September 2018 are on an
IFRS 15 basis, whereas the results for the six months ended 30 September 2017 are (as previously reported) on an IAS 18 basis. Comparisons between the two bases of reporting
are not meaningful and to ensure appropriate disclosure during the period of transition onto IFRS 15, results for the six months ended 30 September 2018 has been disclosed on
both an IFRS 15 and IAS 18 basis. Our commentary describing our operating performance in the Operating Review has been provided solely on an IAS 18 basis. The accounting
standard applied is clearly marked in the heading of relevant columns in the news release. To aid in the understanding of the transition from IAS 18 to IFRS 15, we have provided
commentary on the main differences between the two standards below. Further disclosure is also included in Note 2: Change in accounting policies and in Note 3:
Segment analysis of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2018.

accounting principles, unless stated otherwise.
^ On 7 August 2017, the Group acquired an effective interest of 34.94% in Safaricom Limited which is accounted for as an
  investment in associate. Net profit from associate and joint venture includes attributable net profits and related
  amortisation of fair valued assets. Prior year results reflect two months of attributable net profit.


Operating review

South Africa (IAS 18 commentary)

Service revenue grew 4.6%, which includes a once-off benefit of R292 million relating to a change in our revenue deferral methodology. Growth was
driven by continued customer gains in all segments, although affected by the weak economic environment negatively impacting consumer spending. Revenue growth was
somewhat lower at 4.3% as a result of slowed growth in equipment revenue. Device sales were negatively impacted by a weaker rand against the US dollar.

Mobile customer revenue grew 3.0%, sustaining a strong trend in the first six months, which was driven by a strong growth in customers, both contract and prepaid, slightly offset
by lower ARPU reflecting lower spending customer inflows.

Our pricing transformation in contract is progressing well. We gained 177 thousand customers in the first six months, with good progress in both the Consumer and Enterprise
segments. Following the introduction of our new 'plus' plans with more inclusive value, representing 50% of the contract base, we gained sufficient information to predict the
changing usage behaviour on these packages. Consequently we have adjusted our revenue deferral methodology, in line with the customer usage insights. This has resulted in
acceleration of the recognition of revenue of R292 million in the period. Contract ARPU was down by 2.0%, with customers opting for plans with lower tariffs, but higher device
financing component.

We added 2.3 million prepaid customers during the first six months resulting in strong customer growth of 10.9%. This has been partly offset by lower prepaid ARPU, down 6.9%, as
we attract new customers with lower spend levels than the current base and also as a result of customers opting for shorter validity periods for data bundles at a lower price.
Customers continue to respond well to our bundle offers and we recently launched 'RedHotDealz' to further improve our value offerings. Our strategic focus on providing
customers with easier access to airtime through Airtime Advance and using Big Data analytics to further enhance this proposition, has resulted in R2.9 billion of airtime generated
through this platform. Revenue earned from this service more than doubled, with 8.4 million customers now using this convenient way to purchase airtime.

Overall data usage drivers were encouraging. Data traffic grew strongly at 28.6%, slightly impacted by our efforts to improve monetisation by re-balancing the promotional data
offered to customers to encourage usage; billed traffic was up 36.7%. Active smart devices on the network were up 10.5% to 19.1 million, of which 9 million are 4G devices with
overall data customers up 3.2% to 20.5 million. We have seen strong growth in the number of bundles sold, up 26.0% or 437 million data bundles, driven by our 'Just 4 You'
personalised offers, as we continue to migrate customers to more in-bundle usage. The optimisation of customers' spend towards shorter validity bundles with lower effective rates
and reduction in out-of-bundle revenue has resulted in a slightly lower data revenue growth of 7.5%. Our digital services is making good progress in enabling new data platforms
such as our recently launched video play platform. Our initial focus has been on ensuring a rich customer experience. Take up of the service is encouraging with more than 272 000
active users on the platform.

The Enterprise segment is performing particularly well with good growth in mobile customer revenue, up 7.7%, resulting from good customer growth of 9.7%. In addition, fixed line
service revenue grew at 29.2% to R1.3 billion, with IPVPN services such as IP connect Fibre and Broadband connect showing good growth. Cloud and hosting revenue grew 14.2%
with strong growth both in 'infrastructure as a service' and 'platform as a service' offerings.

We continue to drive our 'Own the home' strategy resulting in good traction on fibre to the home/business, more than doubling the connections in the period.
EBITDA grew 2.8% to R13.8 billion#, while the EBITDA margin of 38.9% reduced by 0.6ppts as a result of the roaming agreement with Rain. This affected margins by 0.7ppts, as we
continue to scale up on the roaming agreement, and moving cost of capacity from depreciation to direct expenses. The remainder of costs continue to be well maintained, in line
with revenue growth.

During the period, we invested over R4 billion into our network, to give customers the best network experience; improving voice quality and data speeds. We have the widest data
network reaching 99.5% of the population on 3G and 83% on 4G. We consistently rank best on data performance metrics across various independent surveys. During the period, we
continued to drive modernisation and improvements in the network, including extending high speed transmission to 93% of our sites and enabling carrier aggregation on more
than five thousand sites in the six months, to further improve the customer experience.

International (IAS 18 commentary)

Our International operations performed well, with strong focus on delivering on key strategic priorities, supported by improving macroeconomic trends. Tanzania continues to
benefit from strong commercial momentum and robust customer growth despite the intensified pricing pressure from competitors. The DRC and Mozambique both delivered
strong results.

Service revenue increased by 12.8% (11.4%*) to R9.4 billion#, with strong growth in our strategic focus areas of data and M-Pesa. We added 2.3 million customers in the first half,
reaching 34.7 million, up 11.4%. Tanzania and the DRC together added 2.1 million customers, while customers in Mozambique increased 18.2%.

Data revenue growth was robust at 26.6% (24.1%*), with all markets growing above 20%. Through our segmented marketing approach and targeted data bundle offers, from our Big
Data enabled 'Just for You' propositions, we were able to monetise the demand for data. We continue to invest considerably into our data networks to widen coverage and improve
experience. In September, we launched 4G services in Mozambique. We now have 4G services across all of our operations. We added 1.4 million data customers this half, to reach
18.0 million, up 21.7%.

M-Pesa revenue grew strongly by 25.2% (24.2%*) to R1.4 billion#, contributing 15.1% of International service revenue. We added 1.4 million customers in the half, reaching 
13.2 million. We continue to add new services to the platform to expand customers' payment options and make transacting more accessible by increasing our agent network. Following
the success of our merchant payment solution in Tanzania, we have rolled out the solution in Mozambique and Lesotho, giving our customers the convenience to transact with
M-Pesa at more points of sale. In Mozambique we connected this merchant payment platform to one of the banks' point of sale devices in stores, making it easier for customers to
pay using M-Pesa. During the first half of the year, on average, R32 billion was processed monthly through the M-Pesa system.

EBITDA increased 20.7% (18.7%*) to R2.9 billion#, while the EBITDA margin expanded by 2.1ppts to 30.1%, supported by good revenue growth and a continued focus on cost
efficiencies through our 'Fit for growth' savings programme. Improved revenue growth, savings on commissions from airtime purchases through M-Pesa, continued savings in
network operating expenses, and savings from lower interconnect costs, are key drivers for margin growth.

Capital expenditure of R1.3 billion enabled us to continue investing in all our markets to support the growing demand for data and wider voice coverage, while enhancing our IT
systems to support our personalised pricing offers and to deliver on our segmentation strategy. We continue to seek opportunities through spectrum acquisition and the roll out of
new technologies to increase our ability to provide a differentiated data experience for our customers. In August, we became the first operator in Africa to launch a standards-based,
commercial 5G network in Lesotho. We were awarded a 4G licence in the DRC, in Mozambique we unified and renewed our licences for 20 years and participated in the spectrum auction held 
during November (the outcome of which will be communicated in due course), and in Tanzania we acquired additional 4G spectrum which will enable us to progress further in delivering 
on our strategic data ambitions.

Safaricom (IAS 18 commentary)

For the six months ended 30 September 2018, Safaricom has contributed a profit of R1.4 billion which represents the net amount of earnings from Safaricom of R1.7 billion and an
amortisation charge of R304 million in relation to fair valued assets and before minority interest and withholding tax.

Safaricom continues to report solid growth, with service revenue increasing 7.7% and EBIT increasing 18.7%, supported by strong growth in data and M-Pesa revenue. M-Pesa
revenue increased 18.2% and contributes 30.0% to service revenue, supported by M-Pesa customers increasing 8.8% to 21.0 million. Mobile data revenue increased 10.8% and now
contributes 15.4% to service revenue. Customers increased 1.5% to 29.9 million and ARPU grew 5.4%. Investment in capital expenditure of KES17 billion, resulted in 3G sites
increasing 21.1%, 4G sites increasing 61.8% and the number of homes passed with fibre more than doubling to 200 thousand.

These results are available on www.safaricom.co.ke/investor-relation/financials/reports/financial-results.

Broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) ownership transaction

We concluded our new BEE ownership transaction on 14 September 2018. At a deal value of R16.4 billion the transaction was the largest deal of its kind in the ICT sector. The key
features of the deal are:

- Transaction size of R16.4 billion;
- Equity swap ratio(1) of Vodacom South Africa to Vodacom Group of 73.0%;
- Subscription price discount from Vodacom Group;
- R3.9 billion equity reinvested by the Vodacom South Africa BEE shareholders;
- R3.3 billion paid out to YeboYethu shareholders as a special dividend (once-off cash settlement);
- Continued listing of YeboYethu on the BEE Segment of the JSE;
- R1.05 billion subscription for YeboYethu ordinary shares by the Group's new employee empowerment trust (Siyanda); and
- 60% gearing of YeboYethu (third party financing and vendor funding from Vodacom Group).
- A once-off IFRS 2 charge of R1 404 million(2), transaction costs of R105 million and a staff component of R1 176 million that will be spread over the vesting period. Vesting is in three
  equal tranches at the end of years 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

The structure of the deal created significant value for current holders, through a major liquidity event of a special dividend, as well as the opportunity to remain invested in
Vodacom Group, through a mutually beneficial structured deal. This secures Vodacom's Level 3 BEE status, and an effective black ownership of c20%, a key consideration for
spectrum allocation, government contracts and corporate business.

Regulatory matters

Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA Bill)

On 17 November 2017, the Ministry published an invitation to provide comments on the ECA bill, having its origins in the Integrated information and communication technology
ICT Policy White Paper of 2 October 2016. Stakeholders made representations to the Ministry at public hearings held on 6 and 7 March 2018. After considering comments
submitted and presentations at hearings, the ECA has since been approved by Cabinet and has been tabled in Parliament. The Ministry has also issued a draft policy direction, for
public comment, which purpose is to enable the licensing of high demand spectrum under the existing ECA legislative framework - prior to Parliament considering and passing into
law the proposed amendments to the ECA Bill. Both of these processes are undergoing a consultation process. The Ministry and the Regulator have both indicated their intention
for a spectrum auction under the existing regulation during the first half of next year and giving more certainty with regard to policy. These processes give progress to the Hybrid
model which will include both the creation of the wireless open-access network (WOAN) and exclusive use for spectrum to the industry. Stakeholders will submit written comments
during November 2018.

Amendment to End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 30 April 2018, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) published final amendments to the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations
with the objective of addressing consumer concerns on out-of-bundle charges and data bundle expiry rules.

These final amendments followed a consultation process between ICASA and industry stakeholders. The regulations require the following:
- Voice, SMS and data bundle depletion notices are to be sent to customers at 50%, 80% and 100% depletion thresholds;
- Operators are not allowed to default customers to out-of-bundle charges on depletion of data bundles, unless specific opt-in instructions have been received from the customer;
  and
- Operators should allow customers the option to roll over unused data before expiry and also provide customers with an option to transfer data to other customers on the same
  network.

The implementation date has been suspended pending the outcome of the review application launched by Cell C in the North Gauteng High Court, Pretoria.

1. This is the ratio in which the Vodacom South Africa shares held by Vodacom South Africa BEE shareholders were exchanged for shares in Vodacom Group Limited.
2. Refer to Note 8 of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2018 for the split between the cash and equity settled IFRS
   2 charge.

Competition Commission data market review
The Competition Commission (CompCom) initiated an enquiry into data costs on 18 August 2017. The main objectives of the market inquiry are to obtain a clear understanding of
the data services value chain, including the interaction and commercial relationships between different levels of the value chain and the relationship with other parts of the ICT
sector as well as the broader economy; and to assess the state of competition in the market at every stage of the value chain for the provision of data services, to identify areas of
market power that may influence competition or pricing. Vodacom made submissions to the CompCom and participated in the hearings held on 17 - 19 October 2018. 
The hearings covered the following key questions posed by the commission:
1. Are data prices in South Africa (whether mobile, fixed or other) higher than they ought to be?
2. To the extent that data prices in South Africa are higher than they ought to be, what are the factors that drive these outcomes?
3. How can these factors be effectively remedied?
4. What is the impact of data prices and access to data more broadly on lower-income customers, rural customers, small businesses and the unemployed? How important are
   affordable data prices for these customers?

Vodacom's submission was focussed on the importance of lowering the cost to provision data, which will also lead to the lowering of retail tariffs. The date for completion of the
data market review has been extended to 31 March 2019.

ICASA priority market review

In June 2017, ICASA gave notice of its intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECS). The purpose of the enquiry is to
identify relevant wholesale and retail markets or market segments in the ECS that are generally prone to ex ante regulation, and to determine from these markets and market
segments those that the Authority intends to prioritise for market reviews and potential regulation.

On 17 August 2018 ICASA communicated the following broad markets which will be the subject of this review:

- Wholesale fixed access, which includes wholesale supply of asymmetric broadband origination, fixed access services and relevant facilities;
- Upstream infrastructure markets incorporating national transmission services, metropolitan connectivity and relevant facilities; and
- Mobile services, which includes the retail market for mobile services and the wholesale supply of mobile network services, including relevant facilities.

The final phase of the inquiry would be the publication of a findings document, which is expected in the second half of FY2019.

Competition Commission investigation into complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile communication services

On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government departments for the
period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020. Vodacom was selected as the preferred supplier on a non-exclusive basis after the other bidders were eliminated at different phases
of the competitive bidding process. The Competition Commission has initiated an investigation against Vodacom Group for alleged abuse of dominance in terms of section 8 of the
Competition Act. The tender process was initiated and controlled by National Treasury, who awarded the tender to Vodacom in a fiercely contested and transparent bidding process.

Outlook
We are encouraged by the relative economic and currency stability in most of our International markets. We have seen strong customer growth and accelerating growth in key
initiatives, such as M-Pesa and data revenue. Prioritising financial inclusion through our mobile money platform, M-Pesa, while enabling a digital society through connectivity is
proving to be a success. We continue to invest and expand in the eco systems of these platforms and expect this will remain a strong driver for growth in the future. The trend of
accelerated top line growth and continued focus on cost efficiencies through our 'Fit for growth' and digitalisation programmes, will also help to improve profitability in these
markets.

In South Africa, we continue to deliver steady growth despite sluggish consumer spending, given a tough economic environment. Our strategy to drive greater value at various price
points combined with providing customers with the ability to select offers most suited to their needs continues to resonate with customers. This is evidenced by the increase in
customers in South Africa and shows that our investment in personalised offers through Big Data and machine learning continues to differentiate us amongst our peers. Our new
product offers such as video in consumer, and ongoing emphasis on our Enterprise business is also set to deliver further growth. Our FinTech services continue to make significant
inroads into new verticals with an expanding array of new product offers. Customer and revenue growth in these areas are particularly encouraging.

We are progressing on our digital telco strategy. The aim of this strategy is to increasingly utilise digital processes to both enhance the customer experience, and contribute to cost
efficiencies in the business. This will be made possible through key enablers such as Robotic Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data analytics. As part of this
journey, we have introduced chatbots, increased focus on our online direct channel and improved our Express recharge offering to drive uptake of this direct sales channel. In future,
scaling of these efforts will address commission cost and other operating costs to both offset inflation related increases and reducing overall costs. Expanding our platform
ecosystems to enable partnerships and digital content will enable future revenue growth opportunities. We are aiming to add to our platform strategy by adding to our video and
financial services platforms in the future.

In South Africa, we will continue to prioritise our participation in the numerous processes established by Government and the regulator to increase competition in the industry,
address the cost to communicate and drive inclusive growth. While we are encouraged by progress made in the regulatory environment in recent times, including a clearer
time-line on the allocation of 4G and 5G spectrum, a number of concerns and inconsistencies remain following the publication of a revised Electronic Communications Act and
policy direction to ICASA regarding unassigned high demand spectrum. Commitments by ICASA and the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services to license 4G
spectrum by March 2019 are crucial in accelerating reductions in the cost to deliver data services.

Greater certainty is required to sustain the high level of investment that the industry commands. We remain hopeful of finding an amicable solution to the finalisation of the new
ECA, the process to allocate unassigned high demand spectrum and the market review by the regulator.

The outcome of the court challenge, by competitors, to the implementation of ICASA's End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations, could potentially have a modest short
term impact on growth, once impacted. We are also mindful of the weaker economic environment in South Africa and the impact this could have on consumer spending.

It is with this in mind that we maintain our medium term targets(1) of mid-single digit service revenue growth, mid-to-high single digit EBIT growth (excluding IFRS 2 charges,
relating to the staff component of the BEE deal) and 12% - 14% of capital investment as % of revenue of the next three years.

1. These targets are on average, over the next three years and are on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases and any merger and acquisition
   activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory environments. Excluding effects from the IFRS 15 and IFRS 16
   implementation.

Understanding the impacts of IFRS 15:
The difference between IFRS 15 and IAS 18 are mainly noticeable in the contract segment where goods and services delivered under a contract are identified as separate
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised at the point in time the Group delivers the goods or renders the service to the customer.

One of the key changes is the recognition of equipment revenue when control of the device has either transferred to the customer or the intermediary. Previously, equipment
revenue on transfer of a device to a customer was limited to the cash received on inception of the contract. Going forward a device revenue contract asset will be recognised on
inception, which will be recovered over the term of the contract. In the first half of the year, R416 million (of which R400 million relates to South Africa) was reclassified from
service revenue to equipment revenue, with total revenue remaining largely unchanged with regards to this element.

1. The Group's effective interest of 34.94% in Safaricom Limited (Safaricom) is accounted for as an investment in associate. Results represent 100% of Safaricom and is for
   information purposes only. Prior year results represents two months of performance from the date of acquisition.

In addition, qualifying incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract, previously expensed on payment, is now capitalised as deferred customer acquisition cost and
amortised over the life time of the contract (typically 24 months). Amortisation charges of R1.8 billion (relating to South Africa) was netted against service revenue during the
current period, as they are considered to be customer discounts under IFRS 15.

Commentary based on IAS 18:

Group service revenue increased 6.1% (5.8%*) to R36.8 billion#, with strong growth in both South Africa and in the International operations.

In South Africa, service revenue increased 4.6% to R27.9 billion# benefitting from strong net customer additions and strong growth in Enterprise, both in mobile and fixed service
revenue.

During the period, we adjusted our revenue deferral methodology in line with the usage insights from our customers and updated our rules with regard to the rollover of unused
minutes and megabytes, resulting in acceleration of revenue recognition of R292 million in the period.

In our International operations, service revenue increased 12.8% (up 11.4%*) to R9.4 billion#. Growth came from strategic growth areas such as data and M-Pesa revenue as well as
an increase in customer net additions.

Service revenue grew by 7.7% in Safaricom during the six month period, driven by growth in data and M-Pesa.

Understanding the impacts of IFRS 15:

Incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract, previously expensed at inception of the contract under IAS 18, are now capitalised as deferred customer acquisition costs.
Cost amounting R1.8 billion for the first half of this year was recognised as a contract asset and will be amortised to the income statement over the contract period (typically 24
months). Certain types of these customer acquisition costs are considered to be customer discounts under IFRS 15, and netted against service revenue when amortised to the
income statement.

Commentary based on IAS 18:

Group total expenses increased 6.2% to R27.9 billion#, which includes a net trading foreign exchange loss of R45 million (2017: loss of R76 million).

In South Africa, expenses increased 5.3%, driven by costs relating to our roaming agreement with Rain, slightly offset by an accelerated phasing of cost to acquire and retain
customers in the prior year, as well as higher network operating costs, relating to higher input costs such as fuel price increases.
In our International operations, total expenses increased by 8.7% (7.5%*) below revenue growth of 12.4% (11.0%*). This was enabled by continued focus on cost containment
through initiatives such as 'Fit for growth' and the increase of airtime purchases through our M-Pesa platform, which results in a reduction of distribution costs.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
for the six months ended 30 September

1.     Basis of preparation

       These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the recognition and measurement criteria of
       International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and in accordance with and containing the information required by IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) as issued
       by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants' (SAICA)
       Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements and the
       requirements of the Companies Act of 2008, as amended. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured
       at fair value or at amortised cost, and are presented in South African rand, which is the parent Company's functional and presentation currency.
  
       The significant accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the previous year, except as disclosed in Note
       2. The significant accounting policies are available for inspection at the Group's registered office.

       The preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements was supervised by the Chief Financial Officer, Dr. phil. T Streichert.
  
       These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. who expressed an unmodified review conclusion. A copy of the
       auditor's review report is available for inspection at the Group's registered office, together with the financial statements identified in the auditor's report. 

2.     Changes in accounting policies

       The Group adopted the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the IASB, which were effective and applicable to the Group from 1 April 2018.
       The accounting pronouncements considered by the Group as significant on adoption are IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and IFRS 9 ""Financial
       Instruments"" as set out below.

       Other IFRS changes adopted on 1 April 2018 have no material impact on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group. Full details on changes in
       accounting policies will be disclosed in the Group's consolidated annual financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2019, which will be available online.
       
       IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)

       IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity
       on the date of adoption. The Group's IAS 18 accounting policy, and the key differences between the Group's IAS 18 and IFRS 15 accounting policies, are disclosed in the
       Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.

       IFRS 15 Accounting policy

       When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations
       (obligations) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from
       other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services don't meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations they are aggregated with
       other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts,
       but might typically be separately identified for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed
       line communication services.

       The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled to in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed
       contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer contracts on behalf of the Group and receive
       commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when
       determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs. The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations
       according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to
       the prices that the Group would achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone
       selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs.

       Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and payment remains probable.

       - Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service during the agreed
         service period.
       - Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as
         indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to receive
         a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.

         When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from the customer a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will
         typically be recognised for devices or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or
         receivable from the customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is
         recognised.

       When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided
       to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a
       significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest is recognised in revenue over the customer's payment period
       using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.

       Contract related costs

       When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to
       deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as
       expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.

       The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the
       Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an
       expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group. Typically this is over the contract period as new commissions are
       payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised.

       Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation relating to IFRS 15

       Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is significantly more complex than under previous reporting requirements and necessitates the collation and processing of very large
       amounts of data and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant critical accounting judgements
       and key sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed below. Other accounting judgements and estimations made by management are not considered to be individually
       critical or material, but cumulatively have a material impact on reported costs and revenues particularly as the Group offers a large variety of bundled goods and services.

       Where the Group doesn't sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis it is necessary to estimate the standalone price. When estimating
       the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods
       and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach
       (which is sometimes the case for handsets and other equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to lack of observable standalone sales
       or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone
       prices of other obligations in the contract. The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts
       the timing of revenue when obligations are provided to customers at different times - for example, the allocation of revenue between handsets, which are usually delivered
       up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying
       value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised.

       When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to customer. As a principal, receipts from and
       payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer then the
       Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised
       revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by
       management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported
       revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.

       Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers third-party branded services
       (such as premium music or TV content) to customers.

2.1    Mobile device revenue acceleration and deferred customer acquisition costs amortised to revenue

       The main impact of IFRS 15 on the Group's revenue results from service agreements entered into with customers which contain both devices and services as deliverables.
       Under IAS 18, revenue allocated to devices on inception of a customer contract was limited to the amount received. IFRS 15 requires revenue to be recognised for devices
       on inception of the contract, irrespective of the amount received, with a corresponding contract asset representing the unbilled portion, or a contract liability in cases where
       revenue recognised under IFRS 15 is less than the actual invoiced amount for any obligations as a result of an advanced payment received. The remainder of the
       subscription fee is recognised over the contract term as services are delivered.

       Contract assets are also raised for the impact of capitalising customer incentive bonuses (CIB). Under IAS 18, incremental costs such as CIB were expensed in the income
       statement as incurred. Under IFRS 15, CIB costs incurred in acquiring a contract customer are deferred and recognised as an asset at inception and amortised against
       revenue over the term of the contract.

2.2    Deferred customer acquisition costs amortised to direct costs

       Under IAS 18, incremental costs were expensed in the income statement as incurred. Under IFRS 15, incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract customer are
       deferred and recognised as an asset at inception. Certain of these costs are subsequently amortised against direct costs over the term of the contract.

2.3    Impairment of contract assets

       IFRS 9 requires expected credit losses to be recorded in respect of amounts due from customers. On initial recognition, the upfront recognition of contract assets under
       IFRS 15 resulted in an increase in credit loss charges recorded in future periods.""

2.4    Deferred tax

       A deferred tax liability has been recognised for device revenue contract assets and deferred customer acquisition costs recognised under IFRS 15 where applicable, at the
       enacted statutory tax rate in each jurisdiction in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS12.

2.5    Reduction in revenue deferrals

       The reduced subscription fee recognised over the contract term under IFRS 15 (see 2.1 above) leads to a reduction in revenue deferrals.

       IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)

       IFRS 9 impacts the classification and measurement of the Group's financial instruments, revises the requirements for when hedge accounting can be applied and requires
       certain additional disclosures. Whilst hedge accounting requirements are revised under IFRS 9, no material changes to the Group were identified. The Group has adopted
       IFRS 9 with the cumulative retrospective impact on the classification and measurement of financial instruments reflected as an adjustment to equity on the date of
       adoption. The key impacts were as follows:

       - The carrying values of trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables are reduced by the lifetime estimated future credit losses at the date of initial
         recognition, where previously credit losses were not recognised on such assets until there was an indicator of impairment, such as a payment default;
       - Customer receivables that are received in instalments, which are currently recorded at amortised cost, will be recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income
         for receivable portfolios that the Group sells from time to time to third parties.
 
       The impact on the consolidated statement of financial position at 1 April 2018 is set out below.

       The following table and the accompanying notes below explain the original measurement categories under IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement

       2. The Group provides financing to customers to acquire devices at an additional contractual charge which is included in finance receivables. The
          business model under IFRS 9 for finance receivables has been determined to be ""hold to collect and sell"". As a result, the Group has
          reclassified finance receivables relating to device financing from loans and receivables to fair value through other comprehensive income.
          The full change in the carrying amount arises from a change in measurement attribute on transition to IFRS 9.

       For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment losses are generally expected to increase. The Group has determined that
       the application of IFRS 9's impairment requirements, and the adoption of IFRS 15 at 1 April 2018 results in an additional impairment allowance as

8.     Broad-based black economic empowerment (BEE) transaction
       The existing Vodacom (Pty) Limited (Vodacom SA) BEE transaction (the previous BEE transaction) was replaced with a new BEE transaction designed to provide liquidity to
       participants through YeboYethu (RF) Limited (YeboYethu) declaring a special dividend, and the opportunity for Vodacom SA BEE shareholders, and the Vodacom Employee
       Share Ownership Trust (ESOP) to participate in an attractive growth opportunity by holding their listed YeboYethu shares. The notional vendor funding of the existing
       Vodacom SA BEE transaction was settled, after which YeboYethu exchanged their remaining shares in Vodacom SA for shares in Vodacom Group Limited (Vodacom Group),
       which are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated level, and are encumbered (Note 9).

       The key features of the BEE transaction include, inter alia:

       - transaction size of R16.4 billion;
       - equity swap ratio of Vodacom SA to Vodacom Group of 73.0%;
       - subscription price discount from Vodacom Group;
       - R3.9 billion equity reinvested by the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders;
       - R3.3 billion paid out to YeboYethu shareholders as a special dividend;
       - continued listing of YeboYethu on the BEE Segment of the JSE;
       - R1.05 billion subscription for YeboYethu ordinary shares by the Group's new employee empowerment trust (Siyanda); and
       - 60% gearing of YeboYethu (third party financing and vendor funding from Vodacom Group).

       Where equity instruments are issued to a BEE partner at less than fair value, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment transaction in terms of IFRS 2:
       Share-based payment (IFRS 2).

       The new BEE transaction was approved by Vodacom Group shareholders on 16 August 2018, and by YeboYethu shareholders on 17 August 2018. This approval date marks
       the grant date of the share-based payment transaction, the value of which has been determined as R2 580 million, being a non-cash, non-recurring BEE expense of 
       R1 404 million and a staff component of R1 176 million that will be spread over the vesting period. Vesting is in three equal tranches at the end of years 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

       The above-mentioned share-based payment charges have been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation based option pricing model. The economic substance of the BEE
       transaction mimics that of a call option, with the value of the outstanding debt at the maturity date of the transaction as the strike price of the option. The assumptions
       used in this model include:

       - 114 451 180 new Vodacom Group shares;
       - Vodacom Group share price of R125.60, being the Vodacom Group share price at the grant date of 17 August 2018;
       - Volatility of 22.72% in the Vodacom Group share price, calculated using historical share price information since Vodacom Group's listing on the JSE;
       - Expected costs to escalate at 6% per annum;
       - Expected dividend yields of between 6.68% to 7.75%;
       - The risk free rate used was based on an independently constructed zero coupon South African Rand interest rate swap curve ranging from 6.35% to 8.58%; and
       - Fair value of equity contribution from non-staff shareholders of R3 074 million.

       The Group facilitated the establishment of the Innovator Trust in 2014 with a loan facility of R750 million, an independent entity whose primary purpose is to develop and
       support black owned small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs) in the information and communication technology sector. The Innovator Trust used a portion of the
       facility to purchase shares in YeboYethu, and uses the income from interest and dividends to develop black owned SMME's in the information and communication
       technology sector and advancement of black owned suppliers in the Group's supply chain.

       The Group currently has no intention to settle the BEE transaction in cash. The Innovator Trust and a portion of the Vodacom ESOP will however be accounted for as
       cash-settled due to the accounting substance thereof. Of the total IFRS 2 charge of R2 580 million, R755 million relates to these cash-settled share-based payment
       arrangements. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability relating to the non-recurring charge for Siyanda (R471 million, not yet included in the income statement as it
       will accrue over the vesting period) and the Innovator Trust (R284 million, included in the total charge in the income statement and in non-current trade and other
       payables) will be re-measured to fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation based option pricing model. Of the R1 404 million charge, R1 119 million was therefore
       credited to the reserve, and R284 million to an IFRS 2 liability. The value of the liability will be re-measured at each reporting period based on changes to the various
       valuation inputs.

       YeboYethu, holds in Vodacom Group, with a target share cover ratio of above three times the debt.

       During the current year, the Group refinanced three of its loan facilities received from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. as listed below:

10.2   Tax matters

       authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules to the Group's business. These disputes may not necessarily be resolved in a manner that is favourable
       to the Group. In addition, the resolution of the disputes could result in obligations to the Group. The Group has made sufficient provision for any losses arising from potential
       tax exposures that are more likely to occur than not.

       assessment, the Group's management has determined, that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal proceedings as at 30 September 2018.

       technology sector as well as the broader economy; and to assess the state of competition in the market at every stage of the value chain for the provision of data services,

       Commission has initiated an investigation against the Group for alleged abuse of dominance, under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act, which is ongoing.

11.1.3 Facilities leasing and roaming agreements between Vodacom (Pty) Limited (the Company) and Rain Networks (Pty) Limited (Rain) (previously Wireless Business Solutions

       arrangements were not in breach of the relevant laws.

11.2   Customer registration

       The Group has made considerable strides in complying with customer registration requirements in all its markets in line with applicable laws. The Group will maintain full

       On 30 September 2016 the Pretoria High Court granted an application by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services (the Ministry) interdicting ICASA from
       implementing the spectrum licensing process contemplated in the Invitation to Apply (ITA) for the licensing of spectrum in the 700MHz, 800MHz and 2 600MHz bands,

       comments submitted and presentations at hearings, the ECA has since been approved by Cabinet and has been tabled in Parliament.

11.5   ICASA priority market review

       In June 2017, ICASA published a notice of intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act. The purpose of the study is to
       identify markets to be prioritised for a potential market review. The final phase of the inquiry would be the publication of a findings document, which is expected in the
       second half of 2019.

11.6   Amendment to End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

       On 30 April 2018, ICASA published final amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations, with the objective to address consumer concerns with
       regard to out-of-bundle charges and expiry rules. The implementation date of the regulations was suspended pending the outcome of the review application initiated in the
       high court against ICASA by Cell C (Pty) Limited.

11.7   Mobile termination rates (MTR)

       Regulators in Tanzania and Mozambique reduced termination rates. Industry submissions and a new cost study in Mozambique leading to a positive outcome where the
       regulator revised MTRs upward with retrospective effect, and set a revised glide path to 2020. In Tanzania, the Group has filed an appeal against the regulator's new five year
       glide path with the Fair Competition Commission on the grounds that new MTRs were modelled using data that was not representative of actual costs incurred by operators
       and the glide path sets MTRs below cost. In South Africa, ICASA has made a determination on MTRs, setting the glide path to reach a rate of R0.09 (and a-symmetrical rate
       of R0.13) by October 2020.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things connections (IoT), is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
   customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.

1. During the 2nd quarter of the prior year, we reclassified the foreign exchange difference between USD and CDF sales to be netted off on the corresponding revenue line.
   The adjustment was USD11.4 million for Q1 2018 and USD4.4 million for Q2 2018. Q1 2018 has not been restated for this change. This was partially offset by a refund of 
   DRC sales tax (ICA) of USD9.9 million, in Q2 2018.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things connections (IoT), is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
   customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
5. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during the period.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service
   revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers""

IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2018 with the cumulative retrospective impact reflected as an adjustment to equity on the
date of adoption. The Group's IAS 18 accounting policy, and the key differences between the Group's IAS 18 and IFRS 15 accounting policies, are disclosed in the Group's annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018.

IFRS 15 Accounting policy

When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate performance obligations (obligations) to
the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in
the agreement. Where individual goods and services don't meet the criteria to be identified as separate obligations, they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the
agreement until a separate obligation is identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified
for mobile handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communication services.

The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled to in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based on the committed
contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer contracts on behalf of the Group and receive commission,
any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the
transaction price and consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs. The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative
standalone selling prices of the obligations. The standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would
achieve by selling the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not directly
observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs.

Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer and payment remains probable.

- Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime and fixed line broadband, is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service during the agreed
  service period.
- Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to intermediaries such as indirect
  channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund;
  otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.

When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be
recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by the Group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a
customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised.

When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other equipment is provided to a
customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is deemed to have received financing. If a significant
financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest is recognised in revenue over the customer's payment period using an interest rate
reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk.

Contract related costs

When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the ability of the Group to deliver an 
obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised on the statement of financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with the 
recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered.

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring customers on behalf of the Group, are 
recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the statement of financial position when the related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line with 
the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be earned by the Group. Typically this is over the contract period as new commissions are payable on contract renewal. 
Certain amounts payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation relating to IFRS 15

Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is significantly more complex than under previous reporting requirements and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data 
and the increased use of management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
are disclosed below. Other accounting judgements and estimations made by management are not considered to be individually critical or material, but cumulatively have a material impact on 
reported costs and revenues particularly as the Group offers a large variety of bundled goods and services.

Where the Group doesn’t sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis it is necessary to estimate the standalone price. When estimating the standalone 
price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include determining the standalone price of similar goods and services sold by the Group,
observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes the case for handsets and other 
equipment). Where it is not possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for services, 
the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the contract. The standalone price determined for 
obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue when obligations are provided to customers at different times - for example, 
the allocation of revenue between handsets, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to 
be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised.

When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to customer. As a principal, receipts from, and payments to 
suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of goods or services prior to transfer to a customer then the Group is acting as an 
agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the margin earned 
by the Group. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement 
between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows. 
Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those where the Group delivers third-party branded services (such as premium
music or TV content) to customers.

Additional financial and operational measures

This announcement contains certain financial (i.e. service revenue, enterprise service revenue, EBITDA and EBIT) and operational (i.e. customers, ARPUs and number of employees)
measures which are presented in addition to the financial information disclosed in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018
which have been prepared in terms of IFRS. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance of the
Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined
by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally,
although these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed in isolation or as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as
complementary to, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2018. The financial measures have been extracted from the
management accounts upon which the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2018 are based. Refer above for
details relating to service revenue, EBIT and headline earnings per share and the supplementary information above for a reconciliation thereof to the reported results
included in this announcement.

resolution of open tax issues.

All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, to any member of the Group or to any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with

Following the prospective adoption of IFRS 15. Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 April 2018, the Group's results for the quarter ended 30 June 2018 are on an IFRS 15
basis, whereas the results for the quarter ended 30 June 2017 are (as previously reported) on an IAS 18 basis. Comparisons between the two bases of reporting are not meaningful
and to ensure appropriate disclosure during the period of transition onto IFRS 15, revenue for the quarter ended 30 June 2018 has been disclosed on both an IFRS 15 and IAS 18
basis and our commentary describing our operating performance in the Operating Review has been provided solely on an IAS 18 basis. The accounting standard applied is clearly
marked in the heading of relevant columns in the news release.

Results for Vodacom's associate investment in Safaricom are disclosed on a bi-annual basis and therefore are not included in this quarterly update.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
The strong momentum from our annual results has carried Vodacom into a pleasing first quarter. Group revenue and service revenue increased 5.0%* and 5.2%* respectively. We
were delighted to add 2.5 million customers over the quarter, reaching 76.5 million across the Group (excluding Safaricom).

In South Africa, despite a tougher economic environment, we grew service revenue by 4.9%^, supported by customer growth of 9.5% to reach 43.1 million customers. This was
driven by our 'Big Data' led innovations, which contributed to robust demand for personalised bundles, offering customers better value for money. We sold over 600 million bundles
this quarter resulting in an effective price reduction of 10% on voice minutes and 17% for data megabytes. This is evidence of our commitment to lowering the cost to
communicate. We have also launched some exciting consumer propositions, including our new Vodacom Ticket, which allows customers to save up to 50% on data for social
media, video, music and gaming. Data revenue grew close to 10%, a pleasing performance off a bigger base, contributing more than 44% to service revenue.

In our International operations, service revenue increased 12.4%** to R4.3 billion, driven largely by M-Pesa and data adoption. M-Pesa continues to grow strongly and we now have
12.7 million customers(1) (excluding Safaricom) using this service.

We remain focused on network investment as a key competitive differentiator, expanding our 4G coverage to 81.5% up from 75.9% a year ago.

Looking ahead, we expect the implementation of the ICASA End-user Subscriber Charter Regulations, in relation to out-of-bundle usage, to have a modest impact on data revenue
growth. We expect this to be mitigated in the short term by continued uptake of data bundles and strong elasticity in demand for these services. We are encouraged by the
improved performance in our International business. We will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition across all operations as a leading digital company.

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue increased 4.9%^ to R13.8 billion, supported by the improvement in customer revenue growth trends, despite a subdued macroeconomic and consumer spending
environment.

Customers increased 9.5% reaching 43.1 million, after adding 1.4 million prepaid customers and 75 000 net contract additions.

Prepaid customer revenue growth was good at 5.5%. This was supported by continued strong customer growth of 10.0%, which was slightly offset by lower ARPUs as we attract new
customers with lower spend levels, on average, than the current base.

Contract customer revenue growth has recovered from declines in previous quarters, to grow at 0.8%. The growth was supported by improved performance in the Enterprise
segment, reflecting customer and ARPU gains from recent contract sign ups and improved usage. Overall contract customers increased by 5.9%. Contract ARPU declined 2.3%, an
improvement in trend from the last two quarters, as customers continue to grow into their ""more data"" contracts and benefits from higher value ARPU customers in Enterprise.

Voice revenue decline remained low at 2.6%, reflecting the success of our personalised voice bundle strategy through our ‘Just 4 You' platform while reducing the effective price
per minute by 10.0%.

Data revenue grew 9.4% to R6.1 billion, contributing 44.1% (2018: 42.2%) of service revenue. We continue to drive bundle engagement aggressively to ensure a worry free
experience for our customers. The success of this pricing strategy, making data more affordable for our customers, has resulted in a 32.2% increase in data bundle sales and an
overall effective price per MB reduction of 17.1%. We continue to grow our current 4G data users, adding 739 000 4G customers in the quarter reaching 8.1 million customers.
Vodacom Ticket was launched during June, which provides customers with data bundles that have more inclusive value. This allows us to drive greater uptake on URL-specific
services with worry free usage.

Fixed-line revenue growth was 22.0% as we continue to grow connectivity revenue for business and homes. Internet of Things (IoT) connections increased 25.2% to 3.9 million.
We spent R2 billion on capital expenditure, focusing on new sites, upgrades and capacity to improve network quality and performance. These efforts have resulted in Vodacom
leading in data speed benchmarks . This also allowed us to expand our 4G coverage to 81.5%, up from 75.9% a year ago. We also expanded our rural coverage and made progress to
improve backhaul performance and capacity by increasing the proportion of self-provided high capacity sites from 90.1% a year ago to 92.4%.

International

Service revenue increased 12.4%**, reflecting continued strong execution in all markets. Reported growth was up 4.1%^.

Tanzania service revenue growth was in line with the previous quarter, despite continued pricing pressure. DRC, Mozambique and Lesotho have made solid progress on their M-Pesa
businesses, and data continues to perform well.

We added 987 000 customers in the quarter, reaching 33.4 million, up 11.4%. This was supported by good customer growth in the DRC and Mozambique.

Data revenue increased, excluding currency translation effects, by 14.7%*, reported up 11.3%, supported by a 17.3% increase in data customers to 17.5 million. The demand for
data remains strong with data traffic up 53.3%. We launched 4G in the DRC during the period, following the award of a 4G licence. We now offer 4G services in all our markets except
Mozambique.

Our mobile money service continues to grow across all operations. M-Pesa revenue was up 23.8%*, excluding currency translation effects, to R634 million, reported up 18.1%.
Customers increased by 26.0% to 12.7 million. Tanzania celebrated 10 years of M-Pesa with 6.8 million customers, up 14.7%. We continue to improve the eco-system, stimulating
activity on the platform. In Tanzania, the 'Lipa kwa' our merchant payment solution has over 7 900 merchants now actively trading on the platform; the service has also recently
been added in Mozambique. M-Pesa revenue now contributes 14.8% to International service revenue.

Capital expenditure increased 8.2% to R552 million, which enabled us to continue to invest in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation and to support data
growth and wider voice coverage.

We were awarded a 4G licence in the DRC during the period and there are currently 80 sites live in three major cities. During June, Tanzania held a 4G spectrum auction, where we
secured 2x10MHz of 700MHz. This spectrum is key in enabling us to extend and improve coverage and capacity, and thereby improve the customer experience. The combined cost
of the 4G licence in the DRC and 4G spectrum in Tanzania was USD32 million.

Results for Vodacom's associate investment in Safaricom are disclosed on a bi-annual basis and therefore are not included in this quarterly update.

Regulatory matters

Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA Bill) - South Africa

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services (Ministry) published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. On 17 November 2017, the Department of
Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) gazetted amendments to the Electronic Communications Act as a Bill. As part of a public participation process, we reiterated our
support for a hybrid model, establishing a competitive wholesale open access network (WOAN) alongside the assignment of spectrum to the current players. On the basis of an
independent economic impact assessment, we also noted the negative impacts the draft legislation could have on investment in the sector, GDP growth and job creation. The
Ministry will consider all submissions before submitting a revised Bill to cabinet for approval to be tabled in Parliament for further consultation and debate.

Amendment to End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations - South Africa

On 30 April 2018, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) published final amendments to the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations
with the main objective to address consumer concerns on out-of-bundle charges and expiry rules.

These final amendments followed a consultation process between ICASA and industry stakeholders. The regulations require the following:
- Voice, SMS and data bundle depletion notices are to be sent to customers at 50%, 80% and 100% depletion thresholds;
- Operators are not allowed to default customers to out-of-bundle charges on depletion of data bundles, unless specific opt-in instructions have been received from the customer;
  and
- Operators should allow customers the option to roll over unused data before expiry and also provide customers with an option to transfer data to other customers
  on the same network.

The effective date has been suspended pending the final determination of an urgent application launched by other operators in the High Court.

ICASA priority market review - South Africa

In June 2017, ICASA gave notice of its intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECS). The purpose of the enquiry is to
identify relevant wholesale and retail markets or market segments in the ECS that are generally prone to ex ante regulations, and to determine from these markets and market
segments those that the Authority intends to prioritise for market reviews and potential regulation. These studies are in line with similar processes in other markets around the
world. The final phase of the inquiry would be the publication of a findings document, which is expected in the second half of FY19.


Competition Commission investigation into complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile communication services - South Africa

On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government departments for the
period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020. Vodacom was selected as the preferred supplier on a non-exclusive basis after the other bidders were eliminated at different phases
of the competitive bidding process. The Competition Commission has initiated an investigation against Vodacom Group for alleged abuse of dominance in terms of section 8 of the
Competition Act. The tender process was initiated and controlled by National Treasury through strict governance procedures, and we are confident that we followed due process in
a fiercely contested and transparent bidding process.

Positive conclusion of ICASA and competition commission investigation of Rain agreements - South Africa

In 2016, Vodacom and Rain (formerly WBS) announced agreements for facilities leasing, services and Vodacom roaming on Rain's network. Rain signed separate facilities leasing
and services agreements with Vodacom, in order to lease passive network infrastructure from Vodacom, which they require to roll out a 4G network. Vodacom signed a roaming
agreement with Rain, whereby Vodacom customers will be able to roam on Rain's 4G network.

The main benefit of the agreements for Vodacom is to improve the experience for its customers by offloading data traffic onto Rain's network. This is an important mechanism to
manage future demand for data services, which would have otherwise been challenging in a potentially spectrum constrained environment.

The agreements have been subject to review by both the Competition Commission and ICASA, both these authorities have now confirmed and communicated that their respective
investigations have not indicated anything of concern, and that they have therefore approved the agreements between Vodacom and Rain.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct
   relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers during the period.
5. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include
   service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming. The Lesotho customer numbers have been restated to align
   with Group policy.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have
   access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a
   contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. M-Pesa customers are based on the number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa during the last month.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers during the period.
   The Lesotho MOU's have been restated in line with the restated customer numbers. (Refer to note 1)
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customer during the period. The Lesotho ARPU's have been restated in
   line with restated customer numbers. (Refer to note 1)

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct
   relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers during the period.
5. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding
   national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
6. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue during the period by the average monthly active customers. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include
   service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them
   to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming. The Lesotho customer numbers have been restated to align
   with Group policy.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access
   to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual
   monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers during the period.
   The Lesotho MOU's have been restated in line the with restated customer numbers. (Refer to note 1)
4. M-Pesa customers are based on the number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa during the last month.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customer during the period. The Lesotho ARPU's have been restated in

Notes:
1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth between 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2018 on an IAS 18 basis. The Group's
   presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling,
   Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being rand. 
   The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the quarter 30 June 2018 average rate (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the
   functional currency for the quarter) to 30 June 2017 quarter numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange rate variances. The prevailing
   exchange rates for the current and comparative quarters are disclosed above.
3. During the 2nd quarter of the previous year, we reclassified the foreign exchange difference between USD and CDF sales to be netted off on the corresponding revenue line. 
   The adjustment was USD11.4 million for Q1 2017. Q1 2017 was not restated for this change.

In particular, such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: expectations regarding the Group's financial condition or results of

""expects"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""plans"" or ""targets"" (including in their negative form). By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual
results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

disruption of supply chains; developments in the Group's financial condition, earnings and distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into account when determining
levels of dividends; the Group's ability to satisfy working capital and other requirements; changes in statutory tax rates or profit mix; and/or changes in tax legislation or final
resolution of open tax issues.

All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, to any member of the Group or to any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with

UPDATE ON VODACOM GROUP’S PROPOSED NEW BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT OWNERSHIP TRANSACTION and NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING


1. Introduction

Shareholders are referred to the announcements released on SENS on Monday 11 June 2018 and Wednesday 4 July 2018 and published in the South African press on Tuesday
12 June 2018 and Thursday 5 July 2018 respectively setting out details of the BEE transaction between Vodacom Group and YeboYethu (RF) Limited (""YeboYethu"") (the ""BEE
transaction""), which announcements of can be accessed on the Vodacom Group website at www.vodacom.com (the ""previous announcements"").

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, terms defined in the previous announcements will have the same meanings herein.


2. Notice of general meeting

A general meeting of shareholders (""general meeting"") will be held at Vodacom World, 082 Vodacom Boulevard, Midrand at 09:00 on Thursday 16 August 2018, for purposes of
considering and, if deemed fit, passing, with or without modification, the resolutions necessary to implement the BEE transaction.


3. South African Post Office strike and the circular to shareholders

Vodacom Group had intended to post the circular containing full details of the BEE transaction and a notice of general meeting to shareholders on or about Monday 16 July 2018.
However the on-going strike by a substantial number of employees of the South African Post Office, has resulted it becoming uncertain as to whether, if the circular was only
posted through the postal service, the circulars would reach the shareholders, within the anticipated timelines or at all.

Accordingly, on Tuesday 17 July 2018 Vodacom Group obtained an order from the Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg, authorising Vodacom Group to deliver the circular, in respect
of those shareholders to whom it would have otherwise posted the circular through the South African Post Office, by giving notice of the availability of such circular (for physical
collection and electronic download) by SMS and/or publication in the press.

UPDATE ON VODACOM GROUP'S PROPOSED NEW BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT OWNERSHIP TRANSACTION AND FINAL BEE TRANSACTION SHARE PRICE

1. Introduction

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on Monday 11 June 2018 and published in the South African press on Tuesday 12 June 2018 detailing the 
BEE transaction between Vodacom Group and YeboYethu (RF) Limited (""YeboYethu"") (the ""BEE transaction"") a copy of which can be found on the Vodacom Group website at 
www.vodacom.com (the ""terms announcement"").

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, terms defined in the above terms announcement will have the same meanings herein.

The BEE transaction was priced on, Tuesday 3 July 2018, being the last practicable date prior to formal approval by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") of the Vodacom Group and YeboYethu
circulars (""pricing date""). The final BEE transaction share price of R143.35 is the 60-day volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") of a Vodacom Group share on the JSE, up to and
including Monday, 2 July 2018, which has been used for calculating the BEE transaction size.

All the value parameters are now final except the final split of the YeboYethu gearing amount between third party financing (class A preference shares) and vendor funding from
Vodacom Group (class B preference shares), which will be determined on the fourth implementation day based on the 5-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share at that time and the
IFRS 2 cost (which will be determined on the shareholder meeting date).

The final BEE transaction parameters are as follows:

60-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share on pricing date                                                                                    R143.35

* This amount is rounded up. The exact amount, given the YeboYethu price per share, is R749 999 984.55.

2. BEE transaction steps

The BEE transaction will be implemented through a series of interlinked and inter-conditional steps as outlined below. The values based on the final BEE transaction share price of
R143.35 are as follows:

2.1 Step 1: first implementation day: unwind of the existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction

Step 1 A: Implementation of the NVF structure

Vodacom SA will repurchase 114 744 844 (31 813 785 from RBH, 13 634 479 from Thebe, and 69 296 580 from YeboYethu (30 298 842 of the ""public A shares"", and 38 997 738
of the ""ESOP A shares"" (as such terms are defined in Vodacom SA's memorandum of incorporation)) Vodacom SA A shares from the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders for a nominal
consideration (R0.00001 per Vodacom SA A share, and R1 147.45 in aggregate) pursuant to the Vodacom SA NVF transaction terms (""Vodacom SA repurchase""), upon which the
remaining Vodacom SA A shares will rank pari passu with the Vodacom SA ordinary shares in all respects and will be unencumbered consistent with the terms of issue thereof. It is
anticipated that post the Vodacom SA repurchase, the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders will collectively hold 185 255 156 Vodacom SA shares, or approximately 3.95% of Vodacom
SA.

Step 1 B: Conversion and partial repurchase of YeboYethu N shares

Following implementation of the Vodacom SA repurchase, the 12 000 000 YeboYethu N shares in issue will automatically convert according to their terms of issue and at the same
time 3 318 908 of those shares shall be repurchased by YeboYethu for a nominal amount (R0.00001 per share, and R33.19 in aggregate) based on the existing YeboYethu NVF
transaction terms.

Of the 8 681 092 YeboYethu ordinary shares held by the YeboYethu ESOP, which remain after the conversion and repurchase described above, up to a maximum of 3 298 516 will,
as set out in step 4 (paragraph 2.4), be sold to the Vodacom ESOP, and the remaining 5 382 576 YeboYethu ordinary shares will be transferred, together with the proceeds received
by the YeboYethu ESOP from its sale to the Vodacom ESOP, to the existing vested beneficiaries of the YeboYethu ESOP in accordance with the terms of the YeboYethu ESOP trust
deed and scheme rules, whereafter the YeboYethu ESOP will be wound-up.

2.2 Step 2: first implementation day: consolidation of Vodacom SA BEE shareholders' interests in Vodacom SA in a single vehicle

Each of RBH and Thebe will exchange their Vodacom SA shares for new YeboYethu ordinary shares in terms of asset-for-share transactions, thereby consolidating all of the
Vodacom SA BEE shareholders' interests into a single vehicle, being YeboYethu.

RBH will sell its 55 126 215 Vodacom SA A shares and 7.56 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares (valued at R2 410 284 967) to YeboYethu, and in return YeboYethu will issue 
15 115 295 new YeboYethu ordinary shares to RBH in consideration.

Thebe will sell its 23 625 521 Vodacom SA A shares and 3.24 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares (valued at R1 032 979 282) to YeboYethu, and in return YeboYethu will issue 
6 477 984 new YeboYethu ordinary shares to Thebe in consideration.

The sales by each of RBH and Thebe, and the issue of new ordinary shares in YeboYethu, will be done simultaneously and at fair market value.

2.3 Step 3: second implementation day: YeboYethu declares a special dividend (distribution)

YeboYethu will declare a special dividend of up to a maximum of R3 261 189 876 or, in all cases, R73.00 per YeboYethu ordinary share, on the second implementation day, subject
to YeboYethu meeting a solvency and liquidity test as contemplated by section 45 of the Companies Act, 2008, as amended. The special dividend represents a significant liquidity
event and equates to 2.9 times the YeboYethu shareholders' original equity contribution. Vodacom Group currently has no intention to settle the BEE transaction in cash.

Despite declaration, the payment of the special dividend will only occur in (and payment will be contingent upon) step 6 (in paragraph 2.6) (and each of the preceding steps) being
implemented.

2.4 Step 4: second implementation day: Vodacom Group employer companies make a contribution to the Vodacom ESOP to enable it to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares

Vodacom Group, on behalf of itself and the employer companies, will make a capital contribution of an aggregate amount of R1.05 billion to the Vodacom ESOP. The Vodacom
ESOP will, on the second implementation day or as soon thereafter as it may be implemented, use the proceeds to purchase up to a maximum of 3 298 516 YeboYethu ordinary
shares valued at R300 million from the YeboYethu ESOP (and the YeboYethu ESOP beneficiaries insofar as the rights therein have vested), and will use the balance of R750 million
to subscribe for 8 246 289 new YeboYethu ordinary shares for the benefit of vested beneficiaries.

Should any balance of the contribution remain after the sale and subscription above, the Vodacom ESOP will use those funds to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares in the market
after the implementation of the BEE transaction.

2.5 Step 5: YeboYethu exchanges Vodacom SA shares for new Vodacom Group shares

A new special purpose vehicle, YeboYethu Investment Company (RF) (Proprietary) Limited (""YeboYethu Investment""), has been created for the purpose of holding YeboYethu's
Vodacom Group shares. YeboYethu Investment is a wholly-owned subsidiary of YeboYethu.
second implementation day

After the implementation of the aforementioned steps and the consolidation of YeboYethu's shareholding in Vodacom SA, YeboYethu will on the next day exchange its Vodacom SA
shares for ordinary shares in the share capital of YeboYethu Investment (""YeboYethu Investment shares""). YeboYethu will sell its 167 255 156 Vodacom SA A shares, valued at 
R6 430 960 748, and 18 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares, valued at R692 100 000, to YeboYethu Investment, and in return YeboYethu Investment will issue 7 123 061 new
YeboYethu Investment ordinary shares to YeboYethu in consideration.

third implementation day

After implementation of YeboYethu's exchange of Vodacom SA shares for YeboYethu Investment shares, and on the subsequent day, YeboYethu Investment will exchange its
Vodacom SA shares for new Vodacom Group shares on a fair market value basis of R7 123 060 748. YeboYethu Investment will sell its 167 255 156 Vodacom SA A shares and 18
million Vodacom SA ordinary shares to Vodacom Group and in return Vodacom Group will issue 49 689 995 new Vodacom Group shares in consideration.

2.6 Step 6: fourth implementation day: YeboYethu raises vendor funding and third party financing and subscribes for additional Vodacom Group shares

In aggregate, YeboYethu will raise R9 908 154 034 in subscription proceeds from the issue of the class A preference shares and class B preference shares. The number of class A
preference shares to be issued by YeboYethu, however, will be, with reference to their aggregate subscription price, equal to the lesser of R5 833 333 333 and an aggregate
subscription price which is equal to a 3x share cover ratio as measured against the 5-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share on the fourth implementation day. The number of class B
preference shares will be equal to that number of class B preference shares which need to be issued, based on their aggregate subscription price, such that the total preference
share funding received by YeboYethu (including the subscription funds received pursuant to the issue of the class A preference shares) is equal to R9 908 154 034.

Accordingly, although the aggregate funding received by YeboYethu from preference share subscription proceeds will remain constant, the split between the class A preference
shares and class B preference shares will be determined with reference to the 5-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share on the fourth implementation day. For illustrative purposes,
below and later in the announcement, the split of the class A preference shares and class B preference shares is based on an assumed 5-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share on
the fourth implementation day of R121.19.

YeboYethu will issue class B preference shares to Vodacom Group and raise R5 284 707 866. The class B preference shares will be unsecured. YeboYethu will use the subscription
proceeds received pursuant to (i) the subscription by Vodacom ESOP (as set out in step 4 at paragraph 2.4 above) and (ii) the issue of the class B preference shares, to (a) fund the
payment of the special dividend (as set out in step 3 at paragraph 2.3 above) and transaction costs amounting to R64 million and (b) subscribe for 2 709 310 (at an issue price of 
R1 000 per share) additional YeboYethu Investment shares.

YeboYethu Investment will use the subscription proceeds received from YeboYethu above to subscribe for 23 927 991 new Vodacom Group shares (representing 1.30% of 
Vodacom Group shares, post the BEE transaction), valued at R3 430 077 652, at a discount of R720 767 619.

In addition, YeboYethu will issue class A preference shares to third party funders and raise R4 623 446 168. The class A share cover preference shares will be secured through
YeboYethu Investment issuing a guarantee and a pledge of the Vodacom Group shares held by it to the third party funders. YeboYethu will use the entire subscription proceeds
received pursuant to the issue of the class A share cover preference shares, to subscribe for 4 623 446 (at an issue price of R1 000 per share) additional YeboYethu Investment
shares.

YeboYethu Investment will use the entire subscription proceeds received from YeboYethu above to subscribe for 40 833 194 new Vodacom Group shares (representing 2.22% of
Vodacom Group shares, post the BEE transaction), valued at R5 853 438 396, at a discount of R1 229 992 228.

The Vodacom Group share price is a material input in calculating the financial effects of the transaction. Since the terms announcement, dated 11 June 2018, markets across the
globe have been impacted by significant share price volatility. This has been driven by global factors including increased international trade uncertainty from tariff interventions
mainly by the USA and China. Emerging markets have been particularly affected. International funds withdrew from riskier assets, creating negative pressure on emerging market
economies and currencies. The impact of this can be clearly seen in the resultant volatile share prices across the South African market.

The table below illustrates what the split of the YeboYethu gearing amounts will be between the class A preference shares and class B preference shares based on various assumed
5-day VWAP's of a Vodacom Group share on the fourth implementation day and is provided for illustrative purposes only.

2.7 Comparison of transaction parameters to terms announcement

The table below shows a comparison of the key pricing parameters of the BEE transaction between the terms announcement and this pricing announcement. The overall gearing
of the BEE transaction structure does not increase (remains at 60%) but the BEE equity reinvestment and Vodacom discount ratios change. The discount from Vodacom increases
from R1.75 billion to R1.95 billion (R200 million increase). As a result of the smaller deal size (R16.4 billion vs. R17.5 billion) and the proportional increase in the facilitation from
Vodacom, the equity reinvestment from BEE investors decreases from R4.50 billion to R3.86 billion (R638 million decrease) and the overall funding required reduces from 
R10.50 billion to R9.91 billion (R592 million decrease).

4. Financial effects

Pro forma financial effects of the BEE transaction

The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the BEE transaction on, inter alia, Vodacom Group's net asset value per share, net tangible asset value per share, basic
earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, headline earnings per share and diluted headline earnings per share based on the most recently published audited consolidated
annual financial statements of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The pro forma financial effects have been prepared using accounting policies that comply with IFRS and that are consistent with those applied in the published audited
consolidated annual financial statements of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The pro forma financial effects are the responsibility of the directors of Vodacom Group and were prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not, because of its nature, fairly
present Vodacom Group's financial position, changes in equity and results of its operations or cash flows nor the effect and impact of the BEE transaction going forward. It does not
purport to be indicative of what the financial results would have been, had the BEE transaction been implemented on a different date.

Accounting treatment

Unwind of existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction

The existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction was predominantly accounted for as an equity-settled share based payment scheme, and YeboYethu and the special purpose vehicles
created by RBH and Thebe to acquire the Vodacom SA shares were consolidated in terms of IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements (""IFRS 10""). Consequently, the unwind of
the existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction will result in the special purpose vehicles created by RBH and Thebe being de-consolidated. The unwind will be accounted for within
equity as it is a transaction with shareholders. Vodacom Group will continue to consolidate YeboYethu while YeboYethu ESOP will be wound up.

The BEE transaction

The BEE transaction will be implemented through a series of inter-conditional steps resulting in Vodacom Group issuing 114 451 180 new Vodacom Group shares to YeboYethu
Investment, of which 49 689 995 are issued at the BEE transaction share price and 64 761 185 are issued at BEE transaction discounted subscription price.

The BEE transaction meets the requirements of an IFRS 2: Share-based Payment arrangement and will predominantly be accounted for as equity-settled, and will result in a once
off share-based payment charge, as well as a recurring share-based payment charge for Vodacom ESOP, which will be expensed over the vesting period. Vodacom Group currently
has no intention to settle the BEE transaction in cash. The Innovator Trust and a portion of the Vodacom ESOP will however be accounted for as cash-settled due to the accounting
substance thereof, of which the charge relating to the Vodacom ESOP will be expensed over the vesting period. As this part of the share based payment is cash-settled, the share
based payment liability will be re-measured at each reporting period.

Based on management's judgement and application of the control principles contained in IFRS 10, management concluded that Vodacom Group will consolidate YeboYethu,
YeboYethu Investment and Vodacom ESOP. As a result, the 114 451 180 new Vodacom Group shares held by YeboYethu Investment in Vodacom Group will be treated as treasury
shares (i.e. it will be excluded from shares in issue and weighted average number of shares in issue for accounting purposes). When the control principles in IFRS 10 are no longer
met, YeboYethu and YeboYethu Investment will be de-consolidated and the new Vodacom Group shares held by YeboYethu Investment will no longer be classified as treasury
shares.

Notes and assumptions:

1. The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Before the BEE transaction"" column has been extracted from the audited consolidated annual financial statements of
   Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

2. The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Pro forma after the BEE transaction"" has been calculated on the basis that all of the steps to unwind the existing Vodacom SA
   BEE transaction and all of the steps to implement the BEE transaction have been completed.

3. The effects on basic earnings, diluted earnings, headline earnings, and diluted headline earnings per share are calculated on the basis that the BEE transaction was effective on
   1 April 2017, while the effects on net asset value and net tangible asset value per share are calculated on the basis that the BEE transaction was effective on 31 March 2018 for
   purposes of presenting the pro forma financial effects thereof on Vodacom Group.

The pro forma adjustments are based on the following principal assumptions:

-  Step 1: The unwind of the existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction

   It has been assumed that the unwind of the existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction and the implementation of the NVF structure by way of a repurchase will take place in accordance
   with the memorandum of incorporation of Vodacom SA, resulting in Vodacom SA BEE shareholders collectively owning a shareholding of 3.95% in Vodacom SA.

   Step 1 results in the de-consolidation of the special purpose vehicles through which RBH and Thebe own their Vodacom SA shares as well as the reversal of the non-controlling
   interest and the YeboYethu ESOP IFRS 2 liability which arose upon the offer to employees to take up interest-free loans with the underlying YeboYethu shares as security, and which
   will be extinguished upon unwinding the existing Vodacom SA BEE transaction. Vodacom Group will continue to consolidate YeboYethu.

-  Step 2: Consolidation of Vodacom SA BEE Shareholders' interests in Vodacom SA in a single vehicle

   This step does not give rise to any pro forma financial effects for Vodacom Group.

-  Step 3: YeboYethu declares a special dividend

   Other reserves are reduced for the impact of the declaration of the special dividend. The pro forma financial effects arising as a result of the settlement of the special dividend are
   described below.

-  Step 4: Vodacom Group (on behalf of itself and other employer companies) make a contribution to the Vodacom ESOP to enable it to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares

   Other reserves and cash are each reduced for the impact of the R300 million acquisition of YeboYethu shares by Vodacom ESOP from YeboYethu ESOP, while there is no impact for
   the R750 million subscription for YeboYethu shares by Vodacom ESOP as it eliminates on consolidation.

-  Step 5: YeboYethu exchanges Vodacom SA shares for new Vodacom Group shares

   The 49 689 995 new Vodacom Group shares issued in exchange for the 3.95% shareholding that YeboYethu holds in Vodacom SA are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated
   level. This step results in an assumed IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating dividend per
   share.

-  Step 6: YeboYethu raises vendor funding and third party financing and subscribes for additional Vodacom Group shares

Class A preference shares

Borrowings are increased for YeboYethu's issue of class A preference shares to third party funders of R4 623 446 168. YeboYethu will use the entire subscription proceeds received
to subscribe for 40 833 194 new Vodacom Group shares through its wholly owned subsidiary YeboYethu Investment at a discount of R1 229 992 228, based on the BEE transaction
share price.

These shares are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated level. In addition, this step results in an IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of
Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating dividend per share.

Finance cost at a rate of 68% of prime overdraft lending rate (non tax deductible) on the outstanding balance of the A preference shares has been assumed.

Class B preference shares

The issue of class B preference shares by YeboYethu to Vodacom Group of R5 284 707 866 does not give rise to any pro forma financial effects as it eliminates on consolidation.
YeboYethu will use the subscription proceeds as well as the subscription proceeds to:

- Fund the payment of the special dividend of R3 261 189 876 to YeboYethu shareholders (detailed in Step 3); and
- Settle assumed transaction costs of R64 million.

The remaining balance of the class B subscription proceeds as well as the subscription proceeds received from Vodacom ESOP through the subscription of YeboYethu shares to the
value of R750 million will be used to subscribe for 23 927 991 new Vodacom Group shares through its wholly owned subsidiary YeboYethu Investment at a discount of R720 767
619 based on the BEE transaction share price.

These shares are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated level. In addition, this step results in an IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of
Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating dividend per share.

3.1. The BEE transaction gives rise to the following assumed IFRS 2 charges:

- A non-recurring share-based payment charge of R1 275 million, relating to YeboYethu shareholders, excluding the Vodacom ESOP; and
- A total share-based payment charge of R1 119 million, relating to Vodacom ESOP, which will be recognised on a recurring basis in tranches over the vesting period of five years.

Accordingly, the pro forma financial effects assumes a charge of R1 491 million, consisting of the non-recurring charge, and one year's vesting charge of R216 million (net of tax), in
relation to the Vodacom ESOP component.

Of the total assumed IFRS 2 charge of R2 394 million, R732 million relates to a cash-settled share-based payment arrangement. On initial recognition, the liability relating to the
Vodacom ESOP and the Innovator Trust will be measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation based option pricing model. The value of the liability will be re-measured at
each reporting period based on changes to the various valuation inputs.

The abovementioned share-based payment charges have been calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation based option pricing model. The economic substance of the BEE
transaction mimics that of a call option, with the value of the outstanding debt at the maturity date of the transaction as the strike price of the option.

A total assumed IFRS 2 charge of R2 394 million has been determined for this transaction at inception. The assumptions used in this model for purposes of the pro forma financial
effects include:
- 114 451 180 new Vodacom Group shares;
- Vodacom Group share price of R123.09, being the Vodacom Group share price on the last practicable date prior to finalising the pricing announcement;
- Volatility of 22.25% in the Vodacom Group share price, calculated using historical share price information since Vodacom Group's listing on the JSE;
- Expected costs to escalate by 6% per annum;
- Expected dividend yields of between 6.9% and 8.03%; and
- The risk free rate used was based on an independently constructed zero coupon South African Rand interest rate swap curve ranging from 6.3% to 8.4%.

These assumptions will be updated when the final IFRS 2 charge is determined upon approval of the BEE transaction.

The Vodacom Group share price is a material input in calculating the financial effects of the transaction. Since the terms announcement dated 11 June 2018, markets across the
globe have been impacted by significant share price volatility. This has been driven by global factors including increased international trade uncertainty from tariff interventions
mainly by the USA and China. Emerging markets have been particularly affected. International funds withdrew from riskier assets, creating negative pressure on emerging market
economies and currencies. The impact of this can be clearly seen in the resultant volatile share prices across the South African market.

The IFRS 2 charge is most sensitive to changes in the share price of the Vodacom Group share. The table below illustrates what the IFRS 2 charge would be based on various
Vodacom Group share prices, with all other assumptions remaining static. The table below is provided for illustrative purposes only.

* This column represents the decrease in earnings per share and headline earnings per share arising as a result of the total assumed IFRS 2 charge, after tax.
** Reflected in the pro forma financial effects of the BEE transaction

The IFRS 2 charge is also sensitive to the dividend yield that is input into the Monte Carlo valuation model. This will also change based on the Vodacom Group share price.

For the purpose of performing the valuation, an annual effective dividend yield of 8.01% was used. This effective dividend yield was based on a term structure of simple dividend
yields that was calculated using Bloomberg analyst forecasts, as at the last practicable date, in conjunction with a projected future share price. The projected future share price was
determined under a risk-neutral framework as dictated under option pricing theory. Typically, this results in a dividend yield higher than the historical average. In order to assess the
sensitivity of this input, we performed a valuation using an assumed 5.92% average historical dividend yield. This assumed average historical dividend yield was determined based
on historical dividend information over the period commencing from 16 May 2012, the date at which Vodacom Group revised its dividend policy, up to and including 29 June 2018.
The IFRS 2 charge that would result using the assumed average historical dividend yield would have been as follows:

                                                     IFRS 2 charge                              Total assumed

3.2. The calculation of diluted earnings and diluted headline earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue, increased by the number of shares to
     be issued for no consideration under the BEE transaction. The assumed number of dilutive shares of 46 095 623 is based on issuing 114 451 180 Vodacom Group shares, assumed
     proceeds based on the outstanding preference share funding and the value of services to be provided by employees in the future and an average market price of the Vodacom
     Group share over the reporting period of R159.03.

3.3. The net assumed cash proceeds of R992 million is assumed to earn interest at an average rate of 6.44% percent, before taxation, which interest saving thereon is of a
     continuing nature.

3.4. Once-off transaction costs of R152 million including VAT (non tax deductible) (inclusive of the transaction costs in Step 6) are assumed to be settled in cash and have been
     expensed in profit or loss. YeboYethu will incur operating expenses in the ordinary course of business. The pro forma effects exclude any incremental increase in excess of historical
     levels in such expenses as this cannot be quantified as at the last practicable date prior of finalising this pricing announcement.

     The pro forma financial effects presented in this pricing announcement differ from those effects presented in the announcement to Vodacom Group shareholders dated 11 June
     2018, due to updating the pro forma financial effects for the BEE transaction share price and due to the non-recurring impact arising from the IFRS 2 charge incorrectly being
     presented separately.

5. Vodacom Group dividend policy

Vodacom Group intends to maintain its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of headline earnings, excluding the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom
and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, Vodacom Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend
received, net of withholding tax.

Vodacom Group intends to add back the day one non-recurring share-based payment charge relating to YeboYethu shareholders, excluding the Vodacom ESOP, in relation to the
proposed BEE transaction to headline earnings, for the purpose of dividend calculation, for the 2019 financial year.

1. Introduction

During 2008, Vodacom Group facilitated a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (""BEE"") ownership transaction through the acquisition by Royal Bafokeng Holdings
(Proprietary) Limited (""RBH"") (which holds its shares in Vodacom (Proprietary) Limited (""Vodacom SA"") through its subsidiary, Lisinfo 209 Investments (Proprietary) Limited), Thebe
Investment Corporation (Proprietary) Limited (""Thebe"") (which holds its shares in Vodacom SA through its subsidiary, Main Street 661 (Proprietary) Limited) and YeboYethu (RF)
Limited (""YeboYethu"") (collectively, the ""Vodacom SA BEE shareholders""), in aggregate, of an effective 6.25% shareholding in the issued share capital of Vodacom SA (the ""existing
BEE transaction"").

The existing BEE transaction is scheduled to unwind on 8 October 2018.

In demonstrating its ongoing and continued commitment to transformation and broad-based BEE ownership in South Africa, Vodacom Group, together with Vodacom SA and the
Vodacom SA BEE shareholders (""parties""), have entered into a suite of agreements in terms of which the current shareholders of YeboYethu, together with the Vodacom SA BEE
shareholders and a newly formed employee share ownership scheme in the form of an employee trust with the beneficiaries acquiring vested rights upfront (the ""Vodacom ESOP"")
will, through YeboYethu, acquire between 5.80% and 6.25% of the issued shares in Vodacom Group (post issuance) in terms of a new BEE ownership transaction (the ""proposed BEE
transaction"").

The parties have entered into inter alia a relationship agreement and an implementation agreement to regulate and implement the proposed BEE transaction, as more fully
described in paragraph 3.

In terms of the implementation agreement, the parties have agreed the key pricing parameters of the proposed BEE transaction, barring the Vodacom SA / Vodacom Group share
exchange, which has been delayed to minimise the time period between the pricing date (as defined below) and the date of conclusion of the proposed BEE transaction, to reduce
market risk and pricing volatility. Accordingly, implementation of the proposed BEE transaction will be implemented based on the 60-day volume weighted average price (""VWAP"")
of a Vodacom Group share on the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE""), up to the last practicable date prior to formal JSE approval of the Vodacom Group and YeboYethu
circulars (""pricing date""). The pricing date is currently anticipated to be Tuesday 3 July 2018.

The parties have agreed the following key proposed BEE transaction parameters, which will be determined on the pricing date:

60-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share                                 From R150 to (but        From R147.50 to          From R145 to (but        From R140 to (but
on pricing date                              From R155 to R165       less than) R155          (but less than) R150     less than) R147.50       less than) R145

                                                                     R17.2 billion to         R16.9 billion to         R16.6 billion to         R16.0 billion to

Based on an illustrative price of R152.50 per Vodacom Group share, YeboYethu would acquire a 6.25% shareholding in Vodacom Group. This illustrative price will be updated to the
60-day VWAP on the last practicable date prior to finalising the circular. (The 60-day VWAP per Vodacom Group share on Thursday 7 June 2018, prior to finalisation of this
announcement amounted to R152.17 per share.)

2. Rationale for and principles of the proposed BEE transaction

The existing BEE transaction is scheduled to unwind on 8 October 2018. Consistent with Vodacom Group's empowerment objectives to sustain and enhance its broad-based black
ownership, the proposed BEE transaction has been designed to provide liquidity and the opportunity for Vodacom SA BEE shareholders and the Vodacom ESOP to participate in an
attractive growth opportunity. In order to structure the proposed BEE transaction efficiently, Vodacom Group was guided by the following principles:

- to preserve Vodacom SA's BEE ownership level by ensuring that black ownership is not diluted through the unwind of the existing BEE structure and the implementation of the
  proposed BEE transaction;
- to provide significant liquidity and a return of capital to Vodacom SA BEE shareholders through the special dividend;
- to lower the cash cost of facilitating the proposed BEE transaction, through gearing the BEE net asset value;
- to bolster and grow YeboYethu, which consolidates Vodacom BEE shareholders in a listed and tradeable platform, and enable trading from day one by an increased
  shareholder base;
- to provide BEE shareholders exposure to Vodacom Group's South African and international operations, including Safaricom; and
- to broaden ownership by including qualifying employees of Vodacom Group and its South African subsidiaries (""employer companies""), through the Vodacom ESOP.

3. Salient details of the proposed BEE transaction

The proposed BEE transaction will be implemented through a series of inter-conditional steps as outlined below. The values reflected below are based on an illustrative price of
R152.50 per Vodacom Group share.

3.1 Background

During 2008 Vodacom Group implemented the existing BEE transaction in terms of which the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders acquired a 6.25% interest in Vodacom SA through a
subscription for:

- 282 million class ""A"" ordinary shares in the share capital of Vodacom SA (""Vodacom SA A shares""); and
- 18 million ordinary shares in the share capital of Vodacom SA (""Vodacom SA ordinary shares""), (collectively, the ""Vodacom SA shares"").

The issue of the Vodacom SA A shares was facilitated by Vodacom SA through a notional vendor finance (""NVF"") structure. The Vodacom SA BEE shareholders were required to
make an equity contribution of R900 million (R378 million from RBH, R162 million from Thebe, and R360 million from YeboYethu). In order to raise funds, YeboYethu offered 
14.4 million ordinary shares in its share capital (""YeboYethu ordinary shares"") for subscription by black individuals and black-owned companies. In addition, the YeboYethu Employee
Participation Trust (""YeboYethu ESOP"") subscribed for 12 million compulsorily convertible ""N"" shares (""YeboYethu N shares"") at a nominal amount in terms of a separate NVF
transaction.

Vodacom Group facilitated the establishment of the Innovator Trust (the “Innovator Trust”), an independent entity whose primary purpose is development and support of black 
owned Small Micro and Medium Enterprises (“SMME”) in the information and communication technology sector, in 2014 with a loan facility of R750 million.  The Innovator Trust uses the 
facility to purchase shares in YeboYethu, and uses the income from interest and dividends to develop black owned SMME’s in the information and communication technology sector and advancement of 
black owned suppliers in Vodacom Group’s supply chain.

In 2016, the YeboYethu ordinary shares were listed on the BEE Segment of the JSE.

Please refer to the announcement to be published in the press tomorrow (Tuesday 12 June 2018) for the diagram which illustrates the shareholding of the existing BEE transaction
structure.

3.2 Proposed BEE transaction steps

3.2.1 Step 1: Unwind of the existing BEE transaction

Step 1A: Settlement of the NVF

Vodacom SA will repurchase 110 902 035 Vodacom SA A shares from the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders for a nominal consideration pursuant to the existing NVF transaction terms
(""Vodacom SA repurchase""), upon which the remaining Vodacom SA A ordinary shares will rank pari passu with the Vodacom SA ordinary shares in all respects and will be
unencumbered consistent with the terms of issue thereof. It is anticipated that post the Vodacom SA repurchase, the Vodacom SA BEE shareholders will collectively hold 
189 097 965 Vodacom SA shares, or approximately 4.0% of Vodacom SA.

Step 1B: Conversion and partial repurchase of YeboYethu N shares

Following implementation of the Vodacom SA repurchase, the YeboYethu N shares will automatically convert according to their terms of issue and at the same time 3 154 468 of
those shares shall be repurchased by YeboYethu for a nominal amount based on the existing YeboYethu NVF transaction terms. Of the 8 845 532 remaining YeboYethu ordinary
shares held by the YeboYethu ESOP, a portion will, as set out in Step 4 (paragraph 3.2.4), be sold to the Vodacom ESOP, and the remainder of those shares will be transferred,
together with the proceeds of those sales, to the existing vested beneficiaries of the YeboYethu ESOP, whereafter the YeboYethu ESOP will be wound-up.

3.2.2 Step 2: Consolidation of Vodacom SA BEE shareholders' interests in Vodacom SA in a single vehicle

Each of RBH and Thebe will exchange their Vodacom SA shares for new YeboYethu ordinary shares in terms of an asset-for-share transaction, thereby consolidating all of the
Vodacom SA BEE shareholders' interests into a single vehicle, being YeboYethu.

RBH will sell its 56 191 660 Vodacom SA A shares and 7.56 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares to YeboYethu, and in return YeboYethu will issue 15 115 065 new YeboYethu
ordinary shares to RBH in consideration.

Thebe will sell its 24 082 140 Vodacom SA A shares and 3.24 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares to YeboYethu, and in return YeboYethu will issue 6 477 885 new YeboYethu
ordinary shares to Thebe in consideration.

The sales by each of RBH and Thebe, and the issue of new ordinary shares in YeboYethu, will be done simultaneously and at fair value.

3.2.3 Step 3: YeboYethu declares a special dividend (distribution)

YeboYethu will declare a special dividend of R3 016 419 627 or R67.28 per YeboYethu ordinary share. The special dividend represents a significant liquidity event and equates to
2.7 times the original equity contribution.

Despite declaration, the payment of the special dividend will only occur in (and be contingent upon) Step 6 (and each of the preceding Steps) being implemented (paragraph 3.2.6).

3.2.4 Step 4: Vodacom Group employer companies make a contribution to the Vodacom ESOP to enable it to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares

Vodacom Group, on behalf of itself and the employer companies, will make a capital contribution of an aggregate amount of R1.05 billion to the Vodacom ESOP. The Vodacom
ESOP will use the proceeds to purchase up to a maximum of 2 988 919 YeboYethu ordinary shares valued at R300 million from the YeboYethu ESOP (and the YeboYethu ESOP
beneficiaries insofar as the rights therein have vested), and will use the balance of R750 million to subscribe for 7 472 297 new YeboYethu ordinary shares for the benefit of vested
beneficiaries.

Should any balance of the contribution remain after the sale and subscription above, the Vodacom ESOP will use those funds to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares in the market
after the implementation of the proposed BEE transaction.

3.2.5 Step 5: YeboYethu exchanges Vodacom SA shares for new Vodacom Group shares

A new special purpose vehicle, YeboYethu Investment Company (RF) (Proprietary) Limited (""YeboYethu Investment""), will be created for the purpose of holding YeboYethu's
Vodacom Group shares, and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of YeboYethu.

After the implementation of the aforementioned steps and the consolidation of YeboYethu's shareholding in Vodacom SA, YeboYethu will on the next day exchange its Vodacom SA
shares for ordinary shares in the share capital of YeboYethu Investment (""YeboYethu Investment shares""). YeboYethu will sell its 171 097 965 Vodacom SA A shares and 18 million
Vodacom SA ordinary shares to YeboYethu Investment, and in return YeboYethu Investment will issue 7 516 420 new YeboYethu Investment ordinary shares to YeboYethu in
consideration.

After implementation of the exchange of Vodacom SA shares for YeboYethu Investment shares, and on the subsequent day, YeboYethu Investment will exchange its Vodacom SA
shares for new ordinary shares in the share capital of Vodacom Group (""Vodacom Group shares"") on a fair value basis. YeboYethu Investment will sell its 171 097 965 Vodacom SA A
shares and 18 million Vodacom SA ordinary shares to Vodacom Group and in return Vodacom Group will issue 49 287 998 new Vodacom Group shares in consideration.

3.2.6 Step 6: YeboYethu raises vendor funding and third party financing and subscribes for additional Vodacom Group shares

YeboYethu will issue class B preference shares in its share capital (""class B preference shares"") to Vodacom Group and raise R4 732 666 667. The class B preference shares will be
unsecured. YeboYethu will use the subscription proceeds received pursuant to (i) the subscription by Vodacom ESOP (as set out in step 4 at paragraph 3.2.4 above) and (ii) the issue
of the class B preference shares, to (a) fund the payment of the special dividend (as set out in step 3 at paragraph 3.2.3 above) and transaction costs amounting to R66 million and
(b) subscribe for 2 400 247 additional YeboYethu Investment shares.

YeboYethu Investment will use the subscription proceeds received from YeboYethu above to subscribe for 19 084 628 new Vodacom Group shares at a discount of R510 158 659.

In addition, YeboYethu will issue class A preference shares in its share capital (""class A share cover preference shares"") to third party funders and raise R5 833 333 333. The class A
share cover preference shares will be secured through YeboYethu Investment issuing a guarantee and a pledge of the Vodacom Group shares held by it to the third party funders.
YeboYethu will use the entire subscription proceeds received pursuant to the issue of the class A share cover preference shares, to subscribe for 5 833 333 additional YeboYethu
Investment shares.

YeboYethu Investment will use the entire subscription proceeds received from YeboYethu above to subscribe for 46 381 473 new Vodacom Group shares at a discount
of R1 239 841 341.

                                           reporting period.

4.3 Listing and trading

Subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the suspensive conditions set out in paragraph 9 (some to be fulfilled prior to beginning to implement, and others during implementation),
the proposed BEE transaction will be implemented over four successive business days, commencing on the first business day upon which, pursuant to any requirements of the JSE,
the proposed BEE transaction may begin to be implemented, provided that such date shall not be earlier than the expiry of the period within which the shareholders of YeboYethu
are, to the extent applicable, entitled to exercise their appraisal rights as a consequence of the passing of the resolutions to approve and implement the proposed BEE transaction
(""Implementation Date""). YeboYethu will remain listed on the BEE Segment of the JSE after the Implementation Date. Registered holders of YeboYethu ordinary shares (""YeboYethu
ordinary shareholders""), with the exception of the Vodacom ESOP, will therefore continue to have the ability to trade their YeboYethu ordinary shares on the JSE, before and after
the implementation of the proposed BEE transaction.

4.4 ESOP

Qualifying Vodacom Group employees (""qualifying employees"") will participate in ownership of Vodacom Group through the Vodacom ESOP that will acquire vested rights to the
YeboYethu ordinary shares acquired by the Vodacom ESOP. Qualifying employees will be issued units in the Vodacom ESOP. The units, representing underlying YeboYethu ordinary
shares, will have a service condition that will lift in three equal tranches at the end of years 3, 4 and 5 respectively, but will only become tradable on the BEE Segment in equal
tranches over a three year period starting from the end of the fifth year of the scheme (i.e. years 6, 7 and 8).

4.5 Funding period

Subject to the funding agreements, YeboYethu (and YeboYethu Investment) will be prohibited from selling its effective shareholding in Vodacom Group for a period of ten years.
After ten years and subject to the final settlement of the then outstanding funding, YeboYethu (and YeboYethu Investment) will have no restriction on the trading of its
shareholding in Vodacom Group.

4.6 Dividends

YeboYethu Investment will receive dividends on its Vodacom Group shares. Dividends received from Vodacom Group will be used to pay taxes, administration costs and to service
non-recourse funding. 20% of the remaining amount after servicing the Vodacom Group non-recourse preference shares will, at the election of YeboYethu be declared as a dividend
to YeboYethu shareholders. The proposed BEE transaction has been structured such that YeboYethu will, subject to the share cover ratio exceeding 2.4 times and the approval of
the YeboYethu board of directors, be able to pay a dividend to YeboYethu shareholders from the outset of the proposed BEE transaction, with a minimum annual trickle dividend in
favour of YeboYethu shareholders being an amount equal to the greater of (i) R76 million (increased at 5% per annum) or the balance of the available cash (whichever is less), and
(ii) 20% of the available cash.

5. Estimated facilitation cost

The economic cost of implementing the proposed BEE transaction for Vodacom Group and its shareholders is estimated to be approximately R4 245 million. This represents
c.24.3% of the transaction value and c.1.7% of the market capitalisation of Vodacom Group as at the last practicable date. Further details of the facilitation cost will be provided in
the circular to Vodacom Group shareholders.

6. Vodacom Group dividend policy

Vodacom Group intends to maintain its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of headline earnings, excluding the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom
and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, Vodacom Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend
received, net of withholding tax.

Vodacom Group intends to add back the day one non-recurring share-based payment charge relating to YeboYethu shareholders, excluding the Vodacom ESOP, in relation to the
proposed BEE transaction to headline earnings, for the purpose of dividend calculation, for the 2019 financial year.

7. Shareholder undertakings

Vodacom Group has secured irrevocable support from Vodafone Group Plc (""Vodafone"") to vote in favour of all the relevant resolutions to effect the proposed BEE transaction.

in-principle support of the proposed BEE transaction and, subject to their internal approval process, intends to vote in favour of all the requisite resolutions in respect of their
shareholding in Vodacom Group.

In addition, Vodacom SA has also secured irrevocable undertakings from RBH and Thebe in order to implement the unwind of the existing BEE transaction.

8. Pro forma financial effects of the unwind of the existing BEE transaction and the proposed BEE transaction (collectively the ""proposed transactions"")

The table below sets out the pro forma financial effects of the proposed transactions on, inter alia, Vodacom Group's net asset value per share, net tangible asset value per share,
basic earnings per share, diluted basic earnings per share, headline earnings per share and diluted headline earnings per share based on the most recently published reviewed
preliminary condensed consolidated financial results of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The pro forma financial effects have been prepared using accounting policies that comply with IFRS and that are consistent with those applied in the published reviewed
preliminary condensed consolidated financial results of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

The pro forma financial effects are the responsibility of the directors of Vodacom Group and were prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not, because of its nature, fairly
present Vodacom Group's financial position, changes in equity and results of its operations or cash flows nor the effect and impact of the proposed transactions going forward. It
does not purport to be indicative of what the financial results would have been, had the proposed transactions been implemented on a different date.

Accounting treatment

Unwind of existing BEE transaction

The existing BEE transaction was predominantly accounted for as an equity-settled share based payment scheme, and YeboYethu and the special purpose vehicles created by RBH
and Thebe to acquire the Vodacom SA shares were consolidated in terms of IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements (""IFRS 10""). Consequently, the unwind of the existing BEE
transaction will result in the special purpose vehicles created by RBH and Thebe being de-consolidated. The unwind will be accounted for within equity as it is a transaction with
shareholders. Vodacom Group will continue to consolidate YeboYethu while YeboYethu ESOP will be wound up.

Proposed BEE transaction

The proposed BEE transaction will be implemented through a series of inter-conditional steps resulting in Vodacom Group issuing an assumed 114 754 098 new Vodacom Group
shares to YeboYethu based on the 60-day VWAP per new Vodacom Group share on the pricing date.

The proposed BEE transaction meets the requirements of an IFRS 2: Share-based Payment (""IFRS 2"") arrangement and will predominantly be accounted for as equity-settled,
resulting and will result in a once off share-based payment charge, as well as a recurring share-based payment charge for Vodacom ESOP, which will be expensed over the vesting
period. Vodacom Group currently has no intention to settle the proposed BEE transaction in cash. The Innovator Trust and a portion of the Vodacom ESOP will however be
accounted for as cash-settled due to the accounting substance thereof, of which the charge relating to the Vodacom ESOP will be expensed over the vesting period. As this part of
the share based payment is cash-settled, the share based payment liability will be re-measured at each reporting period.

Based on management's judgement and application of the control principles contained in IFRS 10, management concluded that Vodacom Group will consolidate YeboYethu,
YeboYethu Investment and Vodacom ESOP. As a result, the assumed 114 754 098 new Vodacom Group shares held by YeboYethu Investment in Vodacom Group will be treated as
treasury shares (i.e. it will be excluded from shares in issue and weighted average number of shares in issue for accounting purposes). When the control principles in IFRS 10 are no
longer met, YeboYethu and YeboYethu Investment will be de-consolidated and the new Vodacom Group shares held by YeboYethu Investment will no longer be classified as
treasury shares.

Notes and assumptions
The pro forma financial effects presented assumes a Vodacom Group share price of R152.50 for illustrative purposes, and will be updated on the last practicable date prior to
finalising the Circular (the 60-day VWAP per Vodacom Group share on Thursday 7 June 2018, prior to finalisation of this announcement amounted to R152.17 per share).

1. The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Before the proposed transactions"" column has been extracted from the published reviewed preliminary condensed
consolidated financial statements of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2018.

2. The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Pro forma after the proposed transactions, excluding non-recurring share-based payment charge"" column has been calculated
on the basis that all of the steps to unwind the existing BEE transaction and all of the steps to implement the proposed BEE transaction have been completed and is stated before
the non-recurring share-based payment charge arising as a result of the proposed BEE transaction.

3. The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Pro forma after the proposed transactions"" has been calculated on the basis that all of the steps to unwind the existing BEE
Transaction and all of the steps to implement the proposed BEE transaction have been completed and is stated after the non-recurring share-based payment charge arising as a
result of the proposed BEE transaction.

4. The effects on basic earnings, diluted basic earnings, headline earnings, and diluted headline earnings per share are calculated on the basis that the proposed transactions were
effective on 1 April 2017, while the effects on net asset value and net tangible asset value per share are calculated on the basis that the proposed transactions were effective on 
31 March 2018 for purposes of presenting the pro forma financial effects thereof on Vodacom Group.

The pro forma adjustments are based on the following principal assumptions:

- Step 1: The unwind of the existing BEE Transaction

It has been assumed that the unwind of the existing BEE transaction and the settlement of the outstanding notional vendor finance will take place in accordance with the
Memorandum of Incorporation of Vodacom SA, resulting in Vodacom SA BEE shareholders collectively owning a shareholding of 4.0% in Vodacom SA.

Step 1 results in the de-consolidation of the special purpose vehicles through which RBH and Thebe owns its Vodacom SA shares as well as the reversal of the non-controlling
interest and the YeboYethu ESOP IFRS 2 liability which arose upon the offer to employees to take up interest-free loans with the underlying YeboYethu shares as security, and which
will be extinguished upon unwinding the existing BEE transaction. Vodacom Group will continue to consolidate YeboYethu.

- Step 2: Consolidation of Vodacom SA BEE Shareholders' interests in Vodacom SA in a single vehicle

This step does not give rise to any pro forma financial effects for Vodacom Group.

- Step 3: YeboYethu declares a special dividend

Other reserves are reduced for the impact of the declaration of the special dividend. The pro forma financial effects arising as a result of the settlement of the special dividend are
described below.

- Step 4: Vodacom Group employer companies make a contribution to the Vodacom ESOP to enable it to acquire YeboYethu ordinary shares

Other reserves and cash are reduced for the impact of the R300 million acquisition of YeboYethu shares by Vodacom ESOP from YeboYethu ESOP, while there is no impact for the 
R750 million subscription for YeboYethu shares by Vodacom ESOP as it eliminates on consolidation.

- Step 5: YeboYethu exchanges Vodacom SA shares for new Vodacom Group shares

The assumed 49 287 998 new Vodacom Group shares issued in exchange for the 4.0% shareholding that YeboYethu holds in Vodacom SA are treated as treasury shares on a
consolidated level. This step results in an assumed IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating
dividend per share.

- Step 6: YeboYethu raises vendor funding and third party financing and subscribes for additional Vodacom Group shares

YeboYethu class A preference shares

Borrowings are increased for YeboYethu's issue of class A preference shares to third party financiers at the assumed value of R5 833 million. YeboYethu will use the entire
subscription proceeds received to subscribe for 46 381 473 new Vodacom Group shares through its wholly owned subsidiary YeboYethu Investment at a discount of R1 240 million,
assuming a Vodacom Group share price of R152.50.

These shares are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated level. In addition, this step results in an IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of
Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating dividend per share.

Finance cost at a rate of 68% of prime overdraft lending rate (non tax deductible) on the outstanding balance of the A preference shares has been assumed.
YeboYethu class B preference shares

The issue of class B preference shares by YeboYethu to Vodacom Group at the assumed value of R 4 733 million does not give rise to any pro forma financial effects as it eliminates
on consolidation. YeboYethu will use the subscription proceeds as well as the subscription proceeds received from Vodacom ESOP through the subscription of YeboYethu shares to
the value of R750 million to:

- Fund the payment of the special dividend of R3 016 million to YeboYethu shareholders (detailed in Step 3);
- Settle assumed transaction costs of R66 million; and
- Subscribe for 19 084 628 new Vodacom Group shares through its wholly owned subsidiary YeboYethu Investment at a discount of R510 million assuming a Vodacom Group share
  price of R152.50.

These shares are treated as treasury shares on a consolidated level. In addition, this step results in an IFRS 2 charge as described below and an increase in the total number of
Vodacom Group shares in issue used for calculating dividend per share.

4.1 The proposed BEE transaction gives rise to the following assumed IFRS 2 charges:

- A non-recurring share-based payment charge of R2 743 million, relating to YeboYethu shareholders, excluding the Vodacom ESOP; and
- A total recurring share-based payment charge of R1 502 million, relating to Vodacom ESOP, which will be recognised in tranches over the vesting period of five years.

Accordingly, the pro forma financial effects assumes a charge of R3 059 million, consisting of the non-recurring charge, and one year's vesting charge net of tax of R77 million, in
relation to the Vodacom ESOP component.

Of the total IFRS 2 charge of R4 245 million, R885 million relates to a cash-settled share-based payment arrangement. On initial recognition, the liability relating to the Vodacom
ESOP and the Innovator Trust will be measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation based option pricing model. The value of the liability will be re-measured at each
reporting period based on changes to the various valuation inputs.

The abovementioned share-based payment charges have been calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation based option pricing model. The economic substance of the proposed
BEE transaction mimics that of a call option, with the value of the outstanding debt at the maturity date of the transaction as the strike price of the option. A total IFRS 2 charge of
R4 245 million has been determined for this transaction at inception. The assumptions used in this model for purposes of the pro forma financial effects include:

- Vodacom SA fair value;
- 114 754 098 new Vodacom Group shares;
- Vodacom Group assumed share price of R152.50;
- Volatility of 22.17%, calculated using historical share price information;
- Expected costs to escalate by 6% per annum;
- Expected dividend yields of between 5% and 6%; and
- A risk free rate of a zero-coupon South African Rand interest rate swap curve as at the valuation date using a raw interpolation bootstrapping algorithm and the South African
  money-market rates and swap rates as input.

4.2 The calculation of diluted earnings and diluted headline earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue, increased by the number of shares to
be issued for no consideration under the proposed BEE transaction. The assumed number of dilutive shares of 40 849 281 is based on an assumed issue of 114 754 098 Vodacom
Group shares, assumed proceeds based on the outstanding preference share funding and the value of services to be provided by employees in the future and an average market
price of the Vodacom Group share over the reporting period of R159.03.

4.3 The net assumed cash proceeds of R2 434 million is assumed to earn interest at an average rate of 6.44% percent, before taxation, which interest saving thereon is of a
continuing nature.

4.4 Once-off transaction costs of R157 million including VAT (non tax deductible) (inclusive of the transaction costs in Step 6) are assumed to be settled in cash and have been
expensed in profit or loss.

The pro forma financial effects based on the final pricing information will be included in the circular to be posted to Vodacom Group shareholders.

9. Suspensive conditions

The implementation of the proposed BEE transaction is subject to the fulfilment or (where applicable) waiver of the following suspensive conditions on or before the day before the
end of the current ""lock-in period"" in the YeboYethu memorandum of incorporation, currently being 7 October 2018, or such later date as may be agreed between Vodacom Group
and YeboYethu (the ""long stop date""):

- that on the pricing date the 60-day VWAP of a Vodacom Group share is equal to or greater than R140 and less than or equal to R165. If this is not the case, the parties may request
  for the pricing date to be delayed to consult as to whether the terms of the proposed BEE transaction can be amended such that the parties will proceed nonetheless. If
  agreement cannot be reached within 15 business days from the pricing date, and following such consultation (i) the price is still not within such range; and (ii) one of the parties
  does not want to proceed, this suspensive condition will fail;
- the requisite majority of Vodacom Group shareholders approving all the resolutions required to effect the proposed BEE transaction;
- the requisite majority of YeboYethu shareholders approving all the resolutions required to effect the proposed BEE transaction;
- filing of an amendment to, and/or replacement of, Vodacom SA's memorandum of incorporation, in a form acceptable to YeboYethu and Vodacom Group, which includes those
  amendments required to give effect to the proposed BEE transaction;
- filing of an amendment to, and/or replacement of, YeboYethu's memorandum of incorporation, in a form acceptable to Vodacom SA, YeboYethu and Vodacom Group, which
  includes those amendments required to give effect to the proposed BEE transaction;
- filing of an amendment to, and/or replacement of, the YeboYethu ESOP's trust deed and scheme rules, in a form acceptable to YeboYethu, Vodacom Group and the YeboYethu
  ESOP, which includes those amendments required to give effect to the proposed BEE transaction;
- the proposed BEE transaction agreements being concluded and becoming unconditional in accordance with their terms;
- the funding agreements being concluded and becoming unconditional in accordance with their terms; and
- all regulatory consents being received on an unconditional basis or, to the extent that any such regulatory consents are subject to any condition or qualification, the party or
  parties adversely affected by the condition or qualification confirming in writing to the other/s that the condition or qualification is acceptable to it or them, which confirmation
  shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Apart from these suspensive conditions, each specific agreement contemplated in the steps outlined above contains its own suspensive conditions that must be fulfilled prior to it
becoming enforceable, which specific transaction conditions must be fulfilled on or before 15 October 2018, or such later date as may be agreed between Vodacom Group and
YeboYethu (the ""specific conditions date""). The specific transaction conditions include the fact that all prior steps should have become unconditional and have been implemented
and that Vodacom Group in certain circumstances has given written notice confirming that all of the suspensive conditions and steps prior to the relevant agreement have been
fulfilled and/or implemented in accordance with the implementation agreement.
Vodacom Group and YeboYethu, may by way of written agreement, and provided that non-compliance therewith would not constitute a breach of law by any of the parties, waive
any of the above general suspensive conditions. Any waiver of the general proposed BEE transaction conditions must occur on or before the long stop date, and any waiver of the
specific transaction conditions must occur before the date upon which the last of the general transaction conditions are fulfilled or waived.

10. Further documentation
Further details will be provided post the pricing date including a detailed transaction timetable.
A circular containing details of the proposed BEE transaction and a notice of general meeting will be posted to Vodacom Group shareholders, the date of which posting is
anticipated to be during July 2018.

Vodacom Group CEO commented:
SHAMEEL JOOSUB

Our sustained investment in customer and network experience across our operations was a major factor in attracting the additional 4.5 million customers in South Africa 
and 2.5 million internationally. Safaricom added 1.4 million customers to push the combined total to over 103 million customers. Securing an outright Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
lead over competitors in all our operations is another key milestone attained this year.

Despite a tougher economic environment in South Africa, 'Big Data' led innovations contributed to robust demand for personalised bundles and a 4.9% growth in service revenue.
Strong device sales, cost optimisation measures and the effective execution of our pricing transformation programme also played a major role in the sound commercial
performance in our largest market.

This was a solid achievement given the revenue impact from reducing out-of-bundle data prices by as much as 50% in October last year as well as the early phase investments in
new revenue streams, including fibre, content propositions and financial services. Over the past three years, we have reduced effective voice and data prices by 36.3% and 42.5%
respectively, while maintaining revenue growth. Our accelerated rural coverage programme was instrumental in Vodacom becoming the continent's first operator to reach 80%
population coverage on a 4G network.

In our International operations, it was a particularly pleasing year for Mozambique and Lesotho, while our commercial actions in Tanzania and DRC continue to show good
momentum. This portfolio produced a 7.4%* increase in normalised service revenue on the back of rising customer numbers, strong demand for data and the accelerated uptake of
M-Pesa. Despite a turbulent political context, Safaricom delivered net profit growth of 14.1% for the year. This was underpinned by strong growth in data and M-Pesa revenues and a
5.1% increase in customers to 29.6 million. Safaricom contributed R1.5 billion profit for the eight months since acquisition, after deducting the amortisation of fair valued assets
and before minority interest.

Revenue from mobile money has become a significant contributor to the Group. The combined customer base, including Safaricom, grew 11.5% in the past year and now exceeds
32.3 million. During this period, the M-Pesa platform in our International operations, processed transactions worth USD1.9 billion, generating a 19.6% increase in M-Pesa revenue to
R2.3 billion. In addition, Safaricom showed impressive results processing USD6.5 billion worth of transactions for the year and grew M-Pesa revenue by 14.2% to KES63 billion.

Our investment and efforts to drive revenue diversification and digital transformation across the Group are having the desired effect. Changing the way we operate, means we are
well positioned to drive new and exciting growth opportunities as we seek to change people's lives through building a connected society.

Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the renewed economic and political stability in South Africa and larger International operations, including Kenya. Our operations benefit from 
stability in foreign exchange and macro-economic environments and this is expected to bring a greater degree of predictability to the results across our markets.

We are encouraged by these developments and are reaffirming our three year targets(1) of mid-single digit service revenue growth, mid-to-high single digit EBIT growth and capital
intensity of 12% - 14% of Group revenue, to build on this momentum.

(1.) These targets are on average, over the next three years and are on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases and any merger and acquisition
     activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory environments. Excluding effects from IFRS 15 and IFRS 16
     implementation.

Operating review

South Africa

South Africa delivered robust performance, despite ongoing data pricing transformation and a low economic growth environment. Service revenue increased 4.9% to R54.6 billion,
supported by strong customer additions, a higher contribution from data revenue and growth in enterprise services. Revenue grew strongly by 8.1% to R70.0 billion, as a result of
equipment revenue growth of 15.2%, underpinned by smart device sales which constitute 70.0% of total devices sold, in-line with our strategy of driving the uptake of smart
devices.

We continue to see positive outcomes from our segmented acquisition strategy. Our Youth proposition, NXTLVL, has now attracted over 3.3 million new and existing Youth
customers. The expansion of our new Siyakha platform is helping improve the lives of customers, through products such as zero rated career portals, Facebook Flex, free health
information for expectant mothers and prepaid funeral cover. These propositions, supported by personalised value offers through our 'Just 4 You' platform have seen us attracting
4.5 million new customers this year, closing at 41.6 million, up 12.1%. Prepaid customers increased 4.3 million, up 13.4%, supporting the 6.4% prepaid customer revenue growth.
We added 229 000 contract customers. Progress on our pricing transformation strategy has resulted in short-term pressure on contract ARPU, which declined 4.4% to R390. This
was as a result of higher roll over of unused data bundles as we continue to migrate customers to 'more value' contracts, with 43.4% of the base now signed up for these contracts.
ARPU was also impacted by changes in deal structures in the first half of the year, and a reduction of the out-of-bundle data rates in October 2017.

Our industry leading application of Big Data and machine learning, created to deliver personalised bundle offers based on customer behaviour, continues to differentiate us from
our competitors. Through our 'Just 4 You' platform we have accelerated the uptake of bundle offers, driving the sale of 2.3 billion bundles in the year, up 51.3%. Of these, 62.2% of
bundle purchases are made through the platform. Customers using bundles have grown 13.9% to 18.7 million.

Data revenue grew strongly at 12.8% to R23.4 billion, contributing 42.8% of service revenue. This represents strong growth as we transform pricing for customers by reducing
out-of-bundle spend. This was achieved by improving customer data usage notifications, reducing of out-of-bundle rates by as much as 50%, and introducing more value offers on
our contract plans. In the second half, 12% of data revenue was out-of-bundle revenue, down from 22% in the first half last year. Data traffic growth remains robust at 43.7%. This
was enabled through growing our data network coverage and capacity as well as focussing our device strategy on increasing 3G and 4G device uptake. 4G customers on our
network increased 44.8% to 7.3 million, while the average megabyte per smart device increased 18.4% to 784MB. Our bundle strategy continues to resound well with our
customers, who have a choice of buying appropriate bundles based on validity period or size to suit their needs. Data bundle purchases increased 54.7% to 766 million. Improved
in-bundle usage has helped us to reduce the overall effective price per megabyte by 21.6% this year.

Enterprise service revenue grew 10.8% now contributing 25.7% of service revenue. Mobile enterprise customer revenue was flat, as the upgrade cycle on the government tender
awarded to Vodacom in October 2016 progressed well, while new sign ups to compensate for the greater discount were slower than originally anticipated. We expect this trend to
improve in the year ahead. Service revenue growth from fixed services increased 55.6%, driven by the inclusion of wholesale transit revenue (a new low margin business), 
connectivity revenue and cloud and hosting services.

EBITDA grew 4.7% to R28.1 billion and delivered a margin of 40.1%. We have contained inflationary pressures on operating expenses, through cost saving initiatives under our 'Fit
for growth' programme, maintaining total operating expense growth of 2.1%, which is 2.8ppts below service revenue growth. EBITDA margins have however contracted 1.3ppts,
impacted by the roaming agreement with Rain diluting margins by 0.7ppts, as we move cost of capacity to direct expenses from depreciation; the increased contribution from lower
margin handset sales has impacted margin by 0.8ppts. EBIT growth of 2.6% was below EBITDA growth as a result of higher growth in depreciation and amortisation costs, in line with
our capital expenditure guidance to deliver our network leadership position.

Our capital expenditure of R8.9 billion was focused on widening our network coverage, improving network performance to support increased data demand and enhancing overall
customer experience. Significant investment was made in our IT systems with deep machine learning capabilities aimed at providing a seamless and personalised customer
experience, enabling us to deliver on our strategic ambition of being the leading digital telco in South Africa. We have extended our 3G population coverage to 99.4% and 4G
coverage to 80.1%, up from 75.8% a year ago. Vodacom is now the first African operator to extend 4G coverage to more than 80% of its population.

International
Service revenue increased by 0.3%, with strong normalised growth of 7.4%* to R16.8 billion with pleasing growth in our strategic focus areas of data and M-Pesa. Reported numbers
have been impacted by the strengthening of the Rand against each country's currency.

Tanzania continued to execute on its strategy, delivering good revenue and customer growth despite a highly competitive environment. We have continued to invest in enhanced
registration processes and to suspend customers until they update personal registration details, as required by law. Mozambique and Lesotho delivered strong results supported by
good execution in monetising growing demand in data and M-Pesa, while performance in the DRC has improved as the currency and economic environment began stabilising in the
second half of the year. Our focus on improving customer experience by addressing points of detraction has resulted in NPS leadership in all markets, in line with our strategy of
providing the best customer experience.

We added 2.5 million customers for the year, up 8.6% to 32.2 million. This was supported by good customer growth in the DRC, up 13.8%, recovering to levels seen prior to the
disconnections done in 2016 in compliance with customer registration requirements, while Mozambique grew customers by 18.7%.

Data revenue grew strongly by 12.0% (18.7%*). We continue to make excellent progress in meeting the growing demand for data, by expanding our data networks to new areas and
constantly improving the network experience in high demand areas such as major towns and cities. We are actively driving access to more affordable smart devices, especially
Vodacom-branded devices resulting in smartphone adoption rates increasing to 31.9%. Our digital social media partnerships, as well as bundled offers through 'Just 4 You' allowed
us to tailor targeted data propositions to better monetise the data demand, all of which resulted in an increase of 3.6 million data customers, to 16.6 million up 27.5%. Data
monetisation remains a key focus area in all markets as demand grows rapidly.

M-Pesa revenue grew strongly by 19.6% (30.4%*) to R2.3 billion, contributing 13.8% of International service revenue. We added 1.8 million customers1 for the year, reaching 11.8
million. We continuously add new services to the platform expanding consumers' payment options. In Tanzania, we have introduced Lipa-Kwa, our merchant payment solution,
which is showing very strong merchant take up. This platform gives customers the convenience to transact with M-Pesa at more points of sale. The equivalent of over USD160
million was transacted through this system this year. In Mozambique, we have expanded our agent network to more than 20 000 agents, while in DRC and Lesotho we continue to
incentivise customers to increase uptake. On average, USD1.9 billion was processed monthly through the M-Pesa system.

The EBITDA margin improved 2.0ppts, while EBIT increased 27.2% (26.5%*) to R2.1 billion, and EBIT margin expanded by 2.5ppts to 12.0%. We have entrenched a culture of strong
cost containment in all our operations, leveraging from programmes such as 'Fit for growth'. Improved revenue growth, savings on commissions from airtime purchases through
M-Pesa, continued savings in network operating expenses, and improving foreign exchange rates, are key drivers for margin growth.

Capital expenditure of R2.7 billion was focused on improving customer experience on our networks by extending voice and data coverage, improving data network speeds and
investing in Business Intelligence tools to drive growth. We rolled out additional 4G sites in Tanzania and Lesotho and expanded 3G coverage in DRC and Mozambique. As part of our
digital transformation, we continue to invest in enhancing our IT systems to support our personalised pricing offers and to deliver on our segmentation strategy.

(1.) 30-day active M-Pesa customers.

Safaricom
During the year, we concluded our acquisition of a 34.94% indirect stake in Safaricom, the number one mobile operator in Kenya. In the eight months since acquisition, Safaricom
has contributed a profit of R1.5 billion which represents the net amount of earnings from Safaricom of R1.9 billion and an amortisation charge of R383 million in relation to fair
valued assets and before minority interest.

Safaricom finished the year with great momentum, reporting annual service revenue growth of 10.0% to KES225 billion and EBIT growth of 12.6% (18.3% excluding a one-off
adjustment in the prior year relating to KES 3.4 billion excise duty refund) to KES79 billion. Underpinning the results was strong expansion of Safaricom's customer base by 5.1% to
29.6 million customers. Strong growth in both data and M-Pesa revenue continues as data customers increased by 6.2% to 17.7 million customers, and 30-day active M-Pesa
customers increased 8.0% to 20.5 million. M-Pesa revenue grew 14.2% while data revenue grew by 24.0%. M-Pesa revenue contributed 28.0% to service revenue, while data
revenue contributed 16.2% to service revenue. Investment in capital expenditure of KES36.4 billion resulted in 3G sites increasing 18.9% and 4G sites increasing 49.4% year on
year.

Regulatory matters

Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA Bill)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services (Ministry) published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. On 17 November 2017, the Department of
Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) gazetted amendments to the Electronic Communications Act as a Bill, the first step to giving effect to the White Paper.
Disappointingly, the amendments did not fully reflect proposals previously submitted by the industry. As part of a public participation process, affected parties submitted
comments on the ECA Bill, to the Ministry on 31 January 2018, and participated in public hearings on 6 and 7 March 2018. Our submissions reiterated our support for a hybrid
model, establishing a competitive wholesale open access network (WOAN) alongside the assignment of spectrum to the current players. On the basis of an independent economic
impact assessment, we also noted the negative impacts the draft legislation could have on investment in the sector, GDP growth and job creation. The Ministry will consider all
submissions before submitting a revised Bill to cabinet for approval to be tabled in Parliament for further consultation and debate.

Amendment to End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 30 April 2018, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) published final amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations,
with the main objective to address consumer concerns with regard to out of bundle charges and expiry rules. The final amendments follow a consultation process between ICASA
and industry stakeholders. The salient points of the new regulations are as follows:

- Bundle depletion notices are to be sent to customers at 50%, 80% and 100% depletion
- Operators are not allowed to default to out-of-bundle charges on depletion of bundles, unless specific opt-in from the customer is obtained
- Operators should allow customers the option to roll over unused data before expiry and also provide customers with an option to transfer data to another customer on the same
  network

The regulation will take effect from 8 June 2018.

ICASA priority market review

In June 2017, ICASA gave notice of its intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECS). The purpose of the enquiry is to
identify relevant wholesale and retail markets or market segments in the ECS that are generally prone to ex ante regulations, and to determine from these markets and market
segments those that the Authority intends to prioritise for market reviews and potential regulation. These studies are in line with similar processes in other markets around the
world. The final phase of the inquiry would be the publication of a findings document, which is expected in the second half of FY2019.

Competition Commission investigation into complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile communication services

On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government departments for the
period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020. Vodacom was selected as the preferred supplier on a non-exclusive basis after the other bidders were eliminated at different phases
of the competitive bidding process. The Competition Commission has initiated an investigation against Vodacom Group for alleged abuse of dominance in terms of section 8 of the
Competition Act. The tender process was initiated and controlled by National Treasury through strict governance procedures, and we are confident that we followed due process in
a fiercely contested and transparent bidding process.

United States Department of Commerce's denial order against ZTE

Following the denial order issued by the US Department of Commerce against ZTE, the Group is in the process of assessing the impact on its networks and implementing the
required contingency plans.

Outlook

Looking ahead, our strategy to become a leading digital company and empower a connected society remains a key focus. We anticipate that our investments in Big Data, digital
services platforms and sophisticated machine learning will increasingly allow us to provide customers with relevant propositions based on customers' needs. Our adoption and
application of this technology puts us at the forefront of global developments and remains a key differentiator to our competitors. In turn, this should continue to drive revenue and
customer growth across all markets.

We are encouraged by the renewed economic and political stability in South Africa and larger International operations, including Kenya. Stability in foreign exchange and
macroeconomic environments benefits our operations and is expected to support more predictable results across our operations. However, unexpected volatility in political
environment, economic growth, currency and regulatory uncertainty continue to pose a risk.

In South Africa, we will continue to manage the process for pricing transformation in data. The priority is to manage out-of-bundle exposure in accordance with ICASA's recently
published End-user and Subscriber Service Charter regulation, effectively improving the cost to communicate for customers. We will manage this change through increased
elasticity, driven by our content platforms, digital social media partnerships and increased penetration of data-capable devices.

Transforming our revenue into new verticals, such as content, fibre, financial services and digital services, will also be a focal point. These services are complimentary to traditional
revenue streams such as voice, messaging and data, but also to further leverage our strong brand, reach and reputation in the countries where we operate.

In our International operations, we continue to focus on data monetisation and growing financial services, through M-Pesa. The opportunity for growth in both these revenues
streams is significant, while we introduce new services across our markets. M-Pesa is becoming a key driver of growth for us, with total M-Pesa customers now at 32.3 million
including Safaricom, which makes us the biggest mobile money operator across the continent. M-Pesa now contributes 13.8% to our service revenue in International, and 28.0% to
service revenue in Safaricom. We still see huge potential in getting all countries to the same level of sophistication as Safaricom and further growing M-Pesa capabilities.
Access to spectrum at reasonable market related pricing remains crucial in making communication services more affordable and delivering new technological advances to
customers in the countries where we operate. We are expecting progress in gaining access in South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania in the year ahead. We will engage
constructively in these processes with regulators and government to ensure a speedy and fair resolution for the industry at large.

We maintain our targets(1) for Group service revenue growth of mid-single digit growth, Group EBIT growth of mid-to-high single digit and capital intensity of 12% - 14% of Group
revenue over the next three years. For completeness, guidance from Safaricom is EBIT of KES85 - KES89 billion and capital expenditure of KES35 - KES38 billion for the year.

(1.) These targets are on average, over the next three years and are on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases and any merger and acquisition
     activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory environments. Excluding effects from IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 implementation.

Group service revenue increased 3.4% (5.1%*) to R70.6 billion, with strong underlying growth in both South Africa and International operations. Revenue growth accelerated to
6.3% (7.8%*) to R86.4 billion supported by a strong demand for high-end smart devices especially in South Africa.

In South Africa, service revenue increased 4.9% benefitting from growth in data revenue, net customer additions of 4.5 million boosting prepaid customer revenue and strong
enterprise revenue growth.

In our International operations, service revenue increased 0.3% (up 7.4%*). Growth came from strategic growth areas such as data and M-Pesa revenue as well as an increase in
customer net additions.
On an annual basis service revenue grew by 10.0% in Safricom, driven by growth in data and M-Pesa revenue.

Group total expenses increased 6.8% to R53.5 billion, which includes a foreign exchange gain of R56 million (2017: foreign exchange loss of R331 million).

In South Africa, we have maintained operating expenditure growth at 2.1% despite inflationary cost pressure. Direct expenses increased 14.6% as a result of higher equipment costs
(+14.0%), including costs related to our roaming agreement with Rain and increase in wholesale transit expenses (a new lower margin business area), excluding which direct
expenses grew by 5.6%. The remainder of the increase was as a result of commissions relating to the high volume of new prepaid connections during the year.

In our International operations, total expenses decreased by 2.3% (up 5.7%*) with continued focus on cost containment through initiatives such as 'Fit for growth' and moving
airtime purchases to M-Pesa, to reduce distribution cost, has assisted in keeping cost growth below revenue growth.

Net finance costs of R2.1 billion has remained relatively consistent as weighted average gross debt in the year was relatively unchanged and cost of debt was flat at 8.3%. The net
loss on remeasurement and disposal of financial instruments of R785 million increased mainly as a result of mark-to-market remeasurements on open forward exchange contracts
(FECs) in South Africa. This follows increased volumes of FECs in the second half of the year as handset orders increased and higher volatility in the USD/ZAR rates in the last
quarter of this year. This also includes net losses on the remeasurement of foreign cash balances across the Group.

Taxation

The tax expense of R6.5 billion was 7.0% higher than the prior year (2017: R6.1 billion). The Group's effective tax rate decreased from 31.7% in the prior year to 29.6%. This decrease
is primarily due to our share of Safaricom's after tax profits included in profit before tax (-1.9ppts) and the profit on sale of the HTT associate investment in Tanzania (-0.5ppts). In the
prior year, the effective tax rate was impacted by +1.4ppts for the Tanzanian capital allowance adjustment in relation to the disposal of network assets to HTT, which was not
repeated in the current year.

compensated for by our share of Safaricom's earnings (+94cps), net of the associated withholding tax and minority interest. The amortisation of other fair valued assets (net at minority interest), 
relating to the Safaricom acquisition, negatively impacted HEPS by 21cps. Excluding the effects from the intangible assets amortisation, HEPS increased 2.3%.

Statement of financial position

Property, plant and equipment increased 0.9% to R40.5 billion and intangible assets decreased 1.2% to R9.1 billion compared to 31 March 2017. The combined increase is mainly
as a result of net additions of R11.5 billion, offset by depreciation and amortisation of R10.0 billion and foreign currency translation loss of R1.3 billion.

Net debt decreased by R2.6 billion to R19.9 billion. Total borrowings increased by R916 million to R32.3 billion. Bank and cash balances increased by R3.7 billion mainly due to the
cash proceeds from the initial public offering in Vodacom Tanzania and the sale of HTT in Tanzania.

Operating free cash flow was up 8.0% as trading performance improved during this year, evidenced by EBITDA increasing 5.3%. Our cash conversion remains strong at 64.2% (2017:
62.6%) as we maintain strong working capital management. Free cash flow increased 24.5% or R2.8 billion mainly due to the dividend received from associate by Vodafone Kenya
Limited of R2.0 billion from Safaricom and the minority distribution which is reflected in net dividends paid. The movement in finance costs paid, relates mainly to realised net
losses incurred on close out of forward exchange contracts.

Dividend

The final dividend of 425 cents per share, reflects a dividend in line with policy.

The Board maintains its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of adjusted headline earnings which excludes the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom
and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, the Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend received,
net of withholding tax.

The Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining such sums and repaying such borrowings owing to third parties as shall be necessary to
meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan, taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement to
dividends arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE Listings Requirements.

8.     Acquisition of interest in Safaricom Limited (Safaricom) through Vodafone Kenya Limited (Vodafone Kenya)

       On 7 August 2017, the Group acquired 87.5% of Vodafone Kenya from Vodafone International Holdings B.V. (VIHBV). Vodafone Kenya holds a 39.93% stake in Safaricom, the
       Republic of Kenya's leading integrated communications company. The investment in Vodafone Kenya has been treated as an investment in a subsidiary in terms of IAS 27:
       Separate Financial Statements. As Vodafone Kenya is an investment holding company, with its only material asset being the associate investment in Safaricom, the
       transaction does not meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3: Business Combinations. The 39.93% equity interest that Vodafone Kenya holds in
       Safaricom has been equity accounted as an investment in an associate.

       The purchase consideration was settled by the issuance of 233 459 781 Vodacom Group Limited shares to the value of R42 618 million (net of directly attributable
       transaction costs of R3 million), measured based on the closing price of Vodacom Group Limited on the effective date, and, for the equity interest in Vodafone Kenya, a cash
       consideration of R51 million.

       VIHBV retained a non-controlling interest (NCI) of 12.5% in Vodafone Kenya, resulting in NCI of R6 104 million being recognised at the acquisition date, measured on a fair
       value basis.

       The fair value of the Group's investment in Safaricom, based on the listed closing share price as at 31 March 2018, was R57 748 million.

9.     Sale of investment in Helios Towers Tanzania Limited (Helios)

       Vodacom Tanzania Public Company Limited sold its 24.06% investment in Helios to Helios Towers Africa Holding Limited (HTA) during October 2017 for total cash proceeds
       of R797 million. This investment was included in non-current asset held for sale as at 31 March 2017. The sale resulted in a pre-tax profit on sale of R734 million being
       recognised. The remaining balance of loans receivable from Helios to the value of R42 million have also been sold to HTA.

10.    Borrowings

       During the current year, the Group modified two of the existing loan facilities received from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. (Vodafone Luxembourg). On 
       3 May 2017, R8 000 million and R4 000 million loan facilities were revised from variable interest rate loans to fixed interest rate loans. The loan facilities bear interest at fixed rates
       of 8.703% and 8.991% and are repayable on 26 November 2019 and 26 July 2021 respectively.

       Additionally, an existing fixed rate facility of R3 000 million was re-financed with a floating rate facility of R3 000 million at a rate of 3 month Jibar +1.50% with a repayment
       date of 24 May 2022.

       The Group also re-financed a R1 530 million facility on 24 November 2017 and increased the facility with an additional R1 000 million draw down. This R2 530 million loan
       bears interest at 3 month JIBAR plus 1.50% and is repayable on 24 November 2024.

11.    Contingent liabilities

11.1   Guarantees

       The Group has various guarantees in issue, relating to external financial obligations of its subsidiaries, which amounted to R116 million (31 March 2017: R119 million).

       Foreign denominated guarantees amounting to R889 million (31 March 2017: R1 005 million) are in issue in support of Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA relating to liabilities
       included in the consolidated statement of financial position.

11.2   Tax matters

       The Group is regularly subject to an evaluation by tax authorities of its direct and indirect tax filings. The consequence of such reviews is that disputes can arise with tax
       authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules to the Group's business. These disputes may not necessarily be resolved in a manner that is favourable
       to the Group. In addition, the resolution of the disputes could result in obligations to the Group. The Group has made sufficient provision for any losses arising from potential
       tax exposures that are more likely to occur than not.

11.3   Legal contingencies

       The Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has, in consultation with its legal counsel, assessed the outcome of these proceedings. Following this
       assessment, the Group's management has determined, that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal proceedings as at 31 March 2018.

11.4   Kenneth Makate (Mr Makate) vs Vodacom (Pty) Limited

       Negotiations in accordance with the Constitutional Court order to determine a reasonable compensation for Mr Makate for a business idea that led to a product known as
       'Please Call Me' have deadlocked and the matter has been referred to the Group's Chief Executive Officer to determine reasonable compensation in accordance with the
       Constitutional Court order.


12.    Other matters

12.1   Competition Commission investigations

12.1.1 Competition complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile communications services

       On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government departments in
       South Africa. The tender was awarded to the Group, for the period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020, after an open and transparent process. The Competition
       Commission has initiated an investigation against the Group under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act, which is ongoing.

12.1.2 Facilities leasing and roaming agreements between Vodacom (Pty) Limited (the Company) and Rain Networks (Pty) Limited (Rain) (previously Wireless Business 
       Solutions (Pty) Limited)

       A number of the Group's competitors lodged complaints with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) and the Competition Commission relating
       to the facilities leasing and roaming arrangements with Rain. On 25 April 2018, the Competition Commission ruled that these arrangements did not constitute a merger and
       that the transaction was not notifiable as contemplated in section 13A(1) of the Competition Act, Act 89 of 1998. ICASA's investigation, on the other hand, is still ongoing.

12.2   G.H. Investments (GHI) and Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA (Vodacom Congo)

       Vodacom Congo contracted GHI to install ultra-low cost base stations on a revenue share basis. Shortly after rolling out the first sites GHI sought to renegotiate the
       contractual terms, which Vodacom Congo declined. GHI then accused Vodacom Congo of infringing its intellectual property rights and demanded payment of
       compensation in the sum of US$1.16 billion. In July 2016, Vodacom Congo filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce's International Court
       of Arbitration (ICC). GHI failed to pay its share of the arbitration fees to the ICC, resulting in the matter being struck out from the ICC roll.

12.3   Mr Puati vs Vodacom Congo

       A patent infringement claim was filed in July 2016 against Vodacom Congo. The plaintiff was asking the Commercial Court of Kinshasa/Gombe, inter alia, to prohibit
       Vodacom Congo from providing the M-Pesa service and to order Vodacom Congo to pay damages in excess of USD200 million for losses resulting from the alleged patent
       infringement. On 22 November 2017, the Commercial Court issued a judgment in favour of Vodacom Congo, barring the action and claim that the plaintiff had initiated against
       Vodacom Congo.

12.4   Customer registration

       The Group has made considerable strides in complying with customer registration requirements in all its markets in line with applicable laws. In Tanzania, significant
       measures are being taken to achieve full compliance. The Group will maintain full compliance with customer registration requirements in markets where it has already been
       achieved.

12.5   Radio frequency spectrum licences

       On 30 September 2016 the Pretoria High Court granted an application by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services (the Ministry) interdicting ICASA from
       implementing the spectrum licensing process contemplated in the Invitation to Apply (ITA) for the licensing of spectrum in the 700MHz, 800MHz and 2600MHz bands,
       pending the outcome of a judicial review on the lawfulness of the ICASA ITA.

12.6   Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (ECA bill)

       On 17 November 2017, the Ministry, published an invitation to provide comments on the ECA bill, having its origins in the Integrated information and communication
       technology ICT Policy White Paper of 2 October 2016. Stakeholders made representations to the Ministry at public hearings held on 6 and 7 March 2018. After considering
       comments submitted and presentations at hearings, the Ministry will soon submit the ECA bill for adoption by Cabinet and later table it in Parliament.

12.7   ICASA priority market review

       In June 2017, ICASA published a notice of intention to conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act. The purpose of the study is to
       identify markets to be prioritised for a potential market review. The final phase of the inquiry would be the publication of a findings document, which is expected in the
       second half of 2019.

12.8   Amendment to End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

       On 30 April 2018, ICASA published final amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations, which will take effect on 8 June 2018, with the main
       objective to address consumer concerns with regard to out-of-bundle charges and expiry rules. The final amendments follows a consultation process between ICASA and
       industry stakeholders. The salient points of the new regulations are as follows:

       - Bundle depletion notices are to be sent to customers at 50%, 80% and 100% depletion;
       - Operators are not allowed to default to out-of-bundle charges on depletion of bundles, unless specific opt-in from the customer is obtained; and
       - Operators should allow customers the option to roll over unused data before expiry and also provide customers with an option to transfer data to another customer on
         the same network.

12.9   Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company (Vodacom Tanzania)

       In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed the Finance Act, 2016 which amends listing requirements under the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010
       (EPOCA), to introduce mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their authorised share capital through an initial
       public offering (IPO) on the Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).

       On 15 August 2017, Vodacom Tanzania listed on the Main Investment Market Segment (MIMS) of the DSE under the ticker VODA, and became the first telecommunications
       operator to comply with these regulatory changes. The listing was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the 19-year history of the DSE, and raised net proceeds after
       underwriting costs of R2 770 million (TZS470 billion).

       The Group has entered into an agreement with its local Tanzanian partner, Mirambo Limited (Mirambo), and certain of Mirambo's shareholders, under the terms of which the
       Group will acquire all of Mirambo's 588 million shares in Vodacom Tanzania. This will result in the Group increasing its total interest in Vodacom Tanzania from 61.6% to
       75%. The transaction close is subject to conditions precedent, including requisite regulatory approvals in Tanzania.

12.10 Mobile termination rates (MTR)

       Regulators in Tanzania and Mozambique cut termination rates this year, with industry submissions and a new cost study in Mozambique leading to a positive outcome
       where the regulator revised MTRs upward with retrospective effect, and set a revised glide path to 2020. In Tanzania, the Group has filed an appeal against the regulator's
       new five year glide path with the Fair Competition Commission on the grounds that new MTRs were modelled using data that was not representative of actual costs incurred
       by operators and the glide path sets MTRs below cost. In South Africa, ICASA is in the process of constructing cost models that will inform MTRs to be applied from 
       October 2018.

12.11 Vodacom Congo

       Vodacom Congo is not in compliance with the minimum capital requirements as set out under the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).
       Vodacom Congo has to increase its share capital to meet the minimum OHADA requirements. The Board and shareholders of Vodacom Congo are in negotiations to address
       the recapitalisation of the company.

12.12 Unwind of Vodacom (Pty) Limited Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) deal

       In 2008, the Group facilitated a BEE ownership transaction (the BEE transaction) through the sale of an effective 6.25% in the issued share capital of Vodacom (Pty) Limited
       (Vodacom SA) to Royal Bafokeng Holdings, Thebe Investment Corporation and YeboYethu (RF) Limited through notional vendor finance (NVF). The NVF maturity date for the
       BEE transaction is 30 September 2018. The Group is currently in the process of negotiating a new BEE transaction.

Notes:
(1.) Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles
     them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
(2.) Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have
     access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a
     contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
(3.) Internet of Things connections (IoT), is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
     customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
(4.) Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls, but
     excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
(5.) Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during the period.
(6.) Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service
     revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
(1.) A customer is defined as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), or in territories where SIMs do not exist, a unique mobile telephone number, which has access to the network for
     any purpose (including data only usage) except telemetric applications.
(2.) Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have
     access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a
     contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the month reported.
(3.) Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 30 days.
(4.) ARPU is calculated by dividing the average total service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period.

Note:
(1.) During the 2nd quarter we reclassified the foreign exchange difference between USD and CDF sales to be netted off on the corresponding revenue line. The adjustment was
     USD11.4 million for Q1 and USD4.4 million for Q2. Q1 has not been restated for this change. This was partially offset by a refund of DRC sales tax (ICA) of USD9.9 million, in Q2.

The reconciliation presents normalised growth adjusted for trading foreign exchange gains/losses and at a constant currency (using current period as base) from on-going
operations.
Notes:
(1.) The reported percentage change relates to the year-on-year percentage growth. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations
     utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing
     exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.
(2.) Trading foreign exchange (FX) are foreign exchange gains/losses on foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulting from trading activities of entities within
     the Group.
(3.) Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being
     rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the year ended 31 March 2018 (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated
     rand value with the functional currency for the period) to 31 March 2017 numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange variances. The
     prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.
(4.) The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International
     operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The
     prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.

Corporate information

Additional financial and operational measures
This announcement contains certain financial (i.e. service revenue, enterprise service revenue, EBITDA and EBIT) and operational (i.e. customers, ARPUs and number of employees)
measures which are presented in addition to the financial information disclosed in the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements and the audited financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 which have been prepared in terms of IFRS. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional
information in understanding the performance of the Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. However, this
additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled
measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, although these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed in isolation or
as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as complementary to, the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements and the audited financial statements for the
year ended 31 March 2018. The financial measures have been extracted from the management accounts upon which the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements
and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 are based. Refer above for details relating to service revenue, EBIT and headline earnings per share
and the supplementary information on pages above for a reconciliation thereof to the reported results included in this announcement.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:
Our strategy of sustained investment into our network and improving customer experience has delivered solid gains in customer
numbers in South Africa, and driven growth in our International operations, resulting in stronger growth in Group revenue of 6.7%.
In South Africa, our customer base grew 14.4% to 41.6 million, contributing to the 6.2% increase in revenue, underpinned by a resilient
pre-paid voice market and a highly successful summer campaign.

During the quarter we delivered on our promise to reduce out-of-bundle data prices, evidence of our commitment to reduce the cost-
to-communicate through our pricing transformation journey; this resulted in a 24.2% decline in effective data prices for the year. In
order to compensate for the expected shortfall in revenue, we have undertaken a range of initiatives to stimulate usage. Monthly trends
towards the end of the quarter show that this is having the desired effect.

Driven by strong customer growth, a solid performance from M-Pesa and sustained demand for data, our International operations
continue to gain momentum. Data revenue grew 19.5%, supported by our strategy to increase smartphone penetration through
improved device affordability. Further new services contributed to a 33.3% jump in revenue from the M-Pesa mobile money platform.
Growth was further supported by an 11% increase in customers, resulting in revenue from International increasing by 9.3%, a third
consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

On the regulatory front in South Africa, we will be submitting a detailed response to the Department of Telecommunications and
Postal Services (DTPS) regarding its proposed amendments to the Electronic Communications Act. We remain of the opinion that a
hybrid between what is currently in place and the proposed Wholesale Open Access Network (WOAN) addresses the government's
transformation mandate and will have a greater impact on driving down the cost to communicate for customers compared with the
proposed amendments to the Electronic Communications Act (ECA).

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue increased 4.9% to R14.1 billion, supported by gains in prepaid customers and strong growth in other service revenues.
We continued to see strong customer growth, adding 1.6 million customers in the quarter as we attracted new customers through our
bundle and segmentation strategy. We added 1.5 million prepaid customers during the quarter, with prepaid active customers up 16.3%
year on year. The increased customer base has supported prepaid customer revenue growth of 6.8%. Contract customers increased by
81k, which was strong despite slower sign-up of new departments as part of the government tender that we won in September 2016.
Contract ARPU declined 5.1% to R393, an improvement in the trend from Q2. This improvement reflects the rebalancing of contract
deals, by reducing discounts on subscriptions. This was partly offset by higher roll over of unused data bundles as we continue with the
migration of customers to 'more data' contracts, as well as the revenue effects from the reduction of out-of-bundle data rates.

Data revenue grew by 8.7% (Q2: 12.2%) to R6.0 billion, contributing 42.3% of service revenue. Data customer growth of 6.4% was
strong, adding 598k customers in the quarter. Data traffic growth remains robust at 43.9%, slightly down from the previous quarter as
a result of commercial steps taken to reduce free data usage, following the end of promotional offers during the quarter. Our bundle
strategy continues to deliver growth with in-bundle data revenue growth trends improving, supported by growth in bundle sales of
53.8%. In a continued effort to improve customer experience and exposure to out-of-bundle data revenues, we reduced out-of-bundle
data prices by as much as 50% from 1 October 2017. The slowdown in data revenue growth in Q3 was driven by these lower out-
of-bundle data revenues, reflecting the reduction in these rates, as well as continuous improvement in moving customers to more
affordable bundles aligned with customer usage. We note an improvement in the in-quarter growth trend, with December growth
recovering to >13% providing evidence that elasticity is returning, supported by commercial actions such as price adjustments on data
bundles. Overall effective price per megabyte was down 24.5%.

Enterprise service revenue grew 9.7% now contributing 25.5% of service revenue, supported by increases in wholesale revenue and
fixed service revenue. Fixed service revenue growth was strong at 23.6%, driven by connectivity revenue and cloud and hosting services.

We continue to invest heavily into communication infrastructure in South Africa, both to increase the reach of our data and voice services 
and also to service the growing demand for data. During this quarter, our capital expenditure of R2.3 billion was focused on maintaining our 
best network advantage, as well as enhancing our IT systems and deep learning machine capabilities. Our market leading network has now reached 
77.6% 4G population coverage, while 3G covers 99.4% of the population.

International

Service revenue increased by 8.7% (+8.1%*) to R4.6 billion in the quarter, a third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. This was
underpinned by strong growth in both data and M-Pesa revenue.

Growth trends in our International operations continued to improve in the quarter. Tanzania continues to deliver on its turnaround
strategy with good revenue and customer growth while we continued our efforts to improve customer registration processes.
Mozambique and Lesotho have made solid progress on their strategic priorities of M-Pesa and data growth, delivering excellent
momentum, while performance in the DRC has improved as the currency and economic environment starts to stabilise.

We added 920k customers in the three months, up 11.2% to 32.0 million, supported by good customer growth both in the DRC and
Mozambique.

Data revenue grew by 19.5%, supported by an increase of 1.3 million data customers in the quarter, to 16.0 million (+26.9%).
Delivery on our device strategy of providing customers with access to better low-cost smart devices, has enabled higher smartphone
penetration, resulting in increased data demand. We continue to focus on improving data monetisation in all markets as demand grows
rapidly.

M-Pesa revenue continued to accelerate at 33.3% to R653 million, contributing 14.3% of service revenue. We added 414 000 customers
in the quarter, reaching 14.4 million, with customers benefitting from the new M-Pesa platform that enables us to offer services
more seamlessly. We continue to grow the number of products on the M-Pesa platform, focusing on growing the merchant payment
system in Tanzania, as well as adding new services in all other markets such as bulk payments, which has helped fuel the increase in
transactions processed through the system. On average, 146 billion transactions were processed monthly through the M-Pesa system.

Capital expenditure of R630 million enabled us to continue strengthening our network and provide service differentiation to support 
wider voice coverage and meet the growing data demand by improving data network speeds and expanding data coverage. As part of our 
digital transformation, we continue to invest in enhancing our IT systems to support our personalised pricing offers and to deliver 
on our segmentation strategy.

Results for Vodacom's associate investment in Safaricom are disclosed on a bi-annual basis and therefore are not included in this
quarterly update.

Regulatory matters

South Africa Integrated Information and Communication Technology ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. On
17 November 2017, the DTPS gazetted amendments to the ECA, the first step to give effect to the White Paper. Disappointingly,
the amendments do not fully reflect proposals previously submitted by the industry. Affected parties and other role players have
been granted an extension for comment as part of a public participation process. These inputs need to be submitted to the DTPS by
31 January 2018. The ministry will consider all submissions before submitting a revised bill to cabinet for approval to be tabled in
parliament for further consultation and debate.

ICASA's intention to amend End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 2 August 2017, ICASA announced that it intends to review regulations on data billing and expiry period for data bundles. On 17
November 2017, ICASA published a second notice in which they proposed amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service
Charter Regulations in relation to data expiry rules and also out-of-bundle billing. The Group submitted its response to the intended
amendments on 3 January 2018. Public hearings are due to follow in February 2018.

ICASA priority market review

ICASA indicated that it will undertake a study to identify priority markets susceptible to ex ante regulations. Notice of intention to
conduct an inquiry to identify priority markets was published by ICASA in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act on 30 June 2017. It is
our understanding that ICASA intends to finalise the inquiry on or before 31 March 2018. We will be fully cooperating with ICASA in this
regard.

Competition Commission investigation into complaint on the National Treasury government transversal contract for mobile
communication services

On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and
provincial government departments for the period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020. Vodacom was selected as the preferred
supplier on a non-exclusive basis after the other bidders were eliminated at different phases of the well-governed, multi-tier bidding
process. The Competition Commission has launched an investigation into the aforementioned, under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the
Competition Act.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes
   customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those
   customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles used. Active data customers are based
   on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or
   who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A
   user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the
   reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices
   or a central station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
5. ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly customer service revenue and mobile interconnect revenue by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and
   outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls
   to free services.

   customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles used. Active data customers are based
   on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or
   who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A
   user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the
   reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices
   or a central station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
5. ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly customer service revenue and mobile interconnect revenue during the period by
   the average monthly active customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and
   outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls
   to free services.

Notes:

1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth between the quarter ended
   31 December 2016 and the quarter ended 31 December 2017. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our
   International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling,
   Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are
   disclosed below.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to
   Vodacom's presentation currency, being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the quarter ended 31 December
   2017 average rate (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the
   quarter) to the quarter ended 31 December 2016 numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes
   exchange rate variances. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative quarters are disclosed below.
3. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date quarter on quarter percentage growth between 30 September 2017

Interim Results for the six months ended 30 September 2017

Vodacom Group CEO commented
Shameel Joosub

13 November 2017

We concluded two key milestones during the first half of the year: Successfully acquiring a 34.94% strategic stake in Safaricom and completing the listing of a 25%
stake in Vodacom Tanzania. The listing, the largest IPO on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange since it launched 19 years ago, resulted in almost 40 000 Tanzanians
investing directly in capital markets for the first time.

In addition we delivered another good financial performance for the first six months of the financial year, despite weaker economic conditions in some of our key
markets, the Group increased normalised service revenue by 4.6%*, boosted by a strong increase in customer gains in South Africa and significant gains in data and
M-Pesa revenue internationally.

In South Africa, we gained 2.9 million customers to breach the 40 million mark for the first time. We now also have 3.3 million sim card connections in our Internet of
Things offerings. This growth in both areas shows that our segmented markets approach and the delivery of greater value through innovative personalised bundles is
continuing to produce results. An increase in smartphone device sales contributed to the 7.7% increase in revenue growth.

We have consistently said throughout the year that we would accelerate the reduction in data prices and address out-of-bundle prices. These are promises that we
have delivered on, with effective data prices decreased by 24.2% during the six-month period. On 1 October 2017 we further reduced out-of-bundle prices by up to
50%.

We have managed to do this while continuing to invest significantly in infrastructure at a time when the lack of available spectrum is pushing our costs higher.
Without new spectrum we are forced to build more base stations to meet data growth demand. Additional spectrum will allow us to invest more efficiently and
accelerate our rural coverage programme. Over the six month period, we invested R3.9 billion to maintain our network lead and enhance our IT systems.

Stripping out exchange rate volatility, our International operations continue to gain momentum as evidenced by the 5.5% growth in normalised service revenue and
the 1.4 million increase in customers to 31.1 million. Our investment in a new M-Pesa platform has had an immediate impact resulting in a 70.9% increase in
transactions and an average of R24 billion processed through the enhanced system on a monthly basis. We expect that the Safaricom transaction will further drive
M-Pesa development and penetration outside of South Africa. Efforts to drive down the cost of smart devices coupled with increased data speeds and wider coverage
contributed to normalised data revenue growth of 6.6%* in our International markets.

Looking ahead, our strategy to become a leading digital company and empower a connected society remains a key focus. We anticipate that our investments in big
data and sophisticated machine learning will increasingly allow us to provide customers with relevant Just 4 You propositions. In turn, this should continue to drive
revenue and customer growth across all markets.

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue increased 4.7% to R26.7 billion supported by strong customer gains and growth in data and enterprise services. Revenue growth was stronger at
7.7% to R33.9 billion, boosted by equipment revenue growth of 18.4%, reflecting the improved exchange rate to the US dollar that assisted in our continued strategy
of driving uptake of affordable smart devices. The sale of smartphones grew by 18.3%, comprising 59.5% of total device sales.

We added 2.9 million customers in the period, reaching 40.0 million, up 12.1% on the previous year, supported by our segmentation and bundle strategy. Prepaid
customers increased by 2.8 million to 34.8 million, up 13.4%, driven by the success of our improved value propositions through our 'Just 4 You' offers and customer
segmentation. Prepaid ARPU was down 6.5%, as a result of high volumes of low ARPU gross connections, driven by the distribution channels accelerating the
connection of sim cards ahead of implementation of improvements to customer registration processes. Underlying ARPU remains strong. Contract customers
increased by 107 000 in the first half, to 5.2 million. Migration to our new ""more data"" contracts, which have a larger data allocation, accelerated during this period to
25% of the base, to meet customers' demand for more data. Contract ARPU declined by 3.9% to R392 as a result of change in deal structures and due to a higher
rollover of unused bundle allocations, as customers grow into fully utilising these larger bundles over time and also reduce their exposure to out-of-bundle usage.

Our segmentation and bundle strategy continues to successfully address our customers' individual needs and usage behaviours. Our youth proposition (NXT LVL) has
reached over 2 million youth customers, while our Siyakha platform offers greater benefits to our emerging prepaid customers, such as free health and information
services for expectant mothers and prepaid funeral cover. Machine learning, is enabling us to customise bundle offers based on size, validity period and now with the
added sophistication of app-specific data. Total bundles sold increased 64.8% to almost 1.1 billion in the first half of the year. Of these, 800 million were voice
bundles, enabling us to reduce our effective price per minute by 10.9%. The success of the personalised voice bundle strategy through our 'Just 4 You' platform has
resulted in low voice revenue decline of 4.8%.

Data revenue grew 15.0% to R11.4 billion, contributing 42.6% of service revenue surpassing the contribution of voice revenue. This was slightly down in the second
quarter as a result of a strong comparative quarter and the introduction of promotional initiatives, such as Meg Your Day, to drive data uptake. Encouragingly, this has
enabled an expanding customer base and increased usage. We added 356 000 data customers to 19.9 million, up 9.6% or half of the mobile customer base. 4G
customers on our network increased 62.8% to 6.0 million, while the average monthly data usage on smart devices increased 19.5% to 776MB. Our pricing
transformation strategy and targeted personalised offers continue to provide customers with greater value. Our data bundle sales grew by 55.5% to 347 million. We
have introduced new initiatives to improve the customer experience on out-of-bundle-data spend, and are driving data-usage education to give customers more
control. Improved in-bundle usage has resulted in a 24.2% reduction in the effective price per MB.

Enterprise has delivered strong growth, with service revenue up 10.0% to R6.8 billion. Enterprise service revenue now contributes 25.3% (2017: 24.1%) of service
revenue. Our fixed-line services revenue increased 11.7%, underpinned by solid growth in connectivity revenue, cloud and hosting revenue and IPVPN revenue. We
are progressing with migrating customers from the mobile voice and data communications contract secured last year with South Africa's national and provincial
government departments, although this is at a slower rate than projected. Internet of Things (IoT) revenue was up 22.4% to R399 million as we continue to develop
innovative solutions in e-health, connected agriculture, smart metering and logistics. Our IoT customer base grew 24.6% to 3.3 million connections.

EBIT declined 2.2% to R9.9 billion, impacted by higher growth in depreciation and amortisation costs, as a result of a write back of depreciation of assets with nil book
value in the prior year, increased bad debt charges, following a temporary delay as we introduced new programs to make it easier for customers to settle outstanding
debt, and earlier phasing of publicity costs from our global brand refresh campaign. EBIT margin contraction of 2.9ppts to 29.2% was affected by the higher
contribution from low margin equipment sales, as well as the cost of our new roaming agreement with WBS.

Our capital expenditure of R3.9 billion was focused on maintaining our network lead; with widest coverage and fastest Internet, as well as enhancing our IT systems.
This enables us to provide truly segmented and personalised experiences for our customers, which is critical to delivering our strategic ambition of becoming a
leading digital company. Our continued investment in infrastructure resulted in 76.7% 4G and 99.3% 3G population coverage, compared with 68.7% 4G coverage a
year ago.

International

Normalised growth trends in our International operations continue to improve. Tanzania is delivering on its turnaround strategy accelerating revenue and customer
growth, while Mozambique and Lesotho executed on a number of commercial actions driving strong growth momentum. In the DRC, economic weakness and
decoupling of the Congolese Franc from the US dollar has impacted negatively on consumer spending. Exchange rate volatility continues to negatively impact
reported growth in our International operations.

We added 1.4 million customers in the first half, reaching 31.1 million, up 11.4%.

Service revenue declined by 4.8% to R8.3 billion in the first half; normalised for currency translation effects, growth was 5.5%*. Service revenue growth was further
underpinned by strong normalised growth in both data and M-Pesa revenue.

Data revenue(1) declined by 2.7%, with normalised growth of 6.6%*, supported by an increase of 1.8 million data customers, to14.8 million, up 23.3%. All markets
grew above 20% apart from the DRC. In addition to increasing data network speeds and improving data coverage, we have retained a strong focus on providing
customers with access to better low-cost smart devices, by promoting Vodacom-branded devices. This is enabling higher smartphone penetration in all our markets.
Data revenue comprised 13.6% (2017: 13.4%) of International operations' service revenue. We continue to focus on improving data monetisation in all markets as
demand grows rapidly.

M-Pesa revenue grew strongly at 14.0%, with normalised growth of 27.2%*. We added 1.1 million customers in the first half of the year, reaching 14.8 million2. The
new M-Pesa platform with enhanced technology has significantly improved stability, resulting in increased trust with customers and 70.9% more transactions
processed through the system. There has also been a steady uptake of our International Money Transfer services. During the first half of the year, on average, R24
billion was processed monthly through the M-Pesa system. Customer growth in all markets remains strong, with 56.0% of customers now using this service in
Mozambique, 35.3% in Lesotho and 22.2% in the DRC. Tanzania remains the leader in International operations with 61.7% of customers using M-Pesa.

EBIT increased 18.6% (2.2%*) to R988 million, while the EBIT margin expanded by 2.3ppts to 11.5%. Various actions to mitigate the impact of the slower revenue
growth in the prior year have helped to improve margins. The success of M-Pesa in all markets has resulted in savings in commission as more airtime is purchased
directly, thereby eliminating third party commissions. We are driving improved efficiencies, and continued savings in network operating expenses through our ""Fit for
growth"" savings programme which remains a key program to minimise cost growth impacts.

Capital expenditure of R1.5 billion enabled us to continue investing in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation and to support wider voice
coverage and data growth, with our 4G coverage in Tanzania expanded to more cities outside Dar es Salaam. As part of our digital transformation we have enhanced
our IT systems to support our personalised pricing offers and to deliver on our segmentation strategy.

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Vodacom Tanzania Board approved a plan to exit its investment in Helios Towers Tanzania Limited (HTT), given that it no
longer complimented its core business objectives. In February 2017, an agreement with HTA Holdings, LTD (HTA) was reached.

(1.) Mobile data revenue and M-Pesa revenue was previously reported in aggregate. These items are now separately disclosed.
(2.) Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 90 days, of these 10.8 million have been active in the past 30 days.

In October 2017, Vodacom Tanzania sold both its 24.06% equity stake and debt holding in HTT a passive infrastructure service provider, to HTT's parent, HTA for
USD58.5 million and USD2.7 million respectively.

The transfer of shares will result in an accounting profit from disposal of TZS 121 billion (c.R743 million) before tax.

Safaricom
During the period we concluded our acquisition of a 34.94% indirect stake in Safaricom, the number one mobile operator in Kenya. During the first two months,
Safaricom has contributed a profit of R349 million which represents the net amount of a profit from associate of R446 million and an amortisation charge, in relation
to fair valued assets recognised as part of the purchase consideration, of R97 million.

Underlying performance in Safaricom remains strong. It achieved local currency service revenue growth of 12.0% for the six months period to KES109.7 billion and
local currency EBIT growth of 8.9% (20.6% excluding one off adjustment from prior year) to KES37.5 billion.

Underpinning the results was strong expansion of Safaricom's customer base by 10.8% to 29.5 million customers. Strong growth in both data and M-Pesa revenue
continues as data customer increased by 13.5% to16.9 million customers and 30 day active M-Pesa customers increased 9.5% to 19.3 million. M-Pesa revenue grew
16.2% while data revenue grew by 31.0%. M-Pesa revenue now contributes 27.0% to service revenue and mobile data 16.0%. Investment in capital expenditure of
KES17.4 billion resulted in 3G sites increasing 21.5% and 4G sites increasing 129% year on year.

Regulatory matters

South Africa Integrated information and communication technology ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. Vodacom supports the objectives of
the White Paper to make broadband more accessible and affordable for all.

The White Paper, inter alia proposes the establishment of a wholesale open access network (WOAN) which will be the sole beneficiary of any new high demand
spectrum that will be allocated, and open access obligations for existing networks.

Since publication, a number of initial exploratory meetings for implementation of the policy paper between the Minister and industry were held with the objective of
finding a workable solution to meet South Africa's social and economic objectives, for which preserving investment competition in networks is essential. The result
was a unified proposal presented to the Minister by six of the country's main mobile and fixed operators. The proposal outlined the operators' vision of the creation of
a wholesale access network, while still allowing current operators the opportunity to access high demand spectrum. Such a solution would also ensure continued
predictability and improve cost efficiency of investment in the network.

The Ministry has subsequently appointed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to conduct a study on the spectrum requirements for the WOAN. The
outcome of the study is still to be released.

The White Paper is a statement of policy intent and to give effect to it, new laws and amendments to existing laws are currently being drafted.

ICASA priority market review

ICASA indicated that it will undertake a study to identify priority markets susceptible to ex ante regulations. Notice of intention to conduct an inquiry to identify
priority markets was published by ICASA in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act on 30 June 2017.

It is our understanding that ICASA intends to finalise the inquiry on or before 31 March 2018. We will be fully cooperating with ICASA in this regard.

ICASA's intention to amend End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

On 2 August 2017, ICASA announced in Parliament that they intend to review regulations on data billing and expiry period for data bundles. ICASA subsequently
published a notice in which they propose amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations in relation to data expiry rules and also
out-of-bundle billing. The Group submitted its response to the intended amendments, which highlighted self-regulatory mechanisms to be implemented, and plans
to address out-of-bundle usage and notifications.

Competition Commission investigation into complaint on the national treasury government transversal contract for mobile communication services
On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government
departments for the period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020. Vodacom was selected as the preferred supplier after the other bidders were eliminated at
different phases of the bidding process.

The Competition Commission has launched an investigation into the aforementioned, under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act. The Group is
committed to fully co-operate with the Competition Commission.

Outlook

We are making good progress in utilising more sophisticated analyses of customer behaviour and in applying these insights through a segmented customer approach
across all our operations. Our Just 4 You proposition supported by big data analysis has now been deployed across all operations, and is enabling us to offer our
customers compelling customer propositions.

Data revenue continues to grow, fuelled by strong demand for data services. The underlying growth drivers remain strong. Growing our data network coverage and
capacity and focusing our device strategy to increase 3G and 4G device uptake remain key strategic initiatives. Our immediate focus has been to transform data
pricing dramatically, by improving the customer experience through the reduction of out-of-bundle rates resulting in lower rates from the beginning of October. While
this creates some short-term pressure on data revenue growth, the effects of this will be managed through driving higher uptake and elasticity to compensate for this
pricing transformation process.

Our International operations continue to perform well, with strong growth in key areas of data and M-Pesa. All operations are delivering well, with the exception of
DRC where the decoupling of the US dollar from the Congolese Franc, and economic pressure, has impacted results. We are seeing improvements in the macro
environment in Mozambique. We are continuing our efforts to improve data monetisation across all markets, which remains a key priority.

Following the acquisition of a 34.94% stake in Safaricom we have prioritised three work streams to drive value across both businesses. We will be driving further
development of M-Pesa across all markets, expanding our Enterprise opportunity across east Africa, and driving big data initiatives across the two organisations.

Regulatory scrutiny across all markets is increasing. We are proactively making changes to address key concerns from customers and regulators. We continue to work
with the relevant regulatory agencies in all our operations to ensure a balanced and fair outcome.

We maintain our targets for Group service revenue growth of mid-single digit growth, Group EBIT growth of mid-to-high single digit and capital intensity of 12% - 14%
of Group revenue over the next three years. These targets are on average, over the next three years and are on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding
spectrum purchases and any merger and acquisition activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory
environments.

Group total expenses increased 5.8% to R26.3 billion.

In South Africa, total expenses increased 11.3% mainly as a result of increased equipment sales, increased bad debt charges following a temporary delay as we
introduced new programs to make it easier for customers to settle outstanding debt and earlier phasing of publicity costs from our global brand refresh campaign.
The costs also include charges in relation to our new roaming agreement with WBS.

In our International operations, actions taken in the prior year to mitigate slowed revenue growth continue to deliver benefits. Total expenses decreased by 7.3% (up
6.4%*). Savings were realised mainly from network and maintenance costs as well as commission savings, as more airtime is purchased directly through M-Pesa,
thereby eliminating third party commissions.

Net finance charges remained in line with the prior year. The R212 million net loss on the re-measurement of financial instruments mainly relates to foreign currency
denominated intergroup loans held by Mozambique and Tanzania. The reduction in rand denominated measurement loss was driven by an improvement in the MZM/
USD exchange rate, as well as partial repayment of the USD loan, as well as the settlement of the Tanzania intergroup loan. The reduction in the net loss was
supported by a gain on forward exchange contract (FEC) revaluation in the current year of R15 million (2016: gain of R60 million). Finance costs were higher as a
result of a 2.0% increase in average gross debt.

Taxation

The tax expense of R3.0 billion was 6.0% lower than the prior year (2016: R3.1 billion). The Group's effective tax rate decreased from 33.3% in the prior year to 30.5%.
The effective tax rate for the half year to 30 September 2016 was higher due to the HTT tower sale tax adjustment in Tanzania offset by the deferred tax assets
recognised in South Africa and Mozambique for tax losses brought forward. The net after tax profit of the Safaricom associate included in the Group's profit before tax
resulted in a reduction of 1.0ppts in the effective tax rate.

increased depreciation (-30cps). The negative impact of the increase in weighted shares issued due to the Safaricom acquisition was (-21cps).

The Group's capital expenditure was R5.4 billion, representing 12.8% of revenue. In South Africa, capital expenditure was directed at accelerating our 3G capacity and
extending 4G coverage to 76.7% of the population. In our International operations, the focus remained on increasing both coverage and capacity thereby adding 115
4G sites, 209 3G sites and 157 2G sites since March 2017. In Safaricom, capital expenditure was focused on increasing 3G and 4G sites as well as fibre roll out and
upgrade on the M-Pesa platform to enhance functionality.

Statement of financial position

Property, plant and equipment increased 1.7% to R40.9 billion and intangible assets decreased by 1.1% to R9.1 billion compared to 31 March 2017. The combined
increase is mainly as a result of net additions of R5.3 billion, offset by depreciation and amortisation of R5.0 billion and foreign currency translation gain of R326
million.

Net debt increased R2.5 billion to R25.0 billion. Total borrowings has remained stable. Bank and cash balances are lower mainly due to the payment of dividends,
offset by cash proceeds from the listing of Vodacom Tanzania.

Free cash flow decreased by 42.7% or R1.5 billion from the prior year mainly due to a substantial investment in working capital. Working capital investment was
higher as a result of the delayed creditor payments in the prior year due to currency shortages in our International operations, increased trade receivables and a
temporary timing difference on receipt of trade receivables. Higher finance costs paid was due to the higher net debt balances.

Dividend

The interim dividend of 390 cents per share, reflects a dividend of 90% of adjusted headline earnings (refer above ) amounting to 345 cents per share, as well as the
inclusion of 50%1 of the dividend receivable from Safaricom (net of withholding tax), amounting to 45 cents per share.

The board intends to pay the remainder of the Safaricom dividend at the end of the financial year as part of the final dividend, adjusting for any currency fluctuation
on receipt of the dividend from Safaricom, by Vodacom Group.

The Board maintains its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of adjusted headline earnings which excludes the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from
Safaricom and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, the Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount
of the dividend received, net of withholding tax.

The Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining such sums and repaying such borrowings owing to third parties as shall be
necessary to meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan, taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed
date on which entitlement to dividends arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE
Listings Requirements.

       (1.) On 7 August 2017, the Group acquired an effective interest of 34.94% in Safaricom Limited (Safaricom), which is
          accounted for as an investment in associate. Due to the significance of this investment, and the information available
          for review by the chief operating decision maker, Safaricom is presented as a separate segment. The above results
          represent 100% of the results of Safaricom from the date of acquisition, including the impact of net fair value
          adjustments on tangible and intangible assets and goodwill (Note 8). The results are therefore eliminated in full in the
         'Corporate and eliminations' column.

     (1.) On 7 August 2017, the Group acquired an effective interest of 34.94% in Safaricom Limited (Safaricom), which is
          accounted for as an investment in associate. Due to the significance of this investment, and the information available
          for review by the chief operating decision maker, Safaricom is presented as a separate segment. The above results
          represent 100% of the results of Safaricom as at 30 September 2017, including the impact of net fair value
          adjustments on tangible and intangible assets and goodwill (Note 8). The results are therefore eliminated in full in
          the 'Corporate and eliminations' column, apart from the Group's equity accounted investment, which remains in the
          total assets under 'Corporate and eliminations'.

8.   Acquisition of interest in Safaricom Limited (Safaricom) through Vodafone Kenya Limited (Vodafone Kenya)

     On 7 August 2017, the Group acquired 87.5% of Vodafone Kenya from Vodafone International Holdings B.V.
     (VIHBV). Vodafone Kenya holds a 39.93% stake in Safaricom, the Republic of Kenya's leading integrated
     communications company. The investment in Vodafone Kenya has been treated as an investment in a subsidiary in
     terms of IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements. As Vodafone Kenya is an investment holding company, with its
     only material asset being the associate investment in Safaricom, the transaction does not meet the definition of a
     business combination under IFRS 3: Business Combinations. The 39.93% equity interest that Vodafone Kenya
     holds in Safaricom has been equity accounted as an investment in an associate.

     The purchase consideration was settled by the issuance of 233 459 781 Vodacom Group Limited shares to the
     value of R42 618 million (net of directly attributable transaction costs of R3 million), measured based on the
     closing price of Vodacom Group Limited on the effective date, and, for the equity interest in Vodafone Kenya, a
     cash consideration of R51 million.

     VIHBV retained a non-controlling interest (NCI) of 12.5% in Vodafone Kenya, resulting in NCI of R6 104 million
     being recognised at the acquisition date, measured on a fair value basis.

     The fair value of the Group's investment in Safaricom, based on the listed closing share price as at 30 September
     2017, was R52 478 million.

9.     Borrowings

       During the current period, the Group modified two of the existing loan facilities received from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l.. On the 3rd of May
       2017, R8 000 million and R4 000 million loan facilities were modified from variable interest rate loans to fixed interest rate loans. The loan facilities bear
       interest at fixed rates of 8.703% and 8.991% and are repayable on the 26 November 2019 and 26 July 2021 respectively.

       Additionally, the existing fixed rate facility of R3 000 million was re-financed with a floating rate facility of R3 000 million at a rate of 3 month Jibar +1.50%
       with a repayment date of 24 May 2022.

10.    Contingent liabilities

10.1   Guarantees

       The Group has various guarantees in issue, relating to external financial obligations of its subsidiaries, which amounted to R112 million (30 September 2016:
       R119 million; 31 March 2017: R119 million).

       Foreign denominated guarantees amounting to R1 015 million (30 September 2016: R1 030 million; 31 March 2017: R1 005 million) are in issue in support
       of Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA relating to liabilities included in the consolidated statement of financial position.

10.2   Tax matters

       The Group is regularly subject to an evaluation by tax authorities of its direct and indirect tax filings. The consequence of such reviews is that disputes can
       arise with tax authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules applicable to the Group's business. These disputes may not necessarily be
       resolved in a manner that is favourable to the Group. Additionally, the resolution of the disputes could result in an obligation to the Group. The Group has
       made sufficient provision for any losses arising from tax exposures that are more likely to occur than not.

10.3   Legal contingencies

       The Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has, in consultation with its legal counsel, assessed the outcome of these proceedings.
       Following this assessment, the Group's management has determined, that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal proceedings as at 30
       September 2017.

10.4   Kenneth Makate (Mr Makate) vs Vodacom (Pty) Limited

       Negotiations with Mr Makate in accordance with the Constitutional Court order to determine a reasonable compensation for a business idea that led to a
       product known as 'Please Call Me' are ongoing.

11.    Other matters

11.1   Competition Commission investigations

11.1.1 Competition complaint on the national treasury government transversal contract for mobile communications services

       On 14 March 2016, National Treasury issued a tender for the supply and delivery of mobile communication services to national and provincial government
       departments in South Africa. The tender was awarded to the Group, for the period 15 September 2016 to 31 August 2020, after an open and transparent
       process. The Competition Commission has initiated an investigation against the Group under sections 8(c) and 8(d)(i) of the Competition Act.

       The Group is committed to full cooperation with the Competition Commission's investigations.

11.1.2 Facilities leasing and roaming agreements between Vodacom (Pty) Limited (the Company) and Wireless Business Solutions (Pty) Limited (WBS)

       Complaints have been raised with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) and the Competition Commission regarding the
       facilities leasing and roaming arrangements between the Company and WBS. ICASA and the Competition Commission are currently investigating these
       complaints.

11.2   G.H. Investments (GHI) and Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA (Vodacom Congo)

       Vodacom Congo contracted GHI to install ultra-low cost base stations on a revenue share basis. Shortly after rolling out the first sites GHI sought to
       renegotiate the contractual terms, which Vodacom Congo declined. GHI then accused Vodacom Congo of infringing its intellectual property rights and
       demanded payment of compensation in the sum of USD1.16 billion. In July 2016, Vodacom Congo filed a request for arbitration with the International
       Chamber of Commerce's International Court of Arbitration (ICC). In its replying papers to the arbitration process, GHI has revised its claim to USD256 million.
       Arbitration has commenced, and is expected to end in March 2018. Vodacom Congo filed its statement of claim on 31 July 2017. GHI will file its statement of
       defence and counter-claim soon, but has failed to pay its share of the arbitration fees to the ICC, demanding that Vodacom Congo carry all the costs of the
       arbitration proceedings.

11.3   Mr Puati vs Vodacom Congo

       A patent infringement claim was filed in July 2016 against Vodacom Congo. The plaintiff is asking the Commercial Court of Kinshasa/Gombe, inter alia, to
       prohibit Vodacom Congo from providing the M-Pesa service and to order Vodacom Congo to pay damages of USD200 million for losses resulting from the
       alleged patent infringement. A hearing was held in December 2016, and the matter has been referred to the Public Prosecutor (in accordance with procedural
       rules of the Democratic Republic of the Congo) for an opinion, before a judgement is delivered. The public prosecutor has since issued an opinion to the
       court. The judgement will be delivered on a date yet to be set.

11.4   Customer registration

       The Group has made considerable strides in complying with customer registration requirements in all its markets in line with applicable laws. In Tanzania the
       Group, together with the other operators, was fined in July 2017 for non-compliance with these requirements based on investigations undertaken in
       December 2016. Significant measures have been taken to achieve compliance prior to and since the fine. The fine, translated, amounted to approximately
       R12 million. The Group will keep up with customer registration requirements in markets where full compliance has been achieved and has put in place
       accelerated action plans in Tanzania. The Group continues to participate in government and industry coordinated forums overseeing the continued efforts to
       enhance the registration processes.

11.5   Radio frequency spectrum licences

       On 30 September 2016 the Pretoria High Court granted an application by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services (the Ministry) interdicting
       ICASA from implementing the spectrum licencing process contemplated in the Invitation to Apply (ITA) for the licensing of spectrum in the 700MHz, 800MHz
       and 2600MHz bands, pending the outcome of a judicial review on the lawfulness of the ICASA ITA.

11.6   South Africa Integrated information and communication technology ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper)

       The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. Vodacom supports the objectives of
       the White Paper to make broadband more accessible and affordable for all.

       The White Paper, inter alia proposes the establishment of a wholesale open access network (WOAN) which will be the sole beneficiary of any new high demand
       spectrum that will be allocated, and open access obligations for existing networks.

       Since publication, a number of initial exploratory meetings for implementation of the policy paper between the Minister and industry were held with the objective of
       finding a workable solution to meet South Africa's social and economic objectives, for which preserving investment competition in networks is essential. The result
       was a unified proposal presented to the Minister by six of the country's main mobile and fixed operators. The proposal outlined the operators' vision of the creation of
       a wholesale access network, while still allowing current operators the opportunity to access high demand spectrum. Such a solution would also ensure continued
       predictability and improve cost efficiency of investment in the network.

       The Ministry has subsequently appointed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to conduct a study on the spectrum requirements for the WOAN. The
       outcome of the study is still to be released.

       The White Paper is a statement of policy intent and to give effect to it, new laws and amendments to existing laws are currently being drafted.

11.7   ICASA priority market review

       ICASA indicated that it will undertake a study to identify priority markets susceptible to ex ante regulation. Notice of intention to conduct an inquiry to
       identify priority markets was published by ICASA in terms of section 4B of the ICASA Act on 30 June 2017. It is our understanding that ICASA intends to
       finalise the inquiry on or before 31 March 2018. We will be fully cooperating with ICASA in this regard.

11.8   ICASA's intention to amend End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations

       On 2 August 2017, ICASA announced in Parliament that they intend to review regulations on data billing and expiry period for data bundles. ICASA
       subsequently published a notice in which they intend to amend the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations in relation to data expiry rules and
       also out-of-bundle billing. The Group submitted its response, which highlighted self-regulatory mechanisms to be implemented, and plans to address
       out-of-bundle usage and notifications.

11.9   Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company (Vodacom Tanzania) listing requirement

       In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed the Finance Act, 2016 which amended listing requirements under the Electronic and Postal Communication
       Act, 2010 (EPOCA), to introduce mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their authorised share
       capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).

       On 15 August 2017, Vodacom Tanzania listed on the Main Investment Market Segment (MIMS) of the DSE under the ticker VODA, and became the first
       telecommunications operator to comply with these regulatory changes. The listing was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the 19-year history of the
       DSE, and raised net proceeds after underwriting costs of R 2 770 million (TZS 470 billion).

11.10  Revenue collection system in Tanzania

       The Tanzanian Revenue Authority (TRA), has implemented an Electronic Revenue Collection System (ERC system) designed to calculate and collect taxes,
       including value added tax and excise duty, from September 2017. All mobile network operators and financial institutions are mandated to provide requested
       information on a monthly basis to the ERC system in compliance with the Tax Administration (Electronic Revenue Collection System) Regulations, 2017.
       Information provided under the ERC system includes mobile phone numbers, traffic and revenue. Vodacom Tanzania is at advanced stages of compliance
       with the ERC system requirements.

11.11  Vodacom Congo

       Vodacom Congo is not in compliance with the minimum capital requirements as set out under the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in
       Africa (OHADA). Vodacom Congo has to increase its share capital to meet the minimum OHADA requirements. The Board and shareholders of Vodacom Congo
       are in negotiations to address the recapitalisation of the company.

12.    Events after the reporting period

       The Board is not aware of any matter or circumstance arising since the end of the reporting period, not otherwise dealt with herein, which significantly affects
       the financial position of the Group or the results of its operations or cash flows for the period, other than the following:

12.1   Sale of investment in Helios Towers Tanzania Limited (Helios)

       Vodacom Tanzania sold its 24.06% investment in Helios to Helios Towers Africa Holding Limited (HTA) during October 2017 for total cash proceeds of R806
       million. This investment is included in non-current asset held for sale as at 30 September 2017. The sale will result in a after tax profit on sale of
       approximately R652 million being recognised in the second half of this financial year. The remaining balance of loans receivable from Helios of R42 million
       have also been sold to HTA.

12.2   Dividend declared after the reporting date and not recognised as a liability

       An interim dividend of R 6 714 million (390 cents per ordinary share) for the year ending 31 March 2018, was declared on 10 November 2017, payable on 4
       December 2017 to shareholders recorded in the register at the close of business on 1 December 2017. The net dividend after taking into account dividend
       withholding tax for those shareholders not exempt from dividend withholding tax is 312.00000 cents per share.

Notes:
(1.) Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee
     that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
(2.) Data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles not used. Data customers are based on the number of unique users
     generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have
     been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service
     or have used the service during the reported month.
(3.) Internet of Things connections (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central
     station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
(4.) Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming
     calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
(5.) Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during
     the period.
(6.) Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU
     only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Note:
(1.) During the 2nd quarter we reclassified the foreign exchange difference between USD and CDF sales to be netted off on the corresponding revenue line. The
    adjustment was USD11.4 million for Q1 and USD4.4 million for Q2. Q1 has not been restated for this change. This was partially offset by a reversal of excise duties
    of USD9.9 million, in Q2.

Notes:
(1.) Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee
      that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
(2.) Data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles not used. Data customers are based on the number of unique users
      generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have
      been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service
      or have used the service during the reported month.
(3.) Internet of Things connections (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central
      station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
(4.) Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming
      calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.
(5.) Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly customers during
      the period.
(6. ) Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only
      include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
(1.) The reported percentage change relates to the six months percentage growth. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International
     operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian

(2.) Trading foreign exchange (FX) are foreign exchange gains/losses on foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulting from trading activities of
     entities within the Group.
(3.) Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation
     currency, being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the six months ended 30 September 2017 (which is derived by
     dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the period) to 30 September 2016 numbers, thereby giving a user a view

""should"", ""expects"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""plans"" or ""targets"" (including in their negative form). By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive,

of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors

resolution of open tax issues.

Placing by Vodafone of 90 million Vodacom shares

Vodacom shareholders are advised that Vodafone Group Plc (""Vodafone Group"") has announced
that its wholly owned subsidiary, Vodafone International Holdings B.V. (“Vodafone”), has sold an
aggregate of 90 million ordinary shares in Vodacom representing approximately 5.2% of Vodacom's
ordinary share capital at a price of ZAR 165 per ordinary share to institutional investors by way of an
accelerated bookbuild process (""Placing"").

Following the completion of the Placing, Vodafone will own approximately 64.5% of Vodacom's
ordinary share capital.

The Vodafone announcement stated the following ""Following Vodacom’s recent acquisition of a 35%
interest in Safaricom, announced on 15 May 2017 (the ""Safaricom Transaction""), Vodafone
increased its ownership in Vodacom from 65.0% to 69.7% and at the time of announcement it was
expected that Vodacom’s free float would decline to approximately 18%. As part of the Safaricom
Transaction, Vodafone therefore committed to Vodacom that it would sell down a sufficient number
of shares to ensure that Vodacom will meet the 20% minimum free float requirement on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”).

The objective of the Placing was to ensure that Vodacom meets the free float requirement and to
restore Vodafone’s shareholding in Vodacom to a percentage that is broadly similar to that which it
held prior to implementation of the Safaricom Transaction. Vodafone remains committed to
Vodacom and intends to retain a controlling majority shareholding in Vodacom for the long-term.

In connection with the Placing, Vodafone has agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any ordinary
shares in Vodacom that are not sold in the Placing for a period of 90 calendar days after completion
of the Placing, subject to consent by the Joint Bookrunners.""

Vodacom Tanzania – Initial Public Offering


Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement published on 28 February 2017 relating to
Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company (“Vodacom Tanzania”), a subsidiary of Vodacom Group,
receiving approval from the Capital Markets & Securities Authority (“CMSA”) in Tanzania to proceed
with an initial public offering ('IPO"") to list 560 000 100 new shares (equating to 25% of the post
offering issued share capital) at a fixed price of 850 Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) to raise TZS 476 billion
($213 million). Initially this IPO was only open to local Tanzanians. The offer closed on 11 May 2017.
Following recent amendments to the Tanzanian Electronic and Postal Communication Act, Vodacom
Tanzania was then given the approval by the CMSA to open the IPO to all potential investors,
including international investors. The offer was therefore extended and opened on 10 July 2017 and
closed on 28 July 2017.

Vodacom Tanzania announced the results of its IPO on Tuesday 8 August 2017, where the IPO raised
TZS 476 billion ($213 million) as planned. Of this amount, 60% was raised through subscriptions by
local Tanzanian investors and 40% from international investors.

The Vodacom Tanzania IPO is the largest in the history of Tanzania’s capital markets and attracted
interest from more than 40 000 local investors, most of whom are first time participants on the Dar es
Salaam Stock Exchange (“DSE”), thus boosting local participation in that country’s capital markets.

In accordance with the IPO timetable approved by the CMSA and included in the Addendum to the
Vodacom Tanzania prospectus, Vodacom Tanzania will be listed on the Main Investment Market
Segment of the DSE on or about Tuesday 15 August 2017 under the ticker “VODA”.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

The solid performance the Group delivered in FY2017, continued into the first quarter of the current financial year. In South
Africa, revenue growth accelerated to 7.8%, aided by increased smartphone device sales. We sustained South African service revenue
growth of 5.6%, underpinned by the consistent and significant investment in our network infrastructure and IT systems,
aimed at further enhancing the customer experience. Our pricing transformation strategy continues to deliver greater value
for our 39 million South African customers. The 9.1% and 18.9% decline in effective voice and data prices respectively over
the quarter reflects our commitment to driving down the cost to communicate in South Africa. As I have stated previously,
there is more work to be done on this front, and we will be introducing additional measures this year to give greater control
to customers by improving our out-of-bundle pricing.

Although the International operations have turned the corner, currency volatility is still negatively impacting translation of
these results. We now have 30 million customers outside of South Africa, an increase of 12.0%. Following the phenomenal
success in South Africa of our 'Just 4 You' platform, customers in all our operations are starting to enjoy the benefits of this
personalised offers platform. We expect that this will contribute to the operational momentum in these markets. Following
the shareholder approval of the acquisition of a stake in Safaricom on 18 July this will further boost contribution outside of
South Africa.

Our strategy to become a leading digital company and empowering a connected society is our key area of focus. We continue to
make substantial investments in all our operations so that we maintain our network lead and IT advantage. This will enable
us to transform our product offerings, customer experience, operations and organisation to deliver on our digital aspirations.

We remain cognisant of the weaker economic conditions that prevail in South Africa as well as some of our larger markets
and have put measures in place should these conditions deteriorate materially in these markets.

* Normalised growth adjusted at a constant currency (using the current quarter as the base). Refer below
for a reconciliation of adjustments. All growth rates quoted are year-on-year growth rates and refer to the quarter ended
30 June 2017 compared to the quarter ended 30 June 2016, unless stated otherwise

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue growth was sustained, growing 5.6%, to R13.1 billion for the quarter. This performance was supported by
continued growth in our customer base and strong demand for data. Revenue growth accelerated to 7.8%, underpinned by a
17.0% increase in equipment revenue, reflecting the successful delivery of our strategy of driving the uptake of data-enabled
devices. The sale of smartphones grew by 29.0%, comprising 57.4% of total device sales.

We added 2.3 million customers in the quarter, reaching 39.4 million, up 12.2%. Our segmented offerings and 'Just 4 You'
personalised offers continue to play an important role both in increasing customer activity and generating greater value
for our customers. During the quarter, we sold 553 million prepaid and contract bundles, up 68.3%, with the number of
bundle users increasing by 25.7% to 17.8 million. Prepaid customers increased by 2.2 million to 34.2 million, driven largely
by our successful personalised offers. Prepaid ARPU was down 3.3%, as we continue to attract more customers in the value
segment. Contract customers increased by two thousand in the quarter, to 5.1 million. Migration to our new ""more data"" contracts, 
which have a larger data allocation, accelerated during this period, as customer demand for data continued to increase. Contract ARPU 
declined by 2.0% to R393, due to a higher rollover of unused bundle allocations, as customers grow into fully utilising these larger bundles.

Voice revenue decline was low at 4.2%, reflecting the success of our personalised voice bundle strategy through our 'Just 4
You' platform, reducing the blended effective price per minute by 9.1%.

Data revenue grew 18.1% to R5.5 billion, contributing 42.2% (2017: 37.8%) of service revenue. We added 463 thousand
4G customers in the quarter, reaching a total of 5.5 million customers as devices became more affordable as a result of
improvements in exchange rates. Active smart devices on the network increased by 18.4% to 16.6 million, with the average
monthly data used on these devices increasing to 734MB per device. We have continued to introduce new initiatives to
reduce the out-of-bundle-data spend by our customers and to give customers more control, resulting in an improved
customer experience. Together with our successful data pricing strategy of making data more affordable, this has resulted in
a 56.1% increase in data bundle sales and an 18.9% reduction in the overall effective price per MB.

Enterprise continues to grow, with revenue up 9.4% to R3.3 billion, contributing 25.3% (2017: 24.4%) of service revenue. Our
fixed-line services revenue grew by 12.0%, while our cloud and hosting services delivered robust revenue growth of 27.5%.
We started the migration of customers from the mobile voice and data communications contract that we secured last year
with South Africa's national and provincial government departments. Internet of Things (IoT) revenue was up 28.9%
to R192 million.

Our capital expenditure of R1.8 billion was focused on maintaining our network lead; with widest coverage and fastest
internet, as well as enhancing our IT systems. This enables us to provide truly segmented
and personalised experiences for our customers, which is critical to delivering our strategic ambition of becoming a leading
digital company. Our continued investment in infrastructure resulted in 75.9% 4G and 99.2% 3G population coverage.

International

Underlying growth trends in our International operations have improved, with a better performance in Tanzania and
sustained growth in Mozambique and Lesotho through strong commercial execution. In the DRC economic weakness and
decoupling of the Congolese Franc from the US dollar continues to impact consumer spending. Exchange rate volatility
continues to negatively impact reported growth. Service revenue declined by 8.0% to R4.1 billion in the quarter; normalised
for currency translation effects, underlying growth was 8.0%*.

We added 281 thousand customers in the quarter, reaching 29.9 million, up 12.0%. We are continuing to improve our
customer registration processes, working closely with regulators to ensure full compliance in all our operations.

Data revenue grew by 2.2%, with normalised growth of 18.9%*, supported by an increase of 810 thousand active data
customers, up to 13.8 million. Data traffic grew 87.0%, reflecting strong demand for mobile data services as we drive the
adoption of data bundles through our 'Just 4 You' personalised offerings. We continue to ensure that our customers have
access to better low cost smart devices, especially Vodacom-branded devices, as we increase data network speeds and
improve data coverage. Data revenue comprised 27.1% (2017: 24.4%) of International operations' service revenue.

M-Pesa revenue continued to grow strongly at 7.4%, with normalised growth of 24.9%*. The new M-Pesa platform with
enhanced technology has significantly improved stability, resulting in increased trust with customers. We added 350
thousand customers in the quarter, reaching 13.3 million(1). We continue to enhance our service and product eco-systems and
develop innovative products to improve customer experience. In Tanzania, 1.0 million customers are using our successful
M-Pawa savings and loans product, developed in partnership with the Commercial Bank of Africa. There has also been a
steady uptake of our International Money Transfer (IMT) services. During the quarter, on average, R22 billion was processed
monthly through the M-Pesa system.

Capital expenditure of R510 million enabled us to continue investing in all our markets to strengthen network and service
differentiation and to support data growth and wider voice coverage. 2G and 3G sites increased 7.5% and 15.4% respectively.

1. Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 90 days, of these 10.1 million
have been active in the past 30 days.

Regulatory matters

South Africa Integrated information and communication technology ICT Policy White Paper

In October 2016, the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services published the cabinet-approved National
Integrated ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper). The White Paper sets out a framework on how the government seeks to
provide access to modern communications infrastructure and services to facilitate the entry of new players and ensure
the meaningful participation of all citizens, including those in rural areas. Its adoption will require various amendments to
existing laws and regulations flowing from the Electronic Communications Act. The Invitation to Apply (ITA) for high demand
spectrum issued by ICASA remains subject to legal challenge from the Ministry, the outcome of which is still pending.

During May 2017, a high level agreement was reached between the Ministry and industry stakeholders that provides for:
- Not returning assigned spectrum, as originally contemplated in the White Paper;
- Licensees committing to buy a set minimum capacity from the Wholesale Open Access Network (WOAN) to ensure
  its viability;
- The Ministry conducting a study to determine the appropriate quantity of high demand spectrum that will be necessary
  for the WOAN to roll out a 4G/LTE network; and
- The remaining high-demand spectrum, after allocation to the WOAN, to be assigned to existing licensees through
  an allocation process yet to be determined, with a possible inclusion of rural coverage obligations.

Subsequently, the Ministry appointed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to conduct a study on the
spectrum requirements for the WOAN.

Listing of Vodacom Tanzania

In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania introduced mandatory listing requirements, requiring licensed telecommunications
operators to list at least 25% of their authorised share capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar es Salaam
stock exchange (DSE). Vodacom Tanzania opened its initial public offer in compliance with the legislation on 9 March 2017.
Following changes to the Electronic and Postal Communications Act 2010 (EPOCA) and directives received from the Capital
Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA), Vodacom Tanzania Plc extended the offer period by three weeks from Monday 10
July 2017 to Friday 28 July 2017 with the listing expected to take place on Tuesday 15 August 2017. This extension is to
facilitate participation by international investors, following recent changes approved by Parliament allowing international
investors to participate in the IPOs of EPOCA licensees.

Safaricom

Shareholders are referred to the circular released on 19 June 2017 detailing the proposed transaction between Vodacom
Group and Vodafone. In accordance with the terms of this proposed transaction, Vodacom Group will acquire a 34.94%
indirect interest in Safaricom from Vodafone by acquiring 87.5% of the issued share capital of Vodafone Kenya. The total
purchase consideration payable by Vodacom Group for the acquisition of 87.5% of the issued share capital of Vodafone
Kenya equates to 233 459 781 shares in Vodacom issued to Vodafone. At the general meeting on 18 July 2017,
shareholders resolved to approve this transaction, which we expect to be effective on or about 1 August 2017.

Notes:
1. Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes
   customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those
   customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are
   users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data
   bundle during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used
   the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices
   or a central station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during
   the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes
   and outgoing international roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls
   to free services.

Notes:
1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth
    between 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2017. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand.
    Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar,
    Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates
    for the current and comparative periods are disclosed above.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries'
   functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being rand. The exchange variances are
   eliminated by applying the quarter 30 June 2017 average rate (which is derived by dividing the individual
   subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the quarter) to 30 June 2016 quarter
   numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange rate variances. The
    prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative quarters are disclosed above.

Share dealings – CEO co-investment

In accordance with paragraph 3.63 of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are advised
that Mr Aziz Joosub has met his co-investment requirements in respect of his terms and
conditions of employment with Vodacom. In terms of the co-investment rules, Vodacom has
allocated the following forfeitable shares to Mr Aziz Joosub, the details of which are more fully
described below. It is noted that in 2016, Mr Aziz Joosub had met his co-investment
requirement for that year, but Vodacom had entered into discussions with Vodafone in regard to
the proposed Safaricom transaction more fully reported to shareholders in the SENS
announcement published on Monday 15 May 2017. While these discussions were ongoing,
Vodacom effectively entered into a prohibited period for certain executives who could not trade
in Vodacom shares. Due to the delay caused by this prohibited period, the vesting period for
the 2016 matching award for Mr Aziz Joosub has been reduced to two years.

ACQUISITION OF AN INDIRECT 34.94% INTEREST IN SAFARICOM

1.   Introduction

     Shareholders are advised that, on 14 May 2017 (""signature date""), Vodacom Group entered into
     an agreement (""the agreement"") in terms of which Vodacom Group will acquire a 34.94% indirect
     interest in Safaricom Limited (""Safaricom"") from Vodafone International Holdings B.V.
     (""Vodafone"") by acquiring 87.5% of the issued share capital of Vodafone Kenya Limited
     (""Vodafone Kenya"") and Vodafone will subscribe for new Vodacom Group shares. The purchase
     consideration payable by Vodacom Group is the sum of an amount equal to the subscription price
     payable by Vodafone for 226.8 million new ordinary Vodacom Group shares (""new Vodacom
     Group shares""), which will be set off against the same amount of the purchase consideration, and
     a maximum amount of KES393.75 million (R51 million) payable to Vodafone in cash (the
     ""proposed transaction"").

2.   Nature of business of Vodafone Kenya and Safaricom

     Vodafone Kenya holds, as its only material asset, a 39.93% interest in Safaricom and is wholly
     owned by Vodafone. Vodafone will retain a 12.5% interest in Vodafone Kenya, equivalent to
     4.99% interest in Safaricom, after completion of the proposed transaction.

     Vodafone Kenya currently has a right to appoint, remove and/or replace four of Safaricom’s ten
     directors. Following the proposed transaction, Vodafone Kenya will retain this right. Vodafone will
     have the right to nominate one of the four directors appointed by Vodafone Kenya to Safaricom's
     board of directors for so long as it retains at least 12.5% of the issued share capital of Vodafone
     Kenya.

     Safaricom, established in 1997 and listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (""NSE"") with a
     market capitalisation of c.US$8 billion, provides a range of integrated telecommunications
     services, including mobile and fixed voice, SMS, data, internet and mobile money (“M-Pesa”) to
     over 28.1 million total customers, including both consumer and enterprise.

     Safaricom is owned by the government of Kenya (35%), Vodafone Kenya (39.93%), public
     investors (25%) and Safaricom employees (0.07%).

3.   Rationale for the proposed transaction

     The proposed transaction presents a unique opportunity to acquire a significant strategic interest
     in the premier telecom operator in East Africa.

     Safaricom is the market leader in Kenya with a 71% mobile customer market share, has one of
     Kenya’s most recognisable brands and a highly experienced management team. Safaricom is a
     high growth, high margin, and high cash generating business. In its 2017 financial year, Safaricom
     delivered 8.8% revenue growth, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
     amortisation (""EBITDA"") margin of 48.1% and cash flow conversion of 65.9%. The company
     benefits from well-invested state-of-the-art infrastructure and is the only operator with a nation-
     wide network which currently provides 3G and 4G coverage to 85% and 25% of the population
     respectively.

     Safaricom has a track-record of sustainable growth, having delivered a compound annual growth
     rate in revenue of 14.8% over the last five years whilst its future growth potential is underpinned
     by a broad range of fundamental drivers. The proposed transaction will expose Vodacom Group
     to the attractive high growth Kenyan market, being one of the largest and most advanced
     economies in east and central Africa that has made significant strides in technological innovation.
     According to the International Monetary Fund, the Kenyan economy is projected to grow at 6%
     per annum over the next five years.

     Kenya has a mobile penetration of 88%, which is well below South Africa’s mobile penetration of
     146%. Kenya has an emerging, urban middle class with an appetite for high value goods and
     services. Kenya has high potential for further growth in mobile penetration and data usage is
     expected to continue to grow, which will increase customer demand for Safaricom’s 3G and 4G
     mobile, fixed line and digital services. Safaricom’s leading mobile money platform, M-Pesa, is an
     important driver of Kenyan economic growth, providing essential financial services to over
     19 million 30-day active customers.

     Vodacom Group sees scope to create further value through closer cooperation between both
     companies, including best practice sharing; replication of Safaricom’s success in M-Pesa in
     Vodacom Group’s other territories; and the creation of new pan-African enterprise solutions in
     contiguous markets in East Africa.

     The proposed transaction also offers an opportunity to diversify Vodacom Group’s economic
     exposure and earning’s profile in a single transaction. Its interest in Safaricom will contribute
     approximately 15% of its earnings (before amortisation for the fair value adjustment of assets on
     acquisition) based on Vodacom Group’s net profits as reported in its preliminary results for the
     year ended 31 March 2017.

     Following the proposed transaction, Vodacom Group will occupy a leading position in its markets
     with approximately one third of sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic product.

4.   Purchase consideration for the proposed transaction

     The purchase consideration, payable by Vodacom Group for the sale and transfer of 87.5% of the
     issued share capital of Vodafone Kenya, is the sum of an amount equal to the subscription price
     payable by Vodafone for the new Vodacom Group shares, which will be set off against the same
     amount of the purchase consideration, and a maximum amount of KES393.75 million (R51 million)
     in cash. As at the signature date, the subscription price amounts to R34.6 billion, based on the
     Vodacom Group share price on Friday 12 May 2017.

     Vodafone Kenya holds 16 000 000 000 shares in Safaricom. The implied share subscription and
     set-off ratio for the number of new Vodacom Group shares to be issued, in respect of 87.5% of
     the 39.93% Safaricom shares held by Vodafone Kenya, is equivalent to 1.62 new Vodacom Group
     shares (cum dividend) for every 100 shares in Safaricom held by Vodafone Kenya.

     The agreed share subscription and set-off ratio implies:

     -   a 5.9% discount compared to the implied share subscription and set-off ratio of 1.72 based
         on the closing share prices of Vodacom Group and Safaricom on Friday 12 May 2017;
     -   a 4.8% discount compared to the implied share subscription and set-off ratio of 1.70 based
         on the volume weighted average share prices of Vodacom Group and Safaricom for the 30
         days prior to and including Friday 12 May 2017;
     -   a 0.6% discount compared to the implied share subscription and set-off ratio of 1.63 based
         on the volume weighted average share prices of Vodacom Group and Safaricom for the
         180 days prior to and including Friday 12 May 2017; and
     -   a share price of KES19.05 based on the Vodacom Group closing share price on Friday
         12 May 2017.

     The new Vodacom Group shares to be issued by the company to Vodafone will be adjusted, after
     the signature date, if Vodacom Group declares any distribution (""Vodacom Group distribution"") to
     its shareholders where the record date for such distribution is set to occur prior to the effective
     date of the proposed transaction, being the 10 business days after the fulfilment of the last of the
     suspensive conditions set out below (""effective date""). Such adjustment will be equal to:

     (i)   the rand equivalent of the Vodacom Group distribution per Vodacom Group share;

     (ii)  multiplied by the number of new Vodacom Group shares immediately prior to any adjustment;
           and

     (iii) divided by the closing price of a Vodacom Group share on the JSE Limited (“JSE”) on Friday
           12 May 2017 less the Vodacom Group distribution per Vodacom Group share.

     As a result of the issue of the new Vodacom Group shares to Vodafone, the interest held by
     Vodafone in Vodacom Group will increase from 65.0% to 69.6% (excluding any potential
     adjustment necessary due to a Vodacom Group distribution). Following the proposed transaction
     Vodacom Group’s expected free float may be below the minimum free float requirement of 20%
     for its listing on the JSE. Should there be a breach in free float as a result of the proposed
     transaction, Vodacom Group has secured a two-year exemption from the JSE from the date of
     implementation of the proposed transaction. Vodafone has committed to Vodacom Group that, if
     required, it will sell down up to 36.3 million of its shares in Vodacom Group before the exemption
     expires in order to rectify the position.

5.   Suspensive conditions

     The proposed transaction is subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the following suspensive
     conditions:

     5.1    the adoption by the existing shareholders of Vodafone Kenya of new articles of association

            articles of association and the special resolution passed in respect thereof with the Kenyan
            Companies Registry;

     5.2    to the extent required, Vodacom Group obtaining an unconditional exemption (as

            the Act) from the Takeover Regulation Panel;

     5.3    Vodacom Group shareholders, other than Vodafone and its associates, as defined in the
            JSE Listings Requirements approving the proposed transaction by means of an ordinary
            resolution as a related party transaction as contemplated in section 10 of the JSE Listings
            Requirements;

     5.4    Vodacom Group shareholders approving:

            5.4.1   the issue of the new Vodacom Group shares by means of a special resolution as
                    contemplated in section 41(1)(b) of the Act; and

            5.4.2   the issue of the new Vodacom Group shares by means of an ordinary resolution
                    as contemplated in clause 5.7.2 of the memorandum of incorporation of Vodacom
                    Group;

     5.5    the receipt of the approval of the proposed transaction in writing from the Financial
            Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank;

     5.6    the JSE having approved a listing of the new Vodacom Group shares on the JSE with
            effect from the effective date;

     5.7    Vodafone Kenya, Vodacom Group and Vodafone entering into an agreement (""director
            appointment right agreement"") which provides for Vodafone’s right to nominate for
            appointment one of the Safaricom directors appointed by Vodafone Kenya, and
            Vodafone’s right to cede its rights and delegate its obligations under the director
            appointment right agreement, and such agreement becoming unconditional in accordance
            with its terms, save for any condition requiring the agreement to become unconditional;
            and

     5.8    the receipt of an exemption, in a form acceptable to Vodacom Group, from the Capital
            Markets Authority of Kenya in terms of regulation 5(1) of the Capital Markets (Take-overs
            and Mergers) Regulations, 2002 (""regulations"") from compliance by Vodacom Group
            and/or Vodafone Kenya with any requirement under the regulations to make a mandatory
            offer to the remaining shareholders of Safaricom pursuant to the implementation of the
            proposed transaction.

6.   Warranties and indemnities

     As required by JSE Listings Requirements, Vodacom Group confirms that warranties and
     indemnities applicable to the proposed transaction are normal for transactions of this nature.

      Notes and assumptions:

      a) The Vodacom Group information reflected in the ""Before the proposed transaction"" column
         has been extracted from the published reviewed preliminary condensed consolidated
         financial statements of Vodacom Group for the year ended 31 March 2017.

      b) The effects on basic earnings, diluted earnings, headline earnings and diluted headline
         earnings are calculated on the basis that the proposed transaction was effective 1 April 2016,
         while the effects on the net asset value and net tangible asset value per share are calculated
         on the basis that the proposed transaction was effective 31 March 2017.

      c) Vodafone Kenya is an investment holding company, with its only material asset being the
         39.93% investment in Safaricom. Management has determined that Vodacom Group will,
         through the acquired interest in Vodafone Kenya, be able to exercise significant influence
         over Safaricom, but not control Safaricom. The acquisition by Vodacom Group of a controlling
         interest of 87.5% in Vodafone Kenya is therefore treated as the acquisition of a subsidiary
         that does not meet the definition of a business. The 39.93% equity interest that Vodafone
         Kenya holds in Safaricom is treated as an investment in an associate in terms of
         IAS 28: Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

         The equity accounting method has been used to account for Vodafone Kenya's equity interest
         in Safaricom. Under the equity method, the 39.93% investment is initially recognised at cost,
         including directly attributable transaction costs. A provisional fair value allocation of the
         investment in the associate was performed. The resulting notional goodwill, calculated as the
         difference between the cost of the investment and Vodafone Kenya’s share of the fair value
         of identifiable assets and liabilities of Safaricom is included in the carrying amount of the
         investment in associate. The identifiable tangible and intangible assets are assumed to be
         amortised over their respective useful lives as determined within the provisional fair value
         allocation exercise.

         Vodafone will retain a 12.5% non-controlling interest in Vodafone Kenya. On consolidation,
         12.5% of the net assets and earnings are therefore allocated to non-controlling interests.

         A detailed fair value allocation will be performed on the effective date of the proposed
         transaction and may differ from the assumptions underlying these pro forma financial effects.

      d) The financial information for Vodafone Kenya has been extracted from unaudited
         management accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017, while the financial information for
         Safaricom has been extracted from the audited condensed consolidated financial statements
         for the year ended 31 March 2017 as published on the NSE on Wednesday 10 May 2017.

      e) For accounting purposes the assumed purchase consideration is determined as follows:

         New Vodacom Group shares:

         226.8 million new Vodacom Group shares at a price of R152.49 per new Vodacom Group
         share, being the closing share price of Vodacom Group on Friday 12 May 2017, being the
         last practicable date prior to this announcement (the assumed price of the new Vodacom
         Group shares will be determined on the effective date of the proposed transaction and may
         differ from the assumptions underlying these pro forma financial effects).

         The number of new Vodacom Group shares has been fixed at 226.8 million, subject only to
         adjustment in respect of distributions to shareholders where the record date for such
         distribution is set to occur prior to the effective date. The pro forma financial effects have been
         prepared on the assumption that the fixed number of new Vodacom Group shares reflect fair
         value of the purchase consideration and equity interest in Safaricom on the assumed effective
         dates of the proposed transaction, which is 1 April 2016 for purposes of calculating the effect
         on basic earnings, diluted earnings, headline earnings and diluted headline earnings per
         share, and 31 March 2017 for purposes of calculating the effect on net asset value and
         tangible net asset value per share. The pro forma financial effects do not reflect any
         adjustments that may result from movements in the fair value of Vodacom Group, Safaricom,
         or the ZAR/KES exchange rate between the date of signing the agreements and the effective
         date of the proposed transaction.

         Furthermore, the pro forma financial effects do not consider potential adjustments to the
         purchase consideration arising pursuant to a Vodacom Group distribution.

         Cash consideration:

         Assumed cash consideration of R51 million in lieu of actual cash in Vodafone Kenya, being
         the Vodacom Group’s share of KES500 million less withholdings tax converted at 7.6867,
         being the closing ZAR/KES exchange rate at 31 March 2017.

     f)  Assumed directly attributable transaction costs (non-recurring) to the value of R417 million
         have been added to the purchase consideration which has consequently increased notional
         goodwill by the same value. This includes security transfer taxes of 1% of the assumed
         purchase consideration amounting to R346 million.

     g)  All effects are of a recurring nature except where otherwise noted.

     h)  Net tangible asset value is calculated as net asset value attributable to the owners of the
         parent, less the value of goodwill, other intangible assets and deferred tax assets attributable
         to the owner of the parent.


8.   Value and profits attributable to the net assets of Vodafone Kenya

     Vodafone Kenya is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vodafone and consequently does not prepare
     consolidated results. The results of Vodafone Kenya do not therefore include its share of the
     profits from its investment in Safaricom. The carrying value of the net assets of Vodafone Kenya
     as at 31 March 2017, being Vodafone Kenya’s most recent reporting date, is KES5 202 million,
     being an equivalent of R677 million (calculated at the closing ZAR/KES exchange rate at 31 March
     2017 of 7.6867) and profits attributable to the net assets for the year ended of KES23 297 million,
     being an equivalent of R3 205 million (calculated at an average ZAR/KES exchange rate for the
     year ended 31 March 2017 of 7.2699).

9.   Articles of association of Vodafone Kenya

     Vodacom Group confirms that the provisions of the articles of association of Vodafone Kenya will
     neither frustrate nor relieve Vodacom Group’s compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

10.  Dividend policy

     Vodacom Group intends to maintain its dividend policy of paying at least 90% of headline
     earnings, excluding the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom and any
     associated intangible amortisation. In addition, the company intends to distribute any dividend it
     receives from Safaricom, up to a maximum amount of the dividend received, net of withholding
     tax.

     Dividends will be paid after consideration of the factors below:

     Vodacom Group intends to pay as much of its after tax profits as will be available after retaining
     such sums and repaying such borrowings owing to third parties as shall be necessary to meet the
     requirements reflected in the budget and business plan, taking into account monies required for
     investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement to dividends arises and the
     date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject
     to the JSE Listings Requirements.

11.  Related party transaction

     The proposed transaction is a 'related party transaction' in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements
     as Vodacom Group will be transacting with a related party, being Vodafone. Vodafone is a material
     shareholder by virtue of being an indirect 65% shareholder in Vodacom Group and is also the
     direct 100% shareholder in Vodafone Kenya.

     The Vodacom Group Board appointed a committee consisting of independent directors who have
     unanimously approved the proposed transaction.

     The company appointed an independent expert, Deloitte & Touché, to provide a fairness opinion
     on the proposed transaction which will be included in the circular to be distributed to shareholders
     as referred to in paragraph 12 below.

12.  Categorisation of the proposed transaction

     The proposed transaction is further classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE
     Listings Requirements as the purchase consideration, being the issue of the new Vodacom Group
     shares and the cash consideration, is 5% or more, but less than 30% of Vodacom Group’s issued
     share capital and market capitalisation, respectively, as at the date of signature of the agreement.
     As the proposed transaction is categorised as a ‘related party transaction' and a 'Category 2
     transaction' in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a circular containing details of the
     proposed transaction, together with the fairness opinion referred to in paragraph 11 above, and a
     notice of general meeting will be posted to Vodacom Group shareholders in due course. Vodacom
     Group shareholders, other than Vodafone and its associates, will be required to approve the
     proposed transaction at the general meeting by means of an ordinary resolution.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

A year ago we said that the strategies that we have implemented to differentiate our network experience, to proactively change our pricing and to offer customers more value
through segmented and personalised offers, will continue to sustain revenue growth.

Our solid results this year show that we continue to make great progress against these strategic priorities with our performance driven, in particular, by strong customer growth in
South Africa, where we added close to three million customers, largely contributing to a 5.6% increase in service revenue growth. This was offset by the impact of currency volatility
and the anticipated effects of customer registrations and disconnections in our International operations, where service revenue declined by 5.6% (+2.2%*). Overall Group service
revenue grew 2.3% (4.4%*).

In South Africa, customers have responded positively to our segmented marketing approach and concerted efforts to increase bundle adoption engagement, particularly through
our 'Just 4 You' offers. This resulted in the sale of almost 1.5 billion bundles, an increase of 34.1% and ultimately in the increase in our Net Promoter Score lead over our next-best
competitor.

The sustained demand for data remains a key driver for growth with active data users up 8.3% in South Africa and 29.3% across our International operations. Data now comprises
36.3% (up from 31.9% a year ago) of Group service revenue and grew at 16.4%.

To solidify our network and service differentiation and support this continued growth, we invested R11.3 billion in our infrastructure of which R8.5 billion was in South Africa where
we expanded 4G coverage to 75.8% of the population and 3G to 99.8%. Over the past three years, capital expenditure across the Group will total at R37.5 billion with R25.9 billion in
South Africa alone.

Enterprise revenue continues to grow strongly at 9.9%. This year, our cloud and hosting revenue increased by 35.2%, and our IoT revenue was up 19.1%
to R662 million.

In our International operations, we have recovered from the customers disconnected in the prior year, adding 2.5 million customers for the year. Although short-term pressures
remain, we expect the introduction of 'Just 4 You' across all our operations and the continued success of M-Pesa to provide for improved commercial
execution to this portfolio. Fuelled by expanding distribution channels and the expansion of products and services on offer, we increased the number of customers that use M-Pesa
by 3.7 million to almost 13 million, contributing to a 19.4% rise in M-Pesa revenue.

In the past year, voice and data prices fell by 14.3% and 16.0% respectively in South Africa where significantly more customers benefitted from using bundles.
This brings the cumulative reduction in voice and data prices to 42.2% and 44.3% over the past three years. 
Still, we remain focussed on addressing out-of-bundle pricing and recently launched an enhanced smart notification service to encourage in-bundle usage.

Cognisant of our responsibility to increase digital and social connectivity in South Africa, we introduced 'Siyakha' in early 2017. Siyakha is a platform that offers zero-rated content
and lower priced products and services, which form part of our effort to help improve the lives of people that can least afford communication costs.

We have made significant strides in transformation, evident in our Level 2 contribution status which we achieved based on last year's ICT Sector BEE Codes. As of November 2016,
significant changes were made to the codes resulting in more stringent requirements and material amendment to the BBBEE status and recognition criteria. Had these criteria been
applied without management and the Board implementing remedial action, within a limited timeframe of three months, it would have resulted in achieving a Level 8 contributor
status. Through higher investment in transformation projects and introducing new transformation initiatives, we have achieved a Level 4 contribution status for this year's
assessment.

Looking ahead, we are fully alert to the changing regulatory and macroeconomic environments and have measures in place to ensure we have the agility to adapt to various relevant
scenarios.


Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue increased 5.6% to R52 071 million driven by strong customer additions, with good progress on data and enterprise services. Revenue grew by 3.9% to R64 729
million, hampered by the equipment revenue decline of 4.0%. This was mainly due to slightly lower device sales, which was impacted by the weakening of the rand against the US
dollar and Euro for most of the year.

Customers increased by 8.6% to 37.1 million, with 3.0 million customer net additions in the year, as our segmentation and bundle strategy continued to attract new customers.
Prepaid customers reached 32.0 million, up 9.3%, driven by the success of our improved value propositions through 'Just 4 You' offers, the successful launch of our youth (NXT LVL)
proposition and a highly engaging summer promotion. We added 218 000 contract customers during the year with improved loyalty leading to reduced contract churn of 4.2%,
while increasing contract ARPU by 2.8% to R408. Our bundle strategy, designed to make communication more affordable, continues to progress well and we sold a total of 1.5 billion
bundles, up 34.1%, in the period. Of these, one billion were voice bundles. This enabled us to reduce our effective price per minute by 14.3% to the benefit of customers. The success
of the personalised voice bundle strategy through our 'Just 4 You' platform has resulted in a slower voice revenue decline of 3.7%.

Data revenue grew 19.7% to R20 696 million, now comprises 39.7% of service revenue. As the strong demand for data continues, underlying drivers of growth remain strong
with data customers up 8.3% to 19.5 million and data traffic up 43.2%. This was enabled through growing our data network coverage and capacity as well as focussing our device
strategy on increasing 3G and 4G device uptake. 4G customers on our network increased 86.7% to 5.1 million, while the average monthly data usage on smartphones increased
25.0% to 560MB. Our data bundles sales grew by 44.8% to 495 million resulting in the reduction in the effective price per MB by 16.0% thereby continuing to give more value to our
customers. Our focus in the year ahead will be to transform data pricing to the benefit of customers, by reducing customer exposure to higher out of bundle rates.

Enterprise showed continued strong revenue growth of 12.7% (of which 2.8ppts relates to the impact of Autopage customer buy backs in the prior year) from customer win backs,
and now contributes 24.3% (2016: 22.8%) of service revenue. Mobile enterprise customer revenue grew 14.2% (of which 4.5ppts relates to the impact of Autopage customer buy
backs in the prior year) to R7 884 million. We have secured South Africa's national and provincial government department's mobile voice and data communications contract for a
period of four years. This award will enable us to partner with government to support greater innovation. Customer migration for this contract is expected to commence in the first
quarter. We are leveraging our network reliability and our leading mobile brand to move more deeply into fixed-line. Fixed-line and business managed services (BMS) revenue increased 8.3%
with growth in cloud and hosting revenue gaining further momentum as it increased by 35.2% in the year. Internet of things (IoT) revenue increased 19.1% to R662 million.

EBITDA increased 7.2% to R26 815 million with EBITDA margin expanding strongly by 1.2ppts to 41.4% due to strong focus on cost efficiencies and driven by sales margin
improvement. We focussed on driving efficiencies across all distribution channels. We rebalanced our subsidies towards data enabled devices, resulting in improved take up of data
services and improved returns. We benefitted from improved inventory management, reduced office accommodation spend as we rationalised offices and various network cost
savings. These cost saving initiatives have offset higher network operating costs due to increased number of sites and a trading foreign exchange net loss of R250 million (2016:
R531 million net gain).

Capital expenditure of R8 471 million allowed us to continue widening our 3G and 4G data coverage, improve voice quality and increase data speeds. 4G coverage increased to
75.8% of the population, up from 58.2% a year ago reaching over 7 900 sites. We extended our high-speed transmission to 92.1% of our sites. We completed the development of our
new customer management and billing systems to future proof our operations and have migrated all our consumer contract customers to this new platform. We also entered into a
commercial agreement with WBS that will enable us to roam on their 4G and 4G plus network.

Our focus on customer experience improvements through network enhancements, better value propositions and service, through our CARE initiative, has enabled us to increase
our customer satisfaction lead to 17 points over our nearest competitor as measured through the Net Promoter Score methodology. We have underpinned our best network
promise with our dropped call compensation guarantee, giving customers free minutes for calls dropped on our network. As customers become more digital, we are positioning
the MyVodacom app as customers' primary interaction channel with Vodacom for people with smartphones. The app enables a number of self-help features, up to date bundle and
balance information with an easy interface to buy our bundles. We continue to drive higher usage of the app through promotional offers and consistent improvement of the app, to
deliver improved functionality.

International

Service revenue declined 5.6% (up 2.2%*) to R16 775 million, impacted by exchange rate volatility and the anticipated effect of the disconnection of customers, most notably in
the prior year, in compliance with customer registration requirements in DRC, Mozambique and Tanzania. Short-term pressure remains, with signs of improvement in Tanzania, very
strong execution in Mozambique and Lesotho, but a challenging macro environment in the DRC. We have introduced 'Just 4 You' personalised offers across all our operations and
take up is progressing well. M-Pesa continues to be a key area of growth.

Customers increased 9.3% to 29.7 million as the International operations have returned to positive net additions of 2.5 million in the year. We continue to improve our customer
registration processes as we work closely with regulators to ensure full compliance in all our operations.

Data revenue grew 2.3% (9.4%*) to R4 113 million driven by a 29.3% increase in data customers to 13.0 million, reflecting strong demand for mobile data services in all
our markets, offset by strong pricing competition, mainly in Tanzania and the DRC. We continue to focus on our commercial and network offering to drive data growth, ensuring
customers have access to better low cost smart devices, especially Vodacom branded devices, increasing data network speeds and driving the adoption of data bundles. Improving
monetisation of the substantial growth opportunity in data in all operations is a key priority for the next financial year.

M-Pesa revenue increased 19.4% to R1.9 billion, fuelled by expansion in the distribution channels and expansion of the products and services on offer. We added 3.7 million
customers, increasing the number of customers to 12.9 million1. Tanzania launched an M-Pesa app for smartphones that has unique features to improve customer experience
such as QR code payments, easier access to contacts and predefined amounts. Mozambique has made significant progress in the year, 2.5 million customers representing 48% of
its customer base are now using the M-Pesa service while Tanzania leads at 63% penetration of its customer base. DRC has reached over two million customers as they focussed
on distribution and realignment of the business model. We have implemented a new M-Pesa platform in all operations except Lesotho with enhanced technology which has
significantly improved stability, resulting in increased trust with customers which is a key attribute for success. The system continues to grow from its roots of person to person
transfers, now also incorporating complete merchant payment system, bill payments, a salary payment system, as well as savings and loans products for customers. In Tanzania
alone, we now transact US$1 billion in value each month.

EBITDA declined 15.6% normalised declined 8.6%* to R4 545 million and the EBITDA margin contracted by 3.1ppts to 26.2%. A number of actions to mitigate the impact of the
slowed revenue growth in the year helped to offset the impact on margins. These included sales margin improvement through the promotion of own channels such as M-Pesa for
recharge, restructuring to drive improved efficiencies and continued savings in network operating expenses through our ""Fit for growth"" savings programme.

Capital expenditure of R2 833 million represented 16.3% of revenue. We continue to invest significantly in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation and to
support data growth and wider voice coverage. We added 284 4G sites, 888 3G sites and 536 2G sites since March 2016.

Regulatory matters
South Africa Integrated information and communication technology ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. Vodacom supports the objectives of the White Paper
to make broadband more accessible and affordable for all. However, as it now stands, we do not believe the White Paper will achieve these objectives.

1.Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 90 days, of these 10.0 million have been active in the past 30 days.

The Group believes the White Paper, in its current form, contains a number of policy elements and interventions which are unclear and require more detail. For the White Paper to
have legal effect, a number of new laws would need to be promulgated and/or existing laws amended. Consultation with all stakeholders would be required to give effect to these
changes.

Since publication a number of initial exploratory meetings for implementation of the policy paper between the Minister and industry were held with the objective of finding a
workable solution to meet South Africa's social and economic objectives. The result was a unified proposal presented to the Minister by six of the country's main mobile and fixed
operators. The proposal outlined the operators' vision of the creation of a wholesale access network, while still allowing current operators the opportunity to access high demand
spectrum. The outcome of this is still to be determined.

Listing of Vodacom Tanzania

In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed the Finance Act, 2016 which amends listing requirements under the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, to introduce
mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their authorised share capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar es
Salaam stock exchange (DSE).

Vodacom Tanzania opened its offer in compliance with the legislation on 9 March 2017 and the offer period closed on 11 May 2017. Vodacom Tanzania will announce the allotment
of shares from 19 May 2017 onwards and commence trading on the DSE on 6 June 2017.

Outlook

The significant investments that we have made in our networks and IT infrastructure over the past three years continue to bear fruit. This, coupled with our segmented marketing
approach and personalised pricing strategy, is resonating with an increasing number of customers. This continues to be evident in our customer satisfaction scores, customer
additions and improved loyalty resulting in lower contract churn and higher engagement with customers buying bundles.

Our International operations have recovered customers that were disconnected, most notably in the prior year, to comply with stricter customer registration requirements.
Mozambique and Lesotho continue to perform well and we are seeing improvements in our operational performance in Tanzania. The DRC continues to face political and macro
economic pressure, which we will monitor.

Our key growth areas remain robust, including data, for which customer demand remains strong. In all our markets, there is still an opportunity to monetise this growth even further
by growing the base through wider network coverage and pushing uptake of data enabled devices, while innovating in the areas of pricing and content to drive customer take up. A
key focus area in the year ahead will be data pricing transformation in South Africa to reduce exposure to out of bundle rates, and improving data monetisation in our International
operations. M-Pesa has achieved scale in both DRC and Mozambique, and the growth in new products and services across all our International operations will continue to support
the growth of this key revenue stream.

Our enterprise business continues to grow as we enable more services, expand operational scale and as customers migrate their IT infrastructure to the cloud.

We continue to engage with government and regulators to resolve delays in the allocation of new spectrum, while currency fluctuations across all our markets remain a key risk.

We target Group service revenue growth of mid-single digit, previously low-to-mid single digit, Group EBIT growth of mid-to-high single digit and capital intensity of 12-14% of Group
revenue over the next three years. The change to an EBIT target reflects a change in management short term incentive targets, which are now based on EBIT, previously EBITDA. The
main aim of this is to align to the Board's objective of optimising capital allocation and maximising returns on investments. These targets are on average, over the next three years
and are on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases and any merger and acquisition activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our
markets and stable macro and regulatory environments.

Group service revenue increased 2.3% (4.4%*) to R68 286 million, underpinned by net customer additions of 5.5 million and data revenue growth of 16.4%. Data revenue 
contributes 36.3% of Group service revenue compared to 31.9% a year ago. Revenue grew at a slower pace of 1.5% (3.4%*)
to R81 278 million due to equipment revenue declining by 4.4%, mainly due to lower sales volumes in South Africa resulting from higher selling prices which were impacted by
currency volatility in the first half of this year

In South Africa, service revenue increased 5.6% stemming from the growth in mobile data revenue, net customer additions of 3.0 million and enterprise revenue growth.
In our International operations, service revenue declined 5.6% (up 2.2%*) supported by increased data revenue as we recovered the majority of customers disconnected in the prior
year. Overall growth has however slowed as a result of the disconnections made in compliance with regulation in the prior year and volatility of foreign exchange in the current year.

Group total expenses increased 0.3% to R50 119 million, below revenue growth of 1.5%, as our cost saving initiatives aided in offsetting higher costs due to inflation, site growth and
negative foreign currency impacts. These expenses include a net foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated trading items of R331 million (2016:
R383 million net gain).

In South Africa, total expenses increased 1.7%. Savings were achieved mainly in direct costs due to strong focus on cost efficiencies, especially in sales margin improvement. We
focussed on driving efficiencies across all distribution channels as we rebalanced our subsidies towards data enabled devices and improved returns. Excluding the impact of trading
foreign exchange, total expenses decreased by 0.3%.

In our International operations, expenses were well contained to mitigate the impact of slower revenue growth. Total expenses decreased by 2.6% (up 5.7%*). Savings were realised
mainly from network and maintenance costs. These costs include the costs of rebranding in the DRC of US$5.2 million.

Net finance charges increased 13.9% to R2 522 million. The average cost of debt increased to 8.3% from 7.4% in the prior year mainly due to an average 1.0ppt increase in JIBAR. The
average debt increased by 13.8% due to the draw down on a R4 000 million Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l facility to finance capital expenditure. On 31 March 2017, the
Group repaid R1 470 million on a three year Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. loan with a nominal value of R3 000 million. The R481 million net loss on the remeasurement
and disposal of financial instruments mainly relates to foreign currency denominated intergroup loans held by Mozambique and Tanzania, offset by a gain on forward exchange
contract (FEC) revaluation in the current year of R166 million (2016: loss of R361 million).


Taxation

The tax expense of R6 102 million was 2.8% higher than the prior year (2016: R5 934 million) in line with growth in operating profit. The Group's effective tax rate increased to 31.7%
from 31.5%. During the year Tanzania recognised a one-off tax adjustment relating to the disposal of network assets to HTT. The adjustment contributed 1.4ppts to the Group's
effective tax rate. This increase was mostly offset by a decline in non-deductible items (-1.1ppts) and the loss from associate in the prior year not recurring (-0.4ppts).


Earnings

Basic earnings per share increased 3.9% to 915 cents while headline earnings per share increased 4.5% or 40 cents to reach 923 cents per share for the year. The strong contribution
from EBITDA was mostly offset by increased depreciation (-35cps) and net finance cost (-38cps) which increased due to higher interest rates and average net debt. HEPS benefitted
from a decline in net loss on re-measurement and disposal of financial instruments (+17cps), an increase in losses attributed to non-controlling interests (+20cps). In addition the
prior year non-recurring loss recognised from HTT as well as the DRC restructuring cost, positively impacted HEPS by (29cps) in the current year.

The Group's capital expenditure decreased by 12.3% to R11 292 million as we exit our period of capex acceleration, representing 13.9% of revenue. In South Africa, capital
expenditure was directed at accelerating our 3G capacity and extending 4G coverage to 75.8%. We increased the number of self-provided sites for high-speed transmission to 92.1%.
In our International operations, the focus remained on increasing both coverage and capacity thereby adding 284 4G sites, 888 3G sites and 536 2G sites since March 2016.

Statement of financial position

Property, plant and equipment increased 1.1% to R40 181 million and intangible assets decreased by 3.5% to R9 186 million compared to 31 March 2016. The combined increase is
mainly as a result of net additions of R11 207 million, offset by depreciation and amortisation of R9 251 million and foreign currency translation differences of R2 299 million.

Net debt increased R1 197 million to R22 484 million. The increase in non-current borrowings supports investment in our networks and information technology infrastructure.

management and lower capital expenditure for the Group. Tax paid increased in line with higher profits from tax paying companies and net finance cost spend increased as a result of
a higher net debt position, coupled with slightly higher interest during the year.

8.     Non-current assets held for sale
       During the prior year, the Board approved a plan to exit its investment in Helios Towers Tanzania Limited
       (Helios) through a sale of shares which was expected to be completed within the current financial year.
       Due to circumstances beyond the Group's control, the sale has been delayed beyond the initial
       expected closing period. The Board as well as the purchaser, HTA Holdings Ltd (HTA) remain committed
       to the transaction and are currently in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in
       order to effect the sale. It is highly probable that the sale will be completed in the next financial year,
       and the investment therefore continues to be classified as a non-current asset held for sale. US$30
       million of the associated shareholder's loan, comprising the nominal value of US$22 million and
       accrued interest thereon, has been purchased by HTA. The Group has not recognised any impairment
       losses in respect of its investment, since the proceeds are expected to exceed the carrying value of the
       investment.

9.     Borrowings
       During the current year the Group drew on a facility from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l.
       with a nominal value of R4 000 million, which will be used primarily for capital expenditure. The loan
       bears interest payable quarterly at three-month JIBAR plus 1.57%, is unsecured and repayable on 29
       July 2021.

       The Group repaid R1 470 million on a 3 year, R3 000 million Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l
       loan on 31 March 2017, reducing the capital balance to R1 530 million. The loan bears interest at
       three-month JIBAR plus 1.15% and is repayable on 24 November 2017.

10.    Business combinations
       During the current year, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Shared Networks
       Tanzania Limited from its shareholders for a consideration of US$15 million, less a working capital
       adjustment of US$4 million. The fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired amounted to US$11
       million. The goodwill represents future synergies, and is allocated to the Group's Tanzania cash-
       generating unit.

       which amounted to R119 million (2016: R113 million).

       Foreign denominated guarantees amounting to R1 005 million (2016: R1 102 million) are in issue in
       support of Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA relating to liabilities included in the consolidated statement of
       financial position.

11.2   Tax matters
       The Group is regularly subject to an evaluation by tax authorities of its direct and indirect tax filings. The
       consequence of such reviews is that disputes can arise with tax authorities over the interpretation or
       application of certain tax rules applicable to the Group's business. These disputes may not necessarily
       be resolved in a manner that is favourable to the Group. Additionally, the resolution of the disputes
       could result in an obligation to the Group. The Group has made sufficient provision for any losses
       arising from tax exposures that are more likely to occur than not.

11.3   Legal contingencies
       The Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has, in consultation with its legal
       counsel, assessed the outcome of these proceedings. Following this assessment, the Group's
       management has determined, that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal
       proceedings as at 31 March 2017.

11.4   Kenneth Makate (Mr Makate) vs Vodacom (Pty) Limited
       Negotiations with Mr Makate in accordance with the Constitutional Court order to determine a
       reasonable compensation for a business idea that led to a product known as 'Please Call Me'
       commenced but were interrupted by Mr Makate's application to the Constitutional Court for the
       variation of its original order. The Constitutional Court dismissed Mr Makate's application and
       negotiations have since resumed.

12.    Other matters
12.1   Competition Commission Complaints
12.1.1 Cell C On/Off-Net Complaint against Vodacom (Pty) Limited (the Company)
       During October 2013 Cell C lodged a complaint with the Competition Commission of South Africa. It
       was alleged that the Group's South African business had abused its market dominance in contravention
       of Section 8 of the Competition Act. The Competition Commission investigated this complaint and on
       18 April 2017 the Commission announced its decision not to refer the matter to the competition
       tribunal due to insufficient evidence required to successfully prosecute.

12.1.2 Facilities leasing and roaming agreements between Vodacom (Pty) Limited (the Company) and Wireless
       Business Solutions (Pty) Limited (WBS)
       During the current year the Company concluded facilities leasing, services and roaming agreements
       between the Company and WBS. MTN and Cell C have raised complaints with both the sector regulator,
       the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), and the Competition Commission.
       The Competition Commission is determining whether the roaming arrangement between the Company
       and WBS is a notifiable merger under the Competition Act, Act 89 of 1998. ICASA, on the other hand, is
       conducting an enquiry to determine whether this transaction contravenes the requirements of the
       Electronic Communications Act 2005, Act 36 of 2005, as amended.

12.2   G.H. Investments (GHI) and Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA (Vodacom Congo)
       Vodacom Congo contracted GHI to install ultra-low cost base stations on a revenue share basis. Shortly
       after rolling out the first sites GHI sought to renegotiate the contractual terms, which Vodacom Congo
       declined. GHI then accused Vodacom Congo of infringing its intellectual property rights and demanded
       payment of compensation in the sum of US$1.16 billion. In July 2016, Vodacom Congo filed a request
       for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce's International Court of Arbitration (ICC). In
       its replying papers to the arbitration process, GHI has revised its claim to US$256 million.

12.3   Mr Puati vs Vodacom Congo
       A patent infringement claim was filed in July 2016 against Vodacom Congo. The plaintiff is asking the
       Commercial Court of Kinshasa/Gombe, inter alia, to prohibit Vodacom Congo from providing the
       M-Pesa service and to order Vodacom Congo to pay damages of US$200 million for losses resulting
       from the alleged patent infringement. A hearing was held in December 2016, and the matter has been
       referred to the Public Prosecutor (in accordance with procedural rules of the Democratic Republic of
       the Congo) for an opinion, before a judgement is delivered.

12.4   Customer registration
       In each country where the Group is subject to customer registration requirements, the Group continues
       to register customers to achieve compliance, and also continues to participate in government and
       industry co-ordinated meetings overseeing the implementation and improved efficiency of the
       registration processes. This includes introducing electronic registration and verification processes
       common to all operators, working with government to extend national identification document
       databases for verification, and information and education to both customers and dealers about the
       importance of complying with registration requirements.

12.5   Radio frequency spectrum licences
       On 30 September 2016 the Pretoria High Court granted an application by the Ministry of
       Telecommunications and Postal Services (the Ministry) interdicting ICASA from implementing the
       spectrum licencing process contemplated in the Invitation to Apply (ITA) for the licensing of spectrum
       in the 700MHz, 800MHz and 2600MHz bands, pending the outcome of a judicial review on the
       lawfulness of the ICASA ITA.

12.6   Integrated information and communication technology (ICT) Policy White Paper (White Paper)
       On 3 October 2016, the Ministry published a White Paper on ICT policy. The White Paper, inter-alia,
       proposes the establishment of a wholesale access network which will be the sole beneficiary of any
       new high demand spectrum that will be allocated, and open access obligations for existing networks.
       The White Paper is a statement of policy intent and to give effect to it, new laws or amendments to
       existing laws would have to be passed by Parliament.

12.7   Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE)
       The ICT Sector BEE Code (the new Code), as amended, was gazetted in November 2016, with the
       effective date being 1 April 2016. One of the most noticeable changes in the new Code is that the
       scorecard BBBEE level recognition has changed materially and, if applied without remedy, would have
       resulted in the Vodacom BBBEE status dropping from Level 2 to Level 8. The Group has introduced new
       initiatives, and is aiming to achieve a level 4 BBBEE status for the 2017 financial year of assessment,
       which is currently being assessed, with the certificate to be issued on 31 May 2017.

12.8   Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company listing requirement
       In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed the Finance Act, 2016 which amends listing
       requirements under the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010 (EPOCA), to introduce
       mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their
       authorised share capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange
       (DSE).

       On 16 November 2016, Vodacom Tanzania Limited was converted from a private company to a public
       company, Vodacom Tanzania Public Limited Company (Vodacom Tanzania). On 25 November 2016,
       Vodacom Tanzania submitted its applications for an IPO and listing to the Capital Markets and
       Securities Authority (CMSA) and DSE, respectively. The DSE and CMSA approved the applications on 17
       February 2017 and 28 February 2017, respectively. The IPO opened on 9 March 2017 and closed on 11
       May 2017. The listing of shares is expected to take place on 6 June 2017.

12.9   Vodacom Congo
       Vodacom Congo is not in compliance with the equity requirements of the Organisation for the
       Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Vodacom Congo would need to increase its share
       capital to meet the minimum OHADA requirement. This matter is currently being discussed by the
       Board and shareholders of Vodacom Congo. No agreement has yet been achieved between the parties.

13.    Events after the reporting period
       The Board is not aware of any matter or circumstance arising since the end of the reporting period, not
       otherwise dealt with herein, which significantly affects the financial position of the Group or the results
       of its operations or cash flows for the period, other than the following:

       Dividend declared after the reporting date and not recognised as a liability

       A final dividend of R6 473 million (435 cents per ordinary share) for the year ended 31 March 2017, was
       declared on 12 May 2017, payable on 26 June 2017 to shareholders recorded in the register at the
       close of business on 23 June 2017. The net dividend after taking into account dividend withholding tax
       for those shareholders not exempt from dividend withholding tax is 348.00000 cents per share.

       1. Level one classification is used when the valuation is determined using quoted prices in an active
          market.
       2. Level two classification is used when valuation inputs used to determine fair value are observable
          for the asset/(liability), either directly as prices or indirectly when derived from prices.
       3. Level three classification is used when unobservable valuation inputs are used to determine the fair
          value for the asset/(liability).

The reconciliations present normalised growth adjusted for trading foreign exchange gains/losses and at a constant currency (using current period as base) from on-going
operations.

Notes:
1. The reported percentage change relates to the year-on-year percentage growth from 31 March 2016 to 31 March 2017. The Group's presentation
   currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar,
   Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. 
2. Trading foreign exchange (FX) are foreign exchange gains/losses on foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulting from trading
   activities of entities within the Group.
3. Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's
   presentation currency, being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the year ended 31March 2017 (which
   is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the year) to 31 March 2016 numbers, thereby
   giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange variances.
4. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth. The Group's presentation currency is the
   South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling,
   Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha.
5. Translation foreign exchange (FX) arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's

Forward-looking statements

This announcement which sets out the annual results for Vodacom Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2017 contains 'forward-looking statements', which have not been
reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors, with respect to the Group's financial condition, results of operations and businesses and certain of the Group's plans and objectives.
In particular, such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: expectations regarding the Group's financial condition or results of
operations including the confirmation of the Group's targets, expectations for the Group's future performance generally; expectations regarding the operating environment and
market conditions and trends; intentions and expectations regarding the development, launch and expansion of products, services and technologies; growth in customers and

expectations regarding the integration or performance of current and future investments, associates, joint ventures, non-controlled interests and newly acquired businesses.

Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as ""will"", ""anticipates"", ""aims"", ""could"", ""may"", ""should"",
""expects"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""plans"" or ""targets"" (including in their negative form). By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual
results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
changes in economic or political conditions in markets served by operations of the Group; greater than anticipated competitive activity; higher than expected costs or capital
expenditures; slower than expected customer growth and reduced customer retention; changes in the spending patterns of new and existing customers; the Group's ability to
expand its spectrum position or renew or obtain necessary licences; the Group's ability to achieve cost savings; the Group's ability to execute its strategy in fibre deployment, network
expansion, new product and service roll-outs, mobile data, Enterprise and broadband; changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as changes in interest rates; the Group's ability to
realise benefits from entering into partnerships or joint ventures and entering into service franchising and brand licensing; unfavourable consequences to the Group of making and
integrating acquisitions or disposals; changes to the regulatory framework in which the Group operates; the impact of legal or other proceedings; loss of suppliers or disruption of
supply chains; developments in the Group's financial condition, earnings and distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into account when determining levels of
dividends; the Group's ability to satisfy working capital and other requirements; changes in statutory tax rates or profit mix; and/or changes in tax legislation or final resolution of
open tax issues.

All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company, to any member of the Group or to any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

I am pleased with what we achieved in the quarter. Performance was driven by strong customer growth in South Africa and strong data demand. In
our International operations the effect of customer disconnections in Q4 of the prior year are still impacting its performance. Group service revenue
growth of 1.3% was impacted by the strengthening of the rand to reporting currencies in our International operations, excluding which, normalised
growth was 4.4%*.

Strong growth in South Africa was delivered through our strategy of sustained investment in network infrastructure, growing data demand and
successful execution of our pricing strategy. This includes the continued impact of our segmented pricing offers, a key highlight of this quarter.
Combined with our network advantage and delivering value for money propositions, this contributed to almost 700 000 new customers joining our
network in South Africa this quarter, showcasing the success of our focus on bundle adoption through 'Just 4 You,' our youth proposition under the
NXTLVL banner and our summer campaign. Strong growth in data demand outstripped declining voice revenues with service revenue growth of 5.5%
to R13.4 billion in South Africa.

In our International operations, we added 876 000 customers in the quarter mirroring the positive trend that we reported in front at our Interim
Results, as we continue to claw back many of the customers disconnected during Q4 of the prior year. Challenging conditions in the DRC were offset
by a better performance in Tanzania and sustained growth in Mozambique resulting in a 3.4%* increase in normalised International service revenue.

The strong demand for data continues with traffic growth of 44.8% in South Africa and 61.7% across our International operations. Data now comprises
40.8% (from 35.3% a year ago) of service revenue in South Africa and 25.2% (from 22.5% a year ago) in the International operations. To support this
continued growth and to strengthen our network and service differentiation, we invested R2.7 billion in our infrastructure including R2.1 billion in
South Africa where we expanded 4G coverage to 70% of the population and 3G to 99%. Including the current period, capital expenditure across
the Group will total at R40.6 billion over a three-year period with R27.4 billion in South Africa alone.

As part of our effort to continuously reduce the cost to communicate in South Africa through our bundle pricing strategy, voice and data prices fell by
17.6% and 15.4% respectively as significantly more prepaid and contract customers benefitted from using bundles. Over the past four years we have
reduced the price of data by more than 60%. Another significant win in helping bridge the digital divide was the introduction of a 4G device below the
key R1 000 price-point to add to the success of the Smart Kicka 2, a low-priced yet high quality 3G smartphone.

The unavailability of spectrum, further delayed by the publication of the White Paper by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services in
October last year, remains a concern. We have been involved in a number of positive engagements with relevant industry stakeholders as we seek to
find a workable solution to make broadband even more accessible and affordable for South Africans. This is the express objective of the White Paper
and Vodacom is aligned with this goal.

* Normalised growth adjusted at a constant currency using the current year as the base. Refer below for a reconciliation of
  adjustments. All growth rates quoted are year-on-year growth rates and refer to the quarter ended 31 December 2016 compared
  to the quarter ended 31 December 2015, unless stated otherwise.


Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue growth was sustained at 5.5% to R13 410 million underpinned by solid customer net additions and continued growth in data demand.
The declining trend in equipment revenue reversed to a growth of 1.6%. Device sales volumes increased as a result of improved selling prices, which
were aided by the stronger rand against major currencies. This resulted in overall revenue growth of 4.9% to R17 142 million.

Our segmented pricing offers, catering for specific customer needs continues to deliver strong results. Nearly a million youth customers have
registered for our youth proposition 'NXTLVL', while 'Just 4 You' personalised offers continue to boost bundle sales and engagement.

Active customers increased 6.7% reaching 36.4 million following a successful summer campaign and our bundle proposition resonated with
customers. Customer adoption of affordable bundles continues to improve. During the quarter we sold 418 million bundles up 34.8%. The number of
bundle users increased 13.3% to 16.3 million. Active prepaid customers increased 6.8% to 31.2 million largely due to the success of our personalised
'Just 4 You' offers. Prepaid ARPU was down as we continue to attract value seeking customers. Active contract customers increased by 143 000 in the
quarter to 5.2 million with contract ARPU up 1.2% to R414. ARPU growth was impacted by the customer disconnections of 75 000 by Altech Autopage
(Pty) Limited and consequent revenue deferral release of R102 million in the prior year, excluding which ARPU grew 3.6%.

Voice revenue declined 6.2%, due to the lapping of the 'Just 4 You' launch in the prior year, and a one-off impact from Altech Autopage (Pty) Limited in
the prior year. Underlying voice revenue decline was 4.6%.

Data revenue growth improved to 22.0% to R5 473 million. Data now makes up 40.8% of service revenue compared to 35.3% a year ago, with active
data customers up 4.9% to 19.3 million. Improvements made to our out-of-data-bundle notification journey have resulted in an improved customer
experience by giving customers more control. This together with the success of our pricing strategy of making data more affordable to all customers
has resulted in a 49.0% increase in bundle sales and an overall effective price per MB reduction of 15.4%. Smartphone sales volumes accelerated this
quarter, up 29.0%, comprising 62.3% of device sales. We added 1.1 million 4G customers in the quarter to reach 4.8 million as devices became more
affordable. We launched a new 4G device at sub R1 000 in the quarter. Active smart devices on the network increased 23.1% to 16.6 million with the
average monthly data usage on these devices at 667MB contributing to the 44.8% improvement in data traffic.

Enterprise continues to grow with revenue up 13.6%1 and now contributed 24.5% (2016: 22.2%) of service revenue. Supported by our strategic
enterprise partnerships with IBM and SAP HANA. Our fixed-line and business managed services revenue grew 29.1% and our cloud and hosting services
delivered strong revenue growth of 25.8%. Our mobile customer revenue delivered strong growth of 12.1%1 to R2 027 million as we continue to add
new customers. Internet of things (IoT) connections increased 29.3% to 2.8 million. We have secured certain mobile, voice and data communications
contracts with national and provincial government departments' for a period of four years.

1. Growth excluding the impact from the acquisition of Autopage in the prior year.

Capital expenditure of R2.1 billion in the quarter allowed us to expand 4G population coverage to 70.0%, up from 54.1% a year ago. We extended our
high-speed transmission to 91.4% of our sites. As data demand continues to grow exponentially we entered into a commercial agreement to roam on
the newly built data network of Wireless Business Solution (WBS) for additional capacity.


International

Service revenue declined 8.2% to R4 206 million, impacted by the improvement of the rand against mainly the US dollar and continued weakness
in the Mozambican metical. Normalised for currency translation effects, underlying growth was up 3.4%*. The improvement in underlying trend
was driven by better performance in Tanzania benefitting from the launch of 'Just 4 You' in August, sustained growth in Mozambique through strong
commercial execution, offset by challenging trading conditions in the DRC and the impacts from customer registration requirements in the majority of
our markets.

Active customers are down 7.5% to 28.8 million as a result of disconnections during the fourth quarter of the prior year, in compliance with customer
registration requirements. We have managed to claw back a significant amount of these customers resulting in positive trends in net customer
additions, adding 876 000 customers in the quarter.

Mobile data revenue grew 2.6% (12.8%*) driven by a 12.4% increase in active data customers to 12.6 million, representing 43.8% of the active
customer base. Data traffic grew 61.7%, reflecting strong demand for mobile data services in all our markets. Mobile data revenue now comprised
25.2% (2016: 22.5%) of International service revenue.

M-Pesa revenue continues to grow strongly at 12.4% (17.4%*). We added 1.1 million customers in the quarter to reach 12.0 million2. Tanzania continues
to improve on the M-Pesa offering with 39% of airtime purchases going through the M-Pesa system in the quarter compared to 32% in the prior year.
DRC has more than doubled their number of customers, and in Mozambique 42.6% of customers are now using the service.

2. Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 90 days,of these 8.8 million have been active in the past 30 days.

Capital expenditure of R612 million enabled us to continue to invest in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation and to
support data growth and wider voice coverage. During the quarter, 2G and 3G sites increased 8.4% and 32.1% respectively.


Regulatory matters

South Africa Integrated information and communication technology ICT Policy White Paper (White Paper)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. We support the
objectives of the White Paper to make broadband more accessible and affordable for all. However, as it now stands, we do not believe the White Paper
will achieve these objectives.

The Group believes the White Paper, as it currently stands, contains a number of policy elements and interventions which are unclear and require more
detail. For the White Paper to have legal effect, a number of new laws would need to be promulgated and/or existing laws amended. Consultation with
all stakeholders would be required to give effect to these changes.

Initial exploratory meetings for implementation of the policy paper between the Minister and industry were held during November and December with
the objective of finding a workable solution to meet South Africa's social and economic objectives.

The Invitation to Apply (ITA) for high demand spectrum issued by ICASA, which is a polar opposite approach to the White Paper, remains subject to legal
challenge from the Ministry, the outcome of which is still pending.

Listing of Vodacom Tanzania

In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed The Finance Act, 2016 which amends listing requirements under the Electronic and Postal
Communication Act, 2010, to introduce mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their
authorised share capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar es Salaam stock exchange (DSE) within six months from 1 July 2016 (listing
requirements).

Vodacom Tanzania submitted its prospectus with the Capital Markets and Securities Authority Tanzania (CMSA) during November 2016 and is awaiting
approval before the offering can proceed.

Notes:

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers
   paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active
   whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles used. Active data customers are based on the
   number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access to
   corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are
   paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), previously machine-to-machine, is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central
   station without direct relationship with an end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active
   customers during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and
   contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international
   roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers
   paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active
   whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are based on the number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on
   integrated tariff plans, or who have access to corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during the
   month. A user is defined as being active if they are paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the
   reported month.
3. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active
   customers during the period.
4. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customer during the period.

Notes:

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers
   paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active
   whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers have been restated to exclude customers with free allocated data bundles used. Active data customers are based on the
   number of unique users generating billable data traffic during the month. Also included are users on integrated tariff plans, or who have access to
   corporate APNs, and users who have been allocated a revenue generating data bundle during this month. A user is defined as being active if they are
   paying a contractual monthly fee for this service or have used the service during the reported month.
3. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active
   customers during the period.
4. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue during the period by the average monthly active customers. Prepaid and
   contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:

1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth between 31 December 2015 and
   31 December 2016. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional
   currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing
   exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed below.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's
   presentation currency, being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the quarter 31 December 2016 average rate (which is
   derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the quarter) to 31 December 2015 quarter
   numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange rate variances. The prevailing exchange rates for the current
   and comparative quarters are disclosed below.

Forward-looking statements

This update which sets out the quarterly results for Vodacom Group Limited for the three months ended 31 December 2016, contains 'forward-
looking statements', which have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors, with respect to the Group's financial condition, results of
operations and businesses and certain of the Group's plans and objectives. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements relating
to: the Group's future performance; future capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, expenses, revenues, financial conditions, dividend policy,
and future prospects; business and management strategies relating to the expansion and growth of the Group; the effects of regulation of the Group's
businesses by governments in the countries in which it operates; the Group's expectations as to the launch and roll out dates for products, services
or technologies; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions; growth in customers and usage; and the rate of dividend
growth by the Group.

Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as 'will', 'anticipates', 'aims',
'could', 'may', 'should', 'expects', 'believes', 'intends', 'plans' or 'targets'. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative
and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future, involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other facts or factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Group, or its industry to
be materially different from any results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on assumptions regarding the Group's present and future business strategies and
the environments in which it operates now and in the future.

All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or any member thereof or any persons acting on their behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above and below. Vodacom expressly disclaims any liability in respect of the

14 November 2016

Shameel Joosub
Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Our strategy of maintaining a network advantage and delivering value for money continues to reap rewards, despite a low growth economic environment in South Africa and
short-term impacts from customer registration requirements within our International operations.

The Group delivered solid service revenue growth of 5.3%, led by a 2.3 million increase in active customers since March 2016, mostly in South Africa.

In South Africa data remains a key contributor to growth, driven by a high demand for data services. We are actively driving down the cost of data encouraging more customers to
use bundles in order to maximise the value they receive for their money. We assist our customers to remain in-bundle and save money through notifications. This has resulted in
greater momentum in bundle usage growth, with 9.3 million customers now buying more than 223 million data bundles. In addition, as a result of our efforts to make data more
affordable, the effective price per megabyte has declined by 13% in the period or 61% over the past four years. Voice price per minute also declined by 14.3% or 52% over the past
four years. These figures show that our pricing transformation strategy, adopted three years ago, is working to deliver improved value to all South Africans.

We believe that the great offers available through our personalised 'Just 4 You' platform has improved the value perceptions with customers and contributed to the strong 5.7% growth in active customers.

We are very pleased with Enterprise revenue growth of 8.9%1. We have won significant contracts from corporate customers and in the public sector. A major highlight includes securing the
national and provincial government departments' mobile voice and data communications contract for a period of four years. 

We have intensified our focus on customer service through our CARE initiative which, as a result of our investments, has further secured a significant lead in terms of Net Promoter Scores, 
which measures customer satisfaction over our next-best competitor. We are compensating our customers for calls which are dropped on our network to support our claim of being the ""best network"".

As expected, our International operations have been impacted by customer registration requirements. Nonetheless, we witnessed encouraging net additions to our active customer
base in the second quarter while M-Pesa revenue achieved stellar growth of 36.8%. There are now 10.9 million customers using M-Pesa in our International operations. Our network
advantage has provided us with flexibility when navigating our International operations through these short-term pressures and we remain squarely focussed on the long-term
potential of our International businesses. Nonetheless, I would note the deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions both in the DRC and Mozambique which we are monitoring
closely.

With prices coming down and data usage growing rapidly, networks require continuous significant capital investment to provide greater capacity and coverage. We invested R5.7
billion into our networks in the first half of the year. Over the last three years, across all our operations the total investment was a massive R37 billion.

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue grew 5.6% to R25 463 million aided by strong customer net additions and increased data demand. Revenue grew 3.8% to R31 446 million, impacted by a 5.2%
decrease in equipment revenue as a result of lower sales volumes as consumer spending remained under pressure and the pricing of devices was impacted by the weaker
performance of the rand against foreign currency.

Active customers grew strongly, reaching 35.7 million, with 1.5 million net customer additions in the first half of the year. Our strategy of delivering the best network and offering
value for money continues to both attract and retain customers. Active prepaid customers increased 1.4 million to 30.6 million, as we attracted value-seeking customers looking to
optimise spend. The take up of our personalised 'Just 4 You' offers has led to an improvement in our value perception with customers. Prepaid voice bundle purchases increased
26.8% to 447 million bundles reducing the pace of voice revenue declines for the past four quarters. These personalised offers provide affordability for customers and resulted in a
15.4% reduction in the prepaid effective price per minute, as we make the cost of communication more affordable.

Customers continue to choose us for our superior network and the differentiated customer experience that we deliver through our customer CARE programme. We added 131 000
contract customers, reduced contract customer churn to 5.1% and increased contract ARPU by 5.4% to R408.

Data revenue grew 19.5% to R9 876 million and comprises 38.8% of service revenue up from 34.3% a year ago. This has been supported by active data customers increasing 4.1%
to 18.2 million and increased data traffic which grew 38.4%. This growth was a result of increased bundles sold, greater data coverage and customers migrating to 3G and 4G
devices. Our 'Just 4 You' offers on data propelled growth in data bundle sales by 47.1% to over 223 million bundles in the period. Our focus on improving the value offered to
customers resulted in a 13.0% reduction in the price per megabyte, and a 61% decline over the last four years. 9.3 million of our data customer are now purchasing data bundles.
Active 4G customers on the network increased 88.9% to 3.6 million with the average monthly data usage on smart devices increasing 14.4% to 629MB. This has resulted in an
overall ARPU uplift of 23.7% as customers migrate from 3G to 4G and 17.9% as customers migrate from 2G to 3G.

Enterprise continues to deliver strong revenue growth, up 8.9%1 and now contributes 24.1% (2016: 22.7%) of service revenue. Growth was supported by new customer wins in
mobile, with mobile customer revenue growing 9.2% to R3 846 million. We have secured South Africa's national and provincial government department's mobile voice and data
communications contract for a period of four years. This award will enable us to partner with government to support greater innovation. Internet of things (IoT), connections
increased 27.7% to 2.6 million. We continue with our strategic partnerships with IBM, SAP HANA and Microsoft 365 to build on our fixed-line, cloud and managed services
businesses.

EBITDA growth was strong at 6.1% to R13 013 million supported by good revenue growth and a continued focus on cost efficiencies. The changes we made through our 'fit for
growth' cost savings programme over the past two years have enabled us to achieve 0.9ppts EBITDA margin expansion to 41.4%. We benefitted from channel efficiencies,
commission savings, improved stock management and received a one-off boost from bad debt recoveries. Other cost initiatives included self-providing more of our mobile
backhaul transmission and renegotiation of key contracts with suppliers. These cost saving initiatives have assisted in offsetting higher network operating costs due to our
accelerated capex programme and a trading forex loss of R77 million (2016: R71 million gain).

Capital expenditure of R4 056 million allowed us to substantially widen 3G and 4G data coverage, improve voice quality and increase data speeds. 3G coverage increased to 99.2%
of the population and 4G coverage to 68.7%, up from 46.8% a year ago. We extended our high-speed transmission to 89.8% of our sites. We are making good progress on our fibre
deployment by entering into strategic wholesale agreements to sell services through other network providers. We completed the development of our new customer management
and billing systems to future proof our operations and have migrated approximately 70% of our consumer contract customers to this new platform.

Our customer CARE programme has enabled us to increase our lead to 16 points over our nearest competitor as measured through the Net Promoter Score. We have substantiated
our best network promise with our dropped call compensation guarantee, giving customers free minutes for calls dropped on our network. We have further enhanced our
MyVodacom App, enabling customers to purchase personalised 'Just 4 You' bundles in the app and have made our 24/7 call centre support available free of charge while roaming.

1. Growth excluding the impact from the acquisition of Autopage in the prior year and X-Link.

International

Service revenue increased 5.4% (2.3%*) to R8 725 million, impacted by customer registration requirements and exchange rate volatility. Despite the tough operating environment,
the International operations benefitted from increased voice revenue of 5.0% as well as 15.5% growth in data revenue driven by personalised Just 4 You offers and continued
network investment. Mobile data revenue now comprises 24.7% (2016: 22.5%) of International service revenue.

Active customers decreased 11.0% to 27.9 million as a result of disconnections during the second half of the prior year. New customer acquisitions were impacted by changes in
customer registration processes. However the monthly customer acquisition trend has improved with net customer additions turning positive and recovering during the second
quarter, resulting in net additions of 791 000 customers in the six month period.

Mobile data revenue grew 15.5% to R2 154 million supported by an increase of 14.0% in active data customers to 12.0 million and 38.4% in data traffic, reflecting strong demand
for mobile data services in all our markets. We continue to focus on our commercial and network offering to drive data growth, ensuring customers have access to better low cost
smart devices, such as Vodacom Kicka and Vodacom SmartTab, expanding 3G and 4G network coverage and driving the adoption of data bundles.

M-Pesa revenue continues to grow strongly at 36.8%, fuelled by continued success in Tanzania and boosted by strong uptake in Mozambique, DRC and Lesotho. DRC has more than
doubled their number of customers, and in Mozambique 38.4% of customers are now using the service. We added 1.7 million customers, increasing the number of active
customers to 10.9 million1, an increase of 19.3% from the prior year. We have implemented a new M-Pesa platform, both in Tanzania and the DRC, with enhanced technology which
has significantly improved stability, resulting in increased trust with customers, a key attribute for success.

EBITDA declined 2.2% (up 1.0%*) to R2 351 million and the EBITDA margin contracted by 2.2ppts to 26.0%. The impact from slower revenue growth was limited by our vigorous
focus on cost containment, mainly from network operation cost savings.

Capital expenditure of R1 619 million represents 17.9% of revenue. We continue to invest significantly in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation and to
support data growth and wider voice coverage.

Regulatory matters

South Africa Integrated information and communication technology (ICT) Policy White Paper (White Paper)

The Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal Services published a White Paper, as approved by cabinet, on 2 October 2016. We support the objectives of the White Paper to make
broadband more accessible and affordable for all. However, as it now stands, we do not believe the White Paper will achieve these objectives. The White Paper proposes a
telecommunications ecosystem that is untested and unproven anywhere in the world. It would be a significant departure from what is currently in place in South Africa and the
polar opposite to what the regulator, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), tabled in its Invitation To Apply for high demand spectrum issued on 15 July
2016.

The Group believes the White Paper as it currently stands, contains a number of policy elements and interventions which are unclear and require more detail. For the White Paper to
have legal effect, a number of new laws would need to be promulgated and/or existing laws amended. Consultation with all stakeholders would be required to give affect to these
changes.

A dedicated team is analysing the contents of the White Paper, with the aim to advise the company as to the potential impact on Vodacom, the industry and South Africa. We will
participate, contribute and propose alternatives, informed by international best practice and norms, to achieve the outcomes the Government is seeking, where appropriate, and we
look forward to continue dialogue as to how best to achieve these objectives.

Listing of Vodacom Tanzania

In June 2016, the Parliament of Tanzania passed The Finance Act, 2016 which amends listing requirements under the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, to introduce
mandatory listing requirements and require licensed telecommunications operators to list 25% of their authorised share capital through an initial public offering (IPO) on the Dar es
Salaam stock exchange (DSE) within six months from 1 July 2016 (listing requirements).

The Group has communicated its intention to list Vodacom Tanzania Limited on the DSE and proposed changes to the listing requirements to the Government and the Capital
Markets and Securities Authority. The Group is currently preparing for the listing and further information on the proposed listing will be issued in due course.

We are also reviewing our current shareholding structure to ensure a successful listing.

Outlook

Our strategy of investing in network infrastructure, offering customers tailor-made value offers which represent improved value for money and continued improvements in
customer service continues to result in strong operational performance. This has led to good customer growth, reduced churn and extended our lead in customer satisfaction
scores over our nearest competitor.

The demand for data remains high. We continue to bring down barriers to entry by reducing handset costs and lowering the price per megabyte through bundle offers. Our
investment in the network has ensured that high speed data now reaches 99.2% of the population in South Africa. The next step to this evolution in growing demand will be to gain
access to spectrum to enable us to continue rolling out new technologies and services more efficiently in all our markets.

We are also making good progress in future areas of growth. In Enterprise, we have recently won significant contracts especially in the public sector, and won back corporate
customers. We have concluded a number of wholesale agreements for Fibre to the premise, which will give access to a number of additional end points and assist in driving this
business forward.

Our International operations are navigating through some short-term pressure specifically relating to competitive dynamics and the changes to processes relating to customer
registration. While we believe that these pressures will persist in the short term, we noted some improvement during the second quarter, and are positive about future growth
prospects in all our operations. Similarly, we note deteriorating macroeconomic conditions both in the DRC and Mozambique which we will be closely monitoring.

With the above in mind we maintain our targets of low to mid single-digit Group service revenue growth, mid to high single-digit Group EBITDA growth and Group capital expenditure
of 12-14% of Group revenue in the medium term. These targets are for an average, over the next three years and are on a normalised basis, excluding spectrum purchases and any
merger and acquisition activity. This assumes broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory environments.

Group service revenue increased 5.3% (4.5%*) to R33 968 million, underpinned by net active customer additions of 2.3 million and data revenue growth of 18.7%. Data revenue
contributes 35.4% of Group service revenue compared to 31.4% a year ago. Revenue grew at a slower pace of 4.1% (3.5%*) to R40 151 million due to equipment revenue declining
by 4.9%, mainly due to lower sales volumes.

In South Africa, service revenue increased 5.6% mainly due to the growth in mobile data revenue, active customer additions of 1.5 million and a lower voice revenue decline.
In the International operations, service revenue grew 5.4% (2.3%*) supported by increased voice and the continued take-up of data services as we returned to positive net additions
in the quarter. Overall growth has been impacted by the slowdown of customer acquisitions as a result of customer registration requirements.

Group total expenses increased 3.7% to R24 881 million, below revenue growth of 4.1%, as our cost saving initiatives aided in offsetting higher costs from inflation, site growth and
negative foreign currency impacts. These expenses include a net trading foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated trading items of R251 million
(2015: R7 million loss).

In South Africa, total expenses increased 2.2%. Savings were achieved mainly in direct costs where we realised commissions savings and improved stock management and we
benefitted from one-off bad debt recoveries of R68 million. Excluding the impact of trading foreign exchange, total expenses increased by 1.4%.

In the International operations, expenses were well contained to mitigate the impact of slower revenue growth. Total expenses increased by 7.4% (1.3%*). Savings were realised
mainly from network and maintenance costs.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

Our strong performance last year has continued into the first quarter of our new financial year and is reflective of the successful
execution of our well-planned strategy. Despite the tougher economic environment in most of the countries in which we operate, the
Group delivered robust service revenue growth of 7.3%.

One of the major highlights this quarter is the stellar number of customer additions in South Africa in both postpaid and prepaid, where we
added almost one million customers. This can largely be attributed to the significant investments that we continue to make in infrastructure
to sustain our competitive advantage to deliver the best network, superior customer service and great value to our customers through
innovation such as our personalised Just 4 You offers. A combination of these factors also means that our Net Promoter Scores continue
to track well ahead of our competitors and shows that our CARE initiative, aimed at maximising the customer experience, is gathering
momentum. A prime example of this is the expanded functionality that we have built into the MyVodacom App.

Customer demand for data remains robust with data revenue growth of 18% in South Africa as we continue to drive a worry-free experience
through in-bundle offers having introduced an innovative solution that more effectively notifies customers when bundles are depleted. The
16% reduction in effective price per megabyte underscores our commitment to providing customers with great value, as does the recent
launch of new Vodacom branded devices, which includes our first premium smartphone, the Smart Platinum 7.

As expected, our International operations have been impacted by new customer registration processes which was offset by
currency gains. This resulted in growth of 13.5% (2.8%*). We remain committed to actively bedding down new customer registration
processes in the various markets in which we operate. M-Pesa is performing very well in our International operations with an increase in
active customers of 34.7% to 10.6 million. M-Pesa revenue has grown 47.5% to R500 million. Importantly, both Mozambique and the DRC
have reached a critical mass of 1.4 million customers each.

We welcome the announcement made by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa on 15 July 2016, inviting operators to participate 
in an auction of much-needed spectrum. This is a major progressive step for the economy, South Africa's telecommunications industry and 
the country as a whole. The allocation of spectrum will be transformative from a broadband access perspective and is expected to make 
reaching the goals set out by government's SA Connect policy more achievable.

Operating review

South Africa

South Africa sustained robust service revenue growth of 5.6% to R12 426 million, despite increasing pressure on consumer spending.
Growth was supported by strong customer additions, high demand for data services and improved voice revenue growth trends. Revenue
was up 4.0% to R15 443 million as a result of a 3.9% decline in equipment revenue. This was driven by lower sales volumes, albeit improved
from previous quarter. In the prior year the tablet and entry smartphone segment was boosted by strong sales volumes of the Vodacom
branded 3G tablet and Smart Kicka smartphone.

Our superior network and value propositions continue to draw new customers, with total active customers up 5.4% to 35.1 million. Active
prepaid customers increased 883 thousand in the quarter to 30.1 million. This is largely due to the continued success of our Just 4 You
propositions. Prepaid ARPU is down 3.2% to R60, affected by the increase in lower ARPU customers. Active contract customers have
increased by 51 thousand in the quarter and churn improved to 5.3% as customer satisfaction remains well ahead of our competitors.
Contract ARPU increased 5.2% to R401 as data demand continues to grow. We now have 14.9 million customers using bundles and we sold
329 million bundles in the first three months. We continue to improve our lead on net promoter score and we now lead by 16 points to our
nearest competitor.

Data revenue increased 18.0% to R4 691 million and now contributes 37.8% to service revenue (Q1 2016: 33.8%). Strong demand for
data has resulted in data customers increasing 6.1% to 18.8 million. Data bundle sales increased 52.1%, largely due to the take-up of more
affordable daily bundles, resulting in a 15.6% decline in the price per megabyte. Average monthly data usage by customers on smart
devices grew by 19.6% to 632MB in the quarter. Active smart devices on the network was up 18.0% to 14.1 million, 3.1 million of which are
using LTE/4G. We have introduced a range of new high quality, reasonably priced Vodacom branded devices. These will offset impacts from
currency depreciation and improve access to affordable devices. These devices will be available from next quarter.

Enterprise service revenue was up 11.6% and contributes 24.4% (Q1 2016: 22.4%) to South Africa service revenue. Mobile customer
revenue was up 9.5% and fixed-line and business managed services increased by 22.6%. The growth in fixed-line and business managed
services has primarily been driven by our IPVPN (Internet protocol virtual private network) and cloud and hosting services as enterprises
begin to migrate to the cloud at an accelerated rate. Internet of Things (IoT) connections increased 30.6% to 2.5 million. In June we
increased our shareholding in X-Link to 100%. This will enable us to execute across the full IoT value chain by developing new IoT verticals,
whilst using X-link as managed services provider.

Capital expenditure of R1 893 million has enabled us to further expand our network coverage, increase data speed and reduce our
dropped-call rate. Our 3G network covered 99% of the population and LTE/4G 64% (Q1 2016: 41%) of the population.

International

Service revenue grew by 13.5% (2.8%*) contributing 26.7% of Group service revenue. Growth in the International operations have been
impacted by new customer registration processes and competition.

Total active customers decreased 11.5% to 26.7 million in the quarter. The impact of customer registration processes on new customer
activations has negatively affected net customer additions mainly in Mozambique and the DRC. The monthly customer growth trend
has started to improve as acquisition procedures become more efficient across all channels. Net customer additions has turned positive
towards the latter part of the quarter in most operations.

Data revenue increased 25.7% to R1 095 million. 40.9% (Q1 2016: 34.1%) of active customers are using data. Data is our key growth area
and now comprises 24.4% (Q1 2016: 22.1%) of International service revenue supported by increased sales of smart devices and improved
network quality and coverage.

M-Pesa continues to gain momentum in all our markets, with active customers of 10.6 million, up 34.7% and revenue up 47.5%. DRC
reached a milestone of 1.4 million active M-Pesa customers in the quarter. M-Pesa in Mozambique grew strongly with 30% of the
active customer base using the service and with an increase in the number of transactions per customer as the service achieves critical
mass in both these operations. In Tanzania, M-Pawa (savings and loan product) customers represent 13.2% of active M-Pesa customers.
We continue to invest significantly in our International operations with capital expenditure of R809 million in the quarter. This enables us to
strengthen network and service differentiation. Tanzania launched LTE/4G in May, currently operating in the capital.

Notes:
1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes
   customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers
   who are active whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are the number of unique users who have generated revenue related to any data activities in the reported month
   (this excludes SMS and MMS messaging users). A unique user is a customer who is only counted once regardless of what data services
   they have utilised.
3. Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connections which allows for a ""many-to-many"" relationship resulting in a bi-directional flow of
    information, enabling this ecosystem to operate without human interventions.
4. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average
   monthly active customers during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue during the period by the average monthly active customers.
    Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing
    international roaming calls, but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.

Notes:

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes
   customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers
   who are active whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are the number of unique users who have generated revenue related to any data activities in the reported month
   (this excludes SMS and MMS messaging users). A unique user is a customer who is only counted once regardless of what data services
   they have utilised.
3. Minutes of use (MOU) per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average   monthly active customers during the period.
4. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue during the period by the average monthly active customers.
   Prepaid and contract ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

Notes:
1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth between 30 June 2015 and 30 June
   2016. The Group's presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies,
   for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing ex
   change rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed below.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to
    Vodacom's presentation currency, being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the quarter 30 June 2016 average
    rate (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated rand value with the functional currency for the quarter) to 30 June
    2015 quarter numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange rate variances. The prevailing
    ex change rates for the current and comparative quarters are disclosed below.

Forward-looking statements

This update which sets out the quarterly results for Vodacom Group Limited for the three months ended 30 June 2016, contains 'forward-
looking statements', which have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors, with respect to the Group's financial condition,
results of operations and businesses and certain of the Group's plans and objectives. In particular, such forward-looking statements include
statements relating to: the Group's future performance; future capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, expenses, revenues, financial
conditions, dividend policy, and future prospects; business and management strategies relating to the expansion and growth of the Group;
the effects of regulation of the Group's businesses by governments in the countries in which it operates; the Group's expectations as to the
launch and roll out dates for products, services or technologies; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions;
growth in customers and usage; and the rate of dividend growth by the Group.

Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as 'will', 'anticipates',
'aims', 'could', 'may', 'should', 'expects', 'believes', 'intends', 'plans' or 'targets'. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently
predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in
the future, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other facts or factors which may cause the actual results, performance or
achievements of the Group, or its industry to be materially different from any results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on assumptions
regarding the Group's present and future business strategies and the environments in which it operates now and in the future.

All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or any member thereof or any persons acting on their
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above and below. Vodacom expressly disclaims any liability in

Shameel Joosub
Vodacom Group CEO commented:

I am very pleased with our performance this year, with strong execution of our strategy delivering solid results. The acceleration in network investment over the past two years is a
true success story of effective capital investment to ensure growth in revenue and customers. The demand for data continues to be our key driver. Overall revenue grew 7.5% with a
slight decline in customers to 61.3 million, as a result of customer registration requirements in our International operations.

In South Africa, our network superiority has played a significant part in offering better value to our 34.2 million customers, 2.1 million up from last year. We spent R8.7 billion to
upgrade our network infrastructure which includes more than doubling our LTE/4G sites to over 6 000. This enabled us to increase LTE/4G coverage across South Africa to 58%
(from 35%) to satisfy exceptional growth in demand for data. Affordability of devices and data bundles led to a 46.8% increase in data traffic as data bundle sales jumped 85.9%. Our
personalised ""Just 4 You"" offers, part of our wider pricing transformation strategy, assisted in improved voice revenue trends, while at the same time reducing effective price per
minute by 16.9%.

Our International operations grew strongly with service revenue up by 16.2% compared to 10.0% growth in 2015. This was achieved in an environment of heightened security
regulations where unregistered customers of all operators were suspended. Service revenue from International operations accounted for 26.6% of the Group equivalent. Notably,
Lesotho exceeded R1 billion in revenue for the first time.

Looking ahead, we will continue to explore spectrum opportunities. South Africa is falling behind on broadband roll out and access. Due to the country's dependency on mobile
data, it is key to secure access to spectrum to unlock this growth potential and fulfil the growing data demands of the population. The proposed acquisition of Neotel lapsed in
March due to regulatory complexities and certain conditions not being fulfilled. Our ambitions to increase the rollout of fibre-based broadband services to homes and businesses
remain. We will also continue to drive our customer experience and network advantage by investing heavily in resources and infrastructure. As was the case a year ago, we remain
cautiously optimistic while being fully cognisant of the various changing regulatory and macroeconomic environments.

Operating review

South Africa
Service revenue increased 4.9% to R49 320 million as the business returned to growth following the 50% cut in mobile termination rates ('MTRs') last year. The successful
execution of our strategy resulted in ARPU trend improvement, boosted by impressive data growth as a result of our accelerated investment programme. Revenue grew at 5.2% to
R62 279 million, underpinned by a 6.2% increase in equipment revenue with 10.5 million devices sold in the year of which 61.6% were smart devices.

Active customers increased by 6.4%, adding 2.1 million customers in the year. The ARPU trend improved largely as a result of lower declines in voice revenue as customers opt into
more attractively priced Just 4 You offers, coupled with the continued increase in data revenue as customers trade up their devices to either 3G or 4G. Total ARPU declined 0.9%
year-on-year to R112. Adjusting for the prior year voucher release of R325 million, ARPU was almost flat, down 0.1%. We have seen great success with the next evolution in our
bundle strategy, with personalised offers for customers through our Just 4 You campaign. These personalised offers optimise spend for customers, while achieving ARPU uplift.
Prepaid bundle purchases increased to over 1 billion. The success of these offers, as well as the migration to better value price plans, has resulted in improving trends on voice
revenue. Active prepaid customers increased 7.6% to 29.3 million. We have migrated 85% of contract customers to new price plans with better value offerings. As a result, contract
in-bundle spend increased to 71.3% (2015: 69.3%). Active contract customers were flat at 4.9 million; contract churn fell from 9.2% a year ago to 8.5% while contract ARPU
increased 4.5% to R397.

Data revenue increased 27.7% to R17 287 million as strong growth in the demand for data continues. Data traffic growth of 46.8% was underpinned by three success factors:
- Improved access to more affordable devices - active smart devices on the network increased 22.8% to 14.1 million, driven mainly by the sale of low cost Vodacom branded
  devices, which account for 25.7% (2015: 16.8%) of total device sales.
- Increased data coverage - the number of active data users on the network expanded 12.7% to 18.7 million customers.
- Our compelling data offers through Just 4 You - this propelled growth in data bundle sales by 85.9% with average monthly data usage increasing 49.8% to 350MB per customer;
  we continue to see good ARPU growth with customers migrating from 2G to 3G and 3G to 4G, growing by 20.5% and 19.7% respectively.

Enterprise continues to deliver strong growth as we leverage network reliability and our leading mobile brand to move more deeply into fixed-line. Enterprise service revenue
(including mobile) now contributes 22.8% of South African service revenue. Fixed-line and business managed services increased 26.5% year-on-year and now comprises 14.9% of
total Enterprise service revenue. Growth was supported by the increased demand for fixed services (particularly IP-VPN offers as well as cloud and hosting services) as customers
sign up for cloud solutions such as SAP HANA software and Microsoft Office 365. We entered into a strategic partnership with IBM in the second half of the year to provide hosting
solutions and the first global cloud in Africa. Our collaboration with IBM, our extensive fixed and mobile infrastructure, our Pan African and global footprint and our investment in
data centre infrastructure, provides the ideal platform and environment to deliver cloud services to large and multinational enterprises. Internet of things ('IoT'), previously called
machine-to-machine, connections increased 28.2% to 2.3 million.

EBITDA increased 9.5% to R25 016 million with strong revenue growth and EBITDA margin expanding 1.6 ppts to 40.2% due to a strong focus on cost efficiencies. Growth was
impacted by a R531 million foreign exchange gain (2015: R114 million loss) which has been offset by a one-off BEE charge of R127 million included in staff expenses in the current
year and a R308 million voucher release in the previous year. At an individual employee level, we have instilled a cost-conscious culture across the business driving good progress
through our cost savings programme ""Fit for growth"". Total expenses grew 2.5%, well below revenue growth of 5.2%. We have made several structural changes to deliver cost
containment, such as optimising SIM card distribution costs and buying back our customer bases (from Nashua Mobile (Pty) Limited in the prior year, and more recently from Altech
Autopage (Pty) Limited), which has reduced on-going commissions paid. Other cost saving initiatives included optimising network operational costs through maintenance contract
renegotiations, self-providing more of our transmission services and outsourcing our network maintenance staff to realise scale benefits.

Capital expenditure of R8.7 billion allowed us to substantially widen 3G and LTE/4G data coverage, improve voice quality and increase data speeds. We have more than doubled the
number of LTE/4G sites in the year to over 6 000 sites. 3G coverage increased to 99% of the population and LTE/4G coverage to 58%, up from 35% a year ago. We extended our
high-speed transmission to 89% of our sites. Vodacom claimed top spot in MyBroadband's 2016 War Drive, which tested the download speeds of South Africa's mobile operators'
mobile data networks. During the year, our fibre deployment has also started gaining traction as we start to accelerate deployment to more estates. We also focused more of our
capital spend on new billing systems to allow us to transition from a predominately mobile company to a unified communications provider and we aim to complete the migration
of our contract customers by the end of this year.

Our strategic focus on delivering the best customer experience has resulted in a record lead of 15 points over our nearest competitor as measured through our Net Promoter Score.
We have expanded our Travel Saver roaming offer from 27 to 180 countries and enabled free calls to our call centres while roaming. We are also improving our in-store experience
to ensure that a customer walks out with a working device with all of their data transferred and free bonus data to ensure that they have no bill shock when setting up their new
device.

The Group and Neotel confirmed that the agreement between the parties had lapsed due to regulatory complexities in concluding the transaction as well as certain conditions not
being fulfilled. Accordingly, the parties agreed that the proposed restructured transaction could no longer be progressed.

International

Service revenue in our International operations, which account for 26.6% of Group service revenue, increased by 16.2% (9.6%*) with growth in all markets. We are particularly proud
of Vodacom Lesotho having now achieved revenue of over R1 billion. The International operations continue to benefit from increased voice revenue of 14.0% as well as 31.9%
growth in data revenue driven by continued network investment. Mobile data revenue now comprises 22.6% (2015:19.9%) of International service revenue.

Active customers decreased 8.1% to 27.1 million, largely due to the customer registration requirements in DRC and Mozambique. In the DRC, the Government ordered all
unregistered customers to be disconnected in December 2015. Vodacom has suspended customers with no registration records and communicated to such customers the
requirement to register to avoid disconnection. In Mozambique, there has been a phased suspension since November 2015 and a disconnection programme for unregistered
customers agreed by the Government and operators.

Mobile data revenue grew 31.9%, (excluding M-Pesa, 42.2%) supported by an increase of 73.1% in data traffic and 1.8% in active data customers to 10.1 million (also impacted by
customer registration requirements), reflecting strong demand for mobile data services in all our markets. We continue to focus on our commercial and network offering to drive
data growth, ensuring customers have access to better low cost smart devices, such as Vodacom Kicka and SmartTab, expanding 3G and LTE/4G network coverage and driving the
adoption of data bundles.

M-Pesa revenue continues to grow strongly at 19.3%, fuelled by expansion of the distribution channel and a growing ecosystem. We added 1.2 million customers, increasing the
number of active customers to 9.2 million1, an increase of 15.4% from the prior year. In Tanzania, M-Pawa (savings and loan product) is gaining traction with 1.6 million customers
actively using the service.

Enterprise service revenue (including mobile) grew 31.1%. Fixed line and business managed services grew at 18.5%, and contributes 53.0% to Group fixed line and business
managed services.

EBITDA grew 31.2% (29.9%*) to R5 385 million, contributing 17.7% to Group EBITDA. EBITDA margin increased from 26.1% to 29.3%, with margin improvement across all
operations. EBITDA was positively impacted by stronger service revenue as well as cost efficiency initiatives of R705 million, partly offset by significant currency devaluation in
Tanzania and Mozambique.

Capital expenditure of R4 090 million represents 22.3% of revenue. We continue to invest significantly in all our markets to strengthen network and service differentiation. To
support the significant data growth and wider voice coverage, we added 869 3G, 54 LTE/4G sites and 930 2G sites during the year. The Lesotho service licence was renewed for
another 20 years, expiring in 2036. In DRC, we secured a 10 year renewal of our existing spectrum until January 2028, as well as the allocation of additional spectrum in the 1
800MHz and 1 900MHz band.

   International operations.

Accolades

We have made headway in building our brand and earning the confidence of all our stakeholders. This focus had the South African youth once again voting Vodacom as the Coolest
Brand in the Generation Next Awards and our My Vodacom App won the Best Mobile App in the Digital Impact Awards. We were also voted the Top Brand in the Telecoms categories
for both consumer and business in the Sunday Times Top Brands Survey, being recognised as the Top Employer in the telecoms industry by the Top Employers Institute and named
the most reputable telecoms operator in the fifth annual Mail and Guardian Top Companies Reputation Index.

Vodacom claimed top spot in MyBroadband's 2016 War Drive, which tested the download speeds of South Africa's mobile operators' mobile data networks and the MyBroadband
Awards, based on four consumer surveys, voted Shameel Joosub IT person of the year.

In DRC, Vodacom won the VSAT Innovation for Africa award at the 2015 AfricaCom Awards for its rural coverage system.

Prior year restatement

The Group provides financing to customers to acquire handsets at an additional contractual charge in both the direct and indirect distribution channel. In the indirect channel, the
Group historically recognised equipment revenue from finance deals on a gross basis with the corresponding cost in direct expenses. This accounting treatment has been revisited,
since, in the indirect channel the Group is not responsible for transferring the handset to the customer and is therefore financing the acquisition of the handset by the customer. As
a result, the Group has restated its consolidated income statement to reflect only the finance income on these transactions as revenue. This resulted in a decrease in equipment
revenue and a corresponding decrease in direct expenses in previous financial years. The restatement has no impact on EBITDA, earnings or earnings per share.

All prior year numbers have been restated to reflect the change and all growth rates in this document are reflective of the reported numbers. This change is further explained in
note 11 of the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements.

For the 2015 financial year, revenue was reduced by R2 833 million, with an equal decrease in direct expenses.

Quarterly restated numbers, where applicable, are available on Vodacom.com.

Outlook

We are confident that the strategies that we have implemented to differentiate our network experience, to proactively change our pricing to improve in-bundle spend and offer
customers more value through segmented and personalised pricing, will continue to sustain revenue growth.

We expect data demand to continue to grow strongly as smart devices become more accessible, content becomes more relevant and our 3G and LTE/4G networks reach more
customers. We have proactively accelerated our investment in our networks over the past two years in order to capitalise on this future demand. To support this growth over the
long term, we will explore further options and opportunities to secure access to spectrum in all our markets.

We continue to focus on developing our growth areas, by driving greater contribution from our International operations, deepening our Enterprise offers, growing fibre to the home
and fibre to the business, accelerating data growth, while expanding on other services such as M-Pesa, insurance and the Internet of things.

Our markets are expected to remain highly competitive and regulatory and macroeconomic risks to persist. The challenges in South Africa's macro environment will continue to
keep customer spend under pressure. In our International operations, customer registration will continue to have a dampening effect on customer growth. Volatile currency rates
will have further impact on these operations. Although not immune to these risks, we believe that through the execution of our strategies, we will continue to show resilience in all
our operations.

With these factors in mind, we revise our medium-term targets upwards to low to mid single digit Group service revenue growth, mid to high single digit Group EBITDA growth and
Group capital expenditure of 12 - 14% of Group revenue over the next three years. These targets are on average, over the next three years and are presented on a normalised* basis,
and exclude any M&A activities and spectrum purchases. In addition, we assume broadly stable currencies in each of our markets and stable macro and regulatory environments.

Group service revenue increased 7.4% (5.8%*) to R66 763 million, underpinned by improved trends in voice revenue and data revenue growth of 28.5%. Data revenue contributes
31.9% of Group service revenue compared to 26.7% a year ago. Revenue grew at 7.5% (6.0%*) to R80 077 million supported by strong demand for devices, particularly
smartphones.

In South Africa, service revenue returned to growth increasing 4.9% mainly due to the growth in mobile data and fixed-line services, and improving voice revenue growth trends.

In the International operations, service revenue grew 16.2% (9.6%*) supported by increased voice and the continued take-up of data services as we accelerated our network
investment programme.

Group total expenses increased 5.1% to R49 981 million less than revenue growth of 7.5%, as our cost programme assisted in offsetting higher costs relating to site growth,
inflation and foreign exchange impact. These expenses include a net trading foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated trading items of R383
million (2015: R174 million loss).

In South Africa, total expenses increased 2.5%. Excluding the impact of trading foreign exchange, total expenses increased by 4.3%. The increase was also impacted by a one-off
BEE charge of R127 million included in staff expenses.

In the International operations, total expenses increased by 14.0% (4.7%*), less than revenue growth as a result of cost efficiency initiatives of R705 million. Growth was also
impacted by a write-off of current assets in the DRC in the prior year of R405 million.

The Group's capital expenditure decreased by 3.2% to R12 875 million and is 16.1% of revenue. In South Africa, capital expenditure was directed at accelerating our 3G and LTE/4G
coverage to 99% and 58% respectively. We increased the number of sites self-provided for high-speed transmission to 88.5%. In our International operations, the focus remained on
increasing both coverage and capacity thereby adding 869 3G, 54 4G sites and 930 2G sites.

Statement of financial position

Property, plant and equipment increased 10.5% to R39 744 million and intangible assets increased by 25.2% to R9 517 million compared to the prior year. The combined increase
comprises net additions of R13 157 million, the positive impact of translating foreign assets of R603 million and transfers to non-current assets held for sale of R165 million, offset
by depreciation and amortisation of R8 735 million.

Net debt increased R4 527 million to R21 287 million. The increase in non-current debt supports investment in our accelerated investment programme. During the year, we
refinanced R4 000 million current debt that became due with a facility obtained from Vodafone Luxembourg and obtained an additional R2 000 million which was used to settle
short-term overnight borrowings.

Effective 16 March 2016, the Group acquired its Altech Autopage mobile customer base from Autopage for a consideration of R717 million. Of this total consideration, R144 million
represents deferred consideration which was outstanding as at 31 March 2016. The fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired amounted to R349 million. The goodwill of
R368 million represents future synergies, and is allocated to the Group's South Africa cash-generating unit.

Operating free cash flow increased 21.8% to R17 054 million. Operating free cash flow was positively impacted by increased Group EBITDA while cash capital expenditure increased
by 4.5% or R551 million. We delivered strong free cash flow, up 26.3% or R2 044 million, supported by our growth in operating free cash flow. This has been partly offset by an
increase in cash tax due to our improved profitability and increased net finance costs paid as a result of higher net debt.

1. Debt includes interest bearing debt, non-interest bearing debt and bank overdrafts.
2. Cash capital expenditure comprises the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, other than license and spectrum payments, net of cash from disposals.
   Purchases of customer bases are excluded from cash capital expenditure.

to meet the requirements reflected in the budget and business plan, taking into account monies required for investment opportunities. There is no fixed date on which entitlement
to dividends arises and the date of payment will be determined by the Board or shareholders at the time of declaration, subject to the JSE Listings Requirements.

Notes to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March

1.     Basis of preparation
       These preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the framework concepts, the
       recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and in accordance with and containing the
       information required by International Accounting Standard ('IAS') 34: Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting
       Standards Board ('IASB'), the Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants ('SAICA') Accounting
       Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Limited ('JSE') Listings
       Requirements and the requirements of the Companies Act of 2008, as amended. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except
       for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value or at amortised cost, and are presented in South African rand, which is the
       parent Company's functional and presentation currency.

       The significant accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the previous year,
       except as disclosed in Note 2. The significant accounting policies are available for inspection at the Group's registered office.

       The Group changed the presentation of its statement of cash flows from the direct method to the indirect method in order to align with the
       Group's ultimate parent, Vodafone Group Plc. This presentation will be reflected in the Group's consolidated annual financial statements for the
       year ended 31 March 2016, which will be available online by 17 June 2016.

       During the year, management revisited the accounting judgements applied in accounting for finance deals. Refer to Note 11 for more details.
       There have been no other material changes in judgements or estimates of amounts reported in prior reporting periods.

       The preparation of these preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements was supervised by the Chief Financial Officer, Dr phil. T
       Streichert.

       These preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been reviewed by
       PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified review conclusion. A copy of the auditor's review report is available for inspection
       at the Group's registered office together with the financial statements identified in the auditor's report.

2.     Changes in accounting policies

       The Group adopted the new, revised or amended accounting pronouncements as issued by the IASB, which were effective and applicable to the
       Group from 1 April 2015, none of which had any material impact on the Group's financial results for the year.

       Full details on changes in accounting policies will be disclosed in the Group's consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31
       March 2016, which will be available online by 17 June 2016.

8.     Investment in associate

       During the year, the Board approved a plan to exit its investment in its associate, Helios Towers Tanzania Limited ('Helios') through a sale of shares to Helios Towers Africa,
       LTD ('HTA'). The Group expects to complete the sale within the next financial year. The investment was classified as a non-current asset held for sale, and the associated
       shareholder's loan was classified to current assets. The investment is presented in the International segment. The Group has not recognised any impairment losses in
       respect of its investment, since the proceeds are expected to exceed the carrying value of the investment and loan receivable.

9.     Borrowings

       During the current year, the Group obtained an additional loan from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. with a nominal value of R2 000 million which was utilised to
       settle short-term overnight borrowings. The loan bears interest payable quarterly at three-month JIBAR plus 1.15%, is unsecured, and is repayable on 16 July 2018.

       A loan from Old Mutual Specialised Financing (Pty) Limited and Minervois Trading No. 2 (Pty) Limited with a nominal value of R1 000 million was repaid on 30 September
       2015. The repayment was funded by a drawdown of R1 000 million on an overall loan facility of R4 000 million from Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l. that was
       approved during the year. The new loan facility is unsecured and has a three year tenure with a repayment date of 28 September 2018. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate
       of 8.64% payable quarterly.

       The residual R3 000 million drawdown on the R4 000 million facility was used to refinance a R3 000 million term loan provided by Vodafone Investments Luxembourg s.a.r.l.
       which matured on 22 March 2016. The repayment date for the new term loan is 22 March 2019 and the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 9.39% per annum.

       Effective 16 March 2016, the Group acquired its Altech Autopage customer base from Autopage for a consideration of R717 million. Of this total consideration, R144
       million represents deferred consideration which was outstanding as at 31 March 2016. The fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired amounted to R349 million. The
       goodwill of R368 million represents future synergies, and is allocated to the Group's South Africa cash-generating unit.

11.    Prior year restatement

       The Group provides financing to customers to acquire handsets at an additional contractual charge in both the direct and indirect distribution channel. In the indirect
       channel, the Group historically recognised equipment revenue from finance deals on a gross basis with the corresponding cost in direct expenses. This accounting
       treatment has been revisited, since, in the indirect channel, the Group is not responsible for transferring the handset to the customer and is therefore financing the
       acquisition of the handset by the customer. As a result, the Group has restated its consolidated income statement to reflect only the finance income on these transactions
       as revenue. This resulted in a decrease in equipment revenue and a corresponding decrease in direct expenses in previous financial years. The restatement has no impact
       on earnings or earnings per share. The amount of the correction was as follows:
                                                                                                              2015

12.    Contingent liabilities

12.1   Guarantees

       The Group issued various guarantees, relating to external financial obligations of its subsidiaries, which amounted to R113 million (2015: R113 million).

       Foreign denominated guarantees amounting to R1 102 million (2015: R911 million) were issued in support of Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA relating to liabilities included in
       the consolidated statement of financial position.

12.2   Tax matters

       The Group is regularly subject to an evaluation by tax authorities of its direct and indirect tax filings. The consequence of such reviews is that disputes can arise with tax
       authorities over the interpretation or application of certain tax rules applicable to the Group's business. These disputes may not necessarily be resolved in a manner that is
       favourable to the Group. Additionally, the resolution of the disputes could result in an obligation to the Group. The Group has made sufficient provision for any losses arising
       from tax exposures that are more likely to occur than not.

12.3   Legal contingencies

       The Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and has, in consultation with its legal counsel, assessed the outcome of these proceedings. Following this
       assessment, the Group's management has determined that adequate provision has been made in respect of these legal proceedings as at 31 March 2016.

       Vodacom Tanzania Limited has entered into an agreement with the shareholders of Shared Networks to acquire 100% of their issued share capital for US$15 million. The
       acquisition will be funded through available cash resources. The transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent, including the requisite
       regulatory approvals.

13.2   Neotel (Pty) Limited ('Neotel')

       The Group and Neotel have confirmed that the agreement between the parties has lapsed due to regulatory complexities in concluding the transaction as well as certain
       conditions not being fulfilled. Accordingly, the parties have agreed that the proposed restructured transaction can no longer be progressed.

13.3   Call termination rates ('CTR')

       The application submitted by Cell C (Pty) Limited ('Cell C') with the High Court to review and set aside the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa's ('Icasa')
       decision on CTR's has subsequently been withdrawn by Cell C.

13.4   Competition Commission complaint lodged by Cell C

       The Group received a complaint from the Competition Commission in which it is alleged that the Group's South African segment has abused their market dominance in
       contravention of Section 8 of the Competition Act of 1998. Investigations on this complaint are ongoing and the Group is in the process of complying with new information
       requests in this regard.

13.5   Vodacom Congo (RDC) SA ('Vodacom Congo') and Vodacom International Limited ('VIL')

       There are various legal matters relating to the Group's investment in Vodacom Congo, the most recent of which is a claim brought in August 2015 by Mr Alieu Badara
       Mohamed Conteh in the Commercial Court of Kinshasa/Gombe against VIL and Vodacom Congo, which was dismissed by the courts in December 2015.

13.6   Customer registration

       In each country where the Group is subject to customer registration requirements, the industry is engaging with authorities to improve the process to ensure customer
       registration. The difficulties experienced by the Group in the registration process include; limited number of national identity cards, the inefficiency of a paper based
       process, and the inability of mass market distribution partners to complete the registration processes correctly. Tanzania and Mozambique have replaced the paper based
       process with an electronic registration process. The Group is continuing to actively register customers and has action plans in each country to achieve full compliance.

13.7   Implementation of Numbering Plan Regulations 2016

       Icasa published Numbering Plan Regulations, in terms of section 68 of the Electronic Communications Act 36 of 2005, as amended, on 24 March 2016. The Group is in the
       process of implementing these regulations.

       On 29 February 2016, the Department of Trade and Industry ('dti') published the revised draft information and communication technology ('ICT') Sector Code for a 60 day
       public comment period. This code follows the May 2015 implementation of the revised generic dti Codes on BBBEE, which saw a complete overhaul of the current targets
       and requirements. The revised codes are expected to be finalised in June 2016, with the effective date being 1 April 2016.

       In February 2016, the North Gauteng High Court made the following order on the matter of regulatory requirements emanating from the Electronic Communications Act
       36 of 2005: Compliance with the 30% equity ownership to be held by historically disadvantaged persons ('HDI') is peremptory and that Icasa does not have any discretion to
       either waive or relax the immediate requirement to comply with the minimum 30% HDI equity ownership threshold.

       The Board is not aware of any matter or circumstance arising since the end of the reporting period, not otherwise dealt with herein, which significantly affects the financial
       position of the Group or the results of its operations or cash flows for the period, other than the following:

14.1   Kenneth Makate ('Mr Makate') vs Vodacom (Pty) Limited ('the Company')
       In 2008, Mr Makate instituted legal proceedings to claim compensation for a business idea that led to a product known as 'Please Call Me'. On 1 July 2014, the South
       Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg ('the High Court') found that Mr Makate had proven the existence of a contract. However, the High Court ruled that the Company was not
       bound by that contract because the responsible director of product development and services did not have authority to enter into any such agreement on the Company's
       behalf. The High Court also rejected Mr Makate's claim on the basis that it had lapsed in terms of the Prescription Act 68 of 1969.

       The High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal ('the Supreme Court') turned down Mr Makate's application for leave to appeal on 11 December 2014 and 2 March 2015,
       respectively. Mr Makate applied for leave to appeal in the Constitutional Court. On 26 April 2016, after having heard the application on 1 September 2015, the
       Constitutional Court granted leave to appeal and upheld Mr Makate's appeal. In doing so, the Constitutional Court ordered that:

       - the Company is bound by the agreement concluded between Mr Makate and the then director of product development and services;
       - the Company is to commence negotiations in good faith with Mr Makate to determine reasonable compensation; and
       - in the event of the parties failing to agree on the reasonable compensation, the matter must be submitted to Vodacom's Chief Executive Officer for determination of the
         amount within a reasonable time.

The reconciliation presents normalised growth adjusted for trading foreign exchange gains/losses and at a constant currency (using current period as base) from on-going
operations. The presentation of the pro-forma constant currency information from on-going operations is the responsibility of the directors of Vodacom Group Limited. The purpose
of presenting this information is to assist the user in understanding the underlying growth trends in these segments. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not
fairly present the financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows of Vodacom Group Limited. This pro-forma information has been reviewed and
reported on by the Group auditors, being PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. Their unqualified reporting accountant's report thereon is available for inspection at the Company's
registered address.

Notes:
1. The reported percentage change relates to the year-on-year percentage growth from 31 March 2015 to 31 March 2016. The Group's presentation currency is the South African
   rand. Our International operations utilise a number of functional currencies, for example the United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and
   Zambian kwacha.
2. Trading foreign exchange ('FX') are foreign exchange gains/losses on foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities resulting from trading activities of entities within
   the Group.
3. Translation foreign exchange ('FX') arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency, being
   rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the average rate for the year ended 31 March 2016 (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's translated
   rand value with the functional currency for the year) to 31 March 2015 numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which excludes exchange variances.

Corporate information

Non-IFRS information
The auditor's report does not necessarily cover all of the information contained in this announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full
understanding of the nature of the auditor's work they should obtain a copy of that report together with the accompanying financial information from the registered office of the
company. This announcement contains certain non-IFRS financial measures which has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors. The Group's management
believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance of the Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by
the Group to assess performance. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it
may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, although these measures are important in the management of the
business, they should not be viewed in isolation or as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as complementary to, the comparable IFRS measures. Refer above for details
relating to service revenue, EBITDA and headline earnings per share.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement which sets out the annual results for Vodacom Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2016 contains 'forward-looking statements', which have not been

In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements relating to: the Group's future performance; future capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, expenses,
revenues, financial conditions, dividend policy, and future prospects; business and management strategies relating to the expansion and growth of the Group; the effects of

technologies; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions; growth in customers and usage; and the rate of dividend growth by the Group.

'believes', 'intends', 'plans' or 'targets'. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to
events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other facts or factors which may cause the actual results,
performance or achievements of the Group, or its industry to be materially different from any results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on assumptions regarding the Group's present and future business strategies and
the environments in which it operates now and in the future.

NEOTEL - VOLUNTARY UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT


Shareholders are referred to the announcements of 8 and 10 December 2015
regarding the entering into of a modified transaction which contemplated Vodacom
(Pty) Limited (“Vodacom South Africa”) acquiring, inter alia, the majority of Neotel
(Pty) Limited’s (“Neotel”) assets related to its fixed line business as a going concern,
excluding, Neotel’s licenses (spectrum, ECN, ECNS). Contemporaneously, Neotel
would offer a roaming arrangement to all the mobile network operators including
Vodacom South Africa (the “Roaming Offer”) (collectively this then became known as
the “Restructured Transaction”).

Vodacom South Africa and Neotel have confirmed that the agreement between the
parties has lapsed due to regulatory complexities in concluding the transaction as
well as certain conditions not being fulfilled. Accordingly, the parties have agreed
that the proposed restructured transaction can no longer be progressed.

Shareholders are advised that Vodacom South Africa will continue to invest in the
development of its own high-speed communication infrastructure to stimulate greater
competition in the fixed telecommunications sector and support both its business
services offerings and its consumer business.

Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO commented:

""We successfully executed on our strategy and achieved another quarter of improving revenue trends. The two biggest highlights in the quarter are the accelerated
service revenue growth of 7.2% in South Africa and the 6.8% increase in the Group customer base to 65.2 million. In South Africa, the take-up of our personalised
offer ""Just for You"" was excellent and contributed to the 15.9% reduction in effective voice rates. The International segment delivered robust service revenue growth
of 15.2%.

Our performance in the quarter reflects the positive impact from our substantial network investment of R9.5 billion across all our operations in the nine months. We have
expanded our network coverage and increased data speeds to secure network leadership.

Customer demand for high speed mobile data is growing across our footprint, supporting a 27.5% increase in Group data revenue. Active data customers increased
14.5% to 30.3 million as we increased sales of more affordable data devices in the quarter.

We expect revenue growth to taper slightly into our last quarter of the financial year due to a stronger prior year comparative and a weaker outlook for the consumer in
South Africa due to the drought and weaker exchange rate.""

Operating review

South Africa

Service revenue growth accelerated to 7.2%, supported by continued growth in our customer base, stable ARPU and strong customer demand for 3G and 4G services.
Revenue grew at 7.1% to R17 116 million, underpinned by a 7.7% increase in equipment revenue with three million devices sold in the quarter.

Total active customers increased 8.7% year-on-year to reach 34.1 million. Active prepaid customers increased 10.3% to 29.2 million, largely due to the success of our
personalised offers and summer campaign. The continued adoption of prepaid voice bundles, particularly the new ""Just for You"" offer, supported customer acquisition
together with an improved voice revenue trend. Prepaid voice bundle purchases increased 36.8% to over 207 million in the quarter. Contract customer additions in the
quarter were negatively impacted by 75 thousand disconnections by Altech Autopage (Pty) Limited, resulting in overall flat year-on-year growth in the contract
customer base. We have migrated 83% of contract customers to new price plans with better value offerings and as a result, contract in-bundle spend is 71% of contract
customer revenue.

Data revenue increased 27.3% to R4 487 million due to sustained demand for data services and customers upgrading to 3G and 4G devices. The improved affordability
of both devices and data bundles supported a 46.6% increase in data traffic. Active data customers increased 14.0% to 19.1 million. Active smart devices on the network
increased 28.2% to 13.5 million and the average amount of data used per month increased 22.0% on such devices. Data revenue comprises 35.3% of service revenue up
from 29.7% a year ago.

Vodacom Business demonstrated strong commercial momentum in both the mobile and fixed businesses. Fixed-line and business managed services revenue now
comprises 12.7% of total Vodacom Business service revenue. Growth was supported by new customer wins for IPVPN connectivity solutions as well growing demand
for cloud and hosting services. Machine-to-machine ('M2M') customers increased 29.6% to 2.2 million. Vodacom Business service revenue now contributes 22.2% of
South African service revenue.

Capital expenditure in the quarter of R2.2 billion allowed us to expand LTE/4G population coverage to 54% from 47% at 30 September 2015 and 3G population
coverage now stands at 98.3%.

On 23 September 2015, the Group entered into a purchase agreement with Altech Autopage (Pty) Limited, where they will dispose of their Vodacom customer base to
the Group. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Competition authorities.

As announced on 10 December 2015, the Neotel transaction has been modified to the extent that Vodacom acquires the majority of Neotel's assets related to its fixed
line business, excluding inter alia, Neotel's spectrum and licences. Neotel is expected to make a roaming offer to all mobile network operators.


International

Service revenue in our International operations, which accounts for 26.6% of Group service revenue, remained robust at 15.2% (9.8%*), underpinned by customer and
data revenue growth. Growth in DRC and Mozambique accelerated as a result of improved ARPU and customer growth. Service revenue growth weakened in Tanzania,
reflecting a significantly more competitive market place.

Active customers increased 4.9% to 31.1 million. In the DRC, the Government ordered all unregistered customers to be disconnected by 28 December 2015. Since
then, Vodacom has suspended customers with no registration records and communicated to such customers the requirement to register to avoid disconnection. In
Mozambique, following a customer registration deadline on 28 November 2015, Vodacom has gone through a similar process. Consistent with experience in Q3, gross
connections are expected to be negatively impacted by both disconnections and suspensions while customers and the distribution channels familiarise themselves with
the new processes.

Data revenue grew 28.4% driven by a 15.2% increase in active data customers to 11.2 million, representing 36.1% of the active customer base. Data contributed 22.5%
of service revenue up from 20.2% a year ago. We continue to drive data growth, ensuring customers have access to better low cost smart devices, such as Vodacom
Kicka and SmartTab, expanding 3G and LTE/4G network coverage and driving the adoption of data bundles.

M-Pesa continues to grow strongly in all our markets, fuelled by expansion in the distribution channel and a growing ecosystem. M-Pesa revenue increased 16.9% in
the quarter compared to 9.4% in the prior quarter. We added 567 thousand customers in the quarter, increasing the number of active customers by 28.6% to 9.7
million1. In Tanzania, M-Pawa (savings and loan product) is gaining traction with 1.5 million customers actively using the service.

Capital expenditure in the quarter was R1 071 million as we continued to expand network coverage and increase capacity. During the quarter, we successfully renewed
our 2G mobile licence in DRC until January 2028. We have obtained additional spectrum in the DRC for the same duration. In September 2015, the regulator has confirmed to
Vodacom Lesotho its intention to renew our mobile licence before its expiry in June 2016. We are currently finalizing the terms of the licence.

1. Number of unique customers who have generated revenue related to M-Pesa in the past 90 days, of these 6.6 million have been active in the past 30 days in the
   International operations.

Notes:

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee
   that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are a number of unique users who have generated revenue related to any data activities in the reported month (this excludes SMS and MMS
   messaging users). A unique user is a customer who needs to be counted once regardless of what data services they have utilised.
3. Machine-to-machine ('M2M') is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an end
   customer, in order to support a specific business process or product. M2M customers have been restated to include customers on the Global Data Service Platform
   ('GDSP').
4. Minutes of use ('MOU') per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers
   during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU
   only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls,
   but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee
   that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are a number of unique users who have generated revenue related to any data activities in the reported month (this excludes SMS and MMS
   messaging users). A unique user is a customer who needs to be counted once regardless of what data services they have utilised.
3. Machine-to-machine ('M2M') is the remote wireless interchange between two or more predefined devices or a central station without direct relationship with an
   end customer, in order to support a specific business process or product. M2M customers have been restated to include customers on the Global Data Service
   Platform ('GDSP').
4. Minutes of use ('MOU') per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers
   during the period.
5. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and contract
   ARPU only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.
6. Traffic comprises total traffic registered on Vodacom's mobile network, including bundled minutes, promotional minutes and outgoing international roaming calls,
   but excluding national roaming calls, incoming international roaming calls and calls to free services.

Notes:

1. Active customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee
   that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service and those customers who are active whilst roaming.
2. Active data customers are a number of unique users who have generated revenue related to any data activities in the reported month (this excludes SMS and MMS
   messaging users). A unique user is a customer who needs to be counted once regardless of what data services they have utilised.
3. Minutes of use ('MOU') per month is calculated by dividing the average monthly minutes (traffic) during the period by the average monthly active customers
   during the period.
4. Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the average monthly service revenue by the average monthly active customers during the period. Prepaid and contract ARPU
   only include service revenue generated from Vodacom mobile customers.

constant currency information from on-going operations is the responsibility of the directors of Vodacom Group Limited. The purpose of presenting this information is
to assist the user in understanding the underlying growth trends in these segments. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not fairly present the

Notes:

1. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date year-on-year percentage growth between 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015. The Group's
   presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations include functional currencies for example United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling,
   Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative periods are disclosed below.
2. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency,
   being rand. The exchange variances are eliminated by applying the quarter 31 December 2015 average rate (which is derived by dividing the individual subsidiary's
   translated rand value with the functional currency for the quarter) to 31 December 2014 quarter numbers, thereby giving a user a view of the performance which
   excludes exchange rate variances. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative quarters are disclosed below.
3. The reported percentage change relates to the quarter to date quarter on quarter percentage growth between 30 September 2015 and 31 December 2015. The Group's
   presentation currency is the South African rand. Our International operations have functional currencies, other than the South African rand, which include the
   United States dollar, Tanzanian shilling, Mozambican metical, Nigerian naira and Zambian kwacha. The prevailing exchange rates for the current and comparative
   periods are disclosed below.
4. Translation foreign exchange arises from the translation of the results, at average rates, of subsidiaries' functional currencies to Vodacom's presentation currency,

Forward-looking statements

This quarterly update which sets out the quarterly results for Vodacom Group Limited for the three months ended 31 December 2015 contains 'forward-looking
statements', which have not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's auditors, with respect to the Group's financial condition, results of operations and businesses
and certain of the Group's plans and objectives. In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements relating to: the Group's future performance; future
capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, expenses, revenues, financial conditions, dividend policy, and future prospects; business and management strategies
relating to the expansion and growth of the Group; the effects of regulation of the Group's businesses by governments in the countries in which it operates; the Group's
expectations as to the launch and roll out dates for products, services or technologies; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions; growth
in customers and usage; and the rate of dividend growth by the Group.

Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as 'will', 'anticipates', 'aims', 'could', 'may',
'should', 'expects', 'believes', 'intends', 'plans' or 'targets'. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and
uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other facts or
factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Group, or its industry to be materially different from any results, performance or
achievement expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on
assumptions regarding the Group's present and future business strategies and the environments in which it operates now and in the future.

All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to the Group or any member thereof or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements above and below. Vodacom expressly disclaims any liability in respect of the content of any forward looking statement and
also expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein or to reflect any
change in their expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such forward-looking statement is based.

Africa”) and Neotel undertook to inform the Competition Tribunal and intervening parties by
7 December 2015 if the Transaction will be continued in an amended form.

Shareholders are advised that agreement has been reached on a modified transaction in
terms of which Vodacom South Africa will acquire inter alia the majority of Neotel’s assets
related to its fixed line business as a going concern, excluding, inter alia, Neotel’s licenses
(spectrum, ECN, ECNS). Contemporaneously, Neotel will offer a roaming arrangement to all
the mobile network operators including Vodacom South Africa (collectively “the Restructured
Transaction”).

Accordingly, Vodacom South Africa and Neotel have submitted to the Competition Tribunal
the signed transaction documentation in respect of the Restructured Transaction. The
Competition Tribunal will consider the Restructured Transaction at a pre-hearing set down
for the 10th December 2015. Shareholders will be advised accordingly of the outcome.

The Transaction is not a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements.
