ASPEN ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO MANUFACTURE INVESTIGATIONAL
COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE


Aspen is pleased to announce that one of its wholly-owned South African subsidiaries, Pharmacare Limited
(which trades as “Aspen Pharmacare”), has entered into a preliminary agreement with Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, two of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of
Johnson & Johnson, for the technical transfer and proposed commercial manufacture of their COVID-19
vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2-S.

The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing clinical trials. Aspen Pharmacare will perform formulation,
filling and secondary packaging of the vaccine for supply to Johnson & Johnson. This agreement is still
subject to the successful completion of the relevant technology transfer activities and finalisation of certain
commercial manufacturing terms.

Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to provide the necessary capacity required for the manufacture of Johnson
& Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at its existing sterile facility in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

Aspen has invested in excess of R3 billion in the facility containing the high technology equipment and
systems that will be used to manufacture state-of-the-art sterile drugs and vaccines, packaged into vials,
ampoules and pre-filled syringes. The production area where it is intended that the vaccine candidate will
be manufactured has capacity to produce more than 300 million doses per annum. The facility has
accreditation from a range of international regulatory authorities and provides lifesaving medicines to both
the domestic and international markets. It was part of the first flagship investments announced at the
President’s inaugural South African Investment conference.

DIVESTMENT OF ASPEN’S EUROPEAN THROMBOSIS BUSINESS TO MYLAN AND WITHDRAWAL OF
CAUTIONARY

Following the release of a cautionary announcement on 24 August 2020, Aspen is pleased to announce that,
Aspen Global Incorporated (“AGI”), its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Mauritius, has concluded an
agreement in terms of which Mylan Ireland Limited (“Mylan”) will acquire the commercialisation rights and
related intellectual property relating to Aspen’s Thrombosis Business in Europe 1 (the “Assets”) for a purchase
consideration of EUR 641.9 million, plus the cost of the related inventory (the “Transaction”). AGI’s
thrombosis products (the “Products”) are sold under the brand names, and variations of the brand names,
Arixtra, Fraxiparine, Mono-Embolex and Orgaran in Europe. Mylan has retained AGI (via its subsidiary, Aspen
France SAS, “Aspen France”) as its distributor of the Products in France.

The Transaction will be conditional upon the fulfilment of customary conditions precedent applicable to
transactions of this nature. It is anticipated that the Transaction will complete before 31 December 2020.

Mylan is a global pharmaceutical company, with principal offices in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, United States
of America. Mylan has a significant presence in Europe, generating sales of over USD 4 billion in 2019.

Transaction details

The disposal of the Assets comprises the following elements relating exclusively to the Products in Europe:

    -    intellectual property required for their commercialisation, and any related goodwill owned by AGI
         and its subsidiaries2;
    -    product registrations and marketing authorisations; and
    -    the related inventory3.


The purchase consideration payable by Mylan for the Assets, other than the inventory, of EUR 641.9 million
is structured as follows:

    -    Upfront cash consideration upon completion:                                     EUR 263.2 million
    -    Deferred cash consideration payable on 25 June 2021:                            EUR 378.7 million

The proceeds from the Transaction will be used to reduce the Group’s debt.

The transfer to Mylan of employees engaged in the Thrombosis Business will take place in accordance with
European labour law regulations.

Contemporaneously with the Transaction, Aspen and Mylan will enter into a Manufacturing and Supply
Agreement (the “MSA”) in terms of which Aspen will supply Products to Mylan for the Territory.

Financial information in respect of the Transaction

The Assets contributed approximately ZAR 1.91 billion4,5 in revenue, ZAR 0.53 billion5 in operating profit and
ZAR 0.45 billion5 in profit after tax6 to the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019. The Net Asset
Value of the Assets was approximately ZAR 9.25 billion7 as at 31 December 2019. It is expected that the net
proceeds from the Transaction will not vary materially from the Net Asset Value of the Assets at time of
completion of the Transaction.

Rationale

In March 2019, Aspen announced that it would undertake a strategic review in respect of its Europe CIS
Commercial business (“the Business”). The review has focused on assessing alternative models for the
conduct of the Business and in determining the range of available options with a view to optimising the
Group’s sustainable returns. In line with the objectives of the strategic review, Aspen is of the view that the
disposal of the commercialisation rights to the Products while continuing to manufacture and supply the
Products is an attractive option for the following reasons:

     •    the Transaction supports Aspen’s strategy of continuing to reshape the Group towards a greater
          concentration of revenue in Emerging Markets (“EMs”) – the Thrombosis business that Aspen will
          retain is almost exclusively in EMs and well supported by strong sales representation;
     •    the disposal will allow Aspen to achieve a more streamlined Business in Europe;
     •    in terms of the MSA, Aspen will continue to manufacture and supply the Products, contributing its
          significant expertise in the production of sterile injectables;
     •    the positive cash inflow from the proceeds of the disposal will allow Aspen to further strengthen its
          balance sheet and assist in establishing financial headroom for future investments; and
     •    Mylan represents the ideal partner to acquire these assets given the company’s strength in Europe,
          commitment to the injectables and biosimilars space and comparable employee-first culture and
          values.


Categorisation of the Transaction and Withdrawal of Cautionary

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements the Transaction is categorised as a Category 2 transaction.
This cautionary, as issued by Aspen on 24 August 2020, is hereby withdrawn.


1 Excludes Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States countries
2 Excluding certain goodwill relating to distribution of the Products in France
3 Excluding inventory in France where Aspen France will continue to distribute the Products
4 Includes revenue in France of ZAR 0.36 billion related to the Products that Aspen will continue to distribute and recognise the revenue
5 Aspen  average exchange rate for the six months ended 31 December 2019 was ZAR16.30 to 1 EUR
6 Profit after tax excludes any notional saving in interest paid arising from the repayment of borrowings with the net proceeds from
the Transaction
7 Aspen closing exchange rate as at the 31 December 2019 was ZAR15.69 to 1 EUR

TRADING STATEMENT


This trading statement is provided to Aspen Holdings shareholders as guidance on the key
performance metrics relating to the results of the Group for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020,
expected to be published on SENS on 9 September 2020, after market close.

The results of the Group for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020 are in line with the updated
guidance provided at the H1 2020 interim results presentation. The key performance metrics set out
below refer to continuing operations unless stated otherwise:

-   Revenue growth as reported, and in constant exchange rates (“CER”), is expected to be within the
    following range:

          Reported revenue growth:       8% to 10%
          CER revenue growth:            3% to 5%

    The difference between reported and CER revenue growth arises due to the material weakening of
    the ZAR against the majority of the other currencies in which Aspen trades in the fourth quarter.

-   Reported revenue growth from Commercial Pharmaceuticals is expected to be between 5% and
    7% and CER growth between 1% and 2%. Positive demand trends for Sterile Focus Brands used in
    the clinical management of COVID-19, the stockpiling of everyday healthcare products and
    advanced filling of prescriptions by consumers positively impacted performance during the early
    and peak periods of COVID-19 infections across several regions. These positive trends were more
    than offset by a decrease in demand as stock levels normalised, delays in the recovery of elective
    surgeries in most regions and reduced infection rates in non-COVID communicable diseases due to
    social distancing. Manufacturing revenue has delivered strong double-digit growth, both reported
    and CER, favourably impacted by the commercial sales of heparin to third parties. Non-heparin
    APIs sales have performed particularly well in H2 2020 assisted by Aspen’s ability to ensure
    consistent supply of product to the market despite the pandemic.

-   The Group delivered strong operating cash flows, benefitting from a positive cash inflow from
    working capital for the twelve months to 30 June 2020.

-   The operating cash flow to headline earnings conversion ratio is expected to be reported at more
    than 130% for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020, up from 107% for the twelve months to 30
    June 2019.

-   Net borrowings declined to approximately ZAR 35,2 billion at 30 June 2020 from ZAR 37,9 billion at
    31 December 2019. The reduction in net borrowings from net cash generated for the period and
    proceeds from disposals was diluted by unfavourable currency movements arising from the
    weakening of the ZAR relative to the EUR and the AUD which inflated the ZAR value of Aspen’s
    debt denominated in those currencies.

-   The leverage ratio, for banking covenant measurement purposes, is expected to be between 2.85x
    and 3.0x against a threshold of 3.5x, as at 30 June 2020. This is a positive outcome which brings
    the Group within range of its medium-term target of a leverage ratio of less than 3.0x.

-   Intangible and tangible asset impairments arising from rigorous and detailed annual impairment
    tests are expected to be approximately ZAR 1,5 billion in FY 2020 as compared to ZAR 3,8 billion in
    the prior comparable period.

-   The Japanese Business and public sector ARVs were classified to discontinued operations for the
    period ended 31 December 2019 and are excluded from the continuing operations for the twelve
    months ended 30 June 2020.

Normalised headline earnings per share (“NHEPS”) comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for
specific non-trading items in accordance with Aspen’s accounting policies. NHEPS is the primary measure
used by management to assess Aspen’s underlying financial performance. NHEPS for the year ended 30
June 2020 is expected to vary from that reported in the prior year ended 30 June 2019 within the
following ranges:

ASPEN’S PROPOSED COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PRELIMINARY
ASSESSMENT REGARDING PRICING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMIC AREA

In May 2017, the European Commission (“the Commission”) opened an investigation of Aspen
Holdings and certain of its European subsidiaries (“Aspen”) under Articles 102(a) of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area
Agreement (“EEAA”). The investigation was in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; (ii)
Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine; (iv) Tioguanine; and (v) Busulfan (“the Products”) sold in the
European Economic Area(1) (excluding Italy) (“EEA”).

The Commission has now adopted a preliminary assessment, following its investigation, setting out
concerns that Aspen may have abused its dominant position by imposing unfair prices pursuant to
Article 102(a) TFEU and Article 54 of the EEAA.

The Products generated approximately EUR 28 million in revenue for the financial year ended 30
June 2020 in the EEA. Over 80% of the revenue is generated by solid dose form Products that are
currently sold at an average price of less than EUR 2 per tablet and approximately EUR 3 per patient
per day, this despite the Products’ low volumes (each Product treats, on average, around 200
patients per year per EEA Member State with one product having an average as low as 8 patients).
The average prices of all of the Products are well below those of certain other post-patent originator
oncology drugs that face generic competition in the EEA. In addition, in a number of Member States,
certain of the Products faced higher priced generic equivalents.

Consequently, Aspen disagrees with the Commission’s preliminary assessment. Notwithstanding
this, in order to meet the Commission’s competition concerns, Aspen has proposed commitments
pursuant to Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 (“the Proposed Commitments”).

The Commission has responded positively to the Proposed Commitments which it intends to accept,
subject to market testing. Market testing will allow interested third parties to submit their
observations on the Proposed Commitments to the Commission within the next two months. If the
result of the market testing is favourable the Proposed Commitments will become binding upon
Aspen and the Commission will close its investigation without any finding against Aspen.

The key elements of the Proposed Commitments are as follows:
   - Average price reductions per Product across the EEA of between 27% and 79% (overall
     average of 73%);
   - Aspen to maintain such reduced prices for ten years and guarantee supply for at least five
     years;
   - After five years, should Aspen wish to cease commercialising any of the Products it will make
     them available for sale to a third party, or absent an interested purchaser, maintain the
     marketing authorisations; and
   - Aspen will make a one-time payment to the relevant entities responsible for reimbursement
     of medicines and other beneficiaries as appropriate to bridge the implementation of the
     price reductions.

Aspen is focused on ensuring supply and access to affordable pharmaceuticals for our patients and
will continue to cooperate with the Commission to prioritise patient needs. This is consistent with
Aspen’s vision of providing quality affordable medicines, an object achieved over many years and
reflected in the role it has played in saving millions of lives across Africa through pioneering and
supplying generic anti-retroviral medicine for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The current COVID-19
crisis has further demonstrated the importance of governments and companies cooperating to
prioritise access to pharmaceuticals. Aspen, as a leading supplier of Anaesthetics, Thrombosis
treatments and most recently dexamethasone, has and will continue to work closely with
authorities to ensure the supply of medically critical products throughout the world, including in the
EEA.

Aspen is pleased that the Commission has responded positively to the Proposed Commitments and
is hopeful that the result of the market testing will also be supportive of the proposed resolution of
this matter.

Footnotes:
(1)The European Economic Area comprises the EU Member States (including the United Kingdom) together with
   Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

(2)Article 9 enables companies under investigation by the Commission to offer commitments in order to meet the
   Commission's concern. If the market test indicates that the commitments are a satisfactory way of addressing the
   Commission's competition concerns, the Commission intends to adopt a decision making the commitments legally
   binding on Aspen. Such a decision would legally bind Aspen to respect the commitments it has offered and would result
   in no finding that there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules.

VOLUNTARY UPDATE FOR THE 10 MONTHS ENDED 30 APRIL 2020


During these unprecedented times, Aspen management and Board have been monitoring the risks and
challenges associated with COVID-19, taking the necessary steps to maintain delivery of quality medicines
to patients across our regions while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. Our immediate
focus under COVID-19 has been to establish processes aimed at ensuring optimum production and the
responsible allocation of essential drugs through heightened focus on our production and supply chain
activities.

Aspen is experiencing an elevated demand for certain of its Sterile Brands in Europe. These products are of
critical importance in the clinical management of patients infected with COVID-19 and we are making every
effort to support the healthcare authorities in Europe and the other regions where we operate. We wish to,
again, express our heartfelt gratitude to our employees throughout the world who have shown great
resilience, dedication and fortitude in allowing Aspen to continue to operate, ensuring delivery of
medicines to patients and caregivers reliant on our products during these exceptional times. In particular,
we highlight the commitment of Aspen’s production workers who leave the safety of their homes each day
to produce medicines for patients around the world.

Performance for the 10 months ended 30 April 2020

Commercial Pharmaceuticals

Our Commercial Pharmaceuticals business is divided into two segments, namely Sterile Brands and
Regional Brands. Certain products within both these segments have relevance in the management of
COVID-19, however the impact of the virus on the business has varied between regions.

Within the Sterile Brands business, elevated demand for Anaesthetics in Europe CIS towards the latter part
of the 10-month period has offset the expected decline in the Chinese business brought about by the
postponement of elective surgeries and less frequent haemodialysis treatment of patients during the first
four months of the calendar year 2020. The Chinese business has shown signs of recovery since the easing
of the restrictions in that country. In Europe CIS, Aspen’s largest Thrombosis region, the effect of COVID-19
on Thrombosis demand has been largely neutral, with declines in elective surgical procedures being
countered by increased hospitalisation rates of medically ill patients. The restructuring of the Thrombosis
business in Europe CIS has supported the continuing recovery of this business segment.

Stockpiling of everyday healthcare products and advanced filling of prescriptions by consumers in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the Regional Brands business. This has led to
overstocking in supply channels and in households which we anticipate will result in decreased demand
over the next few months as stock levels equalise.
Manufacturing

Aspen’s manufacturing facilities have maintained operations at normal capacity, with enhanced safety
measures introduced to protect employees. Aspen’s API manufacturing business has been positively
impacted by the sale of heparin API to third parties, while the underlying API and finished dose form
operations have also continued to perform well.

Europe CIS strategic review

The strategic review and internal restructuring undertaken in respect of the Europe CIS business has been
ongoing. Management continue to expect to finalise the outcomes of this strategic review and conclude on
an appropriate course of action by September 2020.

Capital Expenditure

Progress on strategic capital expenditure projects related to construction of manufacturing facilities for the
Anaesthetics products as well as smaller projects have been hampered by country specific COVID-19
restrictions and will resume as and when local regulations allow.

Working capital

Aspen’s maintenance of reasonable levels of safety stock through its value chain has, to date, stood us in
good stead during the COVID-19 crisis, allowing Aspen to continue to supply essential medicines to patients
in need around the world. In Europe, which has been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19, Aspen has been
well supported by its important manufacturing sites in France, Germany and the Netherlands and has
managed to redirect inventory successfully to the locations most in need. Aspen is also working hard with
its contract manufacturers and suppliers to overcome logistics hurdles as these arise in order to ensure
ongoing replenishment of finished products and raw materials. Careful attention is being paid to collections
of receivables and Aspen is ensuring that all of its creditors are paid to terms in this time of heightened
financial pressure on many businesses.



FY 2020 outlook

The Group outlook for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020, as published on 6 March 2020, did not take into
account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding the severity, impact and
duration of COVID-19 prevents Aspen from reliably assessing and quantifying the future impact of the virus
on the business. The unusual demand patterns experienced during the first four months of the calendar
year 2020 do not necessarily represent trends which will persist over the rest of the period of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Aspen completed the disposal of its Japanese business at the end of January 2020 and applied the net
proceeds received from it to repaying short dated Euro denominated debt. Aspen’s leverage ratio will be
measured at 30 June 2020 against a covenant level of 3.5x. The Group expects to deliver a leverage ratio
below this covenant level, as guided at the interim results presentation in March 2020. Aspen has reviewed
and is comfortable with its liquidity position.

The Group maintains the outlook published with its interim results announcement in March 2020 for
Normalised HEPS from continuing operations in FY 2020 to be higher as compared to the prior year
Normalised HEPS from continuing operations of R13.50.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty presently being encountered as a consequence of the pandemic, as
more information becomes available, the outlook for FY 2020 will be updated if deemed necessary. Aspen
is scheduled to release its annual result for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020 on 09 September 2020.
The financial information in this update has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group’s auditors.

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT

This voluntary trading statement is provided to Aspen Holdings shareholders as guidance on the key
performance metrics relating to the results of the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
expected to be published on SENS on 5 March 2020, after market close. The Japanese Business and South
African public sector ARVs (commercial related activities only) have been reclassified to discontinued
operations for the period ended 31 December 2019 and the results have been restated for the comparative
period ended 31 December 2018.

The results of the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019 are slightly ahead of the guidance
provided at the 2019 full year results presentation, supported by the performance of Commercial
Pharmaceuticals in certain regions and heparin sales to third parties. The key performance metrics set out
below refer to continuing operations unless stated otherwise:

*   Revenue growth as reported, and in constant exchange rates (""CER""), is expected to be within the
    following range:

          Reported and CER revenue growth:         2% to 4%

*   Revenue growth (CER) from Commercial Pharmaceuticals is expected to be between 1% and 3%.
    Manufacturing revenue has been favourably impacted by the reinitiating of commercial sales of heparin
    API to third parties, with underlying operations performing in line with expectations.

*   Included in Other operating income is an amount of ZAR 147 million relating to the receipt of the
    Hydroxyprogestrone caproate (HPC) milestone payment (USD 10 million) in August 2019.

*   The Group delivered improved operating cash flows over the comparable period in the prior year, for the
    six months to 31 December 2019.

*   The operating cash flow to headline earnings conversion ratio is expected to be reported at more than
    80% for the six months ended 31 December 2019, up from 43% for the six months to 31 December 2018.
    Aspen has a cyclically stronger operating cash flow in the second half of the financial year.

*   Net borrowings declined to approximately ZAR 38.0 billion at 31 December 2019. The implementation of
    IFRS 16 - leases on a modified retrospective basis was immaterial from an income statement perspective
    but did result in a once off increase in borrowings of ZAR 550 million.

*   The leverage ratio is expected to end between 3.50x and 3.60x against a covenant threshold of 4.0x, as
    at 31 December 2019. Assuming the net proceeds from the sale of the Japanese Business (EUR 270.3
    million) were received on 31 December 2019 and these proceeds were applied to the net borrowings in
    its entirety at this date, the pro-forma leverage ratio would have been between 3.20x and 3.30x. The net
    proceeds of EUR 270.3 million from the sale of the Japanese Business were received in February 2020.

*   Potential intangible asset impairment risk has been assessed based on the performance for the six
    months ended 31 December 2019 and expected performance for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020.
    Certain Regional Brands were identified due to lower performance vs prior expectations, and the
    resulting impairment is expected to be ZAR 500 million. A rigorous and detailed impairment test of
    tangible and intangible asset values is performed annually, at year-end based upon updated long-term
    future forecasts.
The Japan Business and public sector ARVs have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the period
ended 31 December 2019. The continuing operations for the prior period have been restated taking into the
following discontinued operations:
     * Japan Business (1)
     * Public sector ARVs (2)
     * Nutritionals Business
     * Asia Pacific non-core pharmaceutical portfolio

Note 1: In November 2019, the Group concluded an agreement (subject to conditions precedent) to divest
of its Japanese operations and any related intellectual property to Sandoz, a Novartis Division. The Japan
Business has been classified as a discontinued operation with all related assets and liabilities transferred to
assets-held-for-sale in terms of IFRS 5. The disposal transaction was concluded effective 31 January 2020.

Note 2: The Group concluded a transaction in September 2019 (subject to conditions precedent, which have
not yet been fulfilled) in terms of which the commercialisation and distribution rights for its major public
sector ARVs were licensed to Laurus, a leading Indian API manufacturer. In terms of the agreement, Aspen
would continue to manufacture the products for Laurus. The deal forms part of Aspen's strategy to exit the
commercialisation of public sector ARVs while ensuring that patients have access to competitively priced and
effective treatment.

Normalised headline earnings per share (""NHEPS"") for the year ended 31 December 2019 is expected to vary from those reported in the prior year ended 31 December 2018 within the following ranges:

*NHEPS continuing has been restated taking into account the impact of discontinued operations, namely the Nutritionals Business, the Asia Pacific
non-core pharmaceutical portfolio, Japan Business and the South African public sector ARVs. The net impact is a decrease of 83.2 cents to NHEPS
continuing for the six months ended 31 December 2018.


Note 3: NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading items. NHEPS is the primary measure used by management to assess Aspen's underlying financial performance.

DIVESTMENT OF ASPEN'S JAPANESE OPERATIONS

Aspen is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Aspen Global Incorporated (""AGI""), which is
incorporated in Mauritius, has concluded an agreement to divest of its Japanese operations and any related
intellectual property to Sandoz, a Novartis Division, for a cash consideration of up to EUR 400 million (""the
Transaction""). Sandoz is a multinational pharmaceutical company and global leader in generic and biosimilar
medicines, headquartered in Holzkirchen, Germany.

Additionally, AGI has entered into a five year Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sandoz (with an
additional two year extension option at the election of Sandoz), which will take effect from completion of
the transaction, for the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients, semi-finished and finished products
related to the portfolio of divested brands.

In terms of the Transaction, the disposal of Aspen's Japanese operations comprises of the following elements:
     - Intellectual property and any related goodwill owned by AGI; and
     - Transfer of all of AGI's shares in Aspen Japan K.K (""AJKK"") (a wholly owned subsidiary of AGI) to
        Sandoz.

Proceeds

The payment of the purchase consideration in terms of the Transaction has been structured as follows:
    - Upfront cash consideration upon completion :                            EUR 300 million (Note 1)
    - Deferred conditional consideration:                                     EUR 100 million (Note 2)
       - Note 1:
          The upfront cash consideration is subject to customary adjustments for net cash/debt and
          working capital in AJKK on completion;
       - Note 2:
          The deferred conditional consideration relates to milestone payments to be made to AGI
          contingent upon achieving certain supply criteria and licensing opportunities. It is expected that
          all milestone payments will have been received by 31 December 2023.

The proceeds from the Transaction will be used to reduce debt.

Conditions precedent and completion

The Transaction is conditional upon the fulfilment of the customary conditions precedent applicable to
transactions of this nature, the more material of which are:
    - Consent of lenders in terms of Aspen's syndicated debt facilities; and
    - Anti-Trust approval from the Japan Fair Trade Commission.
It is anticipated that the Transaction will complete during the first half of calendar year 2020 (the second half
of Aspen's 2020 financial year).

Rationale

The Transaction is consistent with the Group's strategic intent to focus on its core pharmaceuticals business
in markets where it has sufficient scale and where there is alignment between its business model and the
relevant market dynamics.

While Aspen's current portfolio and operational platform in Japan do not provide sufficient scale and
leverage in this market, it is believed that this business' current strong management, dedicated staff,
specialty portfolio and commercial platform will present an excellent opportunity once combined with
Sandoz's Japanese portfolio and product pipeline.

Financial information

Aspen's Japanese operations contributed ZAR 2.1 billion (EUR 130 million*) in revenue and ZAR 0.4 billion
(EUR 24 million*) in normalised EBITDA to the Group for the year ended 30 June 2019. The Net Asset Value
of the Japanese operations was approximately ZAR 4.8 billion (EUR 298 million**) as at 30 June 2019.

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction is categorized as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements.

*Converted at Aspen average exchange for the year ended 30 June 2019 of ZAR16.19 to EUR
**Converted at Aspen closing rate as at the 30 June 2019 of ZAR16.02 to EUR

SUMMARISED AUDITED GROUP ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
AND NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

The reviewed provisional Group financial results for the year ended 30 June 2019 which were released on
SENS on 11 September 2019 have been restated as a consequence of the recall of Zantac, a product
predominantly sold by our Australian commercial business as an over-the-counter (""OTC"") product, but
which is also available as a prescription product. The product is indicated for relief from stomach acid build-
up and used in the treatment of heartburn, gastric reflux and ulcers. The recall was effected on 1 October
2019, after our 2019 financial year-end and followed an instruction issued on 26 September 2019 by the
Australian regulatory authority (""TGA"") for the recall of all pharmaceutical products containing the active
pharmaceutical ingredient ranitidine. Ranitidine contains traces of a by-product compound called N-
nitrosodimethylamine (""NMDA"") which may pose a low carcinogenic risk from long-term exposure. The
TGA and other international regulatory agencies are in the process of investigating the issue.


As a consequence of the recall Aspen has revised the assumptions supporting the value of the Zantac
brand and raised an impairment of ZAR 719 million, on a worst-case basis, assuming that the brand will
not recover from the negative impact of the recall. Aspen is, however, actively working on plans to
relaunch the brand containing an alternative API formulation, which would comply with the new
pharmaceutical regulations. The cost related to the recall and return of stock from the market is not
material and has not been accrued as a liability in the statement of financial position. The total revenue
for Zantac in Australasia for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 was R119 million (representing 0.3% of
total Group revenue) and the impact of the loss of Zantac on future earnings is not considered material.

Accordingly, the summarised audited Group annual financial statements are presented below:

SALIENT RESULTS

 - Revenue from continuing operations increased by 1% to R38.9 billion (Restated June 2018: R38.3

TRADING STATEMENT
This trading statement is provided to Aspen Holdings shareholders as guidance on
the key performance metrics relating to the results of the Group for the year ended
30 June 2019, expected to be published on SENS on 11 September 2019, after
market close. These key performance metrics are set out below:

*   Revenue growth as reported, and in constant exchange rates (""CER""), is
    expected to be within the following ranges:

    Reported revenue growth:        0% to 2.0%
    CER revenue growth:             -3.0% to 0%

    Reported revenue benefitted from positive relative exchange rate influences.

*   Revenue growth (in CER) from Commercial Pharmaceuticals in emerging
    markets was marginally positive, while being marginally negative in developed
    markets, resulting in overall CER growth from this segment expected to be
    between -1% and 0%. Revenue was impacted by underperformance in the
    Europe CIS region, constrained Anaesthetics supply and a strike at the South
    African manufacturing sites, offset by positive sales results in the Asia Pacific and
    Latin American regions.

*   The Group delivered strong cash flows in the second half, including a positive
    cash inflow from working capital for the six months to 30 June 2019.

*   The operating cash flow to headline earnings conversion ratio is expected to be
    reported at more than 100% for the year ended 30 June 2019, up from 47% in
    the six months to 31 December 2018.

*   Net borrowings declined to less than ZAR 40.0 billion at 30 June 2019, from ZAR
    53.5 billion at 31 December 2018.

*   The leverage ratio is expected to end between 3.60x and 3.70x against a
    covenant threshold of 4.0x, as at 30 June 2019.

*   During the year, the Group disposed of the Nutritionals business and
    discontinued or divested of a non-core pharmaceutical portfolio of products in the
    Asia Pacific region. In Aspen's interim results for the 6 months ended 31
    December 2018, these prospective discontinuations and divestments were
    classified as discontinued operations with all related assets and liabilities
    transferred to assets held-for-sale in terms of IFRS 5. As at 30 June 2019 these
    discontinuations and disposals were complete and the results of the disposals
    are included as part of discontinued operations. The net profit before tax from
    these disposals amounted to approximately ZAR 5.4 billion.
*     Rigorous impairment testing of tangible and intangible asset values was once
      again performed, resulting in total impairments of the order of ZAR 3.0 billion.
      Contributing factors to these impairments are expected pressure on the oncology
      portfolio in Europe and the restructuring of certain production facilities to align
      these with production process improvements and expected future manufacturing
      requirements.

SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION IN RESPECT OF UNITED KINGDOM (""UK"") COMPETITION AUTHORITY
INVESTIGATION

Shareholders are referred to Aspen's SENS announcement of 13 October 2017 wherein it was confirmed
that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (""CMA"") had opened an investigation into Aspen's alleged
anti-competitive conduct under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (""TFEU"") in relation to the supply of Fludrocortisone acetate 0.1 mg tablets (""Fludrocortisone"") and
Dexamethasone 2 mg tablets (""Dexamethasone"") in the UK. Subsequently, the CMA advised Aspen that
it would not be proceeding with its investigation in relation to Dexamethasone.

Aspen has offered commitments (""Commitments"") to the CMA for the purposes of addressing the
competition concerns arising from certain aspects of the CMA's investigation. The CMA has given notice
that it proposes to accept the Commitments.

In terms of the Commitments: -
1.    Aspen will dispose of its rights to the ambient Fludrocortisone in the UK to an independent third
      party in accordance with a prescribed process, overseen by the CMA;
2.    Aspen will reintroduce the cold storage Fludrocortisone into the UK market in accordance with a
      prescribed process, overseen by the CMA; and
3.    Aspen will make an ex-gratia payment in the aggregate amount of £8million to -
      3.1 the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in the amount of £6,485,600;
      3.2 the Scottish Ministers in the amount of £788,000;
      3.3 the Welsh Ministers in the amount of £455,200; and
      3.4 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for Northern Ireland in the amount
           of £271,200.

The giving of the Commitments does not constitute an admission of any wrongdoing by Aspen with
respect to the alleged anti-competitive conduct under Article 102 of the TFEU. In addition, the
Commitments remain subject to the CMA's final approval.

The CMA and Aspen have entered into settlement discussions in respect of Aspen's alleged anti-
competitive conduct under Article 101 of the TFEU. Within the context that historically Aspen had the
only Fludrocortisone in the UK, Aspen has admitted liability for entering into an agreement to acquire a
potential competitor Fludrocortisone with the consequence that the conclusion of this agreement
resulted in anti-competitive behaviour. Pursuant to Aspen's aforesaid admission, the CMA will impose a
penalty on Aspen for an infringement under Article 101 of the TFEU which shall not exceed GBP 2,101,954.
The Commitments offered by Aspen and the settlement discussions being undertaken between the CMA
and Aspen reflect the Group's willingness to address the concerns raised by Competition Authorities into
alleged anti-competitive conduct by Aspen. The Group remains committed to the resolution of other
outstanding investigations in the interest of patients.

COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTMENT OF ASPEN'S NUTRITIONALS BUSINESS TO LACTALIS

With reference to previous announcements to shareholders in respect of this transaction, Aspen is pleased
to confirm that it completed the divestment of its Nutritionals Business to the Lactalis Group for a gross
consideration of EUR 740 million on 31 May 2019. Aspen can also confirm that it has received proof of

The completion of this divestment and the divestment of a portfolio of products in Australia to Mylan,

the deleveraging of its balance sheet.

ASPEN'S DIVESTMENT OF A PORTFOLIO OF PRESCRIPTION AND OTC PRODUCTS IN AUSTRALIA TO MYLAN

Shareholders are referred to Aspen's announcement of 13 December 2018 wherein it was confirmed that
its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Mauritius, Aspen Global Incorporated (""AGI""), and its
Australian subsidiaries (""Aspen Australia""), had entered into a distribution arrangement with Alphapharm,
a subsidiary of Mylan N.V. (collectively ""Mylan""), in respect of a portfolio of prescription and over-the-
counter (""OTC"") products commercialised by Aspen in, primarily, Australia and New Zealand, with effect
from 1 December 2018. It was also announced that this distribution arrangement included an option for
Mylan to acquire this portfolio from AGI and Aspen Australia.

Aspen is pleased to confirm that Mylan has exercised this option and will acquire this portfolio of products
from AGI and Aspen Australia for a maximum consideration of AUD 188 million, of which AUD 93 million is
payable by 29 May 2019, AUD 30 million is payable in January 2020 and up to AUD 65 million is payable in
September 2020. The value of the final payment is partially contingent on Aspen satisfying certain
conditions.

This divestment is in line with the Group's ongoing portfolio management approach and its stated intention
to not only acquire value enhancing products, but to also divest of non-core assets, thereby ensuring
enhanced operational focus. The proceeds will be used to reduce Aspen's gearing.

Unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2018

COMMENTARY
GROUP RESULTS
Aspen's earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2018 are in line with management's expectations. A good performance
from Commercial Pharmaceuticals in Emerging Markets is offset by a decline in revenue from Manufacturing (as guided in the
September 2018 results announcement). Earnings are diluted by higher financing costs. 

The published results record the impact of recent transactional activity and changes in accounting standards, namely:
- In September 2018 Aspen announced that it had reached an agreement to divest of its Nutritionals Business to the
  Lactalis Group (""Lactalis""). Positive progress has been made in satisfying of the conditions precedent and all but one 
  of the conditions which are reliant on third-party consent had been fulfilled before the end of February 2019. The 
  outstanding third-party condition relates to approval by New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office for Lactalis to 
  invest in that country. The remaining conditions precedent are within the control of the parties. The parties are 
  mutually committed to working towards a closing date for this transaction of 31 May 2019. The Nutritionals Business 
  has accordingly been classified as discontinued and the related assets transferred to assets held-for-sale;
- The Group has concluded various agreements relating to the divestment and discontinuation of a non-core pharmaceutical
  portfolio in the Asia Pacific region. These products have also been classified as discontinued operations and the
  assets relating to this portfolio have been transferred to assets held-for-sale; and
- Aspen has adopted two new accounting standards, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
  Customers which have resulted in the restatement of the disclosed comparable financial information for the six months
  ended 31 December 2017 and the year ended 30 June 2018.
  
Relative movements in exchange rates had an impact on financial performance, as is illustrated in the table below
which compares performance in the prior comparable period at previously reported exchange rates and then at constant
exchange rates (""CER""). The CER results for the six months ended 31 December 2017 restate performance for that period 
using the average exchange rates for the six months ended 31 December 2018.

In order to enhance comparability of relevant underlying performance, in this commentary, (1) all performance
references are to continuing operations; and (2) all December 2017 revenue numbers are stated in CER and all percentage 
changes in revenue between December 2018 and December 2017 are based on December 2017 CER revenue. 

SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE
Sterile Focus Brands 
Sterile Focus Brands, comprising the Anaesthetics and Thrombosis portfolios, delivered revenue in line with the prior
comparable period at R7,8 billion. The gross profit from Sterile Focus Brands of R4,3 billion was at an improved gross
margin percentage benefitting from lower Thrombosis manufacturing costs.

Anaesthetics Brands
Revenue from Anaesthetics was 1% lower at R4,4 billion. This is a sound performance given ongoing supply constraints
affecting all major territories other than Japan. China (+6%) and Latin America (+22%) are the material regions driving
growth. Supply limitations have adversely impacted sales in Europe CIS and Australasia. Price decreases in Japan offset 
strong volume gains. Supply is expected to improve from the commencement of the 2020 financial year and should be 
unconstrained midway through that year.

Thrombosis Brands
Thrombosis revenue of R3,4 billion is unchanged from the prior comparable period. Emerging Markets are up 7%,
propelled by a strong performance in China, which offsets the declines in Developed Markets. 

Other Pharmaceuticals
Other Pharmaceuticals, comprising Regional Brands and Manufacturing, deliver revenue of R11,9 billion, flat with the
prior comparable period. 

Regional Brands
Regional Brands, which comprise 45% of Group revenue, have shown growth of 3%. The High Potency & Cytotoxic Brands have been
reclassified under Regional Brands in line with a change to regional management of this portfolio. Revenue growth has been
recorded in most territories, but this has been partially offset by pricing pressure on the oncology portfolio in Europe, 
that also dilutes the margins.

Manufacturing
Manufacturing revenue declines 10% to R3,0 billion, primarily due to a tender lost in the prior year by one of Aspen's
major third-party customers (as reported in the results announcement for the 2018 financial year) and the suspension of
sales of heparin to third-parties due to limited global availability. Resultant lower volumes weigh on margins.

FUNDING
Borrowings, net of cash, have increased by R6,7 billion to R53,5 billion. R1,0 billion of this increase is the consequence
of Rand weakness relative to foreign currency denominated loans. Payments relating to acquisitions of R4,9 billion and
capital expenditure of R1,5 billion have been the main other drivers of the higher debt levels. The gearing ratio covenant
measure is 4,43 times against an upper threshold of 4,75 times in terms of the temporary amendment to this covenant 
measure.

Operating cash flows have been constrained by an increased working capital investment, largely due to strategic stock
builds. Operating cash flow per share of 317 cents represents a 47% rate of conversion of operating profit. Net 
interest paid is covered five times by EBITDA. 

De-leveraging the balance sheet is a priority. The first steps in this process are well progressed with the pending
receipt of the proceeds from the Nutritionals disposal, estimated at EUR635 million, in addition to the inflows received
and expected from the divestment of the non-core pharmaceutical portfolio in the Asia Pacific region. This will bring the
gearing ratio covenant measure within the specified level of 4,0 for each of the June and December 2019 measurement periods. 
Aspen's medium-term target for the gearing ratio is less than 3,0. Opportunities to accelerate the achievement of this target
include the aforementioned potential collaborations in Europe and the ongoing assessment of opportunities to realise value.

PROSPECTS
The pending completion of the Nutritionals disposal will allow complete focus on pharmaceuticals. Aspen has embarked on a 
strategic review of its European and South African Commercial Pharmaceuticals businesses. As an outcome of the 
first phase of the South African review it has been decided to split South African Commercial Pharmaceuticals into two distinct 
divisions in order to achieve heightened product and customer focus. The second phase of the review will concentrate on 
developing strategies specific to each division to optimise value delivery.

Any re-shaping of the Group will be aimed at driving sustainable organic growth with a strong emphasis on Emerging
Markets. Achievement of the de-leveraging objectives will provide headroom for further investment in building Aspen's
product portfolio of niche specialty pharma brands in Emerging Markets. 

The Group's most promising pipeline opportunities in the short to medium term are with the women's health products that
are being developed for launch in the USA. Aspen has reached a memorandum of understanding with a partner that is committed 
to building a women's health franchise in that country. The partner will distribute Aspen's pipeline products in this 
therapeutic area in the USA. 

Normalised headline earnings from continuing operations (at CER) for the full year are expected to be in line
with the percentage decline recorded in the first half. Given the diversity of currencies to which the Group is exposed, 
exchange rate volatility could influence reported results. Operating cash flows are cyclically stronger in the second half 
of the financial year and a conversion rate of operating profits to cash of between 90% and 100% is anticipated for the full 
financial year.

G. POTENTIAL DISPUTED MATTER - EUROPEAN COMMISSION
   In May 2017, the European Commission (the ""Commission"") instituted an investigation of Aspen Pharmacare 
   Holdings Limited and certain of its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries under Article 102 of the Treaty on 
   the Functioning of the European Union (""Article 102"") in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; 
   (ii) Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine; (iv) Thioguanine; and (v) Busulfan, for (a) alleged setting of 
   unfair and excessive pricing in the form of significant price increases; (b) alleged unfair/abusive 
   negotiating practices; (c) alleged stock allocation strategies designed to reduce supply; and (d) alleged 
   practices hindering parallel trade, in the European Economic Area (excluding Italy).

   The Commission's investigation is continuing and Aspen and its advisers are fully cooperating with the 
   Commission in its investigation. The Commission's decision whether to formally open a case by issuing a 
   statement of objection, is not likely to be made before the second calendar quarter of 2019 after 
   conclusion of its investigation.

   The outcome of the Commission matter is unknown at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised 
   in the statement of financial position.

H. POTENTIAL DISPUTED MATTER - UK COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY
   In October 2017, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (""CMA"") opened an investigation of Aspen in 
   respect of alleged anti-competitive conduct and pricing practices in relation to the supply of 
   fludrocortisone acetate 0.1mg tablets and dexamethasone 2mg tablets in the UK. The CMA has subsequently 
   advised that it will not be proceeding with its investigation in relation to dexamethasone 2mg tablets.

   A high level of cooperation and diligence is being afforded to the investigation team by Aspen and its advisers.

   The CMA's decision whether to formally open a case by issuing a statement of objection, is not likely to be 
   made before the second calendar quarter of 2019 after conclusion of its investigation.

   The outcome of the CMA matter is unknown at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised in the 
   statement of financial position.

I. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
   Asia Pacific non-core pharmaceutical portfolio

   The Group has continued following its strategy of divesting non-core pharmaceutical products. In the 
   Asia Pacific region, a portfolio of non-core products has been selected for divestment and accordingly 
   been classified as part of discontinued operations in terms of IFRS 5 and the assets relating to these 
   portfolios have been transferred to assets held-for-sale.

   Nutritionals Business
   In September 2018, the Group concluded an agreement (subject to conditions precedent) to divest of its 
   Nutritionals Business predominantly carried on in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific 
   under the S-26, Alula and Infacare brands (""Nutritionals Business"") to the Lactalis Group, a leading 
   multinational dairy corporation based in Laval, France. Consequently the Nutritionals Business has 
   been classified as a discontinued operation in terms of IFRS 5 and all related assets and liabilities 
   have been transferred to assets held-for-sale.

L. ILLUSTRATIVE CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE REPORT ON SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
   The Group has presented selected line items from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
   certain trading profit metrics on a constant exchange rate basis in the tables below.
   
   The pro forma constant exchange rate information is presented to demonstrate the impact of fluctuations 
   in currency exchange rates on the Group's reported results. The constant exchange rate report is the 
   responsibility of the Group's Board of Directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to 
   the nature of this information, it may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in 
   equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information has been compiled in terms of 
   the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information by SAICA and the accounting 
   policies of the Group as at 31 December 2018. The illustrative constant exchange rate report on selected 
   financial data has not been reviewed or audited by the Group's auditors.
   
   The Group's financial performance is impacted by numerous currencies which underlie the reported trading 
   results, where even within geographic segments, the Group trades in multiple currencies (""source currencies""). 
   The constant exchange rate restatement has been calculated by adjusting the prior period's reported results 
   at the current period's reported average exchange rates. Restating the prior period's numbers provides 
   illustrative comparability with the current period's reported performance by adjusting the estimated effect 
   of source currency movements.
   
   The listing of average exchange rates against the Rand for the currencies contributing materially to the 
   impact of exchange rate movements are set out below:

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2018 have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRIC interpretations, the Listings Requirements 
of the JSE Limited, South African Companies Act, 2008 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of 
IAS 34: Interim Reporting. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim financial results are in terms
of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the annual financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 except for changes to the segmental analysis, new standard
implementations as well as discontinued operations which are explained in detail below.

The unaudited interim financial results have been reported in Rand millions in the current period to augment
effective financial analysis. This has changed from the previous interim period where the financial results 
were reported in Rand billions. 

These interim Group financial results have been prepared under the supervision of the Deputy Group Chief
Executive, M G Attridge CA(SA) and approved by the Board of Directors.

Restatement of the Group segmental analysis

disposal of the Nutritionals Business segment, the Group has revised its reportable segments to reflect the
newly updated operating model which aligns to the way in which the business is managed and reported on by the
Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM""). The business segments which make up the Pharmaceutical segment have 
been revised as follows:
- The High Potency & Cytotoxic therapeutic segment has been reclassified to Regional Brands as these
  products are now managed on a regional basis; and
- The Therapeutic Focused Brand segment has been replaced by the Sterile Focus Brand segment and includes
  the Anaesthetics and Thrombosis portfolios.

Restatement of discontinued operations
IAS 34 requires that the interim financial report disclose the effect of changes in the composition of the
entity during the interim period. The Group is discontinuing the following portfolios:

Asia Pacific non-core pharmaceutical portfolio
The Group has continued following its strategy of divesting non-core pharmaceutical products. In the Asia
Pacific region, a portfolio of non-core products has been selected for divestment and accordingly been
classified as part of discontinued operations in terms of IFRS 5 and the assets relating to these portfolios 
have been transferred to assets held-for-sale. 

Nutritionals Business
In September 2018 the Group concluded an agreement (subject to conditions precedent) to divest of its
Nutritionals Business predominantly carried on in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific under 
the S-26, Alula and Infacare brands (""Nutritionals Business"") to the Lactalis Group, a leading multinational 
dairy corporation based in Laval, France. Consequently the Nutritionals Business has been classified as a 
discontinued operation in terms of IFRS 5 and all related assets and liabilities have been transferred to 
assets held-for-sale.

Restatement due to changes in accounting standards
The implementation of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
became effective for Aspen in the 2019 financial year. Aspen has assessed and applied the new standards and 
the December 2018 interim results have been reported in line with the new requirements. The 31 December 2017 
and 30 June 2018 comparative periods have been restated in the unaudited results on a full retrospective basis. 

IFRS 15 
In applying the new standard the Group recognises revenue upon the transfer of control over the products to the 
customer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the entity. Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of 
goods in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue, net of trade discounts, distribution fees paid 
to independent wholesalers and excluding value added tax, comprises the total invoice value of goods and 
co-marketing fees. 

Following a detailed review of the impact of implementing the revised standard, the Group identified certain
distribution arrangements in terms of which control of inventory did not transfer to the customer within the
relevant financial period and this required a restatement in terms of IFRS 15. The details of the restatement
are set out in note K. 

IFRS 9
Applying the incurred loss model, the Group assessed whether there was any objective evidence of impairment
at the end of each reporting period. The assessment resulted in an increase in the allowance account for
losses and the resultant restatement has been applied on a full retrospective basis and the details are set 
out in note K.

ASPEN PRE-CLOSE STATEMENT

The purpose of this announcement is to provide Aspen shareholders with an operational and
trading update for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 November 2018 before the Group enters a
closed period from 1 January 2019 until 8 March 2019. Aspen’s interim financial results are
scheduled for publication on 7 March 2019.

Introduction

Over the past five years Aspen has successfully transitioned from a generics-focused
pharmaceutical business operating in a few select countries into a global multi-national
corporation with strong equity in Regional Brands as well as leading positions in specialised
therapies such as Thrombosis and Anaesthetics.

In order to successfully position the Group going forward, the focus of management is on the
following key areas over the near term:

   -   Drive organic growth (as measured in constant exchange rates) led by a growing
       Emerging Markets’ contribution;
   -   Re-establish a reliable and stable supply of Anaesthetics from the manufacturers;
   -   Progress and complete the construction projects to enable the in-sourced
       manufacture of Anaesthetics ;
   -   Enhance supply chain efficiencies aimed at offsetting pricing pressures and improving
       profitability;
   -   Portfolio management including divestments of non-core product portfolios as well as
       exploring opportunities for strategic regional partnerships;
   -   Reduce gearing with a target of reducing the Net Debt to EBITDA (""Leverage"") ratio to
       less than 3.0 within the medium term, thereby creating greater headroom and
       capacity to take advantage of future opportunities; and
   -   Establish a route to market strategy for the US pipeline.

Aspen management believes that these objectives are key to solidifying the foundation of the
Group’s business and providing a platform for future growth.

Trading review

The Group remains on track to meet its full year guidance of Commercial Pharma organic
revenue growth (as measured in constant exchange rates) ranging between 1% and 4% based
on performance for the five months to 30 November 2018. Positive performance from
Commercial Pharma in most Emerging Markets and in Japan has been offset by weaker
performance across Europe and Russia.
Manufacturing revenue from APIs has done better than expected for the five months to 30
November 2018 and is in line with the revenue for the comparable prior period. Revenue
from finished dose form manufacture has been affected by the headwinds indicated in the
full year results presentation in September 2018.
The Nutritionals business will be treated as a discontinuing operation in the results disclosed
for the 2019 financial year in light of the agreement to dispose of this business to Lactalis.
On balance, the movements in foreign exchange rates over the period to 30 November 2018
have had a slightly favorable impact on revenue and EBITDA relative to the prior year
comparable period.


Portfolio management

As part of the Group’s approach to portfolio management, it seeks opportunities to not only
acquire products, but also to divest of non-core assets, allowing enhanced operational focus
and removing complexity. Aligned to this, Aspen confirms that with effect from 1 December
2018, its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Mauritius, Aspen Global Incorporated,
and its Australian subsidiaries, have entered into a distribution arrangement with Mylan for
a portfolio of prescription and OTC products primarily commercialised in Australia and New
Zealand. The distribution arrangement includes an option for Mylan to purchase this
portfolio.

Should Mylan exercise its purchase option, which is able to do from March 2019, the
consideration for this divestment would be approximately AUD 188 million. The products
that are the subject of this arrangement recorded sales of AUD 55 million for the year ended
30 June 2018.
Aspen has also discontinued or terminated several third party licenses in Australia.
Excluding these and the products covered by the Mylan distribution agreement, Commercial
Pharma in Australia has recorded positive growth for the five months ended 30 November
2018.



Progress on conditions precedent to disposal of the Nutritionals business

Aspen is pleased to advise that significant progress has been made in procuring the
fulfilment of the conditions precedent to the disposal by Aspen to B.A.S. S.A. (""Lactalis"") of
Aspen’s Nutritionals business (the ""Lactalis transaction""). Currently, each of Aspen’s
Lenders, the South African Reserve Bank and Nestlé have consented and/or approved the
disposal, insofar as is necessary. It is expected that the outstanding conditions precedent
will be fulfilled during the first quarter of the 2019 calendar year.


Funding arrangements

Management has engaged with Aspen’s syndicate of funders providing multi-currency
facilities to negotiate a conditional and temporary adjustment to Aspen’s Leverage ratio
covenant as at 31 December 2018 such that if the Lactalis transaction does not complete on
or before 31 December 2018 then Aspen’s 31 December 2018 Leverage ratio covenant limit
will be increased from 4.00 to 4.75 times.

and its subsidiaries (collectively “Aspen” or “the Group”)




VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: PROVISION OF SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION IN RESPECT OF THE 2018
FINANCIAL YEAR RESULTS

On 13 September 2018, Aspen released its results for the 2018 financial year which reported that Aspen
had improved revenue by 3% to R42.6 billion and had grown normalised headline earnings per share
(“NHEPS”) by 10% to 1 605 cents in the year ended 30 June 2018. Following the release of these results,
trading volumes in Aspen shares increased with the share price declining significantly. We have received a
number of enquiries in respect of certain aspects of our business and for the benefit of our shareholders
the following supplementary information is provided.

Guarantees to financial institutions relative to net debt levels

Aspen has no off-balance sheet funding and all guarantees to financial institutions apply only to wholly
owned Aspen subsidiaries.

In the announcement of 13 September 2018, Aspen reported guarantees to financial institutions of R73,5
billion and in the accompanying commentary, reported borrowings, net of cash, of R46,8 billion. The
explanation for the difference between these two values is as follows:

    -   The guarantees are for the maximum value of all available facilities and credit lines, and not only
        for the drawn down portion thereof;

    -   Cash balances are offset against borrowings while the guarantees are on the full available debt
        facilities, drawn and undrawn; and

    -   The guarantees also cover the gross value of the South Africa cash pooling system, and certain lines
        which are linked to non-vanilla debt facilities, i.e. derivative lines, guarantee lines and other lines of
        credit.

Revenue growth prospects in Commercial Pharmaceuticals

Aspen is targeting organic revenue growth of between 1% and 4% in its Commercial Pharmaceuticals
business for the 2019 financial year.

Sale of Nutritionals business

As also announced on 13 September 2018, Aspen has concluded an agreement to divest of its global
nutritionals business (“Nutritionals business”) to the Lactalis Group, a leading multinational dairy
corporation, for a fully funded cash consideration of EUR 739,8 million which includes approximately EUR
62 million to be paid to Aspen’s joint venture partners in Asia Pacific.
The net proceeds to Aspen from completion of the divestment of the Nutritionals business, after
transaction costs and related taxes, is expected to be approximately EUR 644 million (R11,2 billion at EUR
17,44/ZAR). These net proceeds will be utilised to reduce Aspen’s gearing, creating greater headroom and
capacity.

Influence of relative exchange rates

Relative exchange rate movements can have a significant impact on Aspen’s Rand-reported results.
Approximately 20% of the Group’s revenue and less than 20% of the Group’s profit after tax was earned in
Rand in the year ended 30 June 2018, with the balance of revenue and profits earned in a wide spread of
global currencies, the most material of which being the EUR, AUD, USD, CNY and JPN. Should present
exchange rates persist for the remainder of the 2019 financial year this would have a positive impact on
Rand-reported earnings.

Any reference to future financial or forecast information included in this announcement has not been
reviewed or reported on by the auditors.

COMMENTARY 
DIVESTMENT OF GLOBAL NUTRITIONALS BUSINESS TO LACTALIS FOR EUR739,8 MILLION
With reference to Aspen's announcement of 29 January 2018, wherein Aspen advised that it had undertaken a strategic review of 
its Global Nutritionals Business predominantly carried on in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific under the S-26,
Alula and Infacare brands (""Nutritionals Business"") and its cautionary announcement of 11 September 2018, Aspen is pleased to 
announce that it has concluded an agreement to divest of its Nutritionals Business to the Lactalis Group, a leading multinational 
dairy corporation' based in Laval, France, for a fully funded cash consideration of EUR739,8 million/R12,9 billion 
(translated at ZAR17,4/EUR) (""the Transaction""). 

The Lactalis Group is a privately owned, global leader in the dairy industry with revenue of EUR18,4 billion, sales in
over 200 countries, approximately 80 000 employees and 246 industrial plants in 47 different countries. Lactalis'
strategic intent is to develop a global infant nutritional business to complement their existing global product range. 
The transaction is considered to be a compelling opportunity for the transferring Aspen employees, as well as the shareholders
of both Aspen and Lactalis. 

In terms of the Transaction, the disposal of the Nutritionals Business will comprise the following elements: 
- Intellectual property and any related goodwill presently owned by:
  - Aspen Holdings and Pharmacare Limited in respect of the South African and Sub-Saharan Africa Nutritionals
    Businesses; and
  - Aspen Global Incorporated in respect of the Latin American and Asia Pacific Nutritionals Businesses;
- Tangible assets (including plant, leased immovable property, equipment, associated fixed assets and inventory)
  presently owned by various Aspen Group companies in respect of the South African, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin American
  Nutritionals Businesses;
- Product registrations and retail registrations relating to Aspen's nutritional products; 
- Shares in companies conducting Aspen's Nutritional Business across Asia Pacific (including the acquisition of shares
  held by joint venture partners in New Zealand and Hong Kong); and
- Transfer of dedicated Nutritionals staff employed within each of the geographical regions.

Rationale
Aspen's disposal of the Nutritionals Business will allow the Aspen business units in Asia Pacific, Latin America and
Sub-Saharan Africa to dedicate all of their time and attention to their core pharmaceutical businesses. This heightened
focus is expected to drive increased business efficiency and performance. 

Aspen believes that Lactalis' entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to develop a leading global position in infant
nutrition will provide the Nutritionals Business and the transferring Aspen employees with exciting future opportunities
for growth and development.

Financial information
The Global Nutritionals Business contributed ZAR3,091 billion to Group revenue and ZAR512 million to Group segmental
contribution profit for the year ended 30 June 2018. 

The proceeds of EUR739,8 million will be reduced by approximately EUR62 million which will be utilised to buy-out
Aspen's joint venture partners in New Zealand and China. 

The balance of the proceeds from the Transaction, after costs and taxes, will be utilised to reduce Aspen's gearing,
creating greater headroom and capacity.

Conditions precedent and completion 
The Transaction is conditional upon the fulfilment of a number conditions precedent, the more material of which are
the following: 
- Approval by the Mexican and South African Competition/Anti-Trust authorities; 
- South African Reserve Bank approval to the extent required under the Exchange Control Regulations;
- New Zealand and Australian foreign investment approvals to the extent required;
- Signature by Aspen and Lactalis of implementation agreements, including certain regional asset purchase and share
  purchase agreements with the various Aspen subsidiaries; and 
- Signature or renewal of certain transitional service and other incidental agreements, some of which are with third
  parties.

It is anticipated that the Transaction will be completed within six months of this announcement.

Categorisation of the Transaction
The Transaction is categorised as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Withdrawal of cautionary announcement 
Shareholders are advised that following the release of the full details of the divestment of the Nutritionals
Business, shareholders no longer need to exercise caution when dealing in their Aspen securities in this regard.

GROUP PERFORMANCE
Aspen improved revenue by 3% to R42,6 billion and grew normalised headline earnings per share (""NHEPS"") by 10% to 
1 605 cents in the year ended 30 June 2018. At constant exchange rates (""CER"") revenue was up 5% and NHEPS increased 10%.

The Group's performance was underpinned by strong operating cash flows with a conversion rate of operating profits to
cash of 105% being achieved. 

Lower earnings in the second half of the year than in the first half were primarily influenced by the unfavourable
impact of the strengthened ZAR. At CER, revenue in the second half of the financial year was in line with that of the 
first half. However, the stronger ZAR in the second half resulted in ZAR reported second half revenue being lower by 
R1,3 billion. 

Significant factors influencing performance for the year were as follows:
- Underlying positive growth in Commercial Pharmaceuticals;
- Strong growth in China in the first full year of operation in that country;
- The inclusion for the full year of the Anaesthetics portfolios acquired during the course of the prior year and the
  margin benefit of the residual rights to the Astra Zeneca (""AZ"") Anaesthetics acquired with effect from 1 November 2017;
- A decline in manufacturing revenue and profitability; and
- Additional operating expenditure related to the development of structures in China and Japan.

Relative movements in exchange rates had a net unfavourable impact on financial performance as is illustrated in the
table below which compares performance for the past year to performance in the prior year at previously reported exchange
rates and then at CER being a restatement of 2017 performance at 2018 average exchange rates.

From this point forward in the commentary, all 2017 revenue numbers are stated in CER and all percentage changes in
revenue between 2018 and 2017 are based on 2017 CER revenue in order to enhance the comparability of underlying
performance.

The synergy programme yielded benefits of approximately R0,5 billion during the year. This helped offset the impact of
Anaesthetics supply challenges and price cuts in Developed Markets.

SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE
Therapeutic Focused Brands
Therapeutic Focused Brands comprising the Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency & Cytotoxic portfolios, recorded
revenue of R18,9 billion which amounted to 44% of Group revenue. Gross profit from Therapeutic Focused Brands of 
R11,0 billion was at an improved gross margin percentage, primarily due to the benefits from the acquisition of the residual
rights to the AZ Anaesthetics and improvements in cost of goods of the Thrombosis portfolio.

Anaesthetics Brands
Anaesthetics delivered revenue of R8,3 billion, advancing 21%. The inclusion of this portfolio for the full year
following the acquisition of the products from AZ and GSK during the course of the prior year assisted to lift the rate of
growth. Emerging markets grew more quickly, led by a strong performance in China. The full potential of the portfolio was
not realised due to disruptions in supply from the AZ production network. 

Thrombosis Brands 
Revenue from the Thrombosis portfolio rose 12% to R6,4 billion supported by growth across all the brands in the
portfolio. The addition of Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China midway through the prior year assisted this outcome. China
produced pleasing half-on-half growth and was an important driver in the 18% advance in revenue in Emerging Markets. 
Developed Markets recorded a satisfactory 7% improvement in revenue.

High Potency & Cytotoxic
Revenue from the High Potency & Cytotoxic Brands declined 9% to R4,2 billion. Increased generic presence in Developed
Europe had a negative influence on results and performance in other Developed Markets was generally down. 

Other Pharmaceuticals
Other Pharmaceuticals comprising Regional Brands and Manufacturing, delivered 1% higher revenue of R20,6 billion at a
narrowing gross profit percentage due primarily to challenges in the manufacturing segment.

Regional Brands
Regional Brands comprise 34% of Group revenue with Sub-Saharan Africa (""SSA"") and Australasia making up 80% of this category. 
Revenue from Regional Brands increased by 5% to R14,3 billion. The absence of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (""HPC"") sales during 
the year resulted in reduced sales in the USA. Excluding HPC and various divestments/discontinuations from the results, the 
underlying revenue growth in Regional Brands was 8%. SSA was the leading contributor to growth, supported by a 11% rise in revenue 
from the South African business. Australasia produced solid results, raising revenue 2% despite the legislated price cuts imposed. 
The Latam and Asian countries also performed well, growing by 17% and 27% respectively.

Manufacturing
Manufacturing revenue declined 5% to R6,2 billion. Active pharmaceutical ingredient revenue was stable. Finished dose
manufacturing revenue declined 22%, largely as a consequence of a major customer losing a tender for the supply of a
product in China. 

Nutritionals
The brand transition to Aspen's new global infant formula brand, Alula, and the launch of Alula in China were
important milestones achieved during the year. Gross profit remained at prior year levels as initiatives to lower cost of goods
offset a revenue decline of 2%. Sub-Saharan Africa continued to grow revenue while Australasia and Latam were slightly
lower. Increased promotional spend was put behind the business to support the brand transition and the launch in China. 

FUNDING
Borrowings, net of cash, increased by R9,6 billion to R46,8 billion. Operating cash generated of R7,0 billion was
offset by R14,3 billion of payments relating to acquisitions, other capital expenditure and dividends to shareholders.
Unfavourable exchange rate effects added a further R2,3 billion to the balance. Operating cash flow per share of 1 537 cents
represented a 105% rate of conversion of operating profit assisted by excellent second half cash generation. Net
interest paid was covered eight times by EBITDA. 

In May 2018, Aspen announced the successful closing of a multi-currency syndicated facilities agreement with 28 lenders, 
equivalent to approximately EUR 3,4 billion, which refinanced Aspen's existing term debt facilities. A significant
oversubscription allowed the facilities to be upsized. 

PROSPECTS
The impending disposal of the Nutritionals Business is another step towards shaping Aspen into an enterprise that is
absolutely focused on its portfolio of valuable branded pharmaceuticals. The Group is a uniquely positioned multinational
with its weighting towards Emerging Markets and offers a portfolio of critical medicines with enduring global demand.
Emerging Markets are expected to continue to lead growth in Commercial Pharmaceuticals. Supply constraints are expected
to impact Anaesthetics at a similar level to that experienced in the past year.

Manufacturing revenue will be lower as limited availability of mucosa will prevent the Group from supplying third
parties with heparin and the full year effect is felt of the termination of the major supply contract referred to earlier.
The Nutritionals Business is well set to deliver a positive performance as benefits of many of the initiatives undertaken
in the last year begin to be realised although the contribution will clearly be limited to the period prior to
completion of the disposal.

The Group will continue its projects aimed at reducing cost of goods which have already proven successful in
protecting gross profit margins from the price erosion experienced in recent years. This includes the capital expenditure
programmes underway at the Port Elizabeth, Notre Dame de Bondeville and Bad Oldesloe sites targeted at bringing the manufacture
of a significant portion of the Anaesthetics portfolio into Aspen facilities. Complex manufacturing capabilities
represent a critical strategic advantage for the Group.

Strong operating cash flows are anticipated to continue although there will be additional investment in inventory
required to facilitate various planned changes in manufacturing sites aligned to the initiatives aimed at lowering the cost
of goods.

Foreign exchange rates will continue to be a factor affecting relative ZAR performance. Further divestments will be
considered where portfolios are identified which are no longer aligned to the Group's specific areas of focus.
Deleveraging the Aspen balance sheet will give headroom for other potential opportunities.

DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS
Taking into account the earnings and cash flow performance for the year ended 30 June 2018, existing debt service
commitments, the expected completion of the disposal of the Nutritionals Business, future proposed investments and funding
options, notice is hereby given that the Board has declared a gross dividend, which is paid from income reserves, of 
315 cents per ordinary share to shareholders (or 252 cents net of a 20% dividend withholding tax, where this maximum rate of
tax applies) recorded in the share register of the Company at the close of business on 5 October 2018 (2017: dividend
of 287 cents per share). Shareholders should seek their own advice on the tax consequences associated with the dividend
and are particularly encouraged to ensure their records are up to date with Aspen so that the correct withholding tax is
applied to their dividend. The Company income tax number is 9325178714. The issued share capital of the Company is 
456 451 541 ordinary shares.

The directors are of the opinion that the Company will, subsequent to the payment of the dividend, satisfy the
solvency and liquidity requirements in terms of sections 4 and 46 of the Companies Act, 2008.

Future distributions will continue to be decided on a year-to-year basis.

In compliance with IAS 10: Events After Balance Sheet Date, the dividend will be accounted for in the financial
statements in the year ended 30 June 2019.

   In May 2017 the European Commission (""the  Commission"") instituted an investigation of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 
   and certain of its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
   European Union (""Article 102"") in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; (ii) Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine; 
   (iv) Thioguanine; and (v) Busulfan, for (a) alleged setting of unfair and excessive pricing in the form of significant 
   price increases; (b) alleged unfair/abusive negotiating practices; (c) alleged stock allocation strategies designed to 
   reduce supply; and (d) alleged practices hindering parallel trade, in the European Economic Area (excluding Italy).
   
   The Commission's investigation is continuing and Aspen and its advisers are fully co-operating with the Commission in 
   its investigation. The Commission's decision whether to formally open a case is likely only to be made during the 
   first quarter of 2019 after conclusion of its investigation.     
   
   The outcome of the Commission matter is unknown at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised in the

   On 1 September 2016, Aspen Global Incorporated (""AGI"") acquired the exclusive rights to commercialise the 
   anaesthetics portfolio of AstraZeneca globally (excluding the USA) (""the AZ anaesthetics""). With effect from 
   1 November 2017, AGI acquired the remaining rights to the intellectual property and manufacturing know-how 
   related to the AZ anaesthetics (""the Residual Rights""). The transaction has been classified as an intangible 
   asset acquisition and not a business combination. The fair value of the Residual Rights is R8 060 million and 
   R5 206 million of the consideration has been paid in the current financial year. The balance of R2 858 million 
   comprises the present value of future deferred fixed and performance-related milestone payments.

   With effect from 12 June 2018, Aspen Pharmacare acquired 100% of the share capital of Alphamed for a consideration 
   of R164'million. 
   
   The estimated post-acquisition operating profits is not material to the Group. 
   
   Due to Alphamed being a standalone company, incorporating manufacturing and development operations, Aspen is accounting 
   for its acquisition as a business combination. Due to the timing of the transaction Aspen has not yet completed the 
   detailed exercise to identify and value the separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and thereafter the goodwill, 
   if any, arising as a result of the transaction. This will be completed as part of the finalisation of the accounting for 
   the acquisition.

K. ILLUSTRATIVE CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE REPORT ON SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                                                                          
   The Group has presented selected line items from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and certain 
   trading profit metrics on a constant exchange rate basis in the tables below.    
   
   The pro forma constant exchange rate information is presented to demonstrate the impact of fluctuations in currency 
   exchange rates on the Group's reported results. The constant exchange rate report is the responsibility of the Group's 
   Board of Directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to the nature of this information, it may not 
   fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma 
   information has been compiled in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information 
   by SAICA and the accounting policies of the Group as at 30 June 2018. The illustrative constant exchange rate report 
   on selected financial data has been derived from the audited financial information and has been reported on by Aspen's 
   auditors in an assurance report, which is available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
   
   The Group's financial performance is impacted by numerous currencies which underlie the reported trading results, 
   where even within geographic segments, the Group trades in multiple currencies (""source currencies""). The constant 
   exchange rate restatement has been calculated by adjusting the prior year's reported results at the current year's 
   reported average exchange rates. Restating the prior year's numbers provides illustrative comparability with the 
   current year's reported performance by adjusting the estimated effect of source currency movements.  
   
   The listing of average exchange rates against the Rand for the currencies contributing materially to the impact of 
   exchange rate movements are set out below:

Voluntary Trading Update

Aspen shareholders are hereby advised that normalised headline earnings per share
(“NHEPS”), headline earnings per share and earnings per share for the year ended 30
June 2018 are expected to improve on those reported in the prior year ended 30 June
2017, within the following ranges:

                                                                   the prior year -

 NHEPS                     8% to 12%       1580.3 to 1638.8                1463.2

 Earnings per share        15% to 19%      1291.9 to 1336.8                 1123.4

NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading
items. NHEPS is the primary measure used by management to assess Aspen’s
underlying financial performance.

At constant exchange rates, revenue in the second half of the financial year was in
line with that of the first half. However, the stronger Rand in the second half resulted
in actual reported second half revenue being over a R1 billion lower. This had a
consequential unfavourable impact on earnings.

The financial results on which this trading announcement is based have not been
reviewed or reported on by Aspen’s external auditors.

Aspen’s results for the year ended 30 June 2018 are scheduled to be published on
SENS on 13 September 2018.

COMMENTARY

GROUP PERFORMANCE
Revenue generated by the Group grew 11% to R21,9 billion, normalised EBITDA1 improved 15% to R6,3 billion
and normalised headline earnings per share (""NHEPS"") increased by 26% to 872 cents for the six months ended 
31 December 2017. 

The significant influences on performance were:
- Healthy organic growth driven by continued positive momentum in performance from the South African
  pharmaceutical business and a strong result from the Thrombosis Brands;
- The inclusion for the full period of the AstraZeneca (""AZ"") global (excluding the USA) anaesthetic portfolio
  (""AZ Anaesthetics"") for which the commercial rights were acquired with effect from 1 September 2016. The
  profitability of the AZ Anaesthetics was further enhanced by the acquisition, with effect from 1 October 2017, 
  of the residual rights to the portfolio for a consideration of USD555 million plus further performance-related
  payments of up to USD211 million;
- Improved profit margins were further assisted by the effect of synergies and higher volumes lowering unit
  cost of goods;
- Additional operating expenditure related to the development of structures in China and Japan; and 
- The reversal of foreign exchange losses incurred in the prior period.

Relative exchange rate movements had a marginally favourable impact on financial performance as is
illustrated in the table below which compares performance for the reporting period to performance in the prior
comparable period at previously reported exchange rates and then at constant exchange rates (""CER"").

From this point forward in the commentary, all December 2016 revenue numbers are stated in CER and all
percentage changes in revenue between December 2017 and December 2016 are based on December 2016 CER revenue 
in order to enhance the comparability of underlying performance.

SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE
Therapeutic Focused Brands
Therapeutic Focused Brands comprising the Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency & Cytotoxic portfolios,
delivered revenue of R9,9 billion contributing 45% of total Group revenue. The gross profit margin from
Therapeutic Focused Brands expanded due to the benefits from the acquisition of the residual rights to the 
AZ Anaesthetics and the realisation of synergies.

Anaesthetics Brands
Revenue of R4,4 billion was achieved, an increase of 59%. The inclusion of the AZ Anaesthetics acquisition
for the full six months compared to four months in the prior period helped elevate the growth rate. Developed
Europe remained the largest contributor (R1,1 billion), followed by China (R0,9 billion) and Japan 
(R0,7 billion). The sound performance from this portfolio was constrained by disruptions in supply from the 
AZ production network during the period. 

Thrombosis Brands
All of the Thrombosis Brands showed excellent growth. The portfolio grew revenue by 17% to R3,3 billion,
increasing 28% in Emerging Markets2 and 10% in Developed Markets3. Performance was enhanced by the addition 
of Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China effective 1 January 2017. Compared to the revenue from the portfolio in 
the second half of the 2017 financial year, which included the products in China for the full period, the 
portfolio grew by 7%.

High Potency & Cytotoxic Brands
Revenue from High Potency & Cytotoxic Brands declined 8% to R2,2 billion. Supply constraints for the Ovestin 
brand and product returns in the USA arising from a change in pack size were the primary causes. This offset 
good results from the balance of the portfolio in Emerging Markets which grew revenue 8%. 
            
Other Pharmaceuticals
Other Pharmaceuticals comprise Regional Brands and Manufacturing. Revenue from this category increased
by 2% to R10,4 billion while the gross profit remained relatively flat.

Regional Brands
Regional Brands comprise 33% of Group revenue with Sub-Saharan Africa (""SSA"") and Australasia making up more
than 80% of this category. Revenue from Regional Brands increased by 4% to R7,2 billion. The absence of
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (""HPC"") sales in the period resulted in reduced sales in the USA. Excluding HPC 
from the results, the underlying revenue growth in the Regional Brands was 10%. SSA was the primary growth 
driver, underpinned by the South African business which raised revenue 21%. The Asia Pacific countries and 
Brazil also returned good revenue growth.

Manufacturing
Manufacturing revenue was flat at R3,2 billion. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients
improved 6% to R2,3 billion. Revenue from finished-dose-form sales declined 16%, largely as a 
consequence of Aspen's acquisition of the Thrombosis Brands in China which the Group previously supplied to
GlaxoSmithKline.

Nutritionals
Revenue from Nutritionals was unchanged from the prior period at R1,6 billion. Sales were stable in each of
Australasia, SSA and Latin America, being the three territories in which the Nutritionals Brands are sold. The
transition of the S-26 and SMA brands to Aspen's new global infant milk formula brand, Alula, has commenced in
Australasia with strong performance in stage 3 and 4 products since launch. Aspen also recorded its first
sales of Alula in China during the period.

FUNDING
Debt levels remain comfortably within the lenders' covenants. Borrowings, net of cash, increased by 
R6,0 billion to R43,1 billion. Operating cash generated of R3,0 billion was offset by R9,4 billion of payments
relating to acquisitions, other capital expenditure and dividends to shareholders. Operating cash flow per 
share of 658 cents represented a 78% rate of conversion of operating profit as the settlement of acquisition 
related trade creditors lifted the investment in working capital. Net interest paid was covered eight times 
by EBITDA.

PROSPECTS
The favourable results for the past period extend the good performance delivered in the second half of the
2017 financial year, clearly demonstrating Aspen's successful transition to a therapeutically focused
multinational pharmaceutical group.

The sales achieved in the first half of the 2018 financial year are expected to be maintained in the
second half in spite of the continued supply constraints which will prevent realisation of full potential. 
Over the six months ended 31 December 2017, revenue from Commercial Pharmaceuticals grew 22% in Emerging Markets,
making up 54% of revenue from this segment. Emerging Markets should continue to be the most important contributor
to growth.

Performance in the second half will benefit from the additional rights to the AZ Anaesthetics for the full
six months. Operating expenses should stabilise at present levels while net interest paid is expected to rise
and there is no certainty that the exchange gains of the first half will be repeated.

It is anticipated that operating cash flows will remain strong and a conversion rate of 100% of operating
profits is targeted for the full financial year. 

The Group results are inevitably influenced by relative currency movements given that 80% of sales are not
denominated in ZAR. Should the current strengthening of the ZAR against other trading currencies be maintained,
sales from offshore territories will convert into a lower value of ZAR revenue. This potential unfavourable
dilution will be partially offset by a weakening USD which reduces the cost of goods, given that a material
portion of purchases are priced in USD.
 
The 2018 financial year is Aspen's twentieth as a company listed on the JSE Ltd. The Group has a proud
record of reporting NHEPS growth for each of the preceding nineteen years and this year should be no
different.

E. CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES
   Currency translation losses on the translation of the

   results and the opening and closing exchange rates applied 
   in the statement of financial position. For the six months 
   the stronger closing Rand translation rate decreased the 
   Group net asset value.                                                 (1,1)            (4,8)            (3,5)

G. RESOLVED INCOME TAX MATTER
   The Aspen Group was subject to an international tax and transfer pricing audit by the South African Revenue 
   Service (""SARS"") and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited received a revised assessment in relation to its 2011 
   fiscal year as a consequence of this audit. Aspen, with the assistance of its legal and tax advisers, entered 
   into discussions with SARS which has resulted in the assessment being reversed by SARS.

H. POTENTIAL DISPUTED MATTER - EUROPEAN COMMISSION
   The European Commission (the ""Commission"") has instituted an investigation of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 
   and certain of its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
   European Union (""Article 102"") in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; (ii) Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine;
   (iv) Thioguanine; and (v) Busulfan, for (a) alleged setting of unfair and excessive pricing in the form of 
   significant price increases; (b) alleged unfair/abusive negotiating practices; (c) alleged stock allocation 
   strategies designed to reduce supply; and (d) alleged practices hindering parallel trade, in the European Economic 
   Area (excluding Italy).

   The Commission has confirmed that at this stage it has ""no firm conclusions"" of whether Aspen Pharmacare Holdings 
   Limited and/or its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries have undertaken any infringement of Article 102 as it requires 
   to complete its investigation. The Commission's decision whether to formally open a case is likely only to be made 
   during the first quarter of 2019 after conclusion of its investigation.

   The outcome of the Commission matter is unknown at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised in the statement 
   of financial position.
   
I. POTENTIAL DISPUTED MATTER - UK COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY
   The UK Competition and Markets Authority (""CMA"") in October 2017 opened an investigation against Aspen into alleged 
   anti-competitive conduct in relation to the supply of fludrocortisone acetate 0.1 mg tablets and dexamethasone 2 mg 
   tablets in the UK. In 2016 the two products had a combined revenue of GBP11.1 million in the UK.

   The investigation is at an early stage and the CMA has confirmed that, at this time, it has not reached any conclusion 
   on whether competition law has been infringed. A high level of cooperation and diligence is being afforded to the 
   investigation team by Aspen and our advisers.

   The outcome of the CMA matter is unknown at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised in the statement of 
   financial position.

J. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND BUSINESSES
   June 2017
   Set out below is the final accounting for the following business combinations:
   
   AstraZeneca anaesthetics portfolio
   With effect from 1 September 2016, Aspen Global Incorporated (""AGI"") acquired the exclusive rights to commercialise the 
   anaesthetics portfolio of AstraZeneca globally (excluding the USA). As consideration for the commercialisation rights, 
   AGI paid USD410 million with a further payment of USD110 million due on 1 July 2017. Additionally, AGI will make 
   sales-related payments of up to USD250 million based on sales in the 24 months following completion.   

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R6,5 billion. The estimation of 
   post-acquisition operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration 
   of the business into the existing operations of the Group.
   
   Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China, Pakistan and India
   As part of its acquisition of the thrombosis products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GlaxoSmithKline (""GSK"") in 2014, AGI 
   also acquired an option to purchase the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the rights, most notably 
   China. AGI has exercised its option and, with effect from 1 January 2017, acquired Fraxiparine and Arixtra in these 
   countries for a consideration of GBP45 million.

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R0,3 billion. The estimation of 
   post-acquisition operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration of 
   the business into the existing operations of the Group.

   GSK anaesthetics portfolio
   With effect from 1 March 2017 AGI acquired a portfolio of anaesthetics globally (excluding the USA) from GSK. As consideration 
   for the commercialisation rights, AGI paid GBP180 million with further potential milestone payments of up to GBP100 million, 
   based on the results of the acquired portfolio in the 36 months following completion.

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R0,5 billion. The estimation of post-acquisition 
   operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration of the business into the 
   existing operations of the Group.

                                                                             Fraxiparine

K. ILLUSTRATIVE CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE REPORT ON SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
   The Group has presented selected line items from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and certain trading
   profit metrics on a constant exchange rate basis in the tables below.
   
   The pro forma constant exchange rate information is presented to demonstrate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange 
   rates on the Group's reported results. The constant exchange rate report is the responsibility of the Group's Board of 
   Directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to the nature of this information, it may not fairly present 
   the Group's financial position, changes in equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information has been 
   compiled in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma Information by SAICA and the accounting 
   policies of the Group as at 31 December 2017. This information has not been reviewed or audited by the Group's auditors.
   
   The Group's financial performance is impacted by numerous currencies which underlie the reported trading results, where even 
   within geographic segments, the Group trades in multiple currencies (""source currencies""). The constant exchange rate restatement
   has been calculated by adjusting the prior year's reported results at the current year's reported average exchange rates. Restating 
   the prior year's numbers provides illustrative comparability with the current year's reported performance by adjusting the estimated 
   effect of source currency movements.
   
   The listing of average exchange rates against the Rand for the currencies contributing materially to the impact of exchange rate 
   movements are set out below:

   Revenue, other income, cost of sales and expenses
   For purposes of the constant exchange rate report the prior year's source currency revenue, cost of sales and expenses have
   been restated from the prior year's relevant average exchange rate to the current year's relevant reported average exchange 
   rate.

   Interest paid net of investment income
   Net interest paid is directly linked to the source currency of the borrowing on which it is levied and is restated from the 
   prior year's relevant reported average exchange rate to the current year's relevant reported average exchange rate.

   Tax
   The tax charge for purposes of the constant currency report has been recomputed by applying the actual effective tax rate to

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRIC interpretations, the Listings Requirements 
of the JSE Limited, South African Companies Act, 2008 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of 
IAS 34: Interim Reporting. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim financial results are in terms
of International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the annual financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 2017 except for changes to the segmental analysis which are explained 
in detail below.

The unaudited interim financial results have been rounded and disclosed in Rand billions to assist financial
analysis. All percentage change variances have been calculated using unrounded numbers to record accurate
variance trends.

These unaudited interim financial results were prepared under the supervision of the Deputy Group Chief
Executive, M G Attridge CA(SA) and approved by the Board of Directors.

Restatement of Group reportable segments
The Group revised its reportable segments for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 to reflect the current
operating model and to achieve alignment with the change in the way in which the business is managed and
reported on by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The regional reporting segments of International, 
South Africa, Asia Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa have been replaced by the Pharmaceutical and Nutritional 
business reporting segments. The Pharmaceutical business reporting segment has been further split into 
Therapeutic Focused Brands and Other Pharmaceuticals.

Therapeutic Focused Brands consist of those brands in the portfolios comprising Aspen's three major
pharmaceutical therapeutic areas, being Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency & Cytotoxics. Other 
Pharmaceuticals consists of the revenue from the Regional Pharmaceutical Brands as well as Manufacturing 
revenue relating to both active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dose form products.

The entity-wide revenue disclosure has been revised to reflect the three therapeutic areas which constitute
the Therapeutic Focused Brands with the balance of the Commercial pharmaceutical brands being recorded as
Regional Brands. The regions have been further refined to split Europe CIS into Developed Europe and 
Developing Europe & CIS segments. The Asia Pacific region has been split into the following segments:
- Australasia;
- China;
- Japan; and
- Other Asia

The GSK Aspen Healthcare for Africa Collaboration which was a material component of the Sub-Saharan Africa
region was terminated effective from 31 December 2016 and as a consequence the Sub-Saharan Africa region is 
no longer a material region. On this basis the South African and Sub-Saharan African regions were consolidated
into a broader all encompassing Sub-Saharan Africa region.

STRATEGIC REVIEW OF ASPEN’S GLOBAL NUTRITIONALS BUSINESS

Aspen has been exploring options to enhance the value of its global Nutritionals business (“Nutritionals”)
since receiving an unsolicited approach in the third quarter of last year.

Following the recent approval by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) of the registration of
Aspen’s infant milk formula brand, Alula, Aspen has decided to formalise its review of strategic options for
Nutritionals. A range of options will be considered including, inter alia, the introduction of a strategic
partner that could unlock appropriate value.

Nutritionals is a global infant milk formula business, with a particular focus on Emerging Markets with well-
established businesses and leading brands in Asia Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and a
growing presence in the Middle East and China. Having generated revenue of R3,2 billion in FY 2017,
Nutritionals is well positioned to continue benefitting from the strong growth trends experienced by the
infant milk formula market in these regions, driven by high birth rates, and an increasing demand for safe,
high quality infant milk formula.

The CFDA’s approval of the registration of Alula enables Aspen to continue with the export of its infant milk
products to China under the more rigorous registration requirements recently imposed by the CFDA and is
an important milestone for Aspen as it seeks to establish and grow its brand presence in China, the world’s
biggest consumer of infant milk formula.

The strength of Aspen’s Nutritionals business is underpinned by three world class infant milk formula
manufacturing sites in New Zealand, South Africa and Mexico.

Aspen has appointed Centerview Partners UK LLP as financial advisor to assist in the strategic review
process.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT: ASPEN RECEIVES APPROVAL FOR REGISTRATION OF ALULA IN CHINA

Aspen is pleased to confirm that the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) announced on
Friday, 12 January 2018 that it had approved the registration of Aspen’s infant milk formula brand, Alula. In
2016, the CFDA introduced new regulation stipulating, inter alia, that only CFDA approved brands will be
allowed and sold into the People’s Republic of China after 1 January 2018.

The approval authorises Aspen to continue export to China of its infant milk formula, following the successful
launch of the Alula infant milk formula brand in October 2017. This is a very important milestone for Aspen
as it seeks to grow its brand presence in China which is the world’s biggest consumer of infant milk formula
products.

INVESTIGATION BY UK COMPETITION AUTHORITY

Shareholders are advised that the the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) has opened
an investigation against Aspen into alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to the supply of
Fludrocortisone acetate 0.1 mg tablets and Dexamethasone 2 mg tablets in the UK. In 2016 the two
products had a combined revenue of GBP11.1 million in the UK.

The investigation is at an early, information-gathering stage and the CMA has confirmed that, at this
time, it has not reached any conclusion on whether competition law has been infringed.

While Aspen is not currently in a position to comment on this investigation, it reaffirms its
commitment to fair and open competition in the UK and around the world. Aspen takes compliance
with competition laws very seriously and will work constructively with the CMA in its process.

Shareholders are advised that any material developments in these proceedings will be
communicated through SENS. Shareholders should exercise care when reacting to information on
this matter which has not been released by Aspen Holdings.

Aspen welcomes the South African Competition Commission’s (“Commission”) decision to drop its
investigation of Aspen for suspected abuse of dominance and excessive pricing on the basis that,

1.    an excessive pricing case cannot be sustained against Aspen; and
2.    the Commission’s investigation revealed that the revenues attributable to Myleran, Alkeran
      and Leukeran in South Africa are very low as they are at the end of their life cycle and these
      products are prescribed for very few patients.

Mr Stephen Saad, the Group Chief Executive of Aspen, thanked Mr Tembinkosi Bonakele, the
Commissioner of the Commission, and the investigating team for the expeditious and co-operative
manner in which the investigation was undertaken and expressed his pleasure with the

Commentary 
GROUP PERFORMANCE
Aspen increased revenue by 16% to R41,2 billion and raised normalised headline earnings per share (""NHEPS"") 
by 16% to 1 463 cents in the year ended 30 June 2017. 

Significant factors influencing performance for the year were as follows:
- The acquisition of the commercial rights to AstraZeneca's global (excluding the USA) anaesthetic portfolio 
  (""the AZ anaesthetics"") which was effective from 1 September 2016 and the acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline's 
  anaesthetics portfolio (""the GSK anaesthetics"") which was effective from 1 March 2017 (together the 
  ""Anaesthetics Portfolio""). The Anaesthetics Portfolio generated revenue of R7,0 billion;
- The positive turnaround in the South African pharmaceutical business; 
- The entry into China with the Anaesthetics Portfolio and a Thrombosis Portfolio supported by Aspen's largest
  regional sales force; 
- The effect of the Venezuela exit and the fall-out from Chinese import restrictions on trade in Australia 
  which constrained Nutritional sales;
- The cancellation of the collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (""GSK"") in Sub-Saharan Africa, outside of 
  South Africa; and
- Improved working capital management which contributed to cash generated from operating activities more 
  than doubling.

Relative movements in exchange rates had a net unfavourable impact on financial performance as is illustrated in the
table below which compares performance for the past year to performance in the prior year at previously reported 
exchange rates and then at constant exchange rates (""CER"") being a restatement of 2016 performance at 2017 average 
exchange rates.

From this point forward in the commentary, all 2016 revenue numbers are stated in CER and all percentage changes in
revenue between 2017 and 2016 are based on 2016 CER revenue in order to enhance the comparability of underlying 
performance.

The synergy programme yielded benefits of approximately R1,2 billion during the year. This significantly bolstered
profits against the effects of the currency headwinds, price erosion and the constrained Nutritionals sales in 
Australia.

During the course of the year, the Group revised its operating model to align with the therapeutic areas identified
for specific focus. Accordingly, Aspen has adjusted its reporting format to reflect this.

SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE
Therapeutic Focused Brands
Therapeutic Focused Brands comprising the Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency & Cytotoxic portfolios, recorded
revenue of R17,4 billion which amounted to 42% of Group revenue. Gross profit from Therapeutic Focused Brands of 
R9,0 billion was at a reduced gross margin percentage due primarily to the lower gross margin percentage contribution 
from the AZ anaesthetics.

Anaesthetics
Aspen established Anaesthetics as a therapeutic focus area following the acquisitions of the AZ anaesthetics and the
GSK anaesthetics during the course of the year. Revenue of R7,0 billion was recorded post-acquisition with the largest
contributions coming from Developed Europe (R1,7 billion), China (R1,5 billion) and Japan (R1,3 billion). The Anaesthetics
acquisitions prompted Aspen's entry into China, requiring significant infrastructure investment and the establishment
of a headcount exceeding 600, now comprising the Group's largest regional sales force. Early performance indications from 
this portfolio in China have been encouraging.

Thrombosis 
The Thrombosis products delivered robust revenue growth of 13% in Emerging Markets to R2,5 billion, 
but retreated 16% in the Developed Market countries (predominantly Developed Europe) where sales of R3,2 billion 
were recorded. This led to an overall decline in the revenue from Thrombosis of 5% to R5,7 billion.

Key drivers in the growth in Emerging Markets were good advances by Fraxiparine in Developing Europe & CIS, the
acquisition of the GSK thrombosis products in China midway through the year and double digit growth delivered in the 
Latam and MENA regions. 

In Developed Europe, mandated price cuts and an adjustment in the distribution model were the primary causes of the
weak results of this portfolio. 

High Potency & Cytotoxic
The High Potency & Cytotoxic portfolio recorded flat sales at R4,7 billion. Double digit growth in Latam, Russia and
South Africa led the performance in Emerging Markets to a 17% increase with sales of R2,0 billion. However, a delay in
the transition of the manufacture of Thyrax to a new site resulting in prolonged stock-outs weighed on results in the
Developed Markets where revenue fell 10% to R2,7 billion.

Other Pharmaceuticals
Other Pharmaceuticals, comprising Other Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands and Manufacturing, increased revenue by 5% to
R20,6 billion and improved gross profit to R9,5 billion on a widening gross profit percentage.

Other Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands
Other Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands account for 45% of all revenue from Pharmaceuticals. This area largely
comprises domestic products, with South Africa and Australia being the most material contributors. Revenue from this 
category increased 4% to R14,0 billion. Adjusting for divestments and products discontinued or to be discontinued, the 
core of this portfolio grew 9% to R13,6 billion. 

In South Africa, a strong turnaround in the second half lifted the full year private sector performance by 9%, while
the public sector edged up 1% to R1,5 billion. Results in Australia for these products are distorted by divestments and
products which have been or will be discontinued. The base portfolio was steady with revenue of R3,4 billion, up 1%.
Latam, Asia and the USA, assisted by the launch of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate, all moved forward positively.

Manufacturing
Manufacturing revenue was up 6% to R6,6 billion. This growth was underpinned by a 9% rise in revenue from active 
pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing where both the Oss and Fine Chemicals sites made favourable contributions. 
Finished dose manufacturing revenue was flat.

Nutritionals
Revenue from Nutritionals eased 3% to R3,2 billion. While there was growth in Latam and Sub-Saharan Africa, a 21% fall
in sales in Australasia lowered the overall outcome. The fall-out in Australia from the withdrawal of informal traders
banned from importing product into China continued to dampen demand and has also caused pricing pressure as operators
have cleared consequent surplus inventory. This was a contributing factor to the lower contribution margin percentage
achieved. Both Australasia and Latam showed positive upturns in performance in the second half. In Australia inventory
levels seem to have found equilibrium allowing normal trading volumes to return while an improved performance in Mexico
lifted the Latam business.

FUNDING
R12,3 billion was paid relating to acquisitions and other capital expenditure during the year, in addition to which
R1,2 billion was paid to shareholders by way of a dividend. As a result of strong operational cash flows (R6,5 billion)
and favourable exchange rate benefits (R2,1 billion) the increase in net borrowings was limited to R4,4 billion. The
operating cash flow per share was 101% higher at 1 421 cents.

Borrowings, net of cash, amounted to R37,1 billion at the year end. The increase in working capital was limited to
R0,9 billion which was primarily related to the acquisition of the AZ and GSK anaesthetics.

The Group intends to embark on an ""amend and extend"" exercise with its primary lenders.

AGREEMENT WITH ASTRAZENECA TO ACQUIRE THE RESIDUAL RIGHTS RELATING TO AZ ANAESTHETICS
Aspen is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Aspen Global Incorporated (""AGI""), has signed an
agreement with AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca UK (""AstraZeneca"") in terms of which AGI will acquire the residual 
rights to the AZ anaesthetics (""the Transaction"") for which it acquired the commercialisation rights via an agreement 
entered into in June 2016, as announced to shareholders on 9 June 2016.

The Transaction
The terms of the concluded agreement provide that AGI will pay US$555 million as consideration for the remaining rights 
to the intellectual property and manufacturing know-how related to the AZ anaesthetics. Additionally, AGI will make
performance-related payments of up to US$211 million based on sales and gross profit in the period to 30 November 2019. 
As part of the Transaction, the terms of the existing supply agreement that included an initial period of 10 years, 
have been amended. In terms of the new agreement, AstraZeneca will continue to supply the medicines manufactured at 
AstraZeneca-owned sites to AGI for a transition period of up to five years. Management of supply from third-party sites 
is anticipated to transition to AGI within one year of closing.

Had AGI owned the aforementioned additional rights to the AZ anaesthetics for the full 12 months ended 30 June 2017,
based on the terms of the Transaction agreements and Aspen's expected related incremental costs, the Transaction would
have generated an additional contribution to operating profit of approximately US$90 million. The value of the net 
assets attributable to the Transaction equates to the consideration payable.

Rationale
The September 2016 acquisition of the commercialisation rights to the AZ anaesthetics portfolio has proven to be an
excellent strategic investment for Aspen, particularly when allied to the subsequent acquisition of the GSK anaesthetics.
By acquiring the underlying intellectual property AGI is best placed to maximise the value of this portfolio, including
through the development of additional products and markets, leveraging the intellectual property that it will own (as
opposed to licence).

Furthermore, the benefits of the strong working relationship that Aspen has developed with AstraZeneca over the past
year will continue via the ongoing supply and transition arrangements.

Completion
The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the completion of subsidiary agreements to the
satisfaction of all parties. It is anticipated that the Transaction will complete during the final quarter of 2017. 

Funding
Aspen has sufficient access to liquidity to meet the immediate funding requirements of the Transaction.

Categorisation of the Transaction
The Transaction is categorised as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

PROSPECTS
Aspen looks forward to the new financial year secure in the knowledge that the significant undertaking of transforming
the Group into a global multinational organisation focused on therapeutic specialties is at an advanced stage. The
financial and manpower investment in structural adjustments and the building of infrastructure has been substantial. 
A new foundation has been successfully established from which the Group is well positioned to pursue its strategies.

The Group has proven its capability to be successful in Emerging Markets and the entry into China should give
momentum to the current growth trend. The full cost of operating in China will only be felt in the year ahead. 
This will give rise to increased operating expenses, but will also provide a scalable platform to support future 
expansion in that country. Performance in Developed Europe has been disappointing and this will be a region receiving 
high focus in the forthcoming period.

The Anaesthetics Portfolio will benefit from the Transaction with AstraZeneca announced today, allowing Aspen to
optimise the value chain for this business. Aside from the additional value acquired, further upside can be expected 
to be realised, phased over a number of years as Aspen increases the in-house production of Anaesthetics. Although 
there is the potential for increased competition from biosimilar and generic entries, Aspen has competitive advantages 
in the supply of Thrombosis products through the efficiency of its vertically integrated supply chain. The securing 
from Teva of the licence for the NDAs for two conjugating estrogen brands and the rights to commercialise these in 
the United States is an exciting future opportunity within the High Potency & Cytotoxic portfolio. The Other 
Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands range should remain an ongoing organic growth driver and the Nutritionals business 
is well set to build on the improved performance of the second half of the past year. Plans are also in place for 
Aspen, together with its joint venture partner, to launch an infant milk formula range in China before the end of 2017.

Significant progress has been made during the past year in normalising working capital levels with the resultant
return to strong operating cash flows. Focus on working capital levels will be maintained although there 
will be operational requirements to build stock from time to time to facilitate safety stock levels while territories 
and manufacturing sites are transitioned.

A combination of acquisitive and organic growth as well as an additional contribution of R0,5 billion from the synergy
programme is expected to lift earnings in the year ahead despite the additional expenses arising from the development
of Aspen's presence in China and Japan. Financial results will continue to be subjected to the vagaries of relative
exchange rate movements. 

DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS
Taking into account the earnings and cash flow performance for the year ended 30 June 2017, existing debt service
commitments, future proposed investments and funding options, notice is hereby given that the Board has declared a
gross dividend, which is paid from income reserves, of 287 cents per ordinary share to shareholders (or 229,6 cents 
net of a 20% dividend withholding tax, where this tax applies) recorded in the share register of the Company at the 
close of business on 6 October 2017 (2016: dividend of 248 cents per share). Shareholders should seek their own advice 
on the tax consequences associated with the dividend and are particularly encouraged to ensure their records are up to 
date so that the correct withholding tax is applied to their dividend. The company income tax number is 9325178714. 
The issued share capital of the Company is 456 435 185 ordinary shares.

The directors are of the opinion that the Company will, subsequent to the payment of the dividend, satisfy the
solvency and liquidity requirements in terms of sections 4 and 46 of the Companies Act, 2008.

Future distributions will continue to be decided on a year-to-year basis.

In compliance with IAS 10: Events After Balance Sheet Date, the dividend will only be accounted for in the financial
statements in the year ending 30 June 2018.

F. HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMY        
   The Venezuelan economy is regarded as a hyperinflationary 
   economy in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards. 
   Due to the political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela, 
   the Group concluded in December 2015 that it would be more 
   appropriate to apply the DICOM rate to report the Venezuelan 
   business financial position, results of operations and cash 
   flows for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016. This resulted in a 
   devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R870 million 
   for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016. The business has since been 
   fully downscaled pending a future change in economic conditions. 
   No trading activity has been undertaken since December 2015 and the 
   devalued business is considered immaterial to the Group.

I. DISPUTED INCOME TAX MATTER
   The Aspen Group was subject to an international tax and transfer pricing audit by the South African Revenue Service 
   (""SARS"") and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited received a revised assessment in relation to its 2011 fiscal year as a 
   consequence of this audit. Aspen, with the assistance of its legal and tax advisers, entered into discussions with 
   SARS and anticipates receiving feedback from SARS as a consequence of those discussions, prior to publishing Aspen's 
   annual financial statements. Aspen remains confident that it has appropriately dealt with its related party transactions, 
   a position that is firmly supported by Aspen's legal and tax advisers. 
   
J. POTENTIAL DISPUTED MATTER - EUROPEAN COMPETITION COMMISSION        
   The European Competition Commission (the ""Commission"") has instituted an investigation of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 
   and certain of its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
   Union (""Article 102"") in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; (ii) Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine; (iv) Thioguanine; 
   and (v) Busulfan, for (a) alleged setting of unfair and excessive pricing in the form of significant price increases; 
   (b) alleged unfair/abusive negotiating practices; (c) alleged stock allocation strategies designed to reduce supply; and 
   (d) alleged practices hindering parallel trade, in the European economic area (excluding Italy).    

   The Commission has confirmed that at this stage it has ""no firm conclusions"" on whether Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 
   and/or its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries have undertaken any infringement of Article 102 as it requires to complete 
   its investigation. The Commission's decision whether to formally open a case is likely only to be made during the first 
   quarter of 2019 after conclusion of its investigation.                                                                            

   The outcome of the Commission matter is unknown and uncertain at this stage and therefore no liability has been raised in 
   the statement of financial position.                                                                            

K. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND BUSINESSES                      
   June 2017                                                       
   Set out below is the provisional accounting for the following business combinations (final accounting for AstraZeneca 
   anaesthetics portfolio):  

   AstraZeneca anaesthetics portfolio                          
   With effect from 1 September 2016, AGI acquired the exclusive rights to commercialise the anaesthetics portfolio of AstraZeneca 
   globally (excluding the USA). As consideration for the commercialisation rights, AGI paid USD410 million with a further payment 
   of USD110 million due on 1 July 2017. Additionally, AGI will make sales-related payments of up to USD250 million based on sales 
   in the 24 months following completion.                          

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R6,5 billion. The estimation of post-acquisition 
   operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration of the business into the 
   existing operations of the Group.                             

   Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China, Pakistan and India                 
   As part of its acquisition of the thrombosis products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GSK in 2014, AGI also acquired an option to 
   purchase the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the rights, most notably China. AGI has exercised its option 
   and, with effect from 1 January 2017, acquired Fraxiparine and Arixtra in these countries for a consideration of GBP45 million.  

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R0,3 billion. The estimation of post-acquisition 
   operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration of the business into the 
   existing operations of the Group.                                                                            

   GSK anaesthetics portfolio             
   With effect from 1 March 2017 AGI acquired a portfolio of anaesthetics globally (excluding the USA) from GSK. As consideration 
   for the commercialisation rights, AGI paid GBP180 million with further potential milestone payments of up to GBP100 million, 
   based on the results of the acquired portfolio in the 36 months following completion.                             

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R0,5 billion. The estimation of post-acquisition 
   operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration of the business into the 
   existing operations of the Group.

L. ILLUSTRATIVE CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE REPORT ON SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                      
   The Group has presented selected line items from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and certain trading profit 
   metrics on a constant exchange rate basis in the tables below.   
   
   The pro forma constant exchange rate information is presented to demonstrate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange 
   rates on the Group's reported results. The constant exchange rate report is the responsibility of the Group's Board of 
   Directors and is presented for illustrative purposes only. Due to the nature of this information, it may not fairly present 
   the Group's financial position, changes in equity and results of operations or cash flows. The pro forma information has been 
   compiled in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and the Revised Guide on Pro Forma information by SAICA and the accounting 
   policies of the Group as at 30 June 2017. The illustrative constant exchange rate report on selected financial data has been 
   derived from the audited financial information and has been reported on by Aspen's auditors in an assurance report, which is 
   available for inspection at the Company's registered office.     
   
   The Group's financial performance is impacted by numerous currencies which underlie the reported trading results, where  
   even within geographic segments, the Group trades in multiple currencies (""source currencies""). The constant exchange rate 
   restatement has been calculated by adjusting the prior year's reported results at the current year's reported average 
   exchange rates. Restating the prior year's numbers provides illustrative comparability with the current year's reported 
   performance by adjusting the estimated effect of source currency movements.     
   
   The listing of average exchange rates against the Rand for the currencies contributing materially to the impact of exchange 
   rate movements are set out below:

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The reviewed provisional Group financial results have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards, IFRIC interpretations, the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, South African Companies Act, 
2008 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 34: Interim Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these provisional Group financial results are in terms of
International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements for 
the year ended 30 June 2016 except for changes to the segmental analysis which are explained in detail below.

The provisional Group financial results have been rounded and disclosed in Rand billions to assist financial analysis.
All percentage change variances have been calculated using unrounded numbers to record accurate variance trends. 

These provisional Group financial results have been prepared under the supervision of the Deputy Group Chief
Executive, MG Attridge CA(SA) and approved by the Board of Directors.

RESTATEMENT OF GROUP SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Following recent acquisitions, the Group has revised the reportable segments to reflect its current operating model and
achieve alignment with the change in the way in which the business is managed and reported on by the Chief Operating
Decision Maker (""CODM""). The regional business reportable segments of International, South Africa, Asia Pacific and
Sub-Saharan Africa have been replaced by the Pharmaceutical and Nutritional business segments. The Pharmaceutical
business segment has been further split into the Therapeutic Focused Brands and Other Pharmaceuticals reportable segments.

Therapeutic Focused Brands consist of Focused Brands in the portfolios comprising Aspen's three major pharmaceutical
therapeutic areas, being Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency & Cytotoxics. Other Pharmaceuticals comprises
revenue from the balance of the Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands as well as Manufacturing revenue relating to both 
active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dose form products.

The entity-wide revenue disclosure has therefore been revised to reflect the three therapeutic areas which constitute
the Therapeutic Focused Brands with the balance of the Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands being recorded as Other
Commercial Pharmaceutical Brands. The regions have been further refined to split Europe CIS into Developed Europe and 
Developing Europe & CIS segments. The Asia Pacific region has been split into the following segments:
- Australasia;
- China;
- Japan; and
- Other Asia

The hyperinflationary economy is no longer separately reported due to immateriality.

The GSK Aspen Healthcare for Africa Collaboration which was a material component of the Sub-Saharan Africa region was
terminated with effect from 31 December 2016 and as a consequence, the Sub-Saharan Africa region is no longer a material
region. On this basis the South African and Sub-Saharan African regions have been consolidated into a single
Sub-Saharan Africa region. 

AUDIT REVIEW
These results have been reviewed by Aspen’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. Their unmodified review conclusion is 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Any reference to future financial performance included in 
this announcement, has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s auditors. 

The illustrative constant exchange rate report on selected financial data has been derived from the audited financial 
information and has been reported on by Aspen’s auditors in an assurance report which is available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is the responsibility

ITALIAN COURT RULING ON APPEAL – ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS

Aspen Holdings has been informed that the Italian Court has dismissed Aspen’s appeal against the
Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) ruling relating to Aspen’s portfolio of oncology products
distributed in Italy. The effect of this is that Aspen will be obliged to now pay the fine imposed by
the ICA in the amount of €5.2 million, plus interest thereon.

Aspen has noted the abridged principle judgment of the Italian Court announced earlier today and is
awaiting the release of the full reasons for that judgment and the Italian Court’s assessment of the
underlying facts, including that:
   - prices for most of the relevant Aspen drugs in Italy had not been increased for between 40
     and 60 years; and
   - a generic version of one of the Aspen drugs in question has recently been approved in Italy
     with a list price of more than double that of the Aspen drug on an equivalent dose basis.

The reasons for the judgment will be handed down in due course. Aspen will engage its advisers and
consider the matter further against receipt of those reasons, including Aspen’s automatic right to
lodge a further appeal to the “Council of State” appeal court.

ASPEN’S SUPPLEMENTARY RESPONSE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMPETITION COMMISSION
ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement released by Aspen on 13 June 2017 wherein it was
confirmed that:

 -   Aspen had noted the announcement made by the South African Competition Commission (“the
     Commission”) on 13 June 2017 that it will be investigating Aspen for suspected abuse of dominance
     in respect of the provision of cancer medication in South Africa;

 -   pharmaceutical prices in South Africa are approved by the South African Department of Health in
     terms of the Single Exit Price (“SEP”) regulatory framework which establishes a universal fixed price
     for each pharmaceutical product; and

 -   Aspen has not increased pricing of its products outside of this regulatory framework and has clearly
     demonstrated its commitment to providing quality medicines affordably over many years. The
     supply of the oncology products in question is no exception.

As further clarification, Aspen confirms that it has, to date, not had any engagement with the
Commission on the matters contained in the Commission’s announcement of 13 June 2017 and
welcomes the opportunity to meet and clarify the following key issues on the products listed by the
Commission in its announcement:

 -   these products are all post-patent and have been for some time now;

 -   there are no obvious barriers precluding generic entry for these products. Invariably in situations
     like these, the lack of generic entry is either attributable to the sub-economical pricing of the
     branded products and/or an unattractive market size; and

 -   despite the lack of generic competition on these products, Aspen reiterates and emphasises that it
     has never increased the prices for these products in South Africa beyond the allowable SEP
     increases as gazetted by the South African Department of Health from time to time.
Aspen hopes to demonstrate, through its active engagement with the Commission and other affected
stakeholders, its ongoing commitment to supplying the South African market with quality affordable
medicines for which it is renowned.

To provide context to shareholders it is confirmed that, while Aspen fully acknowledges the vital nature
of the four oncology products listed in the Commission’s announcement, these products have a
collective turnover of about R3 million in the South African private market.

ASPEN’S RESPONSE TO THE PRESS REPORTS OF 14 AND 15 APRIL 2017

In reference to the articles reported in the European press on 14 and 15 April 2017, Aspen Holdings
wishes to comment as follows:

    -    Aspen has clearly demonstrated its commitment to providing quality medicines affordably over
         many years. The supply of the oncology products in question is no exception.

    -    Aspen’s status as a responsible and committed provider of quality, affordable medicines is further
         validated by the role it has played in saving millions of lives across Africa through pioneering and
         supplying generic anti-retroviral medicine in Africa for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.

    -    The content of the reports concern matters that are sub-judice. Out of respect for the integrity
         of ongoing legal processes with European regulators, as well as the court in Italy, Aspen will not
         comment on these public allegations. Instead, Aspen looks forward to the opportunity to
         demonstrate the integrity and legality of its practices in the context of these legal processes.

    -    The oncology portfolio in question generated revenue in the European Union in Aspen’s
         financial year ended 30 June 2016 of €60 million (R963 million). The majority of the revenue
         was from the sale of tablets which have an average price of approximately €2 per tablet. The
         Aspen Group’s total revenue for the year ending 30 June 2016 was R35,6 billion.

Unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2016


COMMENTARY 
GROUP PERFORMANCE
Revenue for the Group grew 13% to R19,8 billion and normalised headline earnings per share increased by 6% to 692 cents 
in the six months ended 31 December 2016. 

The results were favourably influenced by the following:
- The acquisition of AstraZeneca's global (excluding the USA) anaesthetics portfolio (""the AZ anaesthetics"") which was
  effective from 1 September 2016 and generated R2,8 billion of revenue during the period;
- Revenue of R0,4 billion from the sale of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (""HPC"") in the USA following the conclusion of
  a supply and distribution agreement with a major pharmaceutical company; and
- Cash generated from operating activities improved considerably, more than doubling to R3,2 billion as measures to 
  improve working capital management took effect.

Offsetting this were the following factors:
- The anticipated decline in the South African business, which is nonetheless well on its path to recovery;
- Margin pressure suffered by the nutritional business in Latin America due to reduced production activity as surplus
  inventories arising from Aspen's withdrawal from Venezuela were redeployed;
- Legislated price decreases, GBP weakness following the Brexit vote, supply constraints and adjustments to the
  distribution model weighing on performance in the Europe CIS territory;and
- Foreign exchange losses, primarily arising from the Rand strengthening against forward exchange contracts. 


INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
The International business remained the largest segment of the Group, contributing 50% to revenue from customers.  Sales 
to customers in this business increased 11% to R10.0 billion.

The Europe CIS territory was the biggest contributor to the International business, increasing sales from customers by
2% to R6,7 billion. Sales of finished dose form pharmaceutical products to healthcare providers (""commercial pharma"") in
this territory were up 9% to R4,5 billion. This performance benefited from the inclusion of the AZ anaesthetics with the
offsetting factors mentioned earlier tempering growth achieved. 

In Latin America, revenue from customers increased 11% to R2,0 billion and commercial pharma sales were 26% higher at
R1,3 billion. Excluding the AZ anaesthetics, the underlying pharmaceutical portfolio increased sales 4% to R1,0 billion.
Revenue from nutritionals grew in local currencies, but the weakness of the Mexican Peso in particular caused reported
revenue to decline 9% to R0,7 billion. Margins were unfavourably affected by lower volumes of production in the Vallejo
manufacturing site in Mexico for the reasons reported earlier. 

In the USA, the arrangements with the initially appointed distributor for HPC were terminated and a supply and distribution 
agreement was signed with a major pharmaceutical company which acquired R0,4 billion of product. Future sales of HPC in the 
USA will be dependent on the success of this distributor in placing the product in the trade. It is unlikely that there will 
be further material sales of HPC by Aspen during the course of the 2017 calendar year.

Capital projects to enhance production efficiency and ensure highest technical support levels continue at the Notre
Dame de Bondeville site in France. At the Oss active pharmaceutical ingredient site in the Netherlands, new capacity 
is being added and investment in the sustainability of the site is ongoing. 

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (""SSA"") BUSINESS
In light of the cancellation of the collaboration with GSK in SSA outside of South Africa, the business segment
previously referred to as SSA has been combined with South Africa, under the heading of the SSA business. 

Sales to customers in SSA declined 1% to R4.6 billion.

Nutritionals revenue grew 9% to R0,5 billion and manufacturing revenue improved 34% to R0,7 billion. However, as previously 
communicated, commercial pharma remained under pressure as the resolution of supply chain issues continued, causing sales 
to decline 8% to R3,4 billion. Despite a month-long strike at the Port Elizabeth and East London manufacturing sites in 
August, significant progress has been achieved in overcoming the supply constraints affecting the commercial pharma division 
which delivered improved results in the latter months of the period. 

The building of a second sterile facility in Port Elizabeth is under way, creating new opportunities to bring
additional production to this site.

ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS
Sales to customers in the Asia Pacific business increased 36% to R5.2 billion.  This region benefits most from the AZ anaesthetics
which added R1,6 billion to the sales achieved.
In Australasia sales from the base pharmaceutical portfolio grew 3% to R2,3 billion. Sales of nutritionals were 23% 
lower at R0,4 billion and margin percentages came under pressure.The Australian nutritional industry continues to adapt to lower
demand following the withdrawal of informal traders barred from importing product into China. In Asia, the business has expanded
substantially with the addition of the AZ anaesthetics. Trade has commenced in China where R0,6 billion of anaesthetic sales was 
achieved in the period. The underlying commercial pharma portfolio in Asia advanced revenue 17% to R0,9 billion. 

FUNDING
During the period R7,4 billion was paid relating to acquisitions and other capital expenditure, in addition to which
R1,1 billion was paid to shareholders by way of a dividend. As a result of strong operational cash flows (R3,2 billion)
and favourable exchange rate benefits (R3,0 billion) the increase in net borrowings was limited to R2,9 billion.
Borrowings, net of cash, amounted to R35,6 billion at the period end. The increase in working capital was limited to 
R0,7 billion which was primarily related to the acquisition of the AZ anaesthetics.

PROSPECTS
The transformation of Aspen into a global, multinational organisation focused on therapeutic specialties over the past
few years has been a challenging undertaking, necessitating substantial investment. During this process, it has been
necessary to build infrastructure, establish new supply sources and transition management of product portfolios across 
the world. There have been resultant inefficiencies in overhead structures and working capital management which continue 
to receive high levels of focus. Unfavourable currency movements and legislated price cuts have also placed pressure on
performance. Consequently, this will dilute the synergies realised from various projects. 

Results in the second half of the 2017 financial year will be influenced by the strengthening of the Rand which, if 
sustained, will dilute foreign earnings which comprise the greatest portion of Aspen's income. The outlook to 30 June 2017
will also be influenced by the following: 
- The extensive work which has been undertaken in order to overcome the supply chain problems experienced in the South African
  business which is expected to result in a substantial improvement in performance is anticipated in the second half of this 
  financial year; 
- The amended distribution model is expected to result in a stronger second half in the Europe/CIS territory;
- The benefit from the inclusion of the AZ anaesthetics for six months, having contributed for four months to 31 December 2016; 
- Aspen's leading position in anaesthetics (outside of the USA) will also be enhanced with the inclusion of the acquisition of
  the GSK anaesthetics portfolio which became effective on 1 March 2017; 
- The completion of the acquisition of Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China will further bolster Aspen's entry to the world's 
  second largest pharmaceutical market;
- The cancellation of the collaboration with GSK in SSA outside of South Africa; and
- The production volumes in the Vallejo nutritionals facility are scheduled to return to more normal levels which should 
  result in an improved performance from this business segment in the forthcoming months.

Overall a stronger underlying performance in the second half of the 2017 financial year is anticipated.

   the Group net asset value.                                                                   

F. HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMY
   The Venezuelan economy is regarded as a hyperinflationary economy in terms of International Financial Reporting 
   Standards. Effective March 2016 two regulated exchange rates were applicable to Aspen's business:
   - The DIPRO rate (previously the official CENCOEX rate) for the importation of high priority goods including 
     nutritionals and pharmaceutical medicines. This rate increased to VEF10,0 per USD from VEF6,30 per USD in 
     March 2016.                                                                   
   - The DICOM rate (previously the SIMADI rate) which is a floating rate published daily by the Venezuelan central 
     bank. The DICOM rate opened in March 2016 at an initial rate of VEF206,8 per USD and the closing rate at 
     30 June 2016 was VEF628,34 per USD. The previous SIMADI rate was VEF200 per USD as at 31 December 2015.

   Due to political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela, the Group concluded in December 2015 that it would be 
   more appropriate to apply the DICOM rate (previously the SIMADI rate) to report the Venezuelan business‘ financial 
   position, results of operations and cash flows. This resulted in a devaluation loss on foreign denominated 
   liabilities of R870 million in June 2016 (December 2015: R841 million).

   The business has been downscaled pending a future change in the economic conditions. No significant trading activity 
   has been undertaken since December 2015.

   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R2,8 billion. The estimation 
   of post-acquisition operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate

   Fraxiparine and Arixtra in China, Pakistan and India
   As part of its acquisition of the thrombosis products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GSK in 2014, AGI also 
   acquired an option to acquire the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the rights, 
   most notably China. AGI has exercised its option and, with effect from 1 January 2017, acquired Fraxiparine 
   and Arixtra in these countries for a consideration of GBP45 million.

   On 21 May 2015, Pharmacare Ltd acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Norgine Pty Ltd in South Africa 
   (""Norgine SA"") for a consideration of EUR29 million. Norgine SA commercialises a portfolio of branded gastro-

   African Competition Authorities was obtained on 25 August 2015. This transaction completed on 30 September 2015.
   
   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R100.4 million. The estimation

   HPC business
   AGI entered into an agreement with McGuff Pharmaceuticals Inc. (""McGuff"") for the exclusive supply of the 
   finished dose form of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (""HPC"") in the United States. With effect from 1 December 2015,
   AGI acquired the related intellectual property and the approved Abbreviated New Drug Application for an upfront 
   consideration of USD15 million. Milestone payments, of between USD21 million and USD28 million, are payable over 
   a five-year supply term and are partly contingent on future sales performance. 
   
   In December 2016 AGI and a major United States-based pharmaceutical company entered into a supply and 
   distribution agreement for HPC in that country, which resulted in initial revenue of R0,4 billion being 
   recognised in the results for the six months ended 31 December 2016.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Acquisition of a portfolio of anaesthetic products
With effect from 1 March 2017 AGI acquired a portfolio of anaesthetics globally (excluding the USA) from GSK. As
consideration for the commercialisation rights, AGI paid GBP180 million and further milestone payments of up to 
GBP100 million, based on the results of the acquired portfolio in the 36 months following completion. 

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRIC interpretations, the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited,
South African Companies Act, 2008 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 34: Interim Reporting. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim financial results are in terms of
International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the Annual Financial Statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2016.

The Group segmental analysis has been revised to reflect the Group's current operating model and all comparative
numbers have been restated accordingly. The updated segmental analysis is aligned to the way the business is managed 
and reported on by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM""). The regional split on the entity-wide revenue disclosure 
has been expanded following the recent business transactions.

The Group segmental analysis has changed as follows:
1. Certain previously reported regions on the entity-wide revenue disclosure (Europe/CIS and Asia Pacific) have been
   further expanded to show the following regions separately:
   a. Europe;
   b. CIS;
   c. Australasia;
   d. China;
   e. Japan; and
   f. Other Asia.

2. The GSK Aspen Healthcare for Africa Collaboration which was a material component of the sub-Saharan Africa region
   has been terminated effective from 31 December 2016 and as a consequence the sub-Saharan Africa region is no longer 
   a material region. On this basis the South African and sub-Saharan African regions have been consolidated into a 
   broader all encompassing sub-Saharan Africa region. To ensure future comparability of the broader sub-Saharan Africa 
   region, the GSK Aspen Healthcare for Africa Collaboration is no longer reflected at a gross revenue level and is 
   reported at a net revenue level with the comparative periods being accordingly restated.

The unaudited interim financial results have been rounded and disclosed in R'billions to assist financial analysis.
All percentage change variances have been calculated using unrounded numbers to record accurate variance trends.

These unaudited interim financial results were prepared under the supervision of the Deputy Group Chief executive, 
MG Attridge CA(SA) and approved by the Board of Directors.

Trading Statement
Aspen shareholders are hereby advised that normalised headline earnings per share
(“NHEPS”) , headline earnings per share and earnings per share for the 6 months ended
31 December 2016 are expected to vary from those reported in the comparative period,
ended 31 December 2015, within the following ranges:

Notes:

1. NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading items.
   NHEPS is the primary measure used by management to assess Aspen’s underlying
   financial performance.

2. The significant increase in headline earnings per share is attributable to the once-off
   negative effect in the comparative period arising from the devaluation of Aspen’s
   Venezuelan business.

3. The decline in earnings per share is due to the positive effect of significant capital
   profits realised in the comparative period arising from the disposal of non-core
   businesses and products.

The financial results on which this trading announcement is based have not been reviewed
or reported on by Aspen`s external auditors.

Aspen`s interim results for the 6 months ended 31 December 2016 are scheduled to be
published on SENS on 9 March 2017.

officer, will remain a member of the Aspen board of directors.

Stephen Saad, the Aspen Group Chief Executive, said “Aspen’s exceptional relationship with GSK and the
many mutually beneficial trading activities between the companies remain unaffected by this disposal. We
are pleased that Aspen shareholders are relieved of the uncertainty caused by GSK’s stated intention to
dispose of its interests, which eliminates the overhang caused by this uncertainty.”

COMMENTARY

GROUP PERFORMANCE
As reported in the interim results, the factors set out below have significantly affected comparability with the
results of the prior year and need to be considered when assessing performance for the 2016 financial year:
1. The completion on 31 August 2015 of the divestment of the generics business conducted in Australia as well as
   certain branded products distributed in Australia to Strides group companies, the related termination of 
   licence arrangements in Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of the divestment of a portfolio of 
   products distributed in South Africa to Litha Pharma (collectively “the Divestments”). The Divestments gave rise 
   to a pre-tax profit on disposal of R1,6 billion. However, as a consequence of the timing of these transactions, 
   the contribution to the trading results by the Divestments is substantially reduced in the 2016 financial year. 
   In the period from 1 July 2015 until the effective date of divestment, revenue from the Divestments was 
   R0,2 billion whereas revenue from the Divestments for the year ended 30 June 2015 was R1,8 billion.

2. The economic situation in Venezuela deteriorated over the year to 30 June 2016 and the Venezuelan 
   authorities have increasingly limited authorisations to pay for pharmaceutical imports using the official DIPRO 
   rate during this period of between Venezuelan Bolivar (“VEF”) 6,30 and 10,00 per US Dollar (“USD”). As a 
   consequence of the limited payment approvals and the uncertain economic and political situation in Venezuela, 
   before reporting the interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2015, the Group has concluded that it 
   would be more appropriate to apply the DICOM exchange rate (VEF628,34 per USD at 30 June 2016) to report the 
   Venezuelan business’ financial position, results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended 
   30 June 2016. This has resulted in a one-off currency devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of 
   R870 million.

The profit arising from the Divestments, the currency devaluation loss and the hyperinflationary adjustments 
relating to Venezuela are excluded, in addition to other specific non-trading items, in determining normalised 
performance. In order to provide meaningful comparability of the financial performance of the ongoing underlying 
business, a comparable measure has been determined by removing the contribution from the Divestments and including 
the results of Aspen’s business in Venezuela translated at VEF628,34 per USD in the prior reporting period. 

The key performance measures for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2016 and the percentage change from the 
prior year are summarised as follows:

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
The International Business increased comparable revenue 19% to R18,9 billion and grew comparable operating profit
before amortisation, adjusted for specific non-trading items (“EBITA”), 15% to R5,9 billion. 

Commercial revenue from pharmaceutical product sales to healthcare providers in Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (“Europe CIS”) improved 22% to R8,5 billion. The acquisition of Mono-Embolex, a thrombolytic 
product with almost all of its sales in Germany, in the second half of the previous year further strengthened 
Aspen’s portfolio in this therapeutic area.

In Latin America (excluding Venezuela), revenue to customers increased 3% to R3,5 billion. Nutritional sales was 
the growth driver, increasing 18% and Infacare was successfully launched in Mexico, securing an important 
government tender. Aspen has suspended trade in Venezuela pending an improvement in economic conditions. 

Sales to customers in the North America and the Middle East North Africa territories increased strongly off 
relatively low bases, growing by 42% and 51% respectively.

Manufacturing revenue continued to advance with particularly strong growth in active pharmaceutical ingredient 
(“API”) sales of 19% to R4,0 billion.

The installation of a new high speed pre-filled syringe filling line at Aspen Notre Dame de Bondeville was 
completed during the period and commercial production is underway. At Aspen Oss the capital expenditure projects 
include adding new production capabilities and maintaining the sustainability of the site.

SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS
Comparable revenue in South Africa was down 1% at R8,1 billion. Nutritionals products maintained their growth
momentum, adding 11% to revenue and there were impressive increases in manufacturing revenue for both APIs 
(+52%) and finished dose forms (+69%). The pharmaceutical business was however constrained by supply problems 
which were compounded by sub-optimal prioritisation of available capacity, leading to a weak second half 
performance. Private sector comparable pharmaceutical revenue was 7% lower. Margins came under pressure from a 
weakening local currency which raised the cost of imports and from operating expense growing faster than sales. 
This was the primary cause of the comparable EBITA for the South African business dropping 15% to R1,5 billion.

The new high volume, high potency multipurpose API facility at Fine Chemicals has commenced production. The high
containment facility in Port Elizabeth has been completed and manufacturing trials are in progress. Construction 
of the additional specialist sterile manufacturing facility in Port Elizabeth is progressing and a number of 
capacity enhancement projects are also underway at this site. These capital projects will provide an important 
strategic advantage to the Group by enabling it to add value to its expanding portfolio of products that require 
complex manufacture. 

ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS 
In the Asia Pacific region, comparable revenue was up 11% to R7,4 billion and comparable EBITA was 10% higher at 
R1,6 billion. In Australasia, sales of pharmaceuticals to customers increased 2% to R4,4 billion with a strong 
performance from core pharmaceutical products in a challenging trading environment being offset by a reduced 
contribution from licensed products in the process of being phased out. Revenue from the nutritionals range was 
6% higher at R1,0 billion. Sales to customers in Asia continued to grow, climbing 29% with Japan 
leading the way. 

SUB-SAHARAN BUSINESS
Gross revenue in sub-Saharan Africa increased 18% to R3,3 billion. Currency weakness across the region and
unfavourable new VAT legislation in Tanzania squeezed margins, but a compensation payment in the Collaboration 
assisted the region to raise EBITA 31% to R0,4 billion.

FUNDING
The Group undertook a successful restructuring of its debt arrangements during the year which became effective
from 30 June 2016. The Group’s USD term debt facilities were repaid under the restructure and replaced 
by EUR term debt facilities which are better aligned with Aspen’s underlying trading cash flows. There was strong 
interest from debt providers in supporting Aspen’s new debt package and the EUR facility was significantly 
oversubscribed. 

Borrowings, net of cash, increased by R2,7 billion to R32,7 billion as a result of unfavourable currency 
translation effects together with the devaluation of the cash held in Venezuela exceeding net positive cash 
generated. 

Group operating cash flows were negatively affected by a R3,4 billion increase in working capital. The unfavourable
currency translation effect on foreign currency denominated working capital balances accounted for R1,4 billion of 
this increase and planned stock builds relating to transition of manufacturing arrangements were the other major 
contributing factor. 

Gearing improved to 43% from 47% in the previous year while net interest paid was covered 6 times by operating 
profit before amortisation. Net foreign exchange losses reduced from R480 million in the 2015 financial year to a 
gain of R36 million in the current year.

POST YEAR END CORPORATE ACTIVITY
In August 2016, Aspen Global Incorporated (“AGI”) signed an agreement with AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca UK
(“AstraZeneca”) whereby AGI agreed to acquire the exclusive rights to commercialise AstraZeneca’s global 
(excluding the USA) anaesthetics portfolio (“the AZ Transaction”). AstraZeneca’s anaesthetics portfolio comprises 
seven  established medicines, namely Diprivan (general anaesthesia), EMLA (topical anaesthetic) and five local 
anaesthetics (Xylocaine/Xylocard/Xyloproct, Marcaine, Naropin, Carbocaine and Citanest) (“the AZ portfolio”). The 
products in the AZ Portfolio are sold in more than 100 countries worldwide including China, Japan, Australia and 
Brazil. These products generated revenue of US$592 million in the year ended 31 December 2015. In terms of the 
concluded agreement, as consideration for the commercialisation rights, AGI will pay US$520 million and 
double-digit percentage royalties on sales of the AZ Portfolio. Additionally, AGI will make sales related payments 
of up to US$250 million based on sales in the 24 months following completion. AGI and AstraZeneca have also signed 
a supply agreement whereby AstraZeneca will supply the AZ Portfolio to AGI. This supply agreement has an initial 
period of 10 years. This transaction became effective on 1 September 2016. Based on the terms of the agreements 
and Aspen’s current cost of funding, Aspen’s interest in the AZ Portfolio would have generated a contribution to 
profit before tax of approximately US$100 million in the year ended 31 December 2015.

On 12 September 2016 Aspen announced that various Group subsidiaries had concluded three separate transactions 
with GlaxoSmithkline (“GSK”) companies as follows:
* AGI signed an agreement with GSK whereby AGI will acquire a portfolio of anaesthetic products globally (with 
  the exception of certain territories, primarily North America) (“the Anaesthetics Transaction”). GSK’s 
  anaesthetics portfolio comprises five established medicines, namely Ultiva (general anaesthesia) and four 
  muscle relaxants (Nimbex, Mivacron, Tracrium and Anectine) (“the GSK Portfolio”). The products in the GSK 
  Portfolio are sold in more than 100 countries worldwide including Japan, Brazil, Korea, Germany and 
  Italy. In terms of the concluded agreement, as consideration for the Portfolio, AGI will pay an initial amount 
  of £180 million and milestone payments of up to £100 million based on the results of the Portfolio in the 
  36 months following completion. AGI and GSK have also signed a supply agreement whereby GSK will supply the 
  products to AGI for four years. The GSK Portfolio is expected to generate revenue of approximately £70 million 
  in the year ended 31 December 2016. The Anaesthetics Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and 
  is anticipated to complete during the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 financial year. 
* As part of its acquisition of the thrombolytic products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GSK in 2014, 
  AGI also acquired an option to acquire the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the 
  rights, most notably China. AGI has exercised its option to acquire Fraxiparine and Arixtra in these countries 
  for a consideration of £45 million. Approximately £30 million of revenue is generated by the thrombolytic 
  products in China. The completion of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products in the relevant territories 
  is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 
  financial year. 
* Pharmacare Limited (“Pharmacare”) and GSK have agreed to cancel the rights of Pharmacare to collaborate in the
  sub-Saharan business of GSK (“the SSA Collaboration”). These rights were acquired as part of a basket of 
  transactions with GSK in 2009. GSK will pay Pharmacare £45 million as consideration for the cancellation. The 
  SSA Collaboration generated approximately R2,6 billion of gross revenue in the 2016 financial year. The 
  cancellation of the SSA Collaboration is expected to become effective in the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 
  financial year.
If the GSK Portfolio was owned for the entire 2017 financial year, it would be expected to add approximately 
75 cents per share to the normalised headline earnings per share (“NHEPS”) of the Group. The net impact on 
NHEPS of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products and the cancellation of the SSA Collaboration should 
not be material. 

PROSPECTS
The transactions announced after the closing of the 2016 financial year represent further steps in Aspen’s 
strategy to move towards sharpened focus on key therapy areas and to move away from areas where the Group is 
less able to add value. This intent is also reflected in the Divestments completed earlier in the year. A key 
element of Aspen’s inorganic expansion strategy is to acquire products within therapeutic areas that are both 
niche in nature and complementary to its existing operations. Anaesthetics has been identified as a therapeutic 
category which is aligned with the Group’s strategic development plans. The AZ Portfolio and the GSK Portfolio 
are complementary, providing Aspen with a leading range of anaesthetic products distributed globally. As a 
category of pharmaceuticals that primarily involves sterile manufacturing and that is dispensed largely in 
hospitals and clinics, anaesthetics present an opportunity to leverage both Aspen’s existing hospital focused 
sales force that is currently promoting thrombolytic products and, potentially in due course, sterile 
manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, the key territories in which the anaesthetics are sold represent an 
excellent fit with Aspen’s existing operational geographic footprint and those territories where the Group 
has ambitions to establish a presence. The transactions also have initiated the establishment of a material 
business in China where the acquisition of the thrombolytic products from GSK creates synergistic 
opportunities with the acquired AZ Portfolio.

Significant work has been done in effectively consolidating the major acquisitions that were concluded in 
the 2015 financial year, including bringing three major manufacturing sites into the Aspen supply network and 
transferring more than 2 000 new employees to Aspen. The foundation has been well set for the business units 
to continue to build on the positive results delivered in the 2016 financial year. In the South African 
private sector pharmaceutical division is expected to record growth in the forthcoming year, although the
first half will continue to suffer from supply issues.

Inventory carrying levels remain too high in certain business units and various projects are underway to 
rectify this position. Inevitably though, working capital will need to be built to sustain the recent 
acquisitions.

Aspen trades in a diversified mix of currencies which generally diminishes currency risk on a Group-wide 
basis. This risk has been further mitigated by the replacement of USD debt with EUR debt, achieving better 
matching between trading cash flows and borrowings.

In the 2015 final results announcement, Aspen identified a number of projects aimed at delivering synergies 
from recent acquisitions, targeting an additional R2,5 billion in EBITA from these synergies by the 2019 
financial year. These projects include lowering the cost of goods for the thrombolytic products portfolio, 
improving margins in the infant nutritionals business, bringing new manufacturing capacity and technologies 
on-line, building the third-party API business and leveraging acquired intellectual property. Particular 
opportunities have been identified to build a niche business based on supply of specialised APIs and 
finished dose forms to the United States. Significant progress has been made over the last year in regard 
to the realisation of these synergies. Aspen is confident that this target will be achieved and exceeded. 
Benefits of approximately R300 million came through during the past year.  It is anticipated that between 
R500 million and R1 billion in further synergies will be achieved in the 2017 financial year.  The realisation 
of these synergies, ongoing organic growth from the base business and the added contribution from the recently 
announced anaesthesia acquisitions are expected to result in a strong increase in earnings in the 2017 financial 
year.

   The Venezuelan economy is regarded as a hyperinflationary economy in terms of International Financial Reporting 
   Standards.
   Effective March 2016 two regulated exchange rates were applicable to Aspen’s business:
   * The DIPRO rate (previously the official CENCOEX rate) for the importation of high priority goods including 
     nutritionals and pharmaceutical medicines. This rate increased to VEF10,0 per USD from VEF6,30 per USD in 
     March 2016.
   * The DICOM rate (previously the SIMADI rate) which is a floating rate published daily by the Venezuelan 
     central bank. The DICOM rate opened in March 2016 at an initial rate of VEF206,8 per USD and the closing 
     rate at 30 June was VEF628,34 per USD. The previous SIMADI rate was VEF200 per USD as at 31 December 
     2015.
 
   Due to the continuing political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela, the Group concluded in December 2015 
   that it would be more appropriate to apply the DICOM rate (previously the SIMADI rate) to report the Venezuelan 
   business financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016. The 
   economic situation in Venezuela has further deteriorated since December 2015 and the Venezuelan authorities 
   have only approved payments for imports to the value of US$3 million at the DIPRO rate (previously the official 
   CENCOEX rate) which ranged between VEF6,30 and 10,0 per USD during the second six-month period to 30 June 2016. 
   (For the six-month period to 31 December imports to the value of US$9 million were approved at the DIPRO rate).

   This has resulted in a devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R870 million (December 2015: 
   R841 million). For the 12 months ended 30 June 2015, the Group applied the DIPRO rate (previously the official 
   CENCOEX rate) of 6,30 per USD as circumstances at that time supported this rate. Aspen will continue to monitor 
   the development of payments received and the exchange rate mechanism. Should the receipt of payments from 
   Venezuela improve or if it can no longer be assumed that the DICOM exchange rate is the relevant exchange rate 
   for the translation this could lead to an amended estimate, which in turn could trigger an amended currency 
   translation. No significant trading activity was undertaken during the six-month period to 30 June 2016 and the 
   business has accordingly been downscaled pending a future change in the economic conditions.

J. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND BUSINESSES
   2016
   Set out below is the provisional accounting for the following June 2016 business combinations:
   Norgine SA
   On 21 May 2015, Pharmacare acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Norgine (Pty) Limited in South Africa 
   (“Norgine SA”) for a consideration of EUR29 million. Norgine SA commercialises a portfolio of branded 
   gastro-intestinal products in South Africa and surrounding territories. The approval of this transaction by the 
   South African competition authorities was obtained on 25 August 2015. This transaction was completed on 
   30 September 2015.
   
   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R100,4 million. The estimation of 
   post-acquisition operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration 
   of the business into the existing operations of the Group.         
   
   HPC business                                                                                                              
   AGI entered into an agreement with McGuff Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“McGuff”) for the exclusive supply of the finished 
   dose form of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (“HPC”) in the USA. AGI acquired the related intellectual property and 
   the approved Abbreviated New Drug Application for an upfront consideration of US$15 million. Milestone payments, 
   of between US$21 million and US$28 million, are payable over a five-year supply term and are partly contingent on
   future sales performance.               
   
   Post-acquisition revenue included in the statement of comprehensive income was R29,9 million. The estimation of 
   post-acquisition operating profits is impracticable and not reasonably determinable due to the immediate integration 
   of the business into the existing operations of the Group.

   On 1 May 2015, the Company acquired 65% of the issued share capital of Kama Industries Limited (“Kama”), a privately 
   owned company incorporated in Ghana for a purchase consideration of US$4,5 million.
   Florinef and Omcilon business
   AGI and Aspen Brazil entered into an agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb Company for the acquisition of the rights 
   to two corticosteroids. Florinef, in certain countries (primarily Japan, the United Kingdom and Brazil) and Omcilon 
   in Brazil, for a consideration of US$41 million. Contingent consideration of US$4 million was paid to Bristol Myers 
   Squibb Company. Additional consideration of up to US$2 million is payable in the event of certain regulatory 
   approvals being obtained but it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of these occurring at this time. The 
   transaction became effective on 1 November 2014.

   AGI acquired the rights to Mono-Embolex, an injectable anticoagulant, from Novartis AG for a consideration of 
   US$142 million effective 20 February 2015.

   The initial accounting for these acquisitions, which were classified as business combinations in the prior year, 
   were reported on a provisional basis and was finalised in the June 2016 financial year.

K. ILLUSTRATIVE COMPARABLE EARNINGS
   The comparability of the reported results for the year ended 30 June 2016 to the prior reporting period has been 
   influenced by the following factors:
   * The completion on 31 August 2015 of the divestment of the generics business conducted in Australia as well as 
     certain branded products distributed in Australia to Strides group companies, the related termination of licence 
     arrangements in Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of the divestment of a portfolio of products 
     distributed in South Africa to Litha Pharma (collectively “the Divestments”). The contribution to the Aspen 
     results by the Divestments is consequently substantially reduced in the current period. In the period from 
     1 July 2015 until effective date of divestment, revenue from the Divestments was R0,2 billion whereas revenue 
     from the Divestments for the year ended 30 June 2015 was R1,8 billion.      
   * The change in translation rate to report the financial position, results of operations and cash flows relating 
     to Aspen’s Venezuelan business for the year ended 30 June 2016 from the official DIPRO rate (previously CENCOEX) 
     which ranged between 6,3 and 10,0 per USD to the DICOM rate (previously SIMADI rate) of VEF628,34 per USD.
   
   To provide meaningful comparability of the financial performance of Aspen’s ongoing underlying business, a measure 
   described as comparable normalised headline earnings, has been determined which excludes the contribution from the 
   Divestments and includes the results of Aspen’s Venezuelan business translated at the DICOM rate of VEF628,34 per 
   USD for the prior reporting period.                             
   
   Set out below is the comparable information for revenue, operating profit, normalised headline earnings and NHEPS. 
   The comparable group segmental analysis and comparable group statement of comprehensive income are included to 
   enable meaningful analytical review. The comparable information has been derived from the reviewed financial 
   information and has not been reported on by Aspen's auditors.  This information has been prepared for illustrative 
   purposes only and is the responsibility of the Board of Directors of Aspen.

   In August 2016, AGI signed an agreement with AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca UK (""AstraZeneca"") whereby AGI agreed 
   to acquire the exclusive rights to commercialise AstraZeneca’s global (excluding the USA) anaesthetics portfolio 
   (“the AZ Transaction”). AstraZeneca’s anaesthetics portfolio comprises seven established medicines, namely Diprivan 
   (general anaesthesia), EMLA (topical anaesthetic) and five local anaesthetics (Xylocaine/Xylocard/Xyloproct, Marcaine, 
   Naropin, Carbocaine and Citanest) (“the AZ Portfolio”). The products in the AZ Portfolio are sold in more than 100 
   countries worldwide including China, Japan, Australia and Brazil. These products generated revenue of US$592 million 
   in the year ended 31 December 2015. In terms of the concluded agreement, as consideration for the commercialisation 
   rights, AGI will pay US$520 million and double-digit percentage royalties on sales of the Portfolio. Additionally, 
   AGI will make sales-related payments of up to US$250 million based on sales in the 24 months following 
   completion. AGI and AstraZeneca have also signed a supply agreement whereby AstraZeneca will supply the AZ 
   Portfolio to AGI. This supply agreement has an initial period of 10 years. This transaction became effective 
   on 1 September 2016. Based on the terms of the agreements and Aspen’s current cost of funding, Aspen’s 
   interest in the AZ Portfolio would have generated a contribution to profit before tax of approximately 
   US$100 million in the year ended 31 December 2015.

   On 12 September 2016 Aspen announced that various Group subsidiaries had concluded three separate transactions 
   with GlaxoSmithkline (“GSK”) companies as follows:
   * AGI signed an agreement with GSK whereby AGI will acquire a portfolio of anaesthetic products globally (with 
     the exception of certain territories, primarily North America) (“the Anaesthetics Transaction”). GSK’s 
     anaesthetics portfolio comprises five established medicines, namely Ultiva (general anaesthesia) and four 
     muscle relaxants (Nimbex, Mivacron, Tracrium and Anectine) (“the GSK Portfolio”). The products in the GSK 
     Portfolio are sold in more than one hundred countries worldwide including Japan, Brazil, Korea, Germany and 
     Italy. In terms of the concluded agreement, as consideration for the Portfolio, AGI will pay an initial 
     amount of £180 million and milestone payments of up to £100 million based on the results of the Portfolio in 
     the 36 months following completion. AGI and GSK have also signed a supply agreement whereby GSK will supply 
     the products to AGI for four years. The GSK Portfolio is expected to generate revenue of approximately 
     £70 million in the year ended 31 December 2016. The Anaesthetics Transaction is subject to customary closing 
     conditions and is anticipated to complete during the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 financial year.
   * As part of its acquisition of the thrombolytic products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GSK in 2014, AGI also 
     acquired an option to acquire the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the rights, most 
     notably China. AGI has exercised its option to acquire Fraxiparine and Arixtra in these countries for a 
     consideration of £45 million. Approximately £30 million of revenue is generated by the thrombolytic products 
     in China. The completion of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products in the relevant territories is 
     subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 
     financial year.
   * Pharmacare Limited (“Pharmacare”) and GSK have agreed to cancel the rights of Pharmacare to collaborate in 
     the sub-Saharan business of GSK (“the SSA Collaboration”). These rights were acquired as part of a basket of 
     transactions with GSK in 2009. GSK will pay Pharmacare £45 million as consideration for the cancellation. The 
     SSA Collaboration generated approximately R2.6 billion of gross revenue in the 2016 financial year. The 
     cancellation of the SSA Collaboration is expected to become effective in the third quarter of Aspen’s 2017 
     financial year.

   If the GSK Portfolio was owned for the entire 2017 financial year, it would be expected to add approximately 
   75 cents per share to the normalised headline earnings per share (“NHEPS”) of the Group. The net impact on 
   NHEPS of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products and the cancellation of the SSA Collaboration should 
   not be material.


Basis of accounting
The reviewed provisional Group financial results have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, IFRIC interpretations, the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, South African Companies 
Act, 2008 and the presentation and disclosure requirements of IAS 34: Interim Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these provisional Group financial results are in terms of 
International Financial Reporting Standards and are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2015, apart from the change in accounting policy relating to the definition of 
normalised headline earnings.

Aspen has amended its accounting policy relating to the definition of normalised headline earnings to exclude net 
monetary adjustments and currency devaluations relating to hyperinflationary economies. The normalised headline 
earnings and normalised headline earnings per share for the year ended 30 June 2015 have been restated to 
retrospectively reflect the change in accounting policy.

The entity-wide revenue disclosure within the Group segmental analysis has been revised to reflect the Group’s 
current operating model and all comparative numbers have been restated accordingly. The updated segmental analysis 
is aligned to the way the business is managed and reported on by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The 
regional split has been expanded to reflect the “USA and Canada” and “Middle East and North Africa” as separate 
regions. Revenue has been categorised between commercial and manufacturing revenue:      
* Commercial revenue includes the commercial sale of all Aspen-owned or licensed finished products. Commercial 
  revenue has been further categorised between pharmaceutical and nutritional products and has been allocated by 
  region based upon end-customer geography.
* Manufacturing revenue includes the sale of Aspen-owned and manufactured APIs and revenue generated from the 
  manufacture of third party-owned finished dose form products.  
  Manufacturing revenue has been allocated by region based upon point of manufacturing geography.
 
The provisional Group financial results have been rounded and disclosed in R’billions to assist financial 
analysis. All percentage change variances have been calculated using unrounded numbers to record accurate 
variance trends.

These provisional Group financial results have been prepared under the supervision of the Deputy Group Chief 
Executive, M G Attridge CA(SA) and approved by the Board of Directors.

Audit review
These results have been reviewed by Aspen’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. Their unmodified review 
conclusion is available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Any reference to future financial 
performance included in this announcement, has not been reviewed or reported on by the Company’s auditors.

The comparable information has been derived from the reviewed financial information and has not been reported 
on by Aspen's auditors.  This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is the 
responsibility of the Board of Directors of Aspen.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT - ASPEN ANNOUNCES SIGNING OF AGREEMENTS WITH GSK FOR:
1. THE ACQUISITION OF A PORTFOLIO OF ANAESTHETICS;
2. THE EXERCISE OF ITS OPTION TO ACQUIRE FRAXIPARINE AND ARIXTRA IN COUNTRIES RETAINED BY
   GSK; AND
3. THE CANCELLATION OF ITS COLLABORATION WITH GSK IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Aspen Holdings is pleased to announce that Group companies have signed agreements with various
subsidiary companies of GlaxoSmithKline plc (?GSK?) relating to the following three separate transactions:

ACQUISITION OF A PORTFOLIO OF ANAESTHETIC PRODUCTS

Aspen Global Incorporated (?AGI?) has signed an agreement with GSK whereby AGI will acquire a portfolio
of anaesthetics globally (with the exception of certain territories, primarily North America) (?the Anaesthetics
Transaction?).

GSK?s anaesthetics portfolio comprises five established medicines, namely Ultiva (general anaesthesia) and
four muscle relaxants (Nimbex, Mivacron, Tracrium and Anectine) (?the Portfolio?). The products in the
Portfolio are sold in more than one hundred countries worldwide including Japan, Brazil, Korea, Germany
and Italy. Aspen expects the Portfolio to generate revenue of approximately #70 million in the year ended 31
December 2016.

The transaction

In terms of the concluded agreement, as consideration for the Portfolio, AGI will pay an initial amount of
#180 million and milestone payments of up to #100 million based on the results of the Portfolio in the 36
months following completion. AGI and GSK have also signed a supply agreement whereby GSK will continue
to supply the products to AGI in the medium term. The commercial activities will transition to AGI in the
short to medium term in accordance with an agreed plan. During the transition period GSK will continue to
provide certain services to AGI.

Funding

AGI?s upfront investment will be funded from debt facilities.
Rationale

Aspen has identified anaesthetics as a key element of its expansion strategy into niche therapeutic categories
that complement its existing operations. The recent acquisition of the global commercialisation rights to
AstraZeneca?s portfolio of anaesthetics was the first step in AGI?s move into this area and the addition of the
Portfolio will serve to further establish AGI as a major role player in anaesthetics globally.

Completion

The Anaesthetics Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is anticipated to complete
during the third quarter of Aspen?s 2017 financial year.

EXERCISE OF OPTION TO ACQUIRE FRAXIPARINE AND ARIXTRA IN COUNTRIES RETAINED BY GSK

As part of its acquisition of the thrombolytic products Fraxiparine and Arixtra from GSK in 2014, AGI also
acquired an option to acquire the same products in certain countries to which GSK retained the rights, most
notably China. AGI has exercised its option to acquire Fraxiparine and Arixtra in these countries for a
consideration of #45 million. This acquisition will be funded from existing funds.

The acquisition of the thrombolytic products in China creates synergistic opportunities with the recent
acquisition of the commercialisation rights to the AZ anaesthetics which have a material presence in that
country. The approximately #30 million Chinese revenue generated by the thrombolytic products, added to
the much higher level of sales of AZ anaesthetics in that country, provides Aspen with a sizeable footprint in
key hospital therapeutic areas in China.

The completion of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products in the relevant countries is subject to
customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the third quarter of Aspen?s 2017 financial year.

CANCELLATION OF THE COLLABORATION WITH GSK IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Aspen?s wholly owned subsidiary, Pharmacare Limited (?Pharmacare?), and GSK have agreed to cancel the
rights of Pharmacare to collaborate in the sub-Saharan business of GSK (?the SSA Collaboration?). These
rights were acquired as part of a basket of transactions with GSK in 2009. GSK will pay Pharmacare #45
million as consideration for the cancellation of the SSA Collaboration.

The cancellation of the SSA Collaboration, which generated approximately R2.1 billion of gross revenue in
Aspen?s 2015 financial year, will enable GSK to focus on its recently communicated strategic initiatives in
Africa. Aspen is retaining its existing African operations in Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda and
will also continue its exports into approximately 15 other African countries. In addition, Aspen will continue
to seek other opportunities in the region should they fit with its strategic goals.

The cancellation of the SSA Collaboration is expected to become effective in the third quarter of Aspen?s
2017 financial year.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THE THREE TRANSACTIONS

If the GSK Portfolio was owned for the entire 2017 financial year, it would be expected to add approximately
75 cents per share to the normalised headline earnings per share (?NHEPS?) of the Group. The net impact
on NHEPS of the acquisition of the thrombolytic products and the cancellation of the SSA Collaboration
should not be material.

This forecast has not been reviewed and reported on by Aspen?s auditors.

Trading Statement

Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited

(Registration number 1985/002935/06)
Share code: APN & ISIN: ZAE000066692
(""Aspen"")


Trading Statement
Aspen shareholders are hereby advised and reminded that the reported results for
the 12 month trading period to 30 June 2016 are influenced by the factors set out
below which significantly affect comparability with the results of the prior period:

   1. The completion on 31 August 2015 of the divestment of the Generics
      business conducted in Australia as well as certain branded products
      distributed in Australia to Strides group companies, the related termination of
      license arrangements in Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of
      the divestment of a portfolio of products distributed in South Africa to Litha
      Pharma (collectively “the Divestments”). The contribution to the Aspen results
      by the Divestments is consequently substantially reduced in the current
      period. In the period from 1 July 2015 until effective date of divestment,
      revenue from the Divestments was R211 million whereas revenue from the
      Divestments for the 12 months ended 30 June 2015 was R1 836 million.

   2. The economic situation in Venezuela has deteriorated over the 12 months to
      30 June 2016 and the Venezuelan authorities have increasingly limited
      authorisations to pay for pharmaceutical imports using the official DIPRO rate
      (previously the CENCOEX rate) ranging during this period from Venezuelan
      Bolivars (“VEF”) 6.30 to 10.0 per USD. As a consequence of the limited
      payment approvals and the uncertain economic and political situation in
      Venezuela, the Group concluded that it would be more appropriate to apply
      the DICOM rate of VEF 628 per USD (which replaced the SIMADI exchange
      rate of VEF 200 per USD in March 2016) to report the Venezuelan business
      financial position, results of its operations and cash flows for the 12 months
      ended 30 June 2016. This has resulted in a once-off currency devaluation
      loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R870 million.

The currency devaluation loss is excluded from normalised headline earnings per
share (“NHEPS”). In order to provide Aspen shareholders with clear comparability of
the financial performance of the ongoing underlying business, a measure described
as comparable NHEPS, has been determined by excluding the contribution from the
Divestments and includes the results of Aspen’s Venezuelan business translated at
the DICOM rate of VEF 628 per USD for the prior reporting period.

Comparable NHEPS for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016 is expected to be
between 1184.0 cents and 1237.4 cents, an increase of between 11% and 16%
over the comparative period (1066.7 cents).
Comparable NHEPS, NHEPS, headline earnings per share and earnings per share
for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016 are expected to vary from those reported in
the comparative period, ended 30 June 2015, within the following ranges:

Notes:

1. NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading
   items. NHEPS is the primary measure used by Aspen to assess its underlying
   financial performance. NHEPS excludes, inter alia, the effects arising from the
   devaluation of Aspen’s Venezuelan business.

2. NHEPS for the comparative period 30 June 2015 has been restated from the
   previously reported value of 1219.1 cents to 1145.8 cents, in terms of a change in
   accounting policy, to exclude net monetary adjustments and currency
   devaluations relating to hyperinflationary economies.

3. The decline in headline earnings per share is mainly as a result of the negative
   effect arising from the devaluation of Aspen’s Venezuelan business.

4. The decline in earnings per share is mainly as a result of the negative effect
   arising from the devaluation of Aspen’s Venezuelan business and intangible
   asset impairments reduced by the positive effect of the capital profits realised on
   the Divestments during the 12 months ended 30 June 2016.

The financial results on which this trading announcement is based have not been
reviewed or reported on by Aspen`s external auditors.

Aspen`s results for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016 are scheduled to be
published on SENS on 14 September 2016.

This general meeting has been convened to:

1. Approve, as a special resolution, certain amendments to the Company’s
   Memorandum of Incorporation (“MOI”) relating to:

   1.1   fractional share entitlements – the proposed changes are aimed at aligning
         the MOI with recent changes of the JSE Listings Requirements; and

   1.2   the timing of proxy form lodgments – the proposed changes are aimed at
         aligning the MOI with recent case law on Section 58 of the Companies Act

   a director of the Company at its meeting held in September 2015 but this
   appointment was not confirmed by shareholders at the Company’s annual general

ASPEN ANNOUNCES SIGNING OF A COMMERCIALISATION AGREEMENT WITH ASTRAZENECA IN
ANAESTHETICS

Aspen Holdings is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Aspen Global Incorporated
(“AGI”), has signed an agreement with AstraZeneca AB and AstraZeneca UK (“AstraZeneca”) whereby AGI
will acquire the exclusive rights to commercialise AstraZeneca’s global (excluding the USA) anaesthetics
portfolio (“the Transaction”).

AstraZeneca’s anaesthetics portfolio comprises seven established medicines, namely Diprivan (general
anaesthesia), EMLA (topical anaesthetic) and five local anaesthetics (Xylocaine/Xylocard/Xyloproct,
Marcaine, Naropin, Carbocaine and Citanest) (“the Portfolio”). The products in the Portfolio are sold in
more than one hundred countries worldwide including China, Japan, Australia and Brazil. These products
generated revenue of US$ 592 million in the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Transaction

In terms of the concluded agreement, as consideration for the commercialisation rights, AGI will pay
US$520 million and double-digit percentage royalties on sales of the Portfolio. Additionally AGI will make
sales related payments of up to US$250 million based on sales in the 24 months following completion. AGI
and AstraZeneca have also signed a supply agreement whereby AstraZeneca will supply the anaesthetic
products to AGI. This supply agreement has an initial period of 10 years.

The commercial activities will transition to AGI in the short to medium term in accordance with an agreed
plan. During the transition period AstraZeneca will continue to provide certain commercialisation services
to AGI.

Based on the terms of the agreements and Aspen’s current cost of funding, Aspen’s interest in the Portfolio
would have generated a contribution to profit before tax of approximately US$100 million in the year
ended 31 December 2015.

Funding

AGI’s upfront investment will be funded from new debt facilities which have been secured.

Rationale

A key element of AGI’s inorganic expansion strategy is to acquire products within therapeutic areas that are
both niche in nature and complementary to its existing operations. To this end, AGI has identified
anaesthetics as a therapeutic category that presents the opportunity to add significant value to the Aspen
Group. As a category of pharmaceuticals that primarily involves sterile manufacturing and that is dispensed
largely in hospitals and clinics, anaesthetics present an opportunity to leverage both Aspen’s existing
hospital focused sales force that is currently promoting anti-coagulants and, potentially in due course,
sterile manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, the key territories in which the Portfolio is sold represent
an excellent fit with Aspen’s existing operational geographic footprint and those markets on which its
future strategy is focussed.

By entering into the Transaction, Aspen gains immediate access not only to a global portfolio of
exceptionally strong brands but also to the scientific and strategic expertise of AstraZeneca, one of the
world’s major pharmaceutical companies and a leader in the area of anaesthetics.

Completion

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is anticipated to complete during the first
quarter of Aspen’s 2017 financial year.

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction is categorised as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements.

ASPEN CLOSES €3,000,000,000 EQUIVALENT FACILITIES ARRANGEMENTS

Aspen Holdings is pleased to announce the successful closing of arrangements in respect of funding
facilities equivalent to €3,000,000,000 (the “Facilities”) for Aspen Holdings and its wholly owned
subsidiaries Aspen Finance (Pty) Limited, Pharmacare Limited t/a Aspen Pharmacare and Aspen Asia
Pacific Pty Limited (together “Aspen”) on 8 June 2016.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited (“BofAML”), Barclays Bank PLC and Absa Bank
Limited (the “EUR Coordinating Bookrunners & Arrangers”) acted as Joint Coordinators for the EUR
facilities and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (“ZAR Coordinating Bookrunner &
Arranger”) as Coordinator for the ZAR facilities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited
acted as Documentation Agent and Facility Agent.

The Facilities were structured across EUR, ZAR and AUD term and revolving credit facilities with
tenors of 2 to 5 years. All facilities were consolidated into a single facility agreement (“the
Agreement”) with all creditors ranking pari-passu.

The initial launch size of €1.5bn for the EUR facilities was significantly oversubscribed (over 2x);
allowing Aspen to upsize the EUR facilities to €2.25bn and still offer the EUR banks considerable
scale-back.

The deal was highly successful against the wider backdrop of significant market volatility and the
challenging macroeconomic environment, and is a testament to Aspen’s strength as a corporation
as well as its strong relationships with investors. Twenty-seven lenders committed to the
transaction from across the USA, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia, comprised of core banks as well
as a number of new relationships.

Unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2015
AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (“Aspen” or ""the Group"")

COMMENTARY 
GROUP PERFORMANCE
For the six months ended 31 December 2015, the profit after tax increased by 35% to R3,3 billion. The factors set out below, 
have significantly affected the comparability with the results of the prior period:
1. The completion on 31 August 2015 of the divestment of the generics business conducted in Australia as well as
   certain branded products distributed in Australia to Strides group companies, the related termination of licence arrangements
   in Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of the divestment of a portfolio of products distributed in South
   Africa to Litha Pharma (collectively “the Divestments”). The Divestments gave rise to a pre-tax profit on disposal of
   R1,7 billion. However, as a consequence of the timing of these transactions, the contribution to the trading results by
   the Divestments is substantially reduced in the current period. In the period from 1 July 2015 until the effective date of
   divestment, revenue from the Divestments was R202 million whereas revenue from the Divestments for the six months ended
   31 December 2014 was R1 148 million. 

2. The economic situation in Venezuela deteriorated over the six months to December 2015 and the Venezuelan authorities 
   have increasingly limited authorisations to pay for pharmaceutical imports using the official CENCOEX rate during
   this period of Venezuelan Bolivar (“VEF”) 6,30 per US Dollar (“USD”). As a consequence of the limited payment approvals
   and the uncertain economic and political situation in Venezuela, the Group has concluded that it would be more
   appropriate to apply the SIMADI exchange rate of VEF200 per USD to report the Venezuelan business' financial position, results 
   of its operations and cash flows for the six months ended 31 December 2015. This has resulted in a one-off currency
   devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R841 million. 

The profit arising from the Divestments, the currency devaluation loss and the hyperinflationary adjustments relating to
Venezuela are excluded in determining normalised headline earnings per share (“NHEPS”) which increased by 14%. In order to provide
meaningful comparability of the financial performance of the ongoing underlying business, a measure described as comparable NHEPS 
has been determined by removing the contribution by the Divestments from NHEPS and including the results of Aspen’s business in
Venezuela translated at VEF200 per USD in the prior reporting period. Comparable NHEPS for the six months ended 31 December
2015 was 640,9 cents, an increase of 21%.  Applying the same principles, comparable revenue increased by 8% and comparable operating 
profit increased by 8%.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
The International Business improved revenue 2% to R9,0 billion and raised operating profit before amortisation, adjusted for 
specific non-trading items (“EBITA”), 16% to R2,8 billion. Revenue was unfavourably affected by R836 million due to the devaluation
of the Venezuelan contribution. Excluding the effect of the devaluation, revenue increased 14% in the remainder of the
international business.

Revenue from customers in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (“Europe CIS”) increased 21% to R6,1 billion. 
Finished dose from pharmaceutical sales to healthcare providers were up 20% to R4,1 billion. The acquisition of Mono-Embolex, 
an anti-coagulant with almost all of its sales in Germany, in the second half of the previous year further strengthened Aspen’s 
offering in this therapeutic area and added to growth. However, the contribution from Russia fell sharply due to the significant 
weakening of the Ruble. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) sales continued to grow and were the largest part of the balance
of the revenue from Europe CIS. 

Sales to customers in Latin America (excluding Venezuela) declined by 1% to R1,7 billion, unfavourably influenced by difficult 
socio-economic conditions in Brazil. The nutritional products in the region maintained their positive growth momentum with revenue
rising 12%. Demand for Aspen’s pharmaceutical products was strong, but performance has continued to be suppressed by unreliable 
supply of certain key products by contract manufacturers. The devalued contribution from Venezuela is no longer material to the Group. 

Sales to customers in the Rest of the World increased 4% to R922 million, led by a positive performance in the Middle
East North Africa territory. 

The installation of a new high speed pre-filled syringe filling line at Aspen Notre Dame de Bondeville (“Aspen NDB”)
was completed during the period and commercial production is about to commence. At Aspen Oss capital expenditure projects
are ongoing, focused on the sustainability of the site.

SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS
In the South African business revenue was 3% lower at R4,2 billion. Excluding the effect of the Divestments, revenue
improved by 4%. The nutritionals products were the leading performer, with revenue growing 15% to R402 million. In the
balance of the private sector, branded and generic pharmaceuticals performed satisfactorily. However, supply problems
severely undermined the performance of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) products with a consequential decline in key OTC brands.
Sales in the public sector (excluding Divestments) were down 4% on the reduced value of the antiretroviral (“ARV”)
tender award. Export revenue from finished dose products and APIs continued to expand, rising 16%. 

EBITA in South Africa was down 4% to R952 million. Excluding the Divestments, EBITA increased by 6%. 

Expansion projects continued at the Port Elizabeth finished dosage form manufacturing site and at the API
manufacturing site in Cape Town (“Fine Chemicals”). In Port Elizabeth, the building of the high containment facility is in the
qualification process. Construction of the additional specialist sterile manufacturing facility is progressing to plan. While
much of the construction at Fine Chemicals is complete, expansion and upgrade projects remain underway.

ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS
Revenue and EBITA in the Asia Pacific region were both 14% lower at R3,8 billion and R843 million respectively. The
decline was led by the Divestments. In Australasia, nutritionals continued to drive revenue growth with an increase of 7% with 
branded pharmaceuticals also advancing. Sales to customers in Asia accelerated 41%, assisted by a positive contribution from Japan. 

SUB-SAHARAN BUSINESS
Gross revenue in sub-Saharan Africa advanced 11% to R1,6 billion. However, currency weakness across the region and
unfavourable new VAT legislation in Tanzania squeezed margins, resulting in a 17% decline in EBITA to R174 million.

FUNDING
Borrowings, net of cash, increased R3,5 billion over the period to R33,5 billion. Retirement of foreign currency denominated
debt was more than offset by a R5,4 billion unfavourable currency translation effect on borrowings denominated in USD and
Australian Dollars as well as the R1,0 billion devaluation in the cash held in Venezuela. Group operating cash flows were
negatively affected by a R1,8 billion increase in working capital over the period. This increase is the consequence of an
unfavourable currency translation effect on foreign currency denominated working capital balances and planned stock builds
in South Africa and Europe CIS. Gearing improved to 44% from 49% in the previous year while net interest paid was covered 
8 times by operating profit before amortisation.

Net foreign exchange losses reduced from R343 million to R15 million while fair value gains on financial instruments
increased from R14 million to R167 million, leading to a combined benefit of R481 million over the period. 

A large portion of net debt reaches term before the end of the calendar year as is reflected by the shift in the value of 
borrowings from non-current to current classification. The Group expects to refinance its debt this year.

PROSPECTS
The period under review has been marked by economic stress in many parts of the world and weakness in most emerging
market currencies. Aspen has continued to deliver solid growth notwithstanding this environment. The Group benefits from the
pharmaceutical industry’s strong defensive qualities in such times, supported by the essential nature of medicines. Further
meaningful advances in the implementation of Aspen’s strategic objectives have been made. The completion of the Divestments
marks an important step in achieving increased focus in the South African and Asia Pacific businesses. Aspen is seeking to
grow its business in targeted therapeutic categories and remains alert to opportunities to expand its product portfolio
in these areas of focus. 

The Aspen business model delivers sustained annuity cash flows which is efficient in translating profits into cash.
For the balance of this financial year, necessary additions to inventory carrying levels will continue to weigh on cash
flows, but thereafter there is the potential to release working capital as stock builds are depleted. The Group trades in
a diversified mix of currencies which generally diminishes currency risk. The material currencies contributing to EBITA are
the Australian Dollar (30%), the Rand (27%) and the Euro and Euro-related currencies (21%). In South Africa, the public 
sector has recently implemented quarterly price adjustments to take account of exchange rate variations. This, together with
Aspen’s forward cover policy for procurement in Rand, will effectively neutralise the exposure to USD-denominated imports of 
ARV APIs, a material factor to date. Consequently the Group has little exposure to USD at the EBITA level. The South African
private market business will nonetheless be unfavourably affected by raised cost of goods as a result of the sharp decline in 
the value of the Rand in recent months.

In the 2015 final results announcement, Aspen identified a number of projects aimed at delivering synergies from
recent acquisitions, targeting an additional R2,5 billion in EBITA* from these synergies by the 2019 financial year. These
projects include lowering the cost of goods for the anti-coagulant portfolio, improving margins in the infant nutritionals
business, bringing new manufacturing capacity and technologies on-line, building the third party API business and
leveraging acquired intellectual property. Particular opportunities have been identified to build a niche business based on
supply of specialised APIs and finished dose forms to the United States. Significant progress has been made over this
past period in regard to the realisation of these synergies and Aspen is confident that this target will be achieved and
exceeded. A material value of the synergies is expected to be achieved in the next financial year*.

K. HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMY
   The Venezuelan economy is regarded as a hyperinflationary economy in terms of International Financial Reporting 
   Standards. There are three regulated exchange rates which are applicable in Venezuela:
   - Official CENCOEX rate for the importation of high priority essential goods including infant nutritionals and 
     pharmaceutical medicines. This rate is Venezuelan Bolivar (""VEF"") 10 per USD with effect from 17 February 2016. 
     The previous rate was VEF6,30 per USD;
   - SICAD rate of VEF13,50 per USD whereby exchange rates are based on conducted auctions; and
   - SIMADI rate of VEF200 per USD that permits individuals and entities to buy and sell foreign currency with fewer 
     restrictions than other exchange rate mechanisms in Venezuela.

   During the six months to 31 December 2015 the Group received approximately USD4 million from Venezuela for transactions
   that were settled at the official CENCOEX rate of VEF6.30 per USD. Aspen Venezuela, had approximately USD49 million of 
   intergroup liabilities and USD7 million of external liabilities pending approval for future settlement at the official CENCOEX 
   rate as at 31 December 2015.
   
   During the six months to 31 December 2015 the economic situation deteriorated and the Venezuelan authorities have
   increasingly limited authorisations to pay for imports using the official CENCOEX rate of VEF6,30 per USD which applied 
   during this period. Because of the continuing political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela the Group has concluded 
   that it would be more appropriate to apply the SIMADI rate of VEF200 per USD to report the Venezuelan business' financial 
   position, results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended 31 December 2015. This has resulted in a 
   currency devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R841 million. For the 12 months ended 30 June 2015, the Group 
   applied the CENCOEX rate of VEF6,30 per USD as circumstances at that time supported this rate. Aspen will continue to monitor 
   the development of payments received and the exchange rate mechanism. Should the payment rates improve or if it can no 
   longer be assumed that the SIMADI exchange rate is the relevant exchange rate for the translation this could lead to an 
   amended estimate, which in turn could trigger an amended currency translation.
   
   The net sales generated by Aspen in Venezuela using the SIMADI exchange rate amounted to R41 million for the six months
   ended 31 December 2015. For the six months ended 31 December 2014, net sales generated by Aspen in Venezuela using
   the current SIMADI exchange rate would have been R44 million compared to the actual reported sales of R880 million. For 
   the six months ended 31 December 2014 the operating loss incurred by Aspen in Venezuela would have been R0,8 million 
   compared to the actual reported loss of R16 million.
   
L. COMPARABLE EARNINGS                                                                             
   The comparability of the reported results for the six month trading period to 31 December 2015 to the prior reporting period 
   has been influenced by the following factors:                                                        
   - The completion on 31 August 2015 of the divestment of the generics business conducted in Australia as well as certain 
     branded products distributed in Australia to Strides group companies, the related termination of licence arrangements 
     in Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of the divestment of a portfolio of products distributed in South Africa 
     to Litha Pharma (collectively “the Divestments”). The contribution to the Aspen results by the Divestments is consequently 
     substantially reduced in the current period. In the period from 1 July 2015 until effective date of divestment, revenue 
     from the Divestments was R202 million whereas revenue from the Divestments for the six months ended 31 December 2014 was 
     R1 148 million.                                                         
   - The change in translation rate to report the financial position, results of operations and cash flows relating to Aspen’s 
     Venezuelan business for the six months ended 31 December 2015 from the official CENCOEX rate of the VEF 6.30 per USD to the 
     SIMADI rate of VEF200 per USD.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
   To provide meaningful comparability of the financial performance of Aspen’s ongoing underlying business, a measure described as 
   comparable normalised headline earnings has been determined which excludes the contribution from Divestments and includes the 
   results of Aspen’s Venezuelan business translated at the SIMADI rate of VEF200 per USD for the prior reporting period.

   earnings per share:

      conducted in Australia as well as certain branded products distributed in Australia
      to Strides group companies, the related termination of license arrangements in
      Australia and the completion on 1 October 2015 of the divestment of a portfolio of
      products distributed in South Africa to Litha Pharma (collectively “the
      Divestments”). The contribution to the Aspen results by the Divestments is
      consequently substantially reduced in the current period. In the period from 1
      July 2015 until effective date of divestment, revenue from the Divestments was
      R202 million whereas revenue from the Divestments for the six months ended 31
      December 2014 was R1 148 million.

   2. The economic situation in Venezuela has deteriorated over the 6 months to 31
      December 2015 and the Venezuelan authorities have increasingly limited
      authorisations to pay for pharmaceutical imports using the official CENCOEX rate
      during this period of Venezuelan Bolivars (“VEF”) 6.30 per USD. As a
      consequence of the limited payment approvals and the uncertain economic and
      political situation in Venezuela, Aspen has concluded that it would be more
      appropriate to apply the SIMADI exchange rate of VEF 200 per USD to report the
      Venezuelan business financial position, results of its operations and cash flows
      for the 6 months ended 31 December 2015. This has resulted in a once-off
      currency devaluation loss on foreign denominated liabilities of R841 million.

The currency devaluation loss is excluded from normalised headline earnings per share
(“NHEPS”). In order to provide Aspen shareholders with clear comparability of the
financial performance of the ongoing underlying business, a measure described as
comparable NHEPS has been determined by excluding the contribution from the
Divestments.

Comparable NHEPS for the 6 months ended 31 December 2015 is expected to be
between 623.6 cents and 650.1 cents, an increase of between 18% and 23% over
the comparative period (528.5 cents).
NHEPS, headline earnings per share and earnings per share for the 6 months ended 31
December 2015 are expected to vary from those reported in the comparative period,
ended 31 December 2014, within the following ranges:

                                                                  the comparative
                                                                         period -
                                                                 31 December 2014

 NHEPS                    11% to 16%         635.7 to 664.3                572.7        1,2

 Headline earnings       -26% to -21%        400.9 to 428.0                541.7         3
 per share

 Earnings per share       32% to 37%         711.6 to 738.6                539.1         4


Notes:

1. NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading
   items. NHEPS is the primary measure used by Aspen to assess its underlying
   financial performance. NHEPS excludes, inter alia, the effects arising from the
   devaluation of Aspen’s Venezuelan business.

2. NHEPS for the comparative period 31 December 2014 has been restated from the
   previously reported value of 569.1 cents to 572.7 cents, in terms of a change in
   accounting policy, to exclude net monetary adjustments and currency devaluations
   relating to hyperinflationary economies.

3. The decline in headline earnings per share is due to the once-off effect arising from
   the devaluation of Aspen’s Venezuelan business.

4. The growth in earnings per share is higher than the growth in NHEPS and the
   negative growth in headline earnings per share due to the effect of significant capital
   profits realised on the Divestments during the 6 months ended 31 December 2015.

The financial results on which this trading announcement is based have not been
reviewed or reported on by Aspen`s external auditors.

Aspen`s interim results for the 6 months ended 31 December 2015 are scheduled to be
published on SENS on 3 March 2016.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT - ASPEN ACQUIRES THE RIGHTS TO HYDROXYPROGESTERONE
CAPROATE INJECTION (HPC)

Aspen is pleased to announce that Aspen Global Incorporated (“AGI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Aspen Holdings, has entered into an agreement with US-based McGuff Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(“McGuff”), a wholly owned subsidiary of McGuff Company, Inc., to acquire the intellectual
property and recently approved Abbreviated New Drug Application in the United States in respect
of the finished dose form of Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (“HPC”), a product indicated for the
treatment of certain female cancers and hormonal imbalances. McGuff will also manufacture and
supply the HPC injection product to AGI. It is expected that the product will be launched in the
United States during 2016.

The transaction will provide a unique vertical integration opportunity as Aspen currently
manufactures the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for HPC. The acquisition is in line with
Aspen’s stated intent to develop commercial opportunities in the United States which are aligned to
the intellectual property available within the Group.
