Introduction   
This financial year has been unprecedented. Never has the world, our country, Group and our 
people been tested to such an extent. But the true Bidvest spirit shone through. Numerous 
cost containment, liquidity preservation and strategic steps were implemented in rapid 
response to considerable demand changes. Various wellness and support interventions were 
rolled out to assist our employees and communities as their livelihoods were severely 
impacted. At the same time, innovation within our businesses ramped up to continue to add 
value to our customers. The Bidvest family is proud of what has been achieved, providing a 
solid platform to ensure that we are capable of #EmergingStronger. 

The Group implemented various measures to lessen the impact of COVID-19 infections on its 
employees, communities and operations. Prevention and treatment interventions were 
rolled-out across the Group to manage health, safety and recovery during this time. Our 
sincerest condolences go to the families, friends and colleagues of the 35 Bidvest employees 
that sadly succumbed to the COVID-19 virus. 

Highlights 
The Group delivered a credible financial performance during the financial year which ended 
on 30 June 2020, considering the already significantly constrained South African economy 
pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic's impact on the last quarter. Post the complete national 
lockdown in April, monthly trading results have progressively improved. 

At the onset of the lockdown, Bidvest proactively bolstered its liquidity position by securing 
R4.5 billion additional general credit facilities with South African banks, taking committed 
general banking facilities to a total of R11.6 billion. An intensified focus on cash generation 
and working capital management, together with rapid and decisive cost containment 
measures, resulted in R2.5 billion more cash generated from operations to total R9.2 billion. 
As a consequence, the Group had no need to access the additional credit facilities secured, a 
truly remarkable result and testament to Bidvest's long-standing cash generation focus. 

The acquisition of PHS Group (PHS), a leading hygiene service provider in the United Kingdom 
(UK), Ireland and Spain, for GBP495 million was concluded and funded with a GBP-denominated 
bridge facility. Despite adding this significant amount of debt on the balance 
sheet, the net debt/ EBITDA remained well within the Group's gearing tolerance.

Exceptional cost discipline and improved gross profit margin were highlights in a very 
challenging year. Trading profit declined 19.9% after taking account of R1.6 billion in 
COVID-19 related charges. Almost two-thirds of profit originated from the services businesses, 
comprising the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, and provided a defensive 
underpin. 

Bidvest family 
An imperative during this crisis is to protect and provide for the safety, health and well-being 
of employees who are, collectively, the backbone of our businesses. 

Bidvest established a R400 million Bidvest COVID-19 Fund (""Fund""), to assist our South African 
employees not working due to the lockdown restrictions. The 30% salary and fee sacrifice by 
the executive management team and board members respectively, during the last quarter, 
was added to the Fund. Various other employee and family support initiatives, such as a 
Groupwide comprehensive employee wellness support programme, COVID-19 testing and 
bursary extensions for children of those retrenched were rolled out. 

Applications to the UIF on behalf of our employees for the COVID-19 TERS benefit were made 
and are ongoing. Furlough support programmes by the governments of the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland are comprehensive in supporting the livelihoods of our employees in these 
countries. 

During the most stringent lockdown periods, approximately 75,000 of our employees were 
not working. Today, 91% of our employees are back at work.

Bidvest is also contributing to the social needs of the broader stakeholder community in the 
country, including a donation to the Solidarity Fund, a donation of PPE, cleaning and hygiene 
products and decontamination services to 2 800 schools as part of a nationwide school 
readiness project. 

In addition, we sponsored the launch of the Woza Matric of 2020 campaign, a free-to-air 
television initiative aimed at grade 12 learners, in partnership with the SABC and 
Department of Education. We are also in the process of distributing food hampers in low-
income communities across three provinces, to reach a total of 20 000 households once the 
project is completed.

*  Normalised headline earnings, which excludes acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts,
   fair value uplift of Adcock's inventory, includes an adjustment for Bidvest's share of Comair's SAA impairment 
   and COIVD-19 pandemic charges, is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business performance 
   of the continuing operations. 
** Normalised HEPS is normalised headline earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. 
 
Revenue from continuing operations was R76.5 billion (2019: R76.1 billion). On a comparable 
basis, the impact of the national lockdown on trading was broadly neutralised by the maiden 
consolidation of Adcock Ingram (""Adcock"") and two months of PHS.  

Gross profit margin improved from 29.6% to 30.6%. Operating expenses increased by 9.6%. 
Cost containment received extra attention, particularly at the onset of the pandemic. 
Excluding the impact of material acquisitions, IFRS 16 and COVID-19 related expenses, as a 
direct result of actions taken, expenses declined by 6.3%.

Services delivered a good overall result, with an excellent performance from Noonan while 
the SA profitability was negatively impacted by no travel- and hospitality-related activity in 
the last quarter. Freight delivered a resilient result on lower trade activity through South 
Africa's ports. Branded Products' result was a combination of a solid Adcock performance 
while the balance of the division bore the brunt of lower demand and trade restrictions during 
lockdown. The results from Commercial Products and Automotive mirrored the latter. In 
Financial Services the negative impact of a complete drop-off of foreign exchange demand in 
the last quarter and fleet contracts rolling off, more than outweighed higher investment 
income. 

Acquisition costs of R178.2 million relate mainly to the acquisition of PHS and other corporate 
actions. 

Net capital items of R2.0 billion were recognised, R1.1 billion of which is attributed directly to 
COVID-19. Property, plant and equipment as well as goodwill and intangible assets of certain 
Brandcorp businesses and automotive dealerships in SA and Namibia, amongst others, were 
impaired by R1.0 billion as a result of lower forecast cash flows impacted by COVID-19, the 
expected slowdown in economic activity as well as higher discount rates. The losses 
recognised on the closure and disposal of Glenryck, Mansfield Group, Bidvest Wits and others 
totalled R247.2 million. Net negative adjustments of R485.7 million were made to the 
investment values of Adcock and Comair prior to the former becoming a subsidiary and the 
latter being put into business rescue. The balance of the charge relates to the insurance 
receipts on damaged Freight equipment. 

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, net finance charges were 7.4% higher at R993.3 million 
(2019: R924.6 million). Additional borrowings were raised to fund acquisitions. Despite the higher 
commitment fees and spreads over base rates, the decrease in interest rates and addition of 
cheaper offshore funding, lowered the Group's average cost of debt to 5.7% pre-tax (2019: 6.7%). 

Share of losses from associates resulted from the operating losses incurred by Comair prior 
to going into business rescue as well as the impairment of the full outstanding SAA settlement. 
Adcock was accounted for as an associate for only one month compared to a full year 
previously. 

The Group's taxation expense decreased by 40.5% to R851.6 million (2019: R1.4 billion). The 
effective tax rate of 65.7% (2019: 27.1%) was impacted by non-tax deductible associate, 
goodwill and Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) impairments, losses on disposal of 
businesses, no deferred tax assets raised on closed operations Bidair Services, Commuter 
Handling Services and Voltex Namibia and other items. 

Normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) from continuing operations, a metric utilised 
by management to assess the underlying business performance excluding acquisition costs 
and amortisation of acquired customer contracts, fair value uplift of Adcock's inventory, 
Bidvest's share of Comair's full impairment of the outstanding SAA settlement as well as 
COVID-19 expenses, declined by 22.9%. 

Bidvest's HEPS from continuing operations decreased by 59.5% to 553.2 cents per share. Basic 
earnings per share from continuing operations decreased from 1 133.8 cents to 49.8 cents 
mainly due to impairments, business closures and disposals together with the contraction in 
the share prices of associates. 

Bidvest net debt increased from R7.8 billion to R19.2 billion, largely due to the acquisition of 
PHS for GBP495 million, effective 1 May 2020. Strong free cash flow generation resulted in 
Bidvest remaining within bank covenants of 3.0x net debt / EBITDA and greater than 3.5x 
interest cover, despite the disproportionate amount of debt versus EBITDA added and the 
lost trading in the fourth quarter. Net debt / EBITDA was 2.1x (2019: 0.9x). 

The PHS acquisition is funded with a GBP-denominated bridge facility, repayable in December 
2021. Following the downgrade of South Africa to junk status, and the resultant impact on 
the Bidvest credit rating, as well as the deterioration in the country's macroeconomic 
position, indicative credit spreads have widened considerably. This makes the initial decision 
to replace the bridge facility with a foreign-denominated bond less viable. The geographic mix 
of debt is also misaligned relative to trading profit. Management therefore embarked on a 
process to review the capital structure and evaluate all alternatives. As a consequence, the 
following steps have been taken to date to part-settle the bridge funding: R4.0 billion debt is 
in the process of being raised from local banks and offshore cash of R2.5 billion has been 
earmarked. Expected proceeds from the MIAL disposal and normal free cash generation in 
the business, will go a long way in settling the bridge funding. Further steps are being 
contemplated. 

Total assets increased by 46.6% to R90.9 billion as Adcock and PHS was consolidated and 
right-of-use assets recognised under IFRS 16. The acquisition of PHS brought about R11.7 
billion of goodwill which represent long-standing customer contracts and a leading brand, 
from which Bidvest expects to derive significant future value. NAV is R68.16 per share 
(2019: R75.71). 
 
Cash generated by operations at R9.2 billion, was 38.2% higher than the R6.6 billion generated 
in the prior year. This is boosted by the adoption of IFRS 16 (positive R1.5 billion impact). The 
Group released R0.9 billion of working capital in the current year compared to an absorption 
of R1.3 billion in the prior year. The main impact, year-on-year, was from lower trade 
receivables on the back of lower activity levels. Free cash flow after leases increased by 
R1.4 billion to R3.7 billion. 

Normalised return on funds employed (ROFE), which excludes COVID-19 charges, declined 
marginally from 23.2% to 23.0% as asset management remains a core focus, particularly in 
these challenging times. ROIC was 12.9% (2019: 18.4%) which is still in excess of the 
Group's weighted cost of capital. 

Corporate action 
The acquisition of PHS became effective on 1 May 2020. PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 
and today service more than 120,000 customers. More than half its customers have 
long-standing relationship with PHS. Advance billings and high retention rates result in 
significant revenue visibility and attractive operational cash conversion. During the due 
diligence, management identified five areas of synergy and cost saving to achieve an improved 
margin, which is more in line with industry peers. Work has started to bring this into effect. 

The hygiene market is increasingly resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers 
such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging 
population, to name a few. The global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly 
heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene. This is expected to 
accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally. 

As previously reported, the R3.2 billion Eqstra transaction was terminated. Three bolt-on 
acquisitions were concluded in Services, the most notable being Future Cleaning which 
augmented the footprint of Noonan's UK operations. 

Following a detailed strategic review of all Bidvest businesses, a decision was taken to divest 
of Bidvest Car Rental and Bidair Services. Formal disposal processes were kicked off and have 
progressed since year-end. Our preference is to sell the businesses in order to preserve as 
many jobs as possible. Bidvest Car Rental was disclosed as a discontinued operation.

The disposal of our stake in MIAL has been extremely frustrating and embroiled in litigation. 
A reduced offer was accepted given the deteriorated financial position of the airport as a 
result of the pandemic. Parties have agreed to cooperate in order to expedite the execution 
of the transaction.  

Dividend 
In light of the extraordinary levels of uncertainty as it relates to the economies and 
environments in which we operate and the restructuring actions taken, the board believes 
that the decision to not declared a final dividend balances the interests of all stakeholders. 
This leaves the total dividend for the year at 282 cents per share, 53% lower year on year. 

Prospects 
Bidvest recognises that the pandemic will result in socio-economic shifts and consequently 
long-term structural changes to the economy and business in general. In the recent weeks, 
Bidvest right-sized operations to make sure that our operating models remain relevant and 
future-fit, reinforce competitive positions, and ensure that the businesses have sufficient 
scale for growth. This unfortunately led to retrenchments across all six divisions. 

Industries that are under incremental pressure include travel and tourism related activities, 
while out-of-home hygiene offers good structural growth opportunities. Affected Bidvest 
businesses have taken account of this in their planning. 

Overall, we expect the uncertain and fragile operating environment to persist. Bidvest's 
basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges should stand it in good stead, 
especially when coupled with an innovative, value-adding mindset. In recent weeks, we have noted 
anecdotal market share gains across many of our Commercial Products businesses as we have 
stock available to trade. Our flagship liquid petroleum gas (LPG) storage project is expected 
to be commissioned during September 2020. The acquisition of PHS leapfrogged our hygiene 
exposure and this will be leveraged going forward. 

South Africa's need for real GDP growth to create employment and prosperity for all, is 
undeniable. Bidvest is actively participating in workstreams incorporating labour, government 
and private sector to achieve this.

Bidvest will continue to invest strategically to generate sustainable profits for the long term. 
The Group remains alert to opportunities both locally and internationally to further its 
strategy to expand into niche areas but will remain steadfast in our capital allocation 
disciplines. 

Bidvest is well positioned to participate in pockets of activity and opportunities. Disciplined 
asset management, cost control and an agile business approach should yield good results. We 
remain confident in our overall resilience and ability to deliver consistent, sustainable growth 
over the long-term.

THE BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED
(“Bidvest” or “The Group”)
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)
(Registration number 1946/021180/06)
JSE Share code: BVT
ISIN: ZAE000117321

TRADING STATEMENT

The Group delivered a credible trading profit performance during the financial year which ended on
30 June 2020, considering the already significantly constrained South African economy pre-COVID-19 and the
pandemic’s impact on the last quarter. Post the complete national lockdown in April, monthly trading results
have progressively improved.

At the onset of the national lockdown, Bidvest proactively bolstered its liquidity position by securing
R4.5 billion additional general banking facilities with South African banks, taking committed facilities to a total
of R11.6 billion. An intensified focus on cash generation and working capital management, together with rapid
and decisive cost containment measures, resulted in strong operational cash flow. As a consequence, the
Group had no need to access the additional credit facilities secured.

As indicated previously, the acquisition of PHS utilised a meaningful portion of the financial headroom that
existed on the Group’s balance sheet. Strong free cash flow generation resulted in Bidvest remaining within
bank covenants of 3.0x net debt / EBITDA and greater than 3.5x interest cover, despite the disproportionate
amount of debt versus EBITDA added and the lost trading in the fourth quarter.
Updated guidance

In accordance with Section 3.4(b) (i) of the JSE Listings Requirements, listed companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.
Since the trading update issued on 1 June 2020, Bidvest took the decisions to divest of Bidvest Car Rental and
Bidair Services. The former will be disclosed as a discontinued operation. Impairments totalling R1.0 billion were
also recognised as a result of lower forecast cash flows impacted by COVID-19, the expected slowdown in
economic activity as well as higher discount rates.
The Group incurred R1.6 billion of COVID-19 charges including higher trade receivables and inventory provisions
made, additional costs incurred to comply with health and safety protocols, the R400 million Bidvest COVID-19
Fund, a reduced offer accepted for our stake in the Mumbai International Airport Limited and once-off
restructuring charges resulting from a strategic business review. The Group reviewed all Bidvest businesses and
right-sized operations to make sure that the operating models remain relevant and future-fit.
As in the past, the Group will present normalised headline earnings. The impact of COVID-19 will be excluded
in addition to the acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts and adjustment for Bidvest’s
share of Comair’s SAA impairment. This is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business
performance of the continuing operations.

Shareholders are advised that:
-   Normalised headline earnings per share (HEPS) is expected to be 22% to 24% lower compared to the prior
    year (FY19: 1 334 cents), translating into normalised HEPS of between 1 014 cents and 1 040 cents.
-   HEPS from continuing operations, which includes Comair’s operating loss and the impairment of its SAA
    settlement claim totalling R201 million, a fair value adjustment to Adcock Ingram’s inventory in terms of
    IFRS 3 as well as the COVID-19 charges, is expected to be between 59% and 61% lower than the prior year
    (FY19: 1 366 cents), translating into a range of between 533 cents and 560 cents.
-   Group HEPS is expected to be between 70% and 72% lower compared to the prior year (FY19: 1 352 cents),
    translating into a range of between 379 cents and 406 cents. The operational losses recognised for the
    discontinued Bidvest Car Rental negatively impacted Group HEPS.
-   Basic earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations is expected to be between 95% and 97% lower
    than the 1 134 cents reported in FY19, translating into a range of 34 cents and 57 cents EPS. This is the result
    of the items described under HEPS as well as the R218 million negative Adcock Ingram remeasurement
    impact, the R241 million capital impairment recognised for Comair and R1.2 billion in capital impairments
    and business disposals.
-   Group EPS is expected to be more than a 100% lower, translating into an EPS loss of between 130 cents and
    150 cents, when compared to the previous year profit of 1 119 cents. The operational losses and
    impairments recognised for the discontinued Bidvest Car Rental negatively impacted Group EPS.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the Group’s auditors. The Group expects its results to 30 June 2020 to be released on SENS on
14 September 2020.

BIDVEST TRADING UPDATE FOR THE TEN MONTHS TO 30 APRIL 2020 AND TRADING STATEMENT

Bidvest shareholders were informed at the time of the release of the Group’s interim results (2 March 2020),
that trading conditions were challenging due to low business confidence in South Africa, constrained consumer
demand and an overall weak economic environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the economic and social environment becoming more demanding and
uncertain, and has created significant operational disruptions, both on the demand and supply side of our
economy. The impact on Bidvest’s trading businesses is significant and the services businesses are also being
disrupted.

In response to the crisis, South Africa was placed under a complete national lockdown between 27 March 2020
and 30 April 2020 (“Lockdown”) to adequately prepare medical and healthcare facilities, and reduce the
spread of the virus. The Lockdown was subsequently extended as part of a risk adjusted, phased approach for
a responsible return to economic activity. We support government’s focus on reducing the spread of the
pandemic and flattening the curve, however the impact of the Lockdown has resulted in the closure of many
South African businesses and placed many others in distressed situations.
Partial lockdown arrangements in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland also resulted in reduced
activity.

Considering the South African economy was already significantly constrained pre-COVID-19, and remembering
that the pandemic impacted mainly the April month, the Group delivered a credible trading profit performance
for the ten months, albeit at a much slower growth pace compared to the interim result. The Group’s financial
position remains solid, which provides a level of comfort in these challenging and uncertain times.

Trading result

Two distinct periods have emerged over this ten-month period:

1) Nine months to 31 March 2020

Pre-Lockdown (to end March), activity in South Africa slowed further from the levels reported on for the first
six months of the year.

Within the services related activities, which include the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, the
offshore operations delivered a strong result, augmented by the maiden contribution from recently acquired,
Future Cleaning. The annuity income and take-or-pay businesses reported trading profit growth in line with
recent history. In the lead up to the Lockdown, demand for hygiene products and services was very high.
Lower cargo volumes, together with no maize shipments, negatively impacted on the rest of the Freight
businesses. For some time, and especially since the start of the calendar year, demand has been very weak in
hospitality, travel and aviation related services, adversely impacting the relevant businesses in both Services,
Financial Services and Automotive. Bidvest Bank’s solid advances and deposits growth continued, but the
insurance businesses remained under pressure. The investment income gains made earlier in the financial year
reversed into losses due to the poor performance of the equity markets.

The majority of the trading and distribution activities, which include the Commercial Products, Branded
Products and Automotive divisions, continued to face very tough trading conditions. In Commercial Products,
the Trade as well as the Warehousing clusters traded reasonably well. The DIY/Tool/Workwear cluster
reported a particularly strong March month as demand for personal protective equipment increased.
Restructuring efforts at Renttech are yielding benefits. Branded Products continued to benefit from the
consolidation of Adcock Ingram (“Adcock”). In the lead up to the Lockdown, there was high demand for Adcock
OTC, Consumer and Critical Care products. Excluding Adcock, trading profit contracted further. Most
businesses held their own except for those exposed to consumer retail where profits were materially
impacted. The weak demand for new vehicles is well known, based on published monthly NAAMSA statistics.
To date, cost control and rightsizing measures more than offset top-line pressures, albeit to a diminishing
degree.

2) Month of April 2020

During the Lockdown, activity was very limited with a particularly devastating impact on Bidvest’s trading and
distribution activities. During April, only half the revenue was generated compared to this time last year, and
the Group broke-even in terms of profitability. Four of the six trading divisions generated a profit for the
month, albeit at much reduced levels.

Demand was limited, even for those Bidvest businesses registered as essential services during the Lockdown.
Revenue from the annuity income contracts were mixed while all the take-or-pay contracts were honoured.
General cargo, hospitality, travel and aviation related volumes and demand were virtually non-existent. Full
maintenance lease revenue and insurance premiums were earned, while net interest income reduced in line
with the interest rate cuts. The trading and distribution businesses were closed with limited trading in only G
Fox, Electrical and Plumblink. Adcock held its own.

The Bidvest teams delivered essential services to the Group’s normal high standard, putting measures in place
to make sure businesses can withstand a prolonged period of disruption and, at the same time, being prepared
to restart at short notice. Albeit, that the trading environment remains extremely fluid and uncertain.

People

An important imperative during this crisis is to protect and provide for the safety, health and well-being of
employees who are, collectively, the enablers of our businesses. During the Lockdown period, we initiated a
work-from-home policy wherever possible and relevant.
Bidvest established a R400 million, Bidvest COVID-19 Fund (“Fund”), to assist our South African employees that
have not been working during the Lockdown. Bidvest is also contributing in other ways to the broader
humanitarian efforts in the country, including the Solidarity Fund. Additionally, the 30% salary and fee sacrifice
by the executive management team and board members, respectively, for the quarter, will be added to the
Fund.

Applications to the UIF on behalf of our employees for the COVID-19 TERS benefit have been made and are
ongoing. We commend the UIF for facilitating, processing and paying out claims in such a short period of time.
Furlough support by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are comprehensive in
supporting the livelihoods of our employees.

Liquidity, solvency and gearing

Bidvest has proactively enhanced its liquidity position by securing R4.5 billion additional general credit facilities
with South African banks. The Group’s committed general banking facilities now total R11.0 billion. Initiatives
are ongoing to evaluate options to strengthen and optimise the capital structure further for the medium term.
The upcoming debt maturity of R0.5 billion in June 2020 has been factored into cash flow projections.
The PHS transaction closed on 28 April 2020. Bidvest paid the GBP495 million purchase price from the 24-
month bridge funding secured in the same currency. The MIAL disposal process is delayed due to the Indian
courts being closed.

The construction of the R1 billion LPG terminal in Richards Bay recommenced post the Lockdown. At this stage,
the terminal is expected to be operational in September 2020. The outstanding capital commitment, as at 30
April 2020,was R115 million. All other capital expenditure, apart from stay-in-business and contractual capex,
is under review.

Bidvest’s focus on cash flow and working capital management is receiving even greater attention in the current
environment. We strive to balance the challenging short-term commercial realities with our shared
responsibility to the South African economy, and all stakeholders. We are ensuring that the Group remains
financially viable, while maintaining relationships with our customers and suppliers as we navigate these
uncertain times. We will continue to work towards pragmatic solutions that will deliver the best possible
outcome for all.

Traditionally Bidvest generates stronger cash from operations in the second half of the financial year. This has
not been the case to date, due to both a reduction in trading and lower trade receivable receipts.
Despite the higher commitment fees and spreads over the base rates, the decrease in interest rates lowered
Bidvest’s average cost of debt by 10bps from the pre-tax 6.5% reported at interim end.

Bidvest’s debt covenants remain unchanged at 3.0x net debt / 12-month rolling EBITDA, pre IFRS16, and
greater than 3.5x interest cover. As indicated previously, the acquisition of PHS will utilise a meaningful portion
of the financial headroom that exists on the Group’s balance sheet. Currency volatility could exacerbate the
situation further. Management expects the Group to be within bank covenants.
As at 30 April 2020, the Group’s net debt was R12.5 billion, compared to R10.0 billion as at 31 December 2019.
This excludes IFRS16 lease liabilities.

PHS

Following the transaction close, PHS will be consolidated from 1 May 2020. The performance for the financial
year, which ended 31 March 2020, was in line with expectations at the time of negotiating the transaction.
PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 and today serves more than 120,000 customers. More than half of its
customers have had an association in excess of ten years with PHS, while the average contract term is three- to
five-years. Advance billings and high retention rates result in significant revenue visibility and attractive
operational cash conversion.
During the due diligence, management identified five areas of synergy and cost saving to achieve an improved
margin, which is more in line with industry peers.
The hygiene market is increasingly resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers such as urbanisation,
hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging population, to name a few. The global outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene.
This is expected to accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally.

Eqstra

The initial Eqstra transaction long-stop date of 31 March 2020 was extended, in terms of the Sale and Purchase
Agreement, to 4 May 2020. The only outstanding condition precedent was approval from the South African
Reserve Bank. This was not obtained by close of business on 4 May 2020 and the R3.2 billion transaction
terminated.

Comair

On 5 May 2020, Comair was placed into business rescue and as a consequence, the share was suspended on
the JSE. The business rescuer will be formulating a proposed plan that will hopefully result in the long-term
viability of this airline. In light of this, Bidvest believed it prudent to fully impair its investment in Comair. As a
consequence, Bidvest will also no longer equity account Comair.

During FY2020, Bidvest will therefore recognise a capital impairment of R232.2 million (gross) and its share of
Comair operating losses of R209.7 million. This compares to a mark-to-market loss of R332.0 million and share
of associate profit of R257.3 million in the prior year. The net impact year-on-year is a significant negative
swing of R373.7 million on attributable earnings and R467.0 million in headline earnings (9.9% and 10.2% of
FY2019 attributable earnings and headline earnings, respectively).

The way forward

Bidvest recognises that the pandemic will result in long term socio-economic shifts and consequently long-
term structural changes to the economy and business in general. The Group will strategically review all Bidvest
businesses and right-size operations to make sure that our operating models remain relevant and appropriate
for the level of demand. This may lead to retrenchments across all six divisions in order to reinforce their
competitive positions in the future, and ensure that the businesses have the potential of sufficient scale.
Industries that are under incremental pressure include travel, and related activities, while out-of-home
hygiene offer good structural growth opportunities.

In the near-term, management is focused on restarting operations, in a phased, flexible and cost-efficient
manner, and within the parameters set by government. Specifically, we are fully aligned to all safety, health
and hygiene protocols for all stakeholders that are impacted by our businesses.

The expected impact of a peak in COVID-19 infections on our employees, and our ability to deliver products
and services to our customers, is being carefully considered.
The operating environment remains very uncertain for the balance of financial year and forecasting is
impractical. The decision to declare a final dividend will only be taken by the board at the time of finalising the
year end results.

Trading statement

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, Bidvest’s financial results for the financial year to 30 June
2020 have been and will continue to be impacted by COVID-19, weak macro conditions and business
rightsizing, Comair entering business rescue, the decline in the Adcock share price between 30 June 2019 and
31 July 2019 as well as the adverse impact of the adoption of IFRS16.
Shareholders are advised that headline earnings per share and earnings per share for the financial year to 30
June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower compared to the previous year.

A further trading statement will be issued to provide specific guidance once there is reasonable certainty of
this information.

NOTICE IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) OF THE COMPANIES ACT OF 2008 AS AMENDED

Shareholders are advised that at the annual general meeting of Bidvest held on 28 November 2019,
shareholders approved and passed a special resolution in terms of Section 45 of the Companies act of
2008, as amended (“the Act”) authorising the Company to provide financial assistance to among
others, related or inter-related companies or corporations of the Company.

Section 45(5) of the Act requires a company to provide written notice to shareholders of the adoption
of a board resolution to provide financial assistance, if the value and/or obligations of the financial
assistance so contemplated together with any previous such resolutions during the financial year,
exceeds one-tenth of 1% of the company’s net worth at the time of the resolution.

In order to give effect to the treasury requirements of the Bidvest Group from time to time, guarantees
and suretyships are issued to third parties for finance and other facilities granted by those third parties
to Group subsidiary companies.

Accordingly, the Bidvest board has adopted a resolution authorising the Company to provide direct or
indirect financial assistance pursuant to the Suretyship signed with Investec Limited for the provision
of general banking facilities to certain group subsidiary companies to the maximum value of
R1 300 000 000. The Surety given replaces and supersedes previous Sureties given.

The board has confirmed that, after considering the reasonable foreseeable financial circumstances
of the Company, it is satisfied that, immediately after providing such financial assistance, the Company
would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test, as contemplated in terms of Section 4 of the Act and that
the terms under which such financial assistance was given were fair and reasonable to the Company.

ACQUISITION OF PHS CONFIRMED

Further to the SENS announcement published on 24 December 2019, shareholders are advised that the
remaining conditions precedent relating to the acquisition of 100% of the PHS Group (“the transaction”;
“PHS”), the leading hygiene services provider in the United Kingdom, The Republic of Ireland and Spain, have
been fulfilled.

The transaction has accordingly become unconditional. Settlement of the GBP495 million acquisition
consideration will take place within nine business days. Bidvest will fully fund the transaction through
committed third-party external GBP-denominated debt.
The acquisition of PHS is in line with Bidvest’s stated strategic intent to expand its presence beyond South
Africa in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from the Group’s capabilities and expertise. The PHS
service offering and geographic presence are complementary to Bidvest’s Services division. The hygiene
market is resilient and is supported by structural growth drivers such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety
standards as well as a growing and aging population, to name a few. The global outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic has undoubtedly heightened the awareness of and need for out-of-home hygiene. This is expected
to accelerate the development and maturity of the industry globally.

“Bidvest’s foray into hygiene services dates back to 1991 when it acquired Steiner. Since then, Bidvest Steiner
quadrupled its reach organically to become the no 1 hygiene service provider in South Africa, competing
against global players. The acquisition of PHS marks another important step in Bidvest’s internationalisation,
even more so during this time of heightened hygiene awareness,” commented Lindsay Ralphs, Bidvest chief
executive.

 -  Trading profits margin improved 81bps to 9.2% 
 -  Strong balance sheet maintained with 1.1x net debt / EBITDA  
 -  ROFE up to 24.8%

 -  Normalised HEPS of 610.9 cents 
 -  Unchanged interim dividend of 282 cents per share 
 
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
 
Trading profit increased by 19.8% to R4.0 billion, off 9.2% revenue growth to R43.7 billion, enhanced by the consolidation of Adcock. 

During the six months to December 2019, Bidvest's domestic operations held their own in a tough trading environment characterised by 
low business confidence and constrained consumer demand culminating in lower volumes. Offshore service businesses performed well. 
Our services businesses, comprising the Services, Freight and Financial Services divisions, grew trading profit by 6.5%. 

Exceptional cost management and good capital discipline resulted in improved margins. Post working capital, cash generated 
from operations increased almost three-fold to R3.8 billion. 

The impact of accounting for Adcock as an associate for one month and consolidating it from 1 August 2019, was neutral on headline earnings. 

The balance sheet remains strong. Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) improved from 22.8% to 24.8%. ROIC of 16.3% is well above 
the Group's weighted cost of capital. 

Acquisitions and investment in our businesses continued. The Bidvest balance sheet remains healthy. Net asset value grew by 
3.4% to R77.10 per share. 

In December, we announced the acquisition of PHS, the largest hygiene services provider in the UK and Spain, for GBP495 million. 
This is in line with Bidvest's strategic intend to expand internationally in niche, asset light annuity income businesses that will 
benefit from Bidvest's capabilities and expertise. 

Normalised HEPS is a measurement used by management to assess the underlying business performance. The Group delivered a 
slightly improved result, as reflected in pro forma normalised HEPS(1) of 636.5 cents. The non-cash impact of IFRS 16 (4.1%) and 
Bidvest's share of Comair's impairment of the SAA settlement (5.8%) represents the differential to the reported 10.5% decline in 
HEPS (563.2 cents). Basic EPS declined 27.7% to 476.9 cents due to the contraction in the share prices of associates compared to 
material share price increases in the prior period. 

The Group declared an interim dividend of 282 cents per share, in line with the prior period. 

(1)  Normalised HEPS, which excludes acquisition costs, amortisation of acquired customer contracts and includes an adjustment 
     for Bidvest's share of Comair's SAA impairment, is a measurement management uses to assess the underlying business performance. 
 
PROSPECTS  
 
The core competencies and drivers of the Bidvest business remain firmly intact. The diverse portfolio of businesses and extensive 
reach allow the Group to weather challenging times. Our basic-need services and everyday essential product ranges enable the 
Group to support and add value to all its stakeholders. Innovation to disrupt ourselves, and the industries in which we operate, 
remains a core focus alongside disciplined asset management and cost control. 

We anticipate the economic conditions experienced during the interim period to persist for the remainder of the financial year. 
Bidvest remains well positioned to participate in pockets of activity and opportunities while creating value for its extensive 
stakeholder base. 

Bidvest will continue to carefully consider strategic investments in South Africa and internationally to generate sustainable 
profits for the long term, particularly in those sectors where we can capitalise on structural growth drivers including out-of-
home hygiene, urbanisation, health and wellness awareness and outsourcing. 

The Group remains cognisant of making growth decisions for capital investment in long-dated relevant infrastructure assets 
backed by take-or-pay contracts, such as the LPG storage project in Richards Bay. This thinking has also led to a decision to 
establish an inland LPG storage terminal, which was recently approved. 

The funding for the acquisitions of PHS and Eqstra will absorb a meaningful portion of the financial headroom that exists on the 
Group's balance sheet today. The resulting gearing ratio will, however, remain comfortably below bank covenants. Strong free 
cash generation and a robust balance sheet will continue to support the Group's strategy of growth in its existing markets, as well 
as continuing to acquire bolt-on businesses. This will also enable Bidvest to pursue expansion internationally in the chosen niche 
areas of Services and Commercial Products.  
 
DIVIDEND DECLARATION  
 
In line with the Group dividend policy, the directors have declared a final gross cash dividend of 282 cents (225.6000 cents net 
of dividend withholding tax, where applicable) per ordinary share for the six months ended 31 December 2019 to those members 
registered on the record date, being Friday, 27 March 2020. The dividend has been declared from income reserves. A dividend 
withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders who are not exempt.

TRADING STATEMENT

In accordance with Section 3.4(b) (i) of the JSE Listings Requirements, listed companies are required to publish
a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be
reported will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.
The remeasurement of associates' fair value based on Adcock Ingram and Comair share prices, which is of a
capital nature, contracted since 30 June 2019 compared to material increases in the prior period. This
negatively impacted attributable income. Adcock Ingram was revalued as at 31 July 2019, subsequent to which
it became a subsidiary. Comair was marked-to-market as at 31 December 2019.
As a result, basic earnings per share (EPS) for the six months to 31 December 2019 is expected to be between
23% and 28% lower, translating into EPS of between 475 cents and 502 cents, when compared to the previous
interim period (1HFY19: 660.0 cents).
During the six months to December 2019, Bidvest's domestic operations held their own in a tough trading
environment characterised by low business confidence and constrained consumer demand culminating in
lower volumes. Offshore service businesses performed well. Operational cash generation has been good and
the balance sheet remains strong. The impact of accounting for Adcock Ingram as an associate for one month
and consolidating it from 1 August 2019, was neutral on headline earnings.
The adoption of IFRS16 had a modest positive impact on the trading profit, however, the resulting higher
interest charge had a net adverse impact of 4% on attributable income and headline earnings, in line with our
expectations and guidance in the 30 June 2019 Annual Financial Statements.
As per the trading statement issued on 19 February 2020, Comair expects to report a loss for the six months to
December 2019, the result of increased operational costs and the impairment of the full outstanding SAA
settlement. This once-off impairment negatively impacted Bidvest's headline earnings by 6%. As Bidvest
excluded its share of the unpaid portion of Comair's SAA claim in normalised headline earnings as at 30 June
2019, this does not impact Bidvest's normalised headline earnings during the current reporting period.

Shareholders are advised that:
*     Excluding the impact of IFRS16, normalised headline earnings per share(1) (HEPS) is expected to be 1% higher
      to 1% lower compared to the prior period (1HFY19: 635.7 cents).
*     The normalised HEPS for the six months to 31 December 2019 is expected to be 2% to 5% lower than the
      prior interim period, translating into normalised HEPS of between 604 cents and 636 cents.
*     The HEPS for the six months to 31 December 2019, which includes the SAA impairment, is expected to be
      between 6% and 11% lower than the prior interim period (1HFY19: 629.1 cents), translating into HEPS of
      between 560 cents and 591 cents.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on by
the Group's auditors. The Group expects its interim results to 31 December 2019 to be released on SENS on or
about the 2nd of March 2020.

BIDVEST GROUP LIMITED
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa
Registration number: 1946/021180/06
ISIN: ZAE000117321
“Bidvest” or “the Company”

ACQUISITION OF PHS BY BIDVEST AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Introduction
Bidvest is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the
PHS Group (“PHS” or the “business”) from Anchorage Capital Group, L.L.C. for and on behalf
of funds managed and advised by it and funds managed by M&G Investments (“the
Acquisition”).

The Acquisition is for an enterprise value consideration of GBP495million, approximately
R9.1 billion.

Overview of PHS
PHS is the number one hygiene service provider in the United Kingdom (UK) and also holds
top positions in the Republic of Ireland (Ireland) and Spain. It offers a comprehensive range
of hygiene services as well complementary services such as consumable supplies, laundry and
rental of textiles and dust control mats.

PHS was founded in the UK in 1963 and today serves more than 120,000 customers. More
than half of its customers have been customers in excess of ten years while the average
contract term is three- to five-years. Advance billings and high retention rates result in
significant revenue visibility and attractive operational cash conversion.

The hygiene market is resilient and continues to grow supported by structural growth drivers
such as urbanisation, hygiene and safety standards as well as a growing and aging population,
to name a few. In the UK, the provision of sanitary and nappy bins is legislated by the
Environmental Protection Act of 1990. External industry research forecasts the hygiene
market to grow at 1.5-2.0 times GDP.

PHS has undergone several ownership and management changes over the past two decades.
Aggressive M&A in non-hygiene areas diverted focus and negatively impacted performance
of the core business. A simplification and refocus drive was then put in place, followed more
recently, by initiatives to leverage the scalable hygiene platform.

Rationale for the Acquisition
The Acquisition of PHS is in line with Bidvest’s stated strategic intent to expand its presence
beyond South Africa in niche, asset light businesses that will benefit from Bidvest’s
capabilities and expertise.

The Acquisition satisfies the following specific criteria:
-   Meaningful player in the territory – No. 1 hygiene market position in the UK and Spain and
    No. 2 in Ireland;
-   A competent management team – senior management has extensive experience in
    operating service businesses;
-   Annuity income – the combination of essential services and long average client tenure;
-   Strong growth prospects – established scalable platforms in the UK, Ireland and Spain in
    a structurally growing industry; and
-   Attractive, sustainable returns and strong cash conversion.

Bidvest believes that the PHS service offering and geographic presence will be complementary
to Bidvest’s Services division. Several learnings can be shared, and enhanced, thereby
improving the overall service offering. The geographic footprint allows for growth optionality
into Europe and further afield.

Salient terms of the Acquisition
The Acquisition will be made through Bidvest Services (UK) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary
of The Bidvest Group (UK) Limited, which in turn is wholly owned by Bidvest.

Bidvest is conservatively geared at 0.9x net debt / EBITDA (as at 30 June 2019) and has an
investment grade rating from Moody’s, which is evidence of its strong credit quality as well
as its significant borrowing capacity in both Europe and South Africa. Accordingly, Bidvest will
fully fund the Acquisition through committed third-party external GBP-denominated debt
funding.

PHS management has signed service contracts in support of the Acquisition and remains
committed to the business.

The transaction is expected to be completed mid-2020, subject to fulfilment of the below
mentioned conditions precedent.

Conditions precedent
The Acquisition is subject to fulfilment and/or waiver of the following conditions precedent:
- South African Reserve Bank approval;
- all necessary anti-trust approvals being granted; and
- all necessary approvals or consents from the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance
   with Part XII of the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2000.

Financial information
The Acquisition will be concluded on a debt-free cash-free basis. When the Acquisition is
executed all debt and debt-like items will be extinguished.

In the financial year to March 2019, PHS generated earnings before interest, tax and
amortisation (EBITA) of GBP37.5 million. The reported loss for the year was GBP60.2 million
post servicing the significant shareholder loans and third party debt. PHS reported negative
NAV of GBP189.1 million. The NAV subject to the Acquisition totalled GBP348 million.
In the table below, the key financial metrics from the statutory financial statements of PHS
for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 are summarised.

(i) the provision of PHS’ memorandum of incorporation does not frustrate Bidvest’s

compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE: Four months ending 31 October 2019

At Bidvest's Annual General Meeting (AGM) held today, 28 November 2019, the Group provided an update on
its performance for the first four months, ended 31 October 2019, of the financial year (FY20).

Bidvest has delivered a resilient organic operational performance in a challenging market. Domestically,
demand is lacklustre in an environment plagued by low business confidence and constrained consumer
demand. Cost and capital discipline together with improved margins were highlights. Acquired businesses
delivered in line with expectations.

Effective 1 July 2019, the Group restructured from seven divisions into six. This mainly impacted Office and
Print and Commercial Products divisions. The former has been renamed Branded Products and now includes
Adcock Ingram (consolidated from 1 August 2019) and Home of Living Brands. The Electrical operations now
form part of Commercial Products.

The Services and Automotive divisions delivered good results, while Commercial Products and Financial
Services held their own. The lack of yellow maize export volumes at the start of the period impacted the
Freight division's results, while the lower margin and volumes on the significant Treasury contract put pressure
on Branded Products' performance. Underlying trends are similar to that experienced towards the end of
FY19.

The adoption of IFRS16 impacted the trading profit positively, while a larger interest expense resulted in a net
negative impact on attributable income.

Bidvest still awaits the closing of the Eqstra transaction. Various acquisitions are being pursued. The disposal of
Bidvest's 6.75% stake in the Mumbai International Airport is progressing. Management remains committed to
disposing of Glenryck, Taeuber & Corssen as well as The Mansfield Group.

Bidvest Freight's R1 billion Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) project in Richards Bay is progressing well. The arrival
of the world's largest LPG storage tanks and the establishment of the terminal was celebrated at the end of
October 2019. Approval has been given for a further R205 million investment in an inland LPG terminal. Work
on this will start once the Richards Bay terminal is operational.

Asset management remains a core focus across the Group. In line with historic seasonal patterns and
considering the strain in the local economy, the Group expects working capital absorption at the end of the
interim period. Net debt /EBITDA remains healthy, despite continued corporate action and capital investments
in South Africa.

In October 2019, Bidvest successfully raised two long-term bonds, totalling R1.5 billion, in a significantly
oversubscribed process. This extended the term of Group debt.

Group ROFE improved year on year.
Additional operational commentary:

Services

Services returned a good result in a challenging and price sensitive market. Noonan continued to perform very
well and Bidvest Facilities Management secured a material contract, effective 1 April 2020. In SA, the results
reflect the predominant annuity nature of the operations. Contract churn at a few businesses is receiving
focused attention. Travel continues to be plagued by downtrading and a high cost base. The bolt-on
acquisitions made during FY19 contributed in line with expectations. Effective 1 July 2019, Noonan acquired
Future Cleaning, a niche cleaning service provider, to expand its footprint in the United Kingdom.

Freight

An excellent performance from Bidvest Tank Terminals, the continuation of good manganese and chrome
volumes and improved bulk volumes in Bidvest SACD did not, unfortunately, offset the lack of yellow maize
export volumes, the continued decline in warehouse and transport volumes as well as weak trading in
Namibia. OnTime delivered a flat result. The DSV Panalpina transaction came into effect, and as a
consequence, Bidvest announced the tie-up with a new international network partner, EMO Trans. Bidvest
Panalpina Logistics has been renamed Bidvest International Logistics. Overall, the divisional performance to
date has been satisfactory.

Branded Products

The divisional performance was significantly impacted by the consolidation of Adcock Ingram, effective 1
August 2019. The overall performance has also been impacted by the lower margins and volumes generated
from the Treasury contract in Konica Minolta. Silveray, Lithotech and Cecil Nurse delivered solid performances.
The packaging division benefitted from the acquisition of Aluminium Foil Converters and the move to paper
packing solutions, specifically to replace plastic. Waltons are preparing for the important back-to-school
period. Asset management, rightsizing of businesses and driving top-line growth remain key focus areas.

Commercial Products

The division held its own despite depressed industrial, manufacturing and construction demand as well as
delayed contract work. Electrical, Plumblink and Bidvest Materials Handling delivered strong results. This was
neutralised by weak trading in the DIY/Workwear/Tools cluster on the back of lower demand that negatively
impacted factory production and manifested in margin pressure. Pockets of activity are evident in the
electrical businesses. Management is focused on bedding down this restructured division with specific
attention given to poor performing operations. Balance sheet management remains a core focus.

Bidvest Bank delivered a solid result with pleasing growth in net interest income as well as good cost control.
FinGlobal continued its good performance. FMI continued its strong growth in gross written premiums,
Compendium performed well but Bidvest Insurance felt the impact of lower vehicle demand and the closure of
its commercial line. The listed equity portfolio returns declined in line with market volatility. One of the key
challenges is the declining leased asset book. Roll out of the Transnet heavy commercial vehicle contract
should accelerate into the balance of the financial year. Closing of the Eqstra transaction is expected in Q1 of
2020.

Automotive

The Automotive division reported a good result notwithstanding the subdued trading environment. Luxury
sales remain weak with gross margin under pressure. Cost containment due to the rationalisation of non-
profitable dealerships, both in SA and Namibia, in the prior year contributed significantly to the improved retail
performance. Bidvest Car Rental delivered a strong result driven by increased volumes and improved fleet
utilisation. Management focus remains on rightsizing the business for current activity levels.
Retirement of executive director

The Bidvest Group announces the retirement of Anthony Dawe. Anthony did not put himself up for re-election
as executive director at today's AGM. Anthony's retirement comes after spending 26 years with the Group. He

to the Bidvest board as executive director on 28 June 2006. The board and the Bidvest family thank Anthony
for his years of service and dedication and wish him well in his retirement.

Wiseman Madinane will succeed Anthony as the Freight CEO, effective 31 December 2019. Wiseman brings to
the role experience from various industries prior to joining Bulk Connections.
