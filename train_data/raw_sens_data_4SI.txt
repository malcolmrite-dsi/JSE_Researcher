ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE 4SIGHT GENERAL MEETING


Shareholders are referred to the announcement issued on Friday, 21 August 2020 advising shareholders, inter alia, of
the date and time of the Company’s upcoming general meeting of shareholders (the “General Meeting”).

The General Meeting will be held entirely by utilising electronic communication and electronic platforms, on Tuesday,
22 September 2020 at 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South African time).

Shareholders may access the General Meeting by utilising the link below and by following the relevant steps:

http://bit.ly/4Sight-SGM-22Sept2020

Steps to follow:

•   Type or copy the link into your internet browser
•   Click “join on web instead or open Microsoft Teams”
•   Click on “join now”

As noted in previous communication, the General Meeting will be held electronically as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the resultant social distancing imperatives, legal restrictions and official advice on gatherings and
movement. However, this will not in any way affect the rights of shareholders to register for the General Meeting,
provided that only those shareholders who are fully verified (as required in terms of the Mauritian Companies Act, 2001)
and subsequently registered at the commencement of the General Meeting will be allowed to participate in the General
Meeting.

Shareholders wishing to participate in the General Meeting are requested to submit notification of their intent (the
“Electronic Notice”) by e-mail to Link Market Services SA Proprietary Limited (the “Transfer Secretary”) at
meetfax@linkmarketservices.co.za as soon as possible and by no later than 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South
African time) on Friday, 18 September 2020. However, this will not in any way affect the rights of shareholders to
register for the General Meeting after this date, provided that only those shareholders who are fully verified and
subsequently registered at the commencement of the General Meeting will be allowed to participate in the General
Meeting by electronic means.

For the Electronic Notice to be valid, it must contain the following information:

•   If the shareholder is an individual: a certified copy of his/ her original identity document and/or passport and/or
    driver's licence.
•   If the shareholder is not an individual, a certified copy of a resolution by the relevant entity and a certified copy of
    the identity documents and/or passports of the persons who passed the relevant resolution, which resolution must
    set out who from the relevant entity is authorised to represent the relevant entity at the General Meeting via
    electronic participation.
•   A valid email address and/or mobile telephone number.

By providing the forms of identification, participants hereby give the Company the right to use this personal data for
the purpose of the General Meeting.

Certificated shareholders or dematerialised shareholders with “own-name” registration, and who are entitled to attend
and vote at the General Meeting, are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and speak in their stead, subject
to the above provisions. A proxy need not be a shareholder. It is required that proxy forms be forwarded to reach the
Transfer Secretary in South Africa by no later than 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South African time) on Friday,
18 September 2020, being the last practicable and reasonable date for the Company to verify the identity of shareholders
and their proxies who wish to participate by electronic communication in the General Meeting.
Shareholders who have dematerialised their shares, other than those shareholders who have dematerialised their shares
with “own-name” registration, should contact their Central Securities Depository Participant (“CSDP”) or broker in the
manner and within the time stipulated in the agreement entered into between them and their CSDP or broker:

•   to furnish them with their voting instructions; or
•   in the event that they wish to participate in the General Meeting, to obtain the necessary letter of representation to
    do so.

Aside from the costs incurred by the Company as a result of hosting the General Meeting by way of a remote interactive
electronic platform, shareholders will be liable for their own network charges in relation to electronic participation in
the General Meeting. Any such charges will not be for the account of 4Sight and/or the Transfer Secretary. 4Sight and/or
the Transfer Secretary cannot be held accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other network failure
due to insufficient airtime, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth and/or power outages which prevents any such
shareholder from participating in the General Meeting.

Shareholders are further advised that voting of shares will be not be possible via electronic communication during the
General Meeting. As such, shareholders are strongly encouraged to submit forms of proxy to the Transfer Secretary (in
the case of certificated shareholders and dematerialised shareholders with “own-name” registration) or provide
instructions to their appointed CSDP or broker (in the case of dematerialised shareholders without “own-name”
registration) by no later than 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South African time) on Friday, 18 September 2020. For
the avoidance of doubt, forms of proxy submitted to the Transfer Secretary in respect of the General Meeting prior to
the publication of this announcement remain valid.

The Transfer Secretary will act as scrutineer.

Shareholders will be able to communicate to the 4Sight Board of Directors (the “Board”) by leaving comments and
asking questions via the chat function in the Microsoft Teams Live Event. Please note that, given the limited time, this
chat function will be moderated by 4Sight’s Audit and Risk Committee Chairperson in order to prioritize any questions
posed by shareholders.

Submission of Questions to the Board

Shareholders will also be able to submit their questions via email to investors@4sightholdings.com. The Company
strongly encourages shareholders to submit all questions no later than 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South African
time) on Friday, 18 September 2020 for consideration by the Board. However, as mentioned above, shareholders will
be allowed to ask questions during the General Meeting itself via the chat function provided.

DISTRIBUTION OF CIRCULAR AND NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING TO SHAREHOLDERS


1.    DISTRIBUTION OF CIRCULAR AND NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING

      Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on SENS on 7 April 2020, where 4Sight advised
      shareholders that it had entered into a share sale and repurchase agreement with Edward Earnest Bartlett, Wilhelm
      Marthinus Bonnema, Brian Jonathan Collett, Hilton Denzil Goodhead, Desmond Bryan Griggs, Ronel Visagie,
      Marthinus Phillipus Neethling, the Ad Alta Trust, the Apex Trust, the Digitata Investment Trust, the Pachypodium
      Trust and the Yotta Trust (collectively, the “purchasers”), whereby 4Sight will dispose of 100% of the issued
      share capital of Digitata Limited (“Digitata”) (the “Digitata Equity”) to the purchasers for an aggregate
      consideration of R91 900 000 (the “Digitata Sale Consideration”).

      The Digitata Sale Consideration will be discharged by the purchasers selling to the Company, as part of an
      indivisible transaction, an aggregate of 290 549 558 4Sight shares (the “repurchase shares”) for an amount equal
      to the Digitata Sale Consideration (the disposal of Digitata Equity and the repurchase by the Company of the
      repurchase shares are collectively referred to herein as the “proposed transaction”).

      Shareholders are now advised that the Company has today issued a circular to its shareholders (the “circular”)
      relating to the proposed transaction. The repurchase by the Company of the repurchase shares constitutes a
      specific repurchase of shares. In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a specific repurchase of shares from
      related parties requires the approval of 4Sight shareholders, excluding the related parties, by way of a special
      resolution.

      A general meeting of 4Sight shareholders will be held at 10:00 SAST / 12:00 MST on Tuesday, 22 September
      2020 at the South African office of 4Sight, Battler House, 28 Roos Street, Fourways, Johannesburg, 2191, for the
      purpose of considering and, if deemed fit, passing, with or without modification, the resolutions required to be
      approved by shareholders in order to authorise and implement the proposed transaction (the “general meeting”).

      In light of the directive announced on 23 March 2020 by the President of South Africa in terms of section 27(1)
      of the Disaster Management Act, No. 57 of 2002 implementing a nationwide lockdown with effect from 26 March
      2020, which may be extended or re-instated from time to time, (the “Lockdown”) and the guidance from the
      South African Government regarding the need for social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
      shareholders are encouraged to make use of proxies for purposes of voting at the general meeting.

      In the event of a future Lockdown, future regulations or directives or preventative measures relating to COVID-
      19, shareholders or their proxies may be prevented from attending the general meeting in person. In such
      circumstances, 4Sight is likely to determine, by way of notice to shareholders published on SENS by no later than
      10 (ten) business days prior to the general meeting, that the general meeting will take place entirely by electronic
      means and/or that shareholders or their proxies will be entitled to vote electronically, which notice will include
      details and instructions of such arrangement.

      The circular will be available on the Company’s website at https://www.4sightholdings.com/disposal-of-
      digitata.html from Friday, 21 August 2020.

2.    SALIENT DATES AND TIMES

               used by Strate, settlement of trades takes place three business days after such trade. Therefore, persons who

      4.       4Sight shareholders are advised that the Company has entered into a closed period from 1 July 2020 until

               Requirements, 4Sight may not hold the general meeting to propose the share repurchase resolution to
               shareholders during a closed period. As such, the Company intends to publish its interim results for the six
               months ended 30 June 2020 on or about Tuesday, 15 September 2020. Any change to the general meeting
               date will be announced on SENS.

4SIGHT HOLDINGS LIMITED
(Incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius)

(“4Sight” or “the Company” or “the Group”)


UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020


THE IMPACT OF COVID-19
The impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been felt across all the Group’s affiliates and business units
in different ways. The majority of operating subsidiaries were categorised as suppliers of essential goods and
services and therefore remained “online” and open for trade, albeit under the COVID-19 lockdown regulations.
The move to lockdown level 4 allowed the Group to gradually start trading in more retail product categories, that
affected only one affiliate, AGE Technologies. All operations except for minor business units (such as training
centres) are back in full production.

From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board of Directors (BoD) and Executive team (EXCO) held
emergency strategy sessions prioritising the management of cash flow and elimination of unnecessary costs where
possible. Our primary goal has been to protect the health and livelihoods of our people during this time. Although
salary increases were put on hold across the majority of the Company, these have now been implemented and our
headcount has increased by 6%.

During the pandemic, the health and safety of our people, our customers and all other stakeholders has been our
priority. We have refined our standard operating procedures to ensure that all operations conform to the highest
levels of hygiene and social distancing requirements. To this end, we have built our own COVID-19 scanning and
contact tracking application. This has been successfully implemented both internally as well as with several of our
customers. We have also implemented a wide range of alternate and flexible working arrangements, where possible
utilising technology to enable remote work. Approximately 99% of our workforce now work and service our
customers remotely.

After the initial impact of COVID-19, we immediately started gearing up our marketing and online presence with
news, webinars and other digital and remote engagements with current customers and business prospects. These
initiatives coupled with our proactive pivot in group strategy have resulted in 4Sight securing several multiple
million rand deals remotely during this time. It should be noted that the full delivery of our new deals will also be
completed remotely.

BUSINESS UPDATE
The last 40 years of technology advancements have led to new and exciting innovations. In the 1980s, we had big
computing and large mainframes. The 1990s saw the era of PCs, networking and data sharing. The 2000s brought
us the Internet and the sharing and connectivity of information, whilst the 2010s saw the proliferation of mobile
devices and apps. Now that we have entered the 2020s, we find ourselves in the ‘automation era’. This is
underpinned by data which is the oil of the automation era as well as any Modern Digital Enterprise’s core asset
in the 2020s.

Our EXCO team identified the Modern Digital Enterprise concept in November 2019 as our key strategy for
business growth in the modern digital economy and automation era. In our most recent annual report, our Group
CEO, Tertius Zitzke, indicated that our business opportunity resides, in taking advantage of 4IR technologies,
coupled with our proven digital transformation approach and initiatives to ultimately accelerate the convergence
between the Operational Technologies, Information Technologies and Business Environment worlds through our
integrated solutions.

We believe that the key characteristic of 4IR is the intelligent use of data to support better decision-making in near
real time. This is critically important in today’s hypercompetitive digital economy in which the ability to pivot
rapidly in response to changing market conditions (e.g. COVID-19) or customer demand is vital. To realise the
true value of 4IR technologies, organisations will need to evolve so that people and technology also converge.

This convergence of 4IR technologies and people will give rise to a new kind of business organisation, which can
be referred to as Enterprise 5.0. This can only be achieved when the technology and people are brought together
within the Enterprise 5.0 framework. We have identified a number of key pillars within 4IR (Industry 4.0) that will
accelerate customers' adoption of digital transformation initiatives and allow them to take advantage of technology
solutions that deliver meaningful business value. These include: People4.0, Customer4.0, Operation4.0, Finance4.0
and Innovation4.0.

We continue to actively manage the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our priority remains the health
and safety of our employees. We are also providing support to our customers, intermediaries and vulnerable
suppliers across our businesses.

Company’s auditors. The Company’s financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be
released on or about 15 September 2020.

The AGM for the year ended 31 December 2019 will be held entirely by utilising electronic communication and
electronic platforms, on Friday, 31 July 2020 at 12:00pm Mauritian time (10:00am South African time).

https://bit.ly/4Sight-AGM-TeamsLink

Steps to follow:

-   Type or copy the link into your internet browser
-   Click “join on web instead or open Microsoft Teams”
-   Click on “join now”

As noted in previous communication, the AGM will be held electronically is as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the resultant social distancing imperatives, legal restrictions and official advice on gatherings and movement. However,
this will not in any way affect the rights of shareholders to register for the AGM, provided that only those shareholders
who are fully verified (as required in terms of the Mauritian Companies Act, 2001) and subsequently registered at the
commencement of the AGM will be allowed to participate in and/or vote by electronic means.

Shareholders wishing to participate in the AGM are requested to submit notification of their intent (“the Electronic
Notice”) by e-mail to the Company at investors@4sightholdings.com or to Link Market Services SA Proprietary Limited
(“the Transfer Secretary”) at meetfax@linkmarketservices.co.za as soon as possible and by no later than 2:00pm
Mauritian time (12:00pm South African time) on Wednesday, 29 July 2020. However, this will not in any way affect
the rights of shareholders to register for the AGM after this date, provided that only those shareholders who are fully
verified and subsequently registered at the commencement of the AGM will be allowed to participate in and/or vote by
electronic means.

For the Electronic Notice to be valid, it must contain the following information:

-   If the shareholder is an individual: a certified copy of his/ her original identity document and/or passport and/or
    driver's licence.
-   If the shareholder is not an individual, a certified copy of a resolution by the relevant entity and a certified copy of
    the identity documents and/or passports of the persons who passed the relevant resolution, which resolution must
    set out who from the relevant entity is authorised to represent the relevant entity at the AGM via electronic
    participation.
-   A valid email address and/or mobile telephone number.

By providing the forms of identification, participants hereby give the Company the right to use this personal data for
the purpose of the AGM.

Certificated shareholders or dematerialised shareholders with “own-name” registration, and who are entitled to attend
and vote at the AGM, are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote in their stead. A proxy need
not be a shareholder and shall be entitled to vote on a poll. It is required that proxy forms be forwarded to reach the
Transfer Secretary in South Africa by no later than 2:00pm Mauritian time (12:00pm South African time) on
Wednesday, 29 July 2020, being the last practicable and reasonable date for the Company to verify the identity of
shareholders and their proxies who wish to participate by electronic communication in the AGM.
Shareholders who have dematerialised their shares, other than those shareholders who have dematerialised their shares
with “own-name” registration, should contact their Central Securities Depository Participant (“CSDP”) or broker in the
manner and within the time stipulated in the agreement entered into between them and their CSDP or broker:

-   to furnish them with their voting instructions; or
-   in the event that they wish to participate in the AGM, to obtain the necessary letter of representation to do so.

Aside from the costs incurred by the Company as a result of hosting the AGM by way of a remote interactive electronic
platform, shareholders will be liable for their own network charges in relation to electronic participation in and/or voting
at the AGM. Any such charges will not be for the account of 4Sight and/or the Transfer Secretary. 4Sight and/or the
Transfer Secretary cannot be held accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other network failure due
to insufficient airtime, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth and/or power outages which prevents any such
shareholder from participating in and/or voting at the AGM.

Procedure for voting at the Annual General Meeting

Voting of shares will be possible via electronic communication during the AGM. Shareholders who have submitted their
Electronic Notice will be provided with the link, username and password in order to access the platform for voting.
Once the AGM has commenced, participants who have logged in using their username and password will be able to
vote during the AGM.

Notwithstanding the availability of the electronic voting platform, shareholders may still submit forms of proxy to the
Transfer Secretary (in the case of certificated shareholders and dematerialised shareholders with “own-name”
registration) or provide instructions to their appointed CSDP or broker (in the case of dematerialised shareholders
without “own-name” registration) by no later than 2:00pm Mauritian time (12:00pm South African time) on Wednesday,
29 July 2020. For the avoidance of doubt, forms of proxy submitted to the Transfer Secretary in respect of the AGM
prior to the publication of this announcement remain valid.

The Transfer Secretary will act as scrutineer.

Shareholders will be able to communicate to the 4Sight Board of Directors (“the Board”) by leaving comments and
asking questions via the chat function in the Microsoft Teams Live Event. Please note that, given the limited time, this
chat function will be moderated by 4Sight’s Audit and Risk Committee Chairperson in order to prioritize any questions
posed by shareholders.

Shareholders will also be able to submit their questions via email to investors@4sightholdings.com. The Company
strongly encourages shareholders to submit all questions no later than 2:00pm Mauritian time (12:00pm South African
time) on Wednesday, 29 July 2020 for consideration by the Board. However, as mentioned above, shareholders will be
allowed to ask questions during the AGM itself via the chat function provided.

NO CHANGE STATEMENT AND AVAILABILITY OF INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT

No Change Statement
Shareholders are advised that the Company’s integrated report, incorporating the audited annual financial
statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2019, (on which the Company’s auditors expressed a qualified
audit     opinion)     is     available    with  immediate      effect    on   the     Company’s       website,
https://www.4sightholdings.com/pdfs/annual-report-2019.pdf, and contains no changes to the provisional results
for the year ended 31 December 2019, released on SENS on 31 March 2020.


Basis for Qualified Opinion on Consolidated Financial Statements and Unqualified Opinion on the separate
Financial Statements.
Visualitics (Pty) Ltd and its related subsidiaries (“Visualitics”), a related party transaction concluded in 2018, was
disposed of prior to the year under review. The independent auditors were unable to obtain sufficient and
appropriate evidence to verify the transactions and balances of Visualitics at the date of the acquisition. This was
due to poorly maintained accounting records by the initial Visualitics management team. The accounting issues,
coupled with a general breakdown in the day-to-day working relationship between the sellers of Visualitics and
the rest of the Company, led to the entity being sold to avoid any further qualifications. Visualitics made no
significant financial contribution to the Company.

Except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of the Independent
Auditor’s Report, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
and the JSE Listing Requirements.

29 June 2020. The annual general meeting of shareholders of 4Sight will be held entirely by electronic

The reason for the holding of the AGM entirely by way of electronic communication is as a result of the COVID-
19 virus outbreak and the resultant health distancing imperatives, legal restrictions and official advice on gatherings
and movement.

EXTENSION OF FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD IN RESPECT OF THE AUDITED ANNUAL

Shareholders are referred to the market notice issued on 3 April 2020 by the Financial Services Conduct Authority
(“FSCA”), wherein, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant nationwide lockdown, the FSCA
granted companies listed on the JSE Limited who have financial years ends of 31 December 2019, 31 January 2020, 29
February 2020 and 31 March 2020, an extension of two months by which to comply with various reporting timeframes
as provided for in the JSE Listings Requirements (“the FSCA extension”).

The JSE Listings Requirements state that the audited financial statements, together with the notice of annual general
meeting of an issuer, must be distributed to shareholders within four months of an issuer’s financial year end.

4Sight published reviewed condensed consolidated provisional financial results for the year ended 31 December 2019
on Tuesday, 31 March 2020. Due to the constraints placed on the Company as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic and resultant national lockdown, 4Sight advises that it will be relying on the FSCA extension with regard to
the distribution of its annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, together with the notice of
annual general meeting, both of which were due to be distributed on or before 30 April 2020.

Accordingly, the annual financial statements of 4Sight for the year ended 31 December 2019, together with the annual
report containing the notice of annual general meeting, will be distributed as soon as practically possible, but by 
no later than 30 June 2020. A further announcement will be released on SENS at the time that the annual report and 
notice of annual general meeting are distributed.

(“4Sight” or the “Company” or the “Group”)


RELATED PARTY DISPOSAL OF DIGITATA LIMITED, REPURCHASE OF SHARES AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY


1.   INTRODUCTION

     Shareholders are advised that 4Sight has entered into a share sale and repurchase agreement (the “transaction
     agreement”) with Edward Earnest Bartlett, Wilhelm Marthinus Bonnema, Brian Jonathan Collett, Hilton Denzil
     Goodhead, Desmond Bryan Griggs, Ronel Visagie, Marthinus Phillipus Neethling, the Ad Alta Trust, the Apex
     Trust, the Digitata Investment Trust, the Pachypodium Trust and the Yotta Trust (collectively, the “purchasers”),
     whereby 4Sight will, with effect from the date on which the last of the conditions precedent to the transaction
     agreement are fulfilled or, where appropriate, waived, dispose of 100% of the issued share capital of Digitata
     Limited (“Digitata”) (the “Digitata Equity”) to the purchasers for an aggregate consideration of R91 900 000.

     The R91 900 000 consideration payable by the purchasers for the Digitata Equity (the “Digitata Sale
     Consideration”) will be discharged by the purchasers selling to the Company as part of an indivisible transaction
     an aggregate of 290 549 558 4Sight shares (the “repurchase shares”) for an amount equal to the Digitata Sale
     Consideration (the disposal of Digitata Equity and the repurchase by the Company of the repurchase shares
     collectively referred to herein as the “proposed transaction”).

2.   DESCRIPTION OF DIGITATA AND RATIONALE

     Digitata was acquired by 4Sight on 1 July 2017 ahead of the Company’s listing on the Alternative Exchange of
     the JSE. Digitata operates mainly in the mobile telecommunications industry and focuses on providing Fourth
     Industrial Revolution (“4IR”) solutions across the areas of service revenue management through its Intelligent
     Pricing Solution, customer engagement through its gamification platform and a suite of mobile network
     management products.

     Digitata has not operated profitably during the last 18 months and has not achieved its agreed budget targets. This
     was primarily due to non-cash events related to impairments as reported in the 2019 Financial Results as published
     on SENS on 31 March 2020. The Digitata subsidiary was acquired by 4Sight at an acquisition cost based on its
     anticipated future financial performance which has unfortunately failed to materialise.

     The other 4Sight clusters, namely the Mining, Manufacturing, Energy & Chemicals and Platform Clusters, which
     continue to deliver solid results, will remain as part of the Group. These clusters enable the creation of an
     ecosystem where 4Sight subsidiaries, partners, and alliances can build, run and grow their 4IR offerings. This
     transcends into the value that can be created for customers embarking on their digital transformation journey,
     while following a cost effective and low risk self-funding methodology.

     In line with previous SENS announcements where 4Sight indicated that the Group continues to realign its strategic
     intent, the proposed transaction will further allow for the continued repositioning of the 4Sight Group as a focused
     multi-national, diversified technology group. The proposed transaction will allow 4Sight to focus its efforts on
     accelerating its integrated solution development for the convergence of operational technologies, information
     technologies and business environment solutions, on a basis that allows the Company to cancel the repurchased
     shares and thus significantly reduce its issued share capital by c.37%.

3.   SALIENT TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION

     Digitata Sale consideration

     The aggregate consideration for the Digitata Equity is R91 900 000.

     On repurchase by the Company of the repurchase shares, the repurchase shares will be cancelled and the issued
     share capital of 4Sight reduced from 791 304 945 to 500 755 387 issued shares.

     Conditions precedent

     The proposed transaction is subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions precedent:

     -     the securing of all regulatory approvals that may be required to give effect to the transaction agreement,
           which includes compliance with the Mauritian Companies Act 2001 (the “Companies Act”), required JSE
           Listings Requirements approvals and to the extent necessary, applicable competition commission
           filings/approval (whether in South Africa or Mauritius);

     -     all such resolutions as may be necessary in order to approve and implement the proposed transaction have
           been passed by the board of directors and/or the shareholders of the Company;

           been passed by the board of directors and/or the shareholders of Digitata;

     -     the Battler transaction(1) has become unconditional in accordance with its terms, save for any condition that
           requires it to become effective with reference to the transaction agreement and/or any terms in the
           transaction agreement;

     -     except for loan obligations in existence between Digitata and/or its subsidiaries and 4Sight and/or its
           subsidiaries (excluding Digitata and its subsidiaries), each of the Company and Digitata has delivered to
           the other a confirmation letter signed by a director that there are no inter-company loan repayment and/or
           customer account (debtors) obligations between or among them (including their respective subsidiaries)
           and that the appropriate accounting entries have been effected;

     -     a fairness opinion is obtained from an independent expert prepared in accordance with Schedule 5 of the
           JSE Listings Requirements, confirming that the sale of the Digitata Equity and the receipt and transfer of
           the repurchase shares as consideration therefor, are fair insofar as the shareholders of the Company are
           concerned (other than those purchasers who are "related parties" as envisaged in the JSE Listings
           Requirements); and

     -     none of the Company’s shareholders exercise legally permissible, valid and enforceable appraisal rights (if
           any) applicable and provided for under the Companies Act, the Company’s constitution or applicable law.

     Note:
     1.    Prior to the disposal of the Digitata Equity, Digitata South Africa Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned
           subsidiary of Digitata, will transfer its equity in Battler Investments Proprietary Limited, which owns the
           immovable property/ies situated in Fourways, Johannesburg and the related property letting enterprise from
           which Group operations are conducted, to Foursight Holdings Proprietary Limited, a wholly-owned
           subsidiary of 4Sight, for no additional consideration (the “Battler transaction”). The Battler transaction
           is subject to Digitata being entitled to continue its operations from the premises rent-free for a period of
           18 months, while also contributing to operating costs.

     Anti-embarrassment

     Should the purchasers (or any of them) to dispose of all or any of the Digitata Equity and/or all or any of the
     business or assets of Digitata and/or all or some of the shares in any subsidiary of Digitata (individually or
     collectively a “Digitata Asset”), to a third party/ies, for a profit during the 12-month period commencing after
     the implementation of the proposed transaction, then the purchasers shall become liable to the Company for 50%
     of any profit made on such disposal.

     Warranties and indemnities

     The transaction agreement contains undertakings, warranties and indemnities that are normal for a transaction of
     this nature.

     Notes and assumptions:
     1.    This information has been extracted, without adjustment, from 4Sight’s reviewed results for the year ended
           31 December 2019, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
     2.    The repurchase shares are assumed to be cancelled.
     3.    Battler Investments Proprietary Limited is excluded from the Digitata figures and the loan due to Digitata.

5.    JSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

      The proposed acquisition constitutes a category 2 transaction with related parties, as the Yotta Trust is an associate
      of a former director of 4Sight who resigned within 12 months prior to the execution of the transaction agreement.
      In addition, the repurchase by the Company of the repurchase shares constitutes a specific repurchase of shares.

      In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a specific repurchase of shares from related parties requires the
      approval of 4Sight shareholders, excluding the related parties, by way of a special resolution. As the proposed
      transaction is a transaction with related parties, 4Sight is in addition required to obtain a fairness opinion from an
      independent expert in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 21.12(b) (read with paragraph 10.7(b)) of the
      JSE Listings Requirements in respect of the proposed transaction, and include a statement confirming as to
      whether the proposed transaction is fair to 4Sight shareholders in accordance with paragraph 10.4(f) of the JSE
      Listings Requirements.

      Accordingly, 4Sight will appoint an independent expert to provide external advice to the board of directors of
      4Sight in relation to the proposed transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. The independent expert's
      report, as well as the statements of the board of directors of 4Sight as to whether the proposed transaction is fair
      to shareholders, will be included in the circular to 4Sight shareholders, as detailed below. Should the independent
      expert state that the proposed disposal of the Digitata Equity is not fair to shareholders, the disposal of the Digitata
      Equity will be subject to the approval of a simple majority of shareholders by way of ordinary resolution,
      excluding the votes of the related parties and their associates being cast in favour of the resolution.

6.    DOCUMENTATION AND TIMING IN RELATION TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

      Full details of the proposed transaction will be set out in a circular which will be distributed by 4Sight to its
      shareholders in due course, which circular will include the opinion of the independent expert in respect of the
      proposed transaction, a notice of general meeting of 4Sight shareholders to approve the proposed transaction and
      the applicable salient dates and times relating to the proposed transaction.

7.    WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY

      4Sight shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcement released on SENS on Monday, 30 March 2020
      and are advised that in light of the publication of this announcement, the cautionary is withdrawn.

4Sight Holdings Limited is a public company, incorporated on 29 June 2017 in accordance with the laws of the Republic
of Mauritius, specifically for the listing of the 4Sight Group on 19 October 2017. As a multi-national diversified
Technology Group Company, we leverage our subsidiaries’ extensive product and services portfolio of Industry 4.0
technology solutions. The Company’s mission is to empower our partners to future-proof their businesses through digital
transformation in order to make better and more informed decisions in the modern digital economy.

Other financial highlights for the period:

    -  Revenue declined by 3.4% from USD 44.5 million to USD 43.0 million; The main reason for this decline can
        be attributed to the Telco Cluster experiencing a considerable decline in revenue of almost 45%. Despite the
        difficult trading and operating environment, two of our three clusters recorded solid results.
    -   The total operating expenses for the period were USD 55.0 million (2018: USD 31.7 million), an increase of
        73.4% compared to the prior period. The increase in operating expenses for the period was mainly due to the
        once off goodwill impairments of USD 18.1 million (2018: USD 6.8 million) and a credit loss increase
        allowances of USD 4.0 million (2018: USD 0.8 Million) in line with IFRS 9 requirements.
    -   Once the goodwill impairment, once-off impairments for intangible assets and credit loss allowances are
        stripped out, the operating expenses increased with only 2% as compared to the 2018 figures. Cash flow from
        operations increased by 52.1% from USD 1.3 million to USD 1.9 million for the period.

TRADING STATEMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR INTERIM RESULTS

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it becomes reasonably certain that the financial results for the next period to
be reported on will differ by 20% or more from the financial results for the previous corresponding
period.

For the purposes of this trading statement it is necessary to compare the loss per share and headline
loss per share for the six-month period ended 30 June 2019 to the restated figures for the six-month
period ended 30 June 2018, as set out below.

Shareholders are accordingly advised that for the six-months ended 30 June 2019, the Company
expects to report:

-     a loss per share of 1.78 USD cents, reflecting a decrease in excess of 100% as compared to the
      restated earnings per share of 0.12 USD cents reported for the six months ended 30 June 2018;
      and

-     a headline loss per share of 0.03 USD cents, reflecting a decrease in excess of 100% as compared
      to the restated headline earnings per share of 0.13 USD cents reported for the six months ended
      30 June 2018.

RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR INTERIM RESULTS

Following the publication of the interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2018, the Group
performed additional assessments of the financial impact associated with the first-time adoption of
IFRS 9 Financial instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The aforementioned
assessments will result in restatements to the Group statement of financial position and statement of
comprehensive income for the interim results ended 30 June 2018. The effect of the restatement on
the earnings per share and the headline earnings per share are shown below:

                                              Previously reported results            Restated results

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and

2019 are expected to be published on or about 13 December 2019.

Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on SENS on 15 October 2019

a consolidated basis) the FH operating subsidiaries within the 4Sight group are profitable
businesses, which generate large cash reserves.

Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 31 October 2019 and are
advised that the Company has made substantial progress with the finalisation of the group
interim results and the final review by the auditor is in progress. Thereafter the interim results
will be considered by the newly constituted Audit and Risk Committee and Board. Once
approved and published, the Company will apply to the JSE for the lifting of the suspension
of trade in 4Sight securities.
