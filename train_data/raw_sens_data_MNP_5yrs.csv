Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance,15 Oct 2020,"Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance

Mondi plc
(Incorporated in England and Wales)
(Registered number: 6209386)
LEI: 213800LOZA69QFDC9N34

LSE share code: MNDI                  ISIN: GB00B1CRLC47
JSE share code: MNP

15 October 2020

Trading update: Mondi delivers resilient Q3 performance

Underlying EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was €306 million, down 20% on the comparable prior year
period (Q3 2019: €383 million), as lower average selling prices and negative currency effects more than
offset lower costs. Compared to the second quarter of 2020 (‘sequentially’), underlying EBITDA was down
13% (Q2 2020: €353 million). Good volume growth in uncoated fine paper and fibre-based packaging
products and ongoing strong cost control were more than offset by the impact of planned maintenance shuts,
negative currency effects and lower average selling prices.

Andrew King, Group CEO, commented “The decisive action we took in the early stages of the COVID-19
pandemic helped to protect our people, maintain supply of essential products and services, and deliver a
resilient performance. Our people have demonstrated their enterprise and commitment, taking care of
colleagues, communities and customers in these unprecedented times.

I am pleased that sustainable packaging continues to be a focus for our customers. We continue to make
good progress leveraging our award-winning innovation capabilities and customer-centric approach to
optimise packaging design using ‘paper where possible, plastic when useful’.”

In Corrugated Packaging, demand from e-commerce and consumer applications remained strong. We
also saw some recovery in industrial end-uses from the lows of the second quarter. We achieved good
volume growth in Corrugated Solutions measured both year-on-year and sequentially. Given the strong
order position and normalised inventory levels, we are currently in discussions with customers around price
increases for various containerboard grades.

Flexible Packaging demand remained resilient during the period and volumes in our paper bags business
grew year-on-year. Following a strong performance in the first half, we saw some supply chain de-stocking
effects impacting volumes in our consumer flexibles business during the quarter.

We continue to leverage Engineered Materials’ coating technologies to develop sustainable packaging
solutions. As expected, we saw lower personal care component volumes as a key product matures. Demand
in industrial and specialised end-uses continued to be impacted by lockdown restrictions, in particular in
release liner. We are implementing a range of measures to reduce the cost base, including the closure of a
release liner plant in Pleasant Prairie (Wisconsin, US) and engaging with employee representatives on the
restructuring of our personal care components focused operations in Gronau (Germany).

Encouragingly, Uncoated Fine Paper demand improved as lockdown restrictions in Europe, Russia and
Southern Africa eased with a gradual pick-up in activity in schools, offices and commercial printing. Sales
volumes were significantly up sequentially, although they are still down on the comparable prior year
period. Average uncoated fine paper prices were lower than in the first half of the year. Our South African
operations are currently affected by an industry-wide strike. We are engaging with trade unions and
employee representatives to reach an agreement while we continue to deliver products to our customers.
The Uncoated Fine Paper business remains well-positioned in the context of the current market
challenges given our cost competitiveness, product diversification and geographic positioning.
Average input costs were stable sequentially and cost control was strong across the business. Currency
movements had a net negative impact on underlying EBITDA compared to the second quarter, driven by a
weaker US dollar, impacting a number of the Group's globally traded products, coupled with a weaker
Russian rouble and Turkish lira. Given prevailing exchange rates, we anticipate a further net negative
currency impact in the fourth quarter.

To protect our employees and suppliers and minimise execution risk, we decided to postpone most planned
maintenance shuts to the second half of the year. During the quarter, planned maintenance shuts with an
estimated impact on underlying EBITDA of around €35 million (2019: €40 million) were carried out
successfully. Based on prevailing market prices, we continue to estimate that the impact of planned mill
maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA for 2020 will be around €100 million (2019: €150 million), with the
fourth quarter impact expected to be around €55 million (2019: €30 million).

Our major capital investment projects are progressing according to plan. The €67 million capital investment
project to convert a containerboard machine at Steti (Czech Republic) to become fully dedicated to the
production of speciality kraft paper for shopping bag applications is scheduled to be commissioned during
the fourth quarter. This additional capacity (75,000 tonnes) further supports our retail customers in their
efforts to replace unnecessary plastic as they transition to more sustainable packaging solutions that
contribute to the circular economy.

During the period, we paid an interim dividend to shareholders amounting to €237 million. We also redeemed
our 3.375% €500 million Eurobond from available cash. There are no other material short-term debt
maturities. The Group’s financial position remains strong, with liquidity of around €970 million.

Outlook

The macro-economic outlook continues to be uncertain, however we are confident that the Group will
continue to demonstrate its resilience, while remaining well-positioned for when the recovery takes place.
Our confidence is underpinned by Mondi’s integrated high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, culture of
continuous improvement, portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions and the strategic flexibility offered by
our strong cash generation and financial position.

Mondi Group – Interim Dividends ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

This morning in our half-year results announcement we announced the Board
was pleased to resume the payment of dividends. The Board has declared a
dividend of 29.75 euro cents per ordinary share relating to the year ended 31
December 2019. In addition, the Board has declared an interim dividend of 19.00
euro cents per ordinary share for the year ending 31 December 2020.

Both dividends, amounting to a total of 48.75 euro cents per share, will be paid
as interim dividends on Tuesday 29 September 2020 to all Mondi plc ordinary
shareholders on either the UK main register or the South African branch register
on Friday 21 August 2020.

The same timetable will be followed for both.

Mondi plc will pay its dividends in euro. However, ordinary shareholders resident
in the United Kingdom will receive the dividends in sterling (unless shareholders
have elected to receive their dividend in euro). The last date for euro currency
elections will be Monday 7 September 2020. The exchange rate will be set on
Tuesday 15 September 2020.

Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register will
receive the dividends in South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1
to ZAR 20.80457. Therefore, the equivalent gross dividend relating to the year
ended 31 December 2019 in rand cents per ordinary share will be 618.93596 and
the equivalent gross 2020 interim dividend in rand cents per ordinary share will
be 395.28683.

For shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register, the
dividend will, for South African dividends tax purposes, be taxed like local
dividends. As such, for South African tax resident shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register, dividends withholding tax will be
withheld from the dividends payable to these shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net dividend
relating to the year ended 31 December 2019 of 495.14877 rand cents per
ordinary share and a net 2020 interim dividend of 316.22946 rand cents per
ordinary share. Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch
register who are not tax resident in South Africa are exempted from South
African dividends withholdings tax.

For the purposes of South Africa dividends tax reporting, the source of income
for the payment of the dividends is the United Kingdom.



Additional Information

The interim dividends will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi plc had a total of 485,553,780 ordinary shares in issue of which
135,556,939 were held on the branch register, excluding treasury shares, at the
dividend declaration date of 6 August 2020.

Andrew King, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""Mondi delivered a robust performance in the first half of 2020, with underlying EBITDA of €738 million. This reflects the
resilience of our business model, achieved despite starting the year with significantly lower average selling prices
across our key pulp and paper grades and the challenges brought by COVID-19.

We took decisive action in the early stages of the pandemic, moving quickly to safeguard our people, support our
communities and protect the profitability, liquidity and cash flow of the business while seeking to ensure we are well
placed to benefit when the recovery comes.

Sustainable packaging continues to be a long-term priority for our customers and wider society. As a leading producer
of both paper and flexible plastic-based packaging, we are in a unique position to support our customers’ environmental
goals with packaging that is sustainable by design adhering to our principle of paper where possible, plastic when
useful.

The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. Having delivered a robust trading performance in the
first half of the year and given our resilient business model and strong financial position, the Board has revisited the
decision taken in April to suspend the final 2019 dividend and is pleased to resume the payment of dividends.

The Board has declared a dividend of 29.75 euro cents per share relating to 2019. Together with the 2019 interim ordinary
dividend paid in September 2019, this results in a total dividend of 57.03 euro cents per share relating to the 2019
financial year, covered three times by 2019 underlying earnings per share. This is in line with our stated dividend policy
of targeting a cover range on average of two to three times underlying earnings over the business cycle. Furthermore,
the Board has declared a 2020 interim ordinary dividend of 19.00 euro cents per share, bringing the total dividend
declared to 48.75 euro cents per share.

Going into the second half of 2020, heightened macro-economic uncertainties remain. Pricing across our key pulp and
paper grades is below or in line with the average of the first half. Demand for packaging daily essentials remains robust
while we continue to see weakness in certain industrial end-uses. Uncoated fine paper order books have picked up from
the lows seen in the second quarter, albeit we do not expect a near-term recovery to pre-pandemic levels. We have
rescheduled planned mill maintenance shuts which will have an impact on the second half of the year.

We are confident that the Group will continue to demonstrate its resilience in the event of a prolonged macro-economic
downturn, while remaining well-positioned when the recovery takes place. This is underpinned by the Group's integrated
high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, culture of continuous improvement, portfolio of sustainable packaging
solutions and the strategic flexibility offered by our strong cash generation and financial position.

I firmly believe that our embedded safety culture was key in facilitating a fast and effective response to protect our
people, communities and business partners during this pandemic. I am incredibly proud of how our teams have risen to
the challenge and my thanks go to my colleagues for their endurance, enterprise and ongoing commitment.""



Dividend
The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. Having delivered a robust trading performance in the first half
of the year and given our resilient business model and strong financial position, the Board has revisited the decision taken in April
to suspend the final 2019 dividend and is pleased to resume the payment of dividends.

The Board has declared a dividend of 29.75 euro cents per share relating to 2019. Furthermore, the Board has declared a 2020
interim ordinary dividend of 19.00 euro cents per share. Both dividends, amounting to a total of 48.75 euro cents per share (total
of around €236 million), will be paid as interim dividends in accordance with the timetable shown below.

This decision is consistent with our stated cover policy, while ensuring we retain the optionality for further value accretive growth
provided by a strong financial position. Our dividend policy remains unchanged.

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of Logging Industries for the Year 2019

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2019 has been published in
accordance with the UK’s Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). This regulation implements the two EU
Directives in the UK, mandating annual reports by companies in the extractives and logging industries of their payments to governments in countries in which
they operate.

To read details of Mondi’s payments to governments go to www.mondigroup.com/en/corporate-governance/regulatory-reports

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our logging activities and specifically to the disclosure of payments to governments relating to the
logging of primary forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations definition of ‘primary forest’ being:

‘Naturally regenerated forest of native tree species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not
significantly disturbed’.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ‘IFL 2000’ (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute (WRI) and Transparent World) inventory of intact forests
has been used as the base for reporting on the harvesting of primary forests in the Komi Republic, Russia (‘Komi’).

Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi fall within the above definition of primary forests. Our operations in South Africa comprise plantation
forests that are not associated with any primary forests and therefore are excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation. In terms of the Russian Forestry Code and Mondi’s sustainable development policies all logged
areas are regenerated, either naturally or via planting where required, including tending and protection of the young forest stands for the next sustainable
forest cycle. During logging operations protected areas, High Conservation Value (HCV) areas and sensitive biotopes, comprising approximately 24% of the
area, are set aside for conservation.

Exchange rate
Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group’s reporting currency) are translated for this report using the average exchange rate during the
financial year to which it relates.

Further information

For further information regarding the Mondi Group’s approach to sustainably managing our forests, please refer to our Sustainable development report 2019
which can be found at www.mondigroup.com/sd19 and our sustainable forestry policy, one of our issue specific SD policies at

Annual General Meeting

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Mondi plc was held earlier today. In accordance with the arrangements announced on
9 April 2020, the AGM was held with the minimum quorum of two shareholders, facilitated by Mondi.

As notified to the market on 9 April 2020, the Board took the decision to no longer propose a final dividend for the year ended
31 December 2019. Resolution 4 was therefore withdrawn.

All resolutions were passed by shareholders by way of a poll and all valid proxy votes were included in the poll. The
Company's issued share capital on 5 May 2020 (the voting record date) was 485,553,780 ordinary shares of €0.20 each.
Overall approximately 76% of shares were voted. The total number of votes received on each resolution is as follows:

Protecting our people, communities and partners

the Group to play an important role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

All of our sites have implemented personal protection measures and intensified hygiene and social distancing
protocols that meet or exceed local and international guidelines, and, where possible, employees are working
remotely.

A multi-function response team closely monitors the latest developments, assessing risks, providing
guidance, and implementing preventative policies in line with individual government regulations and
recommendations in the countries in which we operate.

Trading update
The Group delivered a robust performance, in line with expectations, during the first quarter of 2020.
Underlying EBITDA of €385 million was 18% below the comparable prior year period (€471 million), driven
mainly by lower pricing across our key paper grades mitigated by lower input cost and our ongoing cost
reduction programmes. Underlying EBITDA was in line with the fourth quarter of 2019 (€381 million).

Our order books held up well in the first quarter, strengthening in consumer and e-commerce end-uses
across our packaging and Engineered Materials businesses as we continued to support our customers.
Towards the end of the quarter and into early April we saw a deterioration in our uncoated fine paper order
book in Europe and South Africa as the effects of the various lockdown measures took hold. We are taking
downtime at our Neusiedler mill (Austria) to manage our inventory levels, while we have temporarily stopped
production at the Merebank mill (South Africa; 270,000 tonnes of annual production capacity), in line with
government regulations. We will consider further such measures as required. In Flexible Packaging, while
we are seeing strength in a number of consumer related applications, particularly in food, beverage and
personal and home care, we are seeing somewhat weaker trading with our customers in building and
construction industries and a mixed picture in industrial and other end-uses.

With the exception of the temporary closure of the Merebank paper mill and temporary closures or other
production interruptions at a small number of our paper bags converting plants, all our facilities have been
in operation throughout the period. Similarly, to date supply chain issues have been manageable, although
we are seeing delays and increased costs in logistics.

The potential impacts of COVID-19 remain very unclear and the pace of change means any effect on
operations and the Group’s financial performance for the year are difficult to predict.
Update on capital expenditure, maintenance shuts schedule and cost mitigation measures
We have moved quickly to protect profitability, liquidity and cash flow while seeking to ensure we are well
placed to benefit when the recovery takes place. Furthermore, we have adjusted our near term priorities to
mitigate the health risks to our on-site employees.

We have postponed non-essential capital expenditure and slowed down some of our major capital projects,
thereby both reducing near term cash outflows and minimising contractors and other non-operating people
on our key sites. As a result, we now expect capital expenditure of around €600 million (previously €700-800
million) in 2020. This is likely to cause limited delays to the commissioning of certain of our capital investment
projects. We have also postponed annual mill maintenance shuts to the second half of the year.

Discretionary spend has been stopped and we continue to actively manage our cost base to mitigate any
impacts.

Strong financial position
Mondi has a strong balance sheet, sector leading investment grade credit ratings, good relationships with a
broad group of banks, and has recently demonstrated its access to the public bond markets with the
successful launch of a €750 million 8-year Eurobond. As at 31 December 2019, the net debt to underlying
EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, well below our single bank debt covenant of 3.5x net debt to underlying EBITDA
(excluding the impact of IFRS16 adjustments).

Mondi currently has a strong liquidity position of around €1.5 billion, comprising €705 million undrawn
committed debt facilities and cash of approximately €800 million, being principally the proceeds from the 8-
year Eurobond issued on 1 April 2020 and other cash in hand.

Our core banks have recently agreed to extend the maturity date of the €750 million Syndicated Revolving
Credit Facility from July 2021 to July 2022. The Group has a €500 million Eurobond maturing in September
2020; there are no other material maturities until 2024.

Dividend
Despite the Group’s strong balance sheet, the proactive measures it is taking to manage the current risks
and the robust trading position to date, it is clear that the operating and trading environment is one of
significantly heightened uncertainty. After due consideration, the Board has decided it is prudent to no longer
propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2019 at the forthcoming AGM.

The Board recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. While it is its intention to pay a dividend,
the Board will consider the appropriateness, quantum and timing of an additional interim dividend payment
relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 when it has a clearer view of the effects of COVID-
19 on the business and outlook.

Commenting on today’s announcement, Andrew King, Group CEO, said:

“Mondi is a resilient business offering packaging and other products for daily consumer needs, and delivering
essential services to the communities around its larger operations. We delivered a robust performance in the
first quarter and in this regard my thanks go to all our colleagues for their courage and commitment during
these challenging times. The Group is financially strong with a robust liquidity position and capital structure.
However, in these unprecedented times we are taking appropriate actions to ensure we remain well-placed
to withstand an extended period of uncertainty.”

Mondi Group - 2019 Final Ordinary Dividend ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

On 27 February 2020 Mondi Group announced, in its Preliminary Results
announcement, that a proposed final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31
December 2019 of 55.72 euro cents per ordinary share will be paid on Thursday
14 May 2020 to all Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on either the UK main
register or the South African branch register on Friday 3 April 2020.

The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the
annual general meeting scheduled for 7 May 2020.

Mondi plc will pay its dividend in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
final ordinary dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive
their dividend in euro). The last date for euro currency elections will be Tuesday
21 April 2020. The exchange rate for this payment will be set on Tuesday 28
April 2020.

Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register will
receive the final ordinary dividend in South African rand cents, converted at a
rate of EUR 1 to ZAR 16.77465. Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary
dividend in rand cents per ordinary share will be 934.68350.

For shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register, the
dividend will, for South African dividends tax purposes, be taxed like local
dividends. As such, for South African tax resident shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register, dividends withholding tax will be
withheld from the dividends payable to these shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net final ordinary
dividend of 747.74680 rand cents per ordinary share. Shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register who are not tax resident in South
Africa are exempted from South African dividends withholdings tax.
For the purposes of South Africa dividends tax reporting, the source of income
for the payment of the dividend is the United Kingdom.

Additional Information

The final ordinary dividend will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi plc had a total of 485,553,780 ordinary shares in issue of which
140,850,910 were held on the branch register, excluding treasury shares, at the
final ordinary dividend recommendation date of 27 February 2020.

Andrew King, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer designate, said:
""Mondi delivered a robust performance in 2019 against a backdrop of challenging trading conditions, with underlying
EBITDA of E1,658 million and ROCE of 19.8%. A solid operational performance, strong cost control and a good
contribution from acquisitions and capital investment projects, partially offset the effects of market pressures in a
number of key pulp and paper grades.

Our capital investment programme to deliver value accretive growth and enhance the ongoing cost competitiveness of
our operations remains on track. Having commissioned the pulp mill rebuild at our Ruzomberok mill (Slovakia) in the
second half of the year, we are making good progress on the related investment in a new 300,000 tonne kraft top white
machine at the same site and previously announced major capital investment projects at our Syktyvkar (Russia) and Steti
(Czech Republic) mills. Smaller expansionary projects underway at a number of our converting packaging operations will
further enhance our production capabilities and product offering to customers.

We completed the Simplification of our corporate structure from dual listed into a single holding company under Mondi
plc in July 2019, simplifying cash and dividend flows, increasing transparency, removing the complexity associated with
the previous structure and enhancing our strategic flexibility.

Offering sustainable packaging solutions has continued to be core to our strategy. With our unique product portfolio and
our EcoSolutions approach, we remain well positioned to support our customers in meeting their sustainability goals
with packaging that is sustainable by design - paper where possible, plastic when useful.

Looking ahead, we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging sectors in which we operate.
Heightened macro-economic uncertainties are likely to continue to affect markets in the short term and, while we are
seeing indications of stability in pricing in certain segments, we start the year with lower prices across our key paper
grades. Input cost relief, our ongoing profit improvement programmes and customer-centric innovation initiatives, and
the benefits from our capital expenditure pipeline will continue to support our performance.

With our robust business model, centred around our high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, our culture of
continuously driving performance and the strategic flexibility our strong cash generation and financial position bring, we
continue to look to the future with confidence.""



Dividend
The Board aims to offer shareholders long-term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three
times on average over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and confidence in the future of the business, the
Board has recommended an increase in the final ordinary dividend to 55.72 euro cents per share (2018: 54.55 euro cents per
share). The final ordinary dividend, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 27.28 euro cents per share, paid on
20 September 2019, amount to a total ordinary dividend for the year of 83.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 9% on the 2018
total ordinary dividend of 76.0 euro cents per share.
The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi plc at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for
7 May 2020 and, if approved, is payable on 14 May 2020 to shareholders on the register on 3 April 2020.
The proposed final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 December 2019 of 55.72 euro cents per share will be paid in
accordance with the following timetable:

Mondi investor site visit to Steti
World-class manufacturing and packaging solutions that are sustainable by design

Mondi is hosting an investor site visit today at our Steti operation in the Czech Republic. The day will include
a series of short presentations from senior executives, including a strategic update from Group CEO Peter
Oswald focusing on the role sustainability and digitalisation play in accelerating progress across the group's
strategic value drivers. Guests will hear about Mondi's approach to help our customers make the transition
to more sustainable packaging with innovative solutions using paper where possible, plastic when useful.
Mondi experts will present product case studies such as PerFORMing (recyclable food trays using up to
80% less plastic and reducing carbon footprint by 70%); DelightBox (lightweight 100% recycled
containerboard box replacing plastic bags); and recyclable consumer flexible solutions.

Guests will also visit our world-class, integrated cost-advantaged Steti pulp and paper mill, with capacity of
around 700ktpa. Since Mondi acquired the mill in 2000, production has increased by 50% and productivity
has more than doubled, while greenhouse gas emissions have been halved. The recently completed E376
million woodyard and mill infrastructure modernisation is delivering key benefits in scale, efficiency and
quality.

Mondi continues to deliver an industry leading performance. Sustainability is at the core of Mondi's strategy
to drive value-accretive growth, and we are well positioned as a leading packaging producer with innovation
capabilities across paper and plastics.

Mondi Group CEO Peter Oswald said, ""Mondi's industry leading margins and returns are a consequence of
our inherent competitive advantages. We are investing in our relationships, our assets with cost-advantage,
digitalisation and product development to drive growth sustainably into the future. Today we will remind
investors that Mondi has a long tradition of sustainable solutions and show how our teams are actively
engaging with key stakeholders to develop innovative products that are sustainable by design, prioritising
customer needs and the planet using our replace, reduce, recycle approach.""

Trading update 10 October 2019

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial position since the half
year ended 30 June 2019, based on management information up to 30 September 2019. These results have
not been audited or reviewed by Mondi's external auditors.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or transactions impacting either
the financial performance or financial position of the Group since 30 June 2019 up to the date of this
statement.

Group performance overview

As outlined in our half-year results, demand in the third quarter remained generally softer across the markets
in which we operate and prices for key paper grades were below those of the first half. Consequently,
underlying EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 was E383 million, down 18% on the comparable prior year
period (E466 million) and 9% below the second quarter of 2019 (E423 million). Lower average selling prices
from the highs reached towards the end of 2018 and into early 2019, coupled with the anticipated lower
forestry fair value gain, more than offset the benefits of our ongoing profit improvement initiatives.

Like-for-like sales volumes were, on average, marginally lower than the comparable prior year period as a
result of lower industrial bags and uncoated fine paper volumes; this was partly offset by growth in
corrugated packaging. On average, costs were higher than the comparable prior year period, although lower
than the previous quarter.

Planned mill maintenance shuts during the quarter had an estimated impact on underlying EBITDA of around
E40 million (2018: E30 million). Based on prevailing market prices, we continue to estimate that the impact
of planned mill maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA for 2019 will be around E150 million (2018: E110
million).

We continue to make good progress on our previously announced major capital investment projects at our
high-quality, cost-advantaged operations in central Europe.

Business unit overview

In Fibre Packaging, containerboard markets showed signs of stabilising during the quarter following the
sharp price erosion seen in the first half of the year. While average benchmark European containerboard
selling prices were lower than the previous quarter and significantly lower than the comparable prior year
period, the price movement during the period was limited. Corrugated packaging saw good volume growth
during the period and continues to benefit from an innovative product offering and lower input paper costs.

Sack kraft paper demand was generally weaker during the quarter, in particular in export markets, impacting
both pricing and volumes. Demand for speciality kraft paper remains good, supported by the drive to replace
plastic carrier bags with paper-based alternatives and increasing requirements for sustainable paper-based
flexible packaging. In line with expectations, price reductions in selected kraft paper grades became effective
at the beginning of the quarter, although pricing remained above 2018 levels. We have taken downtime at
certain operations in order to manage our inventory levels in response to softer demand. Industrial bags
volumes were lower than in the comparable prior year period, however we have seen an improvement in
order books over the past six weeks.

On 30 September 2019 we completed the sale of a specialised extrusion coated products plant in Duffel
(Belgium).

Consumer Packaging made steady progress, benefiting from product innovation and continuous
improvement initiatives. We are actively working with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to
find innovative solutions that improve the sustainability of plastic packaging, based on circular economy
principles, leveraging our product know-how and customer relationships across our packaging businesses.

In Uncoated Fine Paper, compared to the previous quarter, we saw lower average uncoated fine paper
prices, significantly lower pulp selling prices and, as anticipated, a materially lower forestry fair value gain.
Strong cost control and shorter planned maintenance shuts could only partly offset these pressures.

Outlook

As we entered the fourth quarter, prices were, on average, marginally below those of the third quarter. If
sustained, the impact of this lower pricing is expected to be largely offset by an easing of pressure on the
cost base, supported by our ongoing profit improvement initiatives.

The Group's robust business model, centred around our high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, our
portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions, clear strategic focus and culture of continuous improvement,
gives us confidence in continuing to deliver a strong and industry-leading performance.

Reorganisation of business segments

To further strengthen our value chain integration, enhance our offering in sustainable packaging solutions
and improve the way we partner with our customers, the Group will be organised across four business units:

   -   Corrugated Packaging, comprising the operations of containerboard and corrugated solutions. Mondi
       is the market leader in virgin containerboard in Europe and the third largest supplier of corrugated
       packaging in emerging Europe.
   -   Flexible Packaging, comprising kraft paper, paper bags and consumer flexible packaging operations.
       Mondi is a leading global flexible packaging provider with a strong focus on paper solutions.
   -   Engineered Materials, comprising personal care components, extrusion solutions and release liner
       operations. Engineered Materials brings together leading market positions in important specialised
       markets such as stretch, label and protective films as well as extrusion coating solutions in Europe.
       Additionally, Engineered Materials is the second largest commercial release liner player globally.
   -   Uncoated Fine Paper remains unchanged. Mondi is the market leader in both Europe and South
       Africa.

Restated segmental information will be published during the fourth quarter of 2019. The reorganisation has
no impact on the overall Group result.

Mondi Group - 2019 Interim Dividend euro/sterling Exchange Rate


Mondi announced on 1 August 2019 that Mondi plc will pay a dividend of 27.28
euro cents per ordinary share on Friday 20 September. The dividend will be paid
in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive their dividend in
euro). The last date for euro currency elections was 30 August 2019. It was
stated in the announcement on 1 August 2019 that the exchange rate for this
payment would be set today. Accordingly, it is confirmed that sterling dividend
payments will be converted at a rate of EUR 1 to GBP 0.90575. Therefore, the
equivalent interim dividend in pence per ordinary share will be 24.70886.

Mondi plc South African branch register shareholders will receive the dividend in
South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1 to ZAR 15.94694.
Therefore, the equivalent gross interim dividend in rand cents per ordinary share
will be 435.03252.

Information relating to the dividend tax applicable to Mondi plc South African
branch register shareholders can be found in the ZAR/euro exchange rate
announcement released by Mondi on 1 August 2019.

Mondi Group – 2019 Interim Dividend ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

On 1 August 2019 Mondi Group announced, in its Half-Yearly Results
announcement, that an interim dividend for the year ending 31 December 2019
of 27.28 euro cents per ordinary share will be paid on Friday 20 September 2019
to all Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on either the UK main register or the South
African branch register on Friday 16 August 2019.

Mondi plc will pay its dividend in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive their dividend in
euro). The last date for euro currency elections will be Friday 30 August 2019.
The exchange rate for this payment will be set on Wednesday 4 September
2019.

Shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register will
receive the dividend in South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1 to
ZAR 15.94694. Therefore, the equivalent gross interim dividend in rand cents per
ordinary share will be 435.03252.

For shareholders holding their shares on the South African branch register, the
dividend will, for South African dividends tax purposes, be taxed like local
dividends. As such, for South African tax resident shareholders holding their
shares on the South African branch register, dividends withholding tax will be
withheld from the dividends payable to these shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net dividend of
348.02602 rand cents per ordinary share. Shareholders holding their shares on
the South African branch register who are not tax resident in South Africa are
exempted from South African dividends withholdings tax.

For the purposes of South Africa dividends tax reporting, the source of income
for the payment of the dividend is the United Kingdom.
Additional Information

The interim dividend will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi plc had a total of 485,553,780 ordinary shares in issue of which
210,229,245 were held on the branch register, excluding treasury shares, at the
dividend declaration date of 1 August 2019.

Correction to DRIP settlement date

The DRIP purchase settlement date for shareholders on the South African
branch register, published in the dividend timetable contained within the Half-
Yearly Results announcement released on 1 August 2019, was incorrect. The
date is Friday 27 September 2019 and not Thursday 26 September 2019 as
originally advised.

Peter Oswald, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""Mondi delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2019 against a backdrop of increasingly challenging trading
conditions, with underlying EBITDA of €894 million, up 5% on the prior year comparable period. Higher average selling
prices, the contribution from capital investments and acquisitions, and a higher forestry fair value gain more than offset
the impact of planned maintenance shuts, lower volumes in certain segments and higher costs. Our initiatives to drive
sustainable performance and mitigate inflationary pressures on our cost base continue to deliver strongly.
Our capital investment programme to deliver value accretive growth and enhance the ongoing cost competitiveness of
our operations remains on track. The €335 million modernisation of our kraft paper facility in Steti (Czech Republic),
which started up in the fourth quarter of 2018, contributed to the strong performance in the period. We are also making
good progress on our previously announced major capital investment projects at our Ruzomberok (Slovakia), Syktyvkar
(Russia) and Steti mills and the smaller expansionary projects at a number of our packaging operations.
At the end of July 2019, we completed the Simplification of our corporate structure from a dual listed structure into a
single holding company structure under Mondi plc. We believe this will simplify cash and dividend flows, increase
transparency, remove the complexity associated with the previous structure and enhance strategic flexibility.
As a leading producer of both paper and plastic based packaging, we are in a unique position to support our customers'
sustainability goals with packaging that is sustainable by design - paper where possible, plastic when useful.
Going into the second half of 2019, ongoing macro-economic uncertainties continue to impact on the trading
environment. Demand is generally softer across the markets in which we operate, while prices for key paper grades are
currently below those of the first half. Furthermore, we expect a significantly lower forestry fair value gain in the second
half. Our relentless focus on continuous improvement is expected to lessen the impact of these pressures.
Underpinned by the Group's robust business model, centred around our high-quality, cost-advantaged asset base, our
portfolio of sustainable packaging solutions, clear strategic focus and culture of continuous improvement, we remain
confident of continuing to deliver a strong and industry-leading performance.""

Mondi Group: Trading Statement

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

Mondi is currently finalising its results for the half year ended 30 June 2019, which will be released on
1?August 2019. Mondi expects underlying EBITDA for the half year ended 30 June 2019 to be above that
of the comparable prior year period of €852 million.

Special item net charges after tax for the half year ended 30 June 2019 are expected to be around
€2?million. In the prior year, the Group recognised special item net charges after tax of €81 million.

Accordingly, Mondi advises that it expects earnings per share (EPS) for the half year ended 30 June 2019 to
be within the ranges shown below:

   -   basic underlying EPS (euro cents) 93 to 99 (2018: 89.2), an increase of between 4% and 11%

   -   basic EPS (euro cents) 93 to 99 (2018: 72.5), an increase of between 28% and 37%

   -   basic headline EPS (euro cents) 93 to 99 (2018: 85.1), an increase of between 9% and 16%

Mondi has disclosed basic underlying EPS, which is defined as basic EPS excluding the impact of special
items, as the directors believe this provides a useful additional measure of the Group's earnings performance
that is comparable from year to year. Mondi has disclosed basic EPS which includes the effect of special
items. The disclosure of basic headline EPS is mandated under the Listings Requirements of the JSE
Limited and has been calculated in accordance with Circular 4/2018 ‘Headline Earnings', as issued by the
South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

The above information has neither been reviewed nor audited by Mondi's auditors.

Notes:
1.   Mondi Limited Ordinary Shares may not be Dematerialised or rematerialised after the Scheme Last Day to Trade.
2.   From the first Trading Day after the Scheme Last Day to Trade and until Admission of the New Mondi plc Shares to the JSE on the first Trading
     Day after the Scheme Effective Time (being Monday, 29 July 2019), the permitted dealings reflect the expectation of the New Mondi plc Shares to
     be received pursuant to the Scheme, which will be issued on the Mondi plc SA Register. During this period, there cannot be any transfers of Mondi
     plc Ordinary Shares between the Mondi plc SA Register and the Mondi plc UK Register. Such dealings may also be limited or restricted by the rules
     of Strate, and the applicable mandate between a Mondi Limited Shareholder and its CSDP or Broker, as applicable from time to time, and are
     effected entirely at the Mondi Limited Shareholders' risk. Temporary Documents of Title will not be issued.
 South African securities transfer tax

 No South African securities transfer tax will be payable by Mondi Limited Shareholders on the transfer of,
 or in respect of the buyback of, the Mondi Limited Ordinary Shares or the issue of the New Mondi plc
 Shares, in each case pursuant to either the Transfer Option or the Buyback Option.

 South African dividends withholdings tax on the Buyback Option

 Where a Scheme Participant is not exempt from SA Dividends Tax (""DWT"") and elects the Buyback
 Option, DWT will arise on the Scheme Consideration. Unless a Scheme Participant is subject to DWT at a
 reduced rate, the applicable DWT withholding rate is presently 20%. The DWT is required to be paid to
 SARS by the regulated intermediary (being the Mondi Limited Shareholder's CSDP or Broker, for
 Dematerialised Shareholders, and Mondi Limited for Certificated Shareholders). In order to prevent (or
 reduce) such withholding, Scheme Participants electing the Buyback Option who are exempt from DWT
 (or subject to DWT at a reduced rate) must provide their regulated intermediary with the requisite SARS
 declaration and undertaking as soon as possible, but in any event before the Election Record Time (being
 12:00 p.m. (SA time) on Friday, 26 July 2019 (or such earlier date and/or time as may be required in terms
 of their mandate with their CSDP or Broker).

 Where a DWT withholding applies, the regulated intermediary will or may, amongst other things, (i) debit a
 Scheme Participant's account with the amount of the DWT, (ii) and/or withhold (and dispose of), from the
 Scheme Consideration due to a Scheme Participant, New Mondi plc Shares (or a beneficial entitlement
 thereto) to settle the DWT (and all taxes, withholdings, expenses, fees and commissions incurred in
 connection with such sale), in accordance with the agreements governing the relationship between a
 Scheme Participant and its CSDP or Broker. For the purposes of such withholding and disposal of the
 New Mondi plc Shares (or a beneficial entitlement thereto) forming part of the Scheme Consideration, for a
 Certificated Shareholder the number of New Mondi plc Shares (or a beneficial entitlement thereto)
 withheld from the Scheme Consideration due will be equal to such DWT rate percentage plus an additional
 5% and for Dematerialised Shareholders will be a number (which may exceed 20%) of the aggregate
 number of New Mondi plc Shares (or a beneficial entitlement thereto) to which such Dematerialised
 Shareholder is entitled, depending on the relevant CSDP and/or Broker. The withheld New Mondi plc
 Shares (or a beneficial entitlement thereto) may in whole or in part be sold together with other New Mondi
 plc Shares (or a beneficial entitlement thereto) withheld by the CSDP and/or Broker, and/or other CSDPs
 and/or Brokers and/or Mondi Limited and/or Mondi plc, in connection with DWT under the Scheme and, in
 such instance, the average price realised on such aggregated sale/s (less all taxes, withholdings,
 expenses, fees and commissions incurred in connection with such sale) will be applied to settle the DWT
 and the balance (if any) credited to the relevant Scheme Participant (it being anticipated that such sales
 and crediting will be complete within 10 Business Days after the admission of the New Mondi plc Shares to
 the JSE and commencement of dealings in the New Mondi plc Shares on the JSE).

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of Logging Industries for the Year 2018

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2018 has been published in
accordance with the UK's Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). This regulation implements the two EU
Directives in the UK, mandating annual reports by companies in the extractives and logging industries of their payments to governments in countries in which
they operate.

To read details of Mondi's payments to governments go to www.mondigroup.com/en/corporate-governance/regulatory-reports

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our logging activities and specifically to the disclosure of payments to governments relating to the
logging of primary forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations definition of ‘primary forest' being:

‘Naturally regenerated forest of native tree species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not
significantly disturbed'.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ‘IFL 2000' (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute (WRI) and Transparent World) inventory of intact forests
has been used as the base for reporting on the harvesting of primary forests in the Komi Republic, Russia (‘Komi').
Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi fall within the above definition of primary forests. Our operations in South Africa comprise plantation
forests that are not associated with any primary forests and therefore are excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation. In terms of the Russian Forestry Code and Mondi's sustainable development policies all logged
areas are naturally regenerated with supplementary plantings of spruce and pine where required to make up full populations of young trees for the next
sustainable forest cycle. During logging operations protected areas, High Conservation Areas (HCV) areas and sensitive biotopes, comprising approximately
24% of the area, are naturally set aside for conservation.

Exchange rate

Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group's reporting currency) are translated for this report using the average exchange rate during the
financial year to which it relates.

Further information

For further information regarding the Mondi Group's approach to sustainably managing our forests, please refer to our Sustainable development report 2018
which can be found at www.mondigroup.com/sd18 and our sustainable forestry policy, one of our issue specific SD policies at

The Annual General Meetings of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc were both held on 9 May 2019. Further to the announcement
made on 9 May 2019, where the boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc announced that the resolutions relating to the
simplification of the existing Mondi Group structure from the current dual listed company structure into a single holding
company structure under Mondi plc (the ""Simplification"") had been approved, the boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc
now advise shareholders of the detailed voting results on all of the specific resolutions proposed at the meetings. Overall in
excess of 72% of the total Group shares were voted. All resolutions were decided on a poll.

The resolutions considered at the Annual General Meetings consisted of resolutions regarding: (i) the usual business of the
annual general meetings of the Group (the ""AGM Resolutions""); (ii) Simplification (the ""Simplification Resolutions""); and
(iii) certain post-Simplification matters (the ""Post-Simplification Resolutions"").

AGM Resolutions
As required by the dual listed company structure, the AGM resolutions, being resolutions relating to the common business of
Mondi Limited and Mondi plc were treated as Joint Electorate Actions. The voting results of the Joint Electorate Actions are
identical and are as follows:

Mondi Group: Trading update 9 May 2019

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial position since the year
ended 31 December 2018, based on management information up to 31 March 2019 and estimated results
for April 2019. These results have not been audited or reviewed by Mondi's external auditors.

Reviewed results for the half-year ending 30 June 2019 will be published on 1 August 2019.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or transactions impacting either
the financial performance or financial position of the Group since 31 December 2018 up to the date of this
statement.

Group performance overview

The Group delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, driven by a combination of higher average
selling prices, a strong operational performance, the contribution from acquisitions and expansionary capital
expenditure projects completed in 2018, and lower planned maintenance shut costs. Underlying EBITDA for
the first quarter of €471 million was 16% above the comparable prior year period (€405 million), and 6% up
on the fourth quarter of 2018 (€446 million).

Like-for-like sales volumes were marginally lower than the comparable prior year period and higher than the
previous quarter. Selling prices for the Group's key paper grades were, on average, higher than the
comparable prior year period and stable on the previous quarter.

Costs were marginally higher than the comparable prior year period and flat on the previous quarter. Among
key input costs, wood, energy and chemical costs were higher than the comparable prior year period. The
notable exception was paper for recycling costs, where, as a result of changes to Chinese import policies,
average benchmark European prices were down 24% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Cash fixed
costs were marginally higher than the prior year, largely as a result of inflationary cost pressures, mitigated
by our cost containment initiatives.

Currency movements had a net neutral impact on underlying EBITDA versus the comparable prior year
period, as the effects of weaker Russian rouble and Turkish lira were offset by a stronger US dollar and
weaker South African rand relative to the euro. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, currency
movements had a small net positive impact mainly as a result of the stronger Russian rouble relative to the
euro.

The estimated impact on underlying EBITDA of maintenance shuts completed during the period was around
€15 million (2018: €35 million). Based on prevailing market prices, we estimate that the impact of
maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA for 2019 will be around €150 million (2018: €110 million), in line
with our previous estimate, of which around €90 million will be incurred in the first half of the year (H1 2018:
€55 million).

Business unit overview

Fibre Packaging benefited from higher average kraft paper selling prices following price increases
implemented through the second half of 2018 and early 2019. Price reductions were seen in containerboard
during the period, which continued into the second quarter. The magnitude varies by grade, with limited
reductions seen in semi-chemical fluting and white-top kraftliner.

Corrugated Packaging and Industrial Bags benefited from higher selling prices versus the comparable prior
year period. Volumes in Corrugated Packaging were up in Europe year-on-year, offset by weaker volumes
in Turkey and Russia. Like-for-like volumes in Industrial Bags were down, due to a combination of pricing
discipline and weakness in selected regional markets.

In Consumer Packaging, we saw further improvement in the subsegment of consumer goods packaging
as it benefits from a restructured plant network and continuous improvement initiatives. As anticipated, we
have also seen a stabilising of performance in personal care components, which has been under pressure
from declining volumes. We continue to work actively with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders
to develop fully recyclable plastic-based packaging and solutions with increased recycled plastic content.

Uncoated Fine Paper continues to perform strongly, with higher average selling prices on the prior year
period more than offsetting higher costs and modestly lower volumes. Prices were, on average, stable on
the previous period.

Capital investment projects

The €335 million modernisation project at our Steti mill (Czech Republic), commissioned in the fourth quarter
of 2018, is operating according to plan. We are also making good progress on our previously announced
major capital investment projects at our Ruzomberok (Slovakia), Syktyvkar (Russia) and Steti mills and the
smaller expansionary projects at a number of our packaging operations.

Cash flow and financing activities

Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows related to our capital
expenditure programme and financing activities, resulting in reduction in net debt during the quarter.

Net finance costs were slightly higher than the comparable prior year, as the benefit from a lower effective
interest rate was offset by higher average net debt during the period.

There have been no significant changes in the Group's borrowing facilities since 31 December 2018.

Outlook

We have positioned the Group to benefit from the key industry trends of sustainability, e-commerce and
enhancing our customers' brand value. While macro-economic uncertainties remain, our focus on delivering
value accretive growth and our performance-driven culture means we are confident of continuing to deliver
a strong and industry leading performance.

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its final ordinary dividend in South African rand cents. The
applicable exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 15.90343.

Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary dividend in rand cents per ordinary

Proposed Simplification of corporate structure: publication of Prospectus and Shareholder documentation

On 19 November 2018, the boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc announced a proposal to simplify the existing
Mondi Group structure from the current dual listed company structure into a single holding company structure under
Mondi plc.

In summary, the proposed simplification will be implemented by way of a South African scheme of arrangement
proposed by the Mondi Limited board between Mondi Limited and the Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders, whereby
Mondi plc will become the holder of all the Mondi Limited ordinary shares (the ""Scheme""), and by other related
actions for the termination of the dual listed company arrangements (the ""Simplification""). Pursuant to the Scheme,
Mondi Limited shareholders will receive one new Mondi plc ordinary share in exchange for each Mondi Limited
ordinary share held.

Following the Simplification, and the resulting exchange of each Mondi Limited ordinary share for a new Mondi plc
ordinary share, each Mondi plc shareholder will have the same voting and capital interests in the Mondi Group as
each Mondi plc ordinary shareholder and Mondi Limited ordinary shareholder currently has.

The Simplification will simplify cash and dividend flows, increase transparency, remove the complexity associated
with the current structure and enhance strategic flexibility. The Simplification will also facilitate continued investment
in the South African operations, estimated at over 8 billion rand over the next five years, including the ongoing
investment in forestry assets and modernisation of the Mondi Group's pulp, containerboard and paper assets in the
country.

Mondi plc will continue to have a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (""LSE"") and will have an inward
secondary listing on the JSE Limited (""JSE"") quoted in rand. Mondi plc shares will continue to be included in the
FTSE 100 index. Today Mondi Limited shares are not eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. Following the
issue of Mondi plc ordinary shares in exchange for Mondi Limited ordinary shares as a result of the Simplification, it is
expected that Mondi plc's weighting in the FTSE 100 index will increase. Mondi plc shares are expected to continue
to be eligible for inclusion in the key JSE indices.

Publication of Prospectus and Shareholder Documentation

Mondi Limited and Mondi plc have today published a combined shareholder circular to Mondi Limited shareholders
which sets out, amongst other things, the full terms and conditions of the Scheme (the ""Scheme Circular"") as well as
notice of the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited (the ""Mondi Limited AGM"") (the ""Mondi Limited AGM Notice"")
(at which, alongside the usual business of the Annual General Meeting, approval for the Scheme and the
Simplification will be sought from Mondi Limited shareholders), together with the actions to be taken by Mondi Limited
shareholders.
Mondi plc has today published a shareholder circular to Mondi plc shareholders which sets out further information in
relation to the Simplification (the ""Mondi plc Circular""), as well as notice of the Annual General Meeting of Mondi plc
(at which, alongside the usual business of the Annual General Meeting, approval for the Simplification will be sought
from Mondi plc shareholders), together with the actions to be taken by Mondi plc shareholders.

In addition, Mondi plc has today published a prospectus in relation to the proposed listing of the new Mondi plc
ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange, which shares will also be listed and traded on the JSE
(the ""Prospectus""). The Prospectus has been approved by the UK Financial Conduct Authority.

The Scheme Circular, the Mondi plc Circular and the Prospectus are available on the Mondi Group website
(www.mondigroup.com). A copy of the Prospectus and the Mondi plc Circular will also be submitted to the National
Storage Mechanism and will be available in due course for inspection at www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/NSM.

Certain information relating to the Simplification and the Scheme has been set out below; however, please refer to
the Scheme Circular, the Mondi plc Circular and the Prospectus for full details on these and other matters.

Further information in relation to the Simplification and the Scheme

    -   The Scheme

         The Simplification will include a scheme of arrangement proposed by the Mondi Limited board between
         Mondi Limited and the Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders, in terms of section 114 of the South African
         Companies Act, 71 of 2008 (the ""SA Companies Act"") which, if implemented, will result in:

          1.    Mondi plc acquiring all of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares held by scheme participants for the
                scheme consideration (being the issue by Mondi plc of one new Mondi plc ordinary share for each
                Mondi Limited ordinary share so acquired) (the ""Transfer Option"");

          2.    alternatively, if and to the extent so elected by the scheme participants and subject to statutory
                requirements under the SA Companies Act, Mondi Limited purchasing from such scheme participants
                their Mondi Limited ordinary shares for the scheme consideration (being the issue by Mondi plc of
                one new Mondi plc ordinary share for each Mondi Limited ordinary share bought back) and, in such
                instance, for each such Mondi Limited ordinary share bought back by Mondi Limited, Mondi Limited
                allotting and issuing to Mondi plc one new Mondi Limited ordinary share (the ""Buyback Option""),
         in each such case subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme as further set out in Part V of the
         Scheme Circular.

    -   Conditions to the Simplification

         The implementation of the Scheme and, in turn, the Simplification, will be subject to the fulfilment, or, if
         applicable, waiver (in whole or in part), on or before 31 December 2019 or such later date/s as Mondi Limited
         and Mondi plc agree in writing from time to time (the ""Longstop Date""), of the following scheme conditions:

          1.    the resolutions proposed to approve the Simplification as set out at resolutions 32 to 37 in the Mondi
                Limited AGM Notice and the Mondi plc AGM Notice (the ""Simplification Resolutions"") are declared
                adopted by the requisite shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc;

          2.    the special resolution of Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders required to give effect to and implement
                the Scheme as set out in resolution 38 of the Mondi Limited AGM Notice (the ""Scheme Resolution"")
                is declared adopted by the requisite shareholders of Mondi Limited, which resolution is a special
                resolution approving the Scheme pursuant to section 115(2)(a) of the SA Companies Act, and in the
                event of the provisions of section 115(2)(c) of the SA Companies Act becoming applicable: (i) the
                High Court of South Africa approves the Scheme; and (ii) if applicable, Mondi Limited not treating the
                Scheme Resolution as a nullity as contemplated in section 115(5)(b) of the SA Companies Act;

          3.    all regulatory consents (being (i) the issue by the South African Takeover Regulation Panel of a
                compliance certificate with respect to the Scheme in terms of section 119(4)(b) of the SA Companies
                Act; and (ii) the approval of, or confirmation of no jurisdiction in respect of, the South African and
                Moroccan competition authorities under the relevant South African and Moroccan competition
            legislation) are received on an unconditional basis, or to the extent that any such regulatory consents
            are subject to any obligation, undertaking, condition or qualification, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc
            confirm in writing to each other that the obligation, undertaking, condition or qualification is
            acceptable to them;

      4.    with regard to Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders exercising their appraisal rights under section
            164 of the SA Companies Act (if any), either: (i) Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders give notice
            objecting to the Scheme as contemplated in section 164(3) of the SA Companies Act and vote
            against the Scheme at the Mondi Limited AGM in respect of less than or equal to 5% of all of the
            Mondi Limited ordinary shares; or (ii) if Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders give notice objecting to
            the Scheme and vote against the Scheme at the Mondi Limited AGM in respect of more than 5% of
            all of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares, then, within the time period permitted in terms of the SA
            Companies Act, dissenting shareholders have exercised appraisal rights, by giving valid demands in
            terms of sections 164(5) to 164(8) of the SA Companies Act, in respect of less than or equal to 5% of
            all the Mondi Limited ordinary shares, or not at all; provided that this Scheme condition will not fail
            unless and until Mondi Limited or Mondi plc give the other written notice that not all of the Scheme
            conditions have been fulfilled or waived on or before the Longstop Date;

      5.    the amendments to the existing Mondi Limited Memorandum of Incorporation approved as part of the
            Simplification Resolutions are filed with, and accepted by, the South African Companies and
            Intellectual Property Commission;

      6.    the JSE and the LSE have given in principle approval to admit the new Mondi plc ordinary shares to
            be issued under the Scheme to trading and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the ""FCA"") has
            given in principle approval to admit the new Mondi plc ordinary shares to the official list of the FCA
            (""UK official list""), each such approval being on terms and/or conditions satisfactory to Mondi Limited
            and Mondi plc, or Mondi Limited and Mondi plc otherwise being satisfied that such new Mondi plc
            ordinary shares have been or will be admitted to trading on the JSE and LSE and admitted to the UK
            official list on or before the first trading day after the date and time upon which the Scheme becomes
            effective (the ""Scheme Effective Time"") following it becoming unconditional in accordance with its
            terms; and

      7.    notice being given by either Mondi Limited to Mondi plc or vice versa specifying the date and time on
            which the Mondi Limited DLC Shares and the Mondi plc DLC Shares (each as defined below) will be
            converted into deferred shares (the ""Simplification Notice""). (In terms of the Simplification, the date
            and time set in this notice will be immediately before the Scheme Effective Time.).

     All of the Scheme conditions are for the benefit of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc. The Scheme conditions in
     3, 4 and 5 above may be waived, in whole or in part, by written agreement between Mondi Limited and Mondi
     plc on or before the date for fulfilment of such Scheme conditions; provided that Mondi Limited and Mondi plc
     will not be entitled to waive the requirement for the issue by the South African Takeover Regulation Panel of
     a compliance certificate without the prior written consent of the Takeover Regulation Panel. The Scheme
     conditions in 1, 2, 6 and 7 above may be waived, in whole or in part, by written agreement between Mondi
     Limited and Mondi plc on or before the date for fulfilment of such Scheme conditions but only to the extent
     that such waiver results in an outcome which is not materially adversely different to the position which would
     have prevailed had such Scheme condition been wholly fulfilled.

     The dates and times for the fulfilment or waiver of any one or more of the Scheme conditions may be
     extended by written agreement between Mondi Limited and Mondi plc from time to time.

     The Scheme will be unconditional for all purposes upon the issue on SENS of the finalisation announcement
     jointly approved by Mondi Limited and Mondi plc to the effect that the Scheme has become unconditional in
     accordance with its terms.

-   Termination events

     The Scheme will terminate and the Scheme Resolution will be treated as a nullity:

      1.    upon written notice from either Mondi Limited to Mondi plc, or Mondi plc to Mondi Limited, if not all
            the Scheme Conditions have been fulfilled or waived, on or before the relevant date/s for fulfilment or
            waiver; or
      2.     by written agreement between Mondi Limited and Mondi plc to such effect.

     Neither Mondi Limited nor Mondi plc will be entitled to terminate or otherwise cancel the Scheme on or prior
     to the last day to trade Mondi Limited ordinary shares on the JSE in order to be recorded in the Mondi
     Limited register at the Scheme record time (which is presently indicatively expected to be at 5:00 p.m. (SA
     time) on Tuesday, 25 June 2019) (the ""Scheme Last Day to Trade""), other than as set out above.

     Neither Mondi Limited nor Mondi plc shall be entitled to terminate or otherwise cancel the Scheme after the
     Scheme Last Day to Trade.

-   The new Mondi plc ordinary shares to be issued under the Scheme

     Applications will be made to: (i) the FCA for the new Mondi plc ordinary shares to be admitted to the premium
     listing segment of the UK official list; (ii) the LSE for the new Mondi plc ordinary shares to be admitted to
     trading on its main market for listed securities; and (iii) the JSE for the new Mondi plc ordinary shares to be
     admitted to listing and trading on the main board of the JSE for listed securities.

-   Suspension and termination of Mondi Limited listing

     Subject to the Scheme becoming unconditional in accordance with its terms, the suspension of the listing on
     the JSE of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares will take place at the commencement of trading on the first
     trading day after the Scheme Last Day to Trade.

     The listing of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares on the JSE will be cancelled with effect from the
     commencement of trading on the first trading day after the Scheme Effective Time. It is expected that
     admission will become effective and that dealings in the new Mondi plc ordinary shares on the JSE will
     commence at 9:00 a.m. (SA time) and dealings in the new Mondi plc ordinary shares on the LSE will
     commence at 8:00 a.m. (UK time) in each case on the first trading day after the Scheme Effective Time.

-   Conversion of the Mondi plc DLC Shares and the Mondi Limited DLC Shares to deferred shares and
     cancellation and/or surrender of all deferred shares

     Subject to the passing of the Simplification Resolutions and the Scheme Resolution, and such resolutions
     becoming effective:

      1.     the existing Mondi plc Articles of Association will be amended to provide for the Mondi plc Special
             Converting Shares, Mondi plc Special Rights Shares, Mondi plc Special Voting Share, Mondi plc UK
             DAN Share and Mondi plc UK DAS Share (the ""Mondi plc DLC Shares"") to be automatically
             converted to deferred shares of Mondi plc at such time as specified in the Simplification Notice, being
             immediately prior to the Scheme Effective Time;

      2.     the existing Mondi Limited Memorandum of Incorporation will be amended to provide for (i) the
             creation of (a) deferred shares in Mondi Limited and (b) redeemable no par value non-voting shares
             in Mondi Limited (the ""Non-Voting Shares""); and (ii) the Mondi Limited Special Converting Shares,
             Mondi Limited Special Rights Shares and Mondi Limited SA DAN Share (the ""Mondi Limited DLC
             Shares"") to be automatically converted to deferred shares in Mondi Limited at such time as specified
             in the Simplification Notice, being immediately prior to the Scheme Effective Time;

      3.     the deferred shares in Mondi plc then in issue (including the deferred shares arising from the
             conversion of the Mondi plc DLC Shares) will be cancelled at the Scheme Effective Time; and

      4.     the deferred shares in Mondi Limited then in issue (being the deferred shares arising from the
             conversion of the Mondi Limited DLC Shares) will be cancelled and/or surrendered at the Scheme
             Effective Time.

-   Mondi Limited SA DAS Share and Non-Voting Shares

       The Mondi Limited SA DAS Share will remain in place and continue to be held by Mondi SSC (SA)
       (Proprietary) Limited following the Simplification becoming effective and the preferences, rights, limitations
        and other terms of the Mondi Limited SA DAS Share will not be amended in any way. The Mondi Limited SA
        DAS Share will continue to allow dividends to be paid from Mondi Limited to Mondi plc ordinary shareholders
        who are resident in South Africa.

        At the Scheme Effective Time so as to ensure that Mondi plc will, following the Simplification, hold the
        majority of each of Mondi Limited's voting and non-voting share capital, Mondi Limited will issue nine Non-
        Voting Shares to Mondi plc for an aggregate amount of nine rand.




Funding of the Scheme consideration

Mondi plc has confirmed to the Mondi Limited board that, subject to the Simplification Resolutions being passed, that
it has the necessary authority to issue such new Mondi plc ordinary shares.

Pro forma financial information

Mondi Limited and Mondi plc operate under a dual listed company structure. Mondi Limited and Mondi plc currently
prepare and report combined and consolidated financial information and statements that incorporate the combined
assets and activities of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc. All public disclosures and interactions with the market in
relation to the financial position and performance of the Mondi Group are based on the combined and consolidated
accounts of the Mondi Group.

The Simplification would combine these assets and activities under Mondi plc, but would have no impact on the total
assets, total liabilities and total ordinary equity interests of the Mondi Group. The Simplification will also result in no
significant change to the basis of preparation of the financial statements or the accounting policies applied. There
would be different allocations to the capital and reserves in the consolidated accounts (as the Simplification will result
in only one class of ordinary shares). In particular, given Mondi Limited will become a subsidiary of the Mondi Group,
Mondi Limited share capital will be eliminated on consolidation and, in consequence, the consolidated financial
statements of the Mondi Group will only reflect Mondi plc share capital and a capital redemption reserve, which
arises on the cancellation of the deferred shares. The difference between the nominal value of the new shares issued
by Mondi plc and Mondi Limited stated capital recorded within the Mondi Group equity immediately prior to the
Simplification will be recognised in a merger reserve within equity. The only expected impact of the Simplification on
the reported profits or equity of the Mondi Group are certain one-off expenses relating to transaction costs, advisory
fees and transfer taxes of between €20 to €22 million, of which around €15 million are contingent on the successful
implementation of the Simplification. Save for these one-off items, the Simplification is not expected to have any
other impact on the reported profits or equity of the business. The above summary of accounting implications
assumes that the appraisal rights process is not invoked.

Given the above, no pro forma financial information in relation to the Simplification has been presented.

Taxation

No South African securities transfer tax will be payable by Mondi Limited shareholders on the transfer of the Mondi
Limited ordinary shares or the issue of the new Mondi plc ordinary shares, in each case pursuant to either the
Transfer Option or the Buyback Option.

Certain other South African, United Kingdom and United States tax consequences of the Simplification and the
subsequent holding and disposal of Mondi plc shares for certain Mondi Limited shareholders and Mondi plc
shareholders are detailed in the Scheme Circular, the Mondi plc Circular and the Prospectus.

Beneficial interests in Mondi Limited

Where required under the SA Companies Act and/or the JSE's Listings Requirements, the Mondi Limited ordinary
shares and/or the Mondi plc ordinary shares held by the Mondi Incentive Schemes Trust (master's reference
IT 869/2008), the Mondi Employee Share Trust and the directors of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shall not be voted
and/or, if voted, shall not be taken into account when determining whether the requisite voting approval has been
obtained for the resolutions at the Mondi Limited AGM (including the Simplification Resolutions and the Scheme
Resolution).
The directors of Mondi plc (and Mondi Limited) and the Mondi Employee Share Trust collectively hold beneficial
interests in 1,328,243 ordinary shares of Mondi plc (and thus a beneficial interest in an equivalent number of Mondi
Limited Special Converting Shares) and in 19,612 ordinary shares of Mondi Limited. The Mondi Incentive Schemes
Trust holds 262,658 ordinary shares of Mondi Limited.

Responsibility statements

Mondi Limited Board, consisting of all of the independent non-executive directors of Mondi Limited (being Fred
Phaswana, David Williams, Dominique Reiniche, Stephen Harris, Tanya Fratto and Stephen Young), constituted in
accordance with the Companies Regulations, 2011 (the ""Independent Board"").

Notes:
1.   All dates and times in respect of the Simplification and the Scheme are subject to change (subject to the approval of the JSE and/or the TRP, if
     required). The dates have been determined based on certain assumptions, including as regards the date by which certain regulatory approvals will
     have been obtained and that no Court approval of the special resolutions required to approve the implementation of the Scheme will be required,
     and the dates and times stated above will change if such circumstances change. Any change in the dates and times will be released on SENS, RIS
     and published in the South African press.
2.   Mondi Limited Shareholders should note that, as transactions in Mondi Limited Ordinary Shares are settled in the electronic settlement system used
     by Strate, settlement of trades takes place three Business Days after such trade. Therefore, Mondi Limited Shareholders who acquire Mondi
     Limited Ordinary Shares on the JSE after the last day to trade in Mondi Limited Ordinary Shares so as to be recorded in the Mondi Limited Register
     on the Voting Record Time will not be entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited.
3.   Mondi Limited Ordinary Shares may not be Dematerialised or rematerialised after the Scheme Last Day to Trade, which is presently indicatively
     expected to be Tuesday, 25 June 2019.
4.   If the Scheme is approved by an insufficient number of Mondi Limited Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited so that a
     Mondi Limited Shareholder may require Mondi Limited to obtain Court approval of the Scheme, as contemplated in section 115(3)(a) of the SA
     Companies Act, and a Mondi Limited Shareholder in fact delivers such a request, the dates and times set out above will not be relevant. If this is
     the case, Mondi Limited Shareholders will be notified separately of the applicable dates and times under this process.
5.   If any Mondi Limited Shareholder who votes against the Scheme exercises its rights in accordance with section 115(3)(b) of the SA Companies Act
     and applies to Court for a review of the transaction, the dates and times set out above will not be relevant. If this is the case, Mondi Limited
     Shareholders will be notified separately of the applicable dates and times under this process.
6.   It should be noted that although Mondi Limited intends to send the required notice to Dissenting Shareholders, if any, in terms of section 164(4) of
     the SA Companies Act on the first Business Day following the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited, the last day for sending this notice is 10
     Business Days after the date of the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited.
7.   If the Annual General Meeting of Mondi Limited is adjourned or postponed, Forms of Proxy submitted for the initial Annual General Meeting will
     remain valid in respect of any adjournment or postponement of the Annual General Meeting, and the dates and times stated above will change.
8.   Although the salient dates and times are stated to be subject to change, such statement may not be regarded as consent or dispensation for any
     change to time periods which may be required in terms of the Takeover Regulations, where applicable, and any such consents or dispensations
     must be specifically applied for and granted.
9.   From the first Trading Day after the Scheme Last Day to Trade and until admission of the New Mondi plc Shares to the JSE on the first Trading Day
     after the Scheme Effective Time (presently indicatively expected to be Monday, 1 July 2019), the permitted dealings reflect the expectation of the
     New Mondi plc Shares to be received pursuant to the Scheme, which will be issued on the Mondi plc SA Register. During this period, there cannot
     be any transfers of Mondi plc Ordinary Shares between the Mondi plc SA Register and the Mondi plc UK Register. Such dealings may also be
     limited or restricted by the rules of Strate, and the applicable mandate between a Mondi Limited Shareholder and its CSDP or Broker, as applicable
     from time to time, and are effected entirely at the Mondi Limited Shareholders' risk. Temporary Documents of Title will not be issued.

Mondi Group – 2018 Final Ordinary Dividend ZAR/Euro Exchange Rate

On 28 February 2019 Mondi Group announced, in its Preliminary Results
announcement, that a proposed final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31
December 2018 of 54.55 euro cents per ordinary share will be paid on 16 May
2019 to all Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on the relevant
registers on 12 April 2019.

The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of
Mondi Limited and Mondi plc at the respective annual general meetings
scheduled for 9 May 2019.

Mondi Limited and Mondi plc will pay their respective dividends as follows:

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its final ordinary dividend in South African rand cents. The
applicable exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 15.90343.
Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary dividend in rand cents per ordinary
share will be 867.53211. Dividend tax will be withheld from Mondi Limited
shareholders at a rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption,
resulting in a net final ordinary dividend of 694.02569 rand cents per ordinary
share.

Mondi plc

Mondi plc will pay its final ordinary dividend in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
final ordinary dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive
their dividends in euro). The last date for euro currency elections will be 12 April
2019. The exchange rate for this payment will be set on 30 April 2019.

In addition, Mondi plc South African branch register shareholders will receive the
final ordinary dividend in South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1
to ZAR 15.90343. Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary dividend in rand
cents per ordinary share will be 867.53211. Dividend tax will be withheld from
Mondi plc South African branch register shareholders at a rate of 20%, unless a
shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net final ordinary dividend of
694.02569 rand cents per ordinary share.

Additional Information

The final ordinary dividends will be paid from income reserves.

Mondi Limited had a total of 118,312,975 ordinary shares in issue and Mondi plc
367,240,805 ordinary shares in issue of which 114,128,350 were held on the

Peter Oswald, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""Mondi delivered a strong performance in 2018, with underlying EBITDA up 19% to EUR1,764 million. We benefited from good demand 
across our fibre packaging businesses, higher average selling prices and the contribution from our recent acquisitions. I am 
particularly pleased to report on a robust operating performance, delivering productivity gains and strong cost containment, 
mitigating the inflationary pressures on our cost base.

We continue to make good progress in delivering value accretive growth and enhancing the ongoing cost competitiveness of our 
operations through our capital expenditure programme. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we successfully started up the EUR335 million 
modernisation of our kraft paper facility in Steti and we received the final permits to proceed with our investment in a 300,000 tonne 
kraft top white machine at our Ruzomberok mill (Slovakia), while work to upgrade the pulp mill at the same site is progressing well. 
Expansionary capital expenditure projects at a number of our packaging operations and the integration of acquisitions completed in the 
year will further enhance our production capabilities and product offering to customers.

In November 2018, we announced a proposal to simplify our dual listed structure into a single holding company structure under Mondi plc, 
which we believe will streamline cash and dividend flows, enhance our strategic flexibility, increase transparency and remove the complexity 
associated with the current structure.

Looking ahead, while there are macro-economic uncertainties, we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging sectors 
in which we operate. Pricing is mixed going into 2019, with recent price reductions in containerboard grades and market pulp and stronger 
pricing in our kraft paper markets. During 2019, we are planning longer maintenance and project related shuts, while looking forward to the 
incremental contribution from recently completed major capital projects and acquisitions.

Mondi is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable packaging solutions. With our robust business model, strong balance sheet, focus on
leveraging key industry trends of sustainability, e-commerce and enhancing brand value, and culture of continuously driving performance,
we continue to look to the future with confidence.""

Group performance review
2018 was a successful year for the Group. We delivered strong results, building on our track record of value accretive growth,
which is testament to our consistent and focused strategy, robust business model, integrated approach to sustainability and firm
commitment to drive performance.

Group revenue of EUR7,481 million was up 5% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, revenue was
up 4%, mainly due to higher average selling prices achieved across all our businesses. We saw volume growth in Fibre Packaging,
driven by the benefit of previously completed capital investment projects, operational improvements and strong organic volume
growth in Industrial Bags. Consumer Packaging volumes were impacted by our targeted approach to exit lower margin business
and a decline in volumes in personal care components. While core product volumes in the Uncoated Fine Paper business were up
year-on-year, market pulp and newsprint volumes were negatively impacted, respectively, by the extended shut at our Richards
Bay mill (South Africa) and the strategic decision taken in the prior year to exit the newsprint market in South Africa.

Underlying EBITDA of EUR1,764 million was up 19% on the prior year, with strong contributions from Fibre Packaging and Uncoated
Fine Paper. A combination of higher selling prices, strong operational performance, the contribution from acquisitions and the
benefits of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives more than offset higher variable and fixed costs and negative currency effects.

Our passion for performance is central to the way we run our business - from our focus on commercial excellence and lean
processes, to rigorous quality management and operational excellence programmes that enhance productivity and efficiency. We
invest in our existing operations and, where appropriate, in acquisitions. We aim to acquire businesses that produce high-quality
products with sustainable competitive advantage and the potential to achieve world-class operating standards. This enables us to
generate synergies through integration, enhance our product and service offering and/or extend our geographic reach to better
serve our customers.

We are pleased that the need for sustainable packaging has moved sharply into focus. We are uniquely positioned, as a
manufacturer of paper, but also flexible plastic packaging, to create the best solutions for forward-thinking, consumer brands in
collaboration with sustainable materials suppliers and recyclers. Our paper and flexible plastic packaging solutions regularly win
awards, but commercial demand for some of our most innovative sustainable packaging was limited before 2018. The public focus
on the impact of plastic waste is changing that. This momentum gives us an important opportunity to lead our industry with
innovative, sustainable paper and plastic packaging solutions. By taking a holistic view, we can develop packaging that considers
the needs of customers, their products and the planet.

In June 2018, we completed the acquisition of Powerflute (Finland), an integrated pulp and paper mill with a production capacity of
285,000 tonnes per annum of high-performance semi-chemical fluting, for a total consideration of EUR365 million on a debt and cash-
free basis. The integration is progressing well and further broadens our containerboard product range and geographic reach. We
also completed two industrial bag plant acquisitions in Egypt bolstering our presence in the fast growing Middle East industrial bag
market, enabling us to better serve our customers in the region. In June 2018, we completed the sale of a flat sack kraft paper mill
in Pine Bluff, Arkansas (US), with 130,000 tonnes of annual production capacity.

The impact of maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA in 2018 was around EUR110 million (2017: EUR95 million). Based on prevailing
market prices, we estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA in 2019 will be around EUR150 million, 
of which the first half year effect is estimated at around EUR90 million (2018: EUR55 million). This includes an extended maintenance 
shut planned at our large Syktyvkar mill (Russia) in the second quarter and a project related shut at our Ruzomberok mill in the second half.

Input costs were generally higher than the prior year period, mitigated by our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Wood costs were
generally higher in local currency terms. Strong wood cost inflation was seen in northern and certain central European markets,
while wood costs were lower in Poland and the Czech Republic driven by favourable regional wood supply dynamics. Energy and
chemical costs were up year-on-year mainly due to higher crude oil and gas prices. Caused mainly by Chinese import policies,
average benchmark paper for recycling costs were down 33% on the prior year, declining sharply during the first quarter and
stabilising thereafter. Polyethylene prices were slightly lower year-on-year.

Despite general labour cost inflation, most evident in central and eastern Europe, Russia and South Africa, and higher maintenance
costs at a number of our key pulp and paper mills, we were able to limit the overall increase in fixed costs due to the success of 
our ongoing cost containment and productivity improvement initiatives.

Currency movements had a net negative impact on underlying EBITDA versus the comparable prior year period. The negative impact 
of a weaker Russian rouble on translation of our domestically focused Uncoated Fine Paper business and a weaker Turkish lira
more than offset the benefits to our export orientated businesses of a weaker South African rand and a strong US dollar relative
to the euro, seen in the second half of the year.

Depreciation and amortisation charges were marginally lower during the period, as currency effects and disposals more than offset
the effects of acquisitions and the Group's capital investment programme.

Underlying operating profit of EUR1,318 million was up 28% on the prior year. After taking into consideration the impact of special
items of EUR126 million (2017: EUR61 million), operating profit of EUR1,192 million was up 23% (2017: EUR968 million).

Cash generated from operations of EUR1,654 million (2017: EUR1,363 million), reflects the continued strong cash generating ability of
the Group. Following the payment of a special dividend (EUR484 million) in May and the completion of acquisitions totalling 
EUR424 million during the year, net debt was up to EUR2,220 million (2017: EUR1,532 million) or 1.3 times (2017: 1.0 times) net debt 
to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA.

Basic underlying earnings of 189.1 euro cents per share were up 27% compared to 2017. After taking the effect of special items
into account, basic earnings of 170.1 euro cents per share were up 23% compared to 2017.

Our Boards have recommended payment of a final ordinary dividend of 54.55 euro cents per share, bringing the total ordinary
dividend for the year to 76.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 23% on 2017.

Underlying EBITDA was up 30% on the prior year to EUR1,086 million, with higher average selling prices, improved product mix and
volume growth more than offsetting higher costs and negative currency effects. A positive contribution from acquisitions was partly
offset by disposal and one-off effects.

Good demand and limited supply supported a strong pricing environment in containerboard markets. Average benchmark European
prices for unbleached kraftliner were up 16% year-on-year, while benchmark recycled containerboard prices were up around 12% 
on the prior year. Prices for white top kraftliner and semi-chemical fluting, which typically show less volatility through
the business cycle, were up in the range of 8% to 10% year-on-year. A slowdown in the rate of demand growth in the fourth quarter
exacerbated by customer de-stocking, and pressure from imports into Europe led to price reductions in containerboard grades
going into the new year.

Corrugated Packaging achieved good volume growth in the second half of the year in its key markets, following stable volumes in
the first half on a strong comparable prior year period. The business successfully implemented price increases required to
compensate for significantly higher paper input costs and negative currency effects; continued to benefit from growing e-commerce
activity; and remained focused on continuous improvements to reduce conversion costs and further enhance its product offering,
quality and service to customers. Pleasingly, our corrugated business won seven 2019 WorldStar awards, more than any other
company worldwide, building on its success in winning five such awards the prior year, and consolidating our position as a truly
innovative force in the packaging industry.

We saw good demand across our range of kraft paper grades during the year, leading to a strong pricing environment. Kraft paper
prices were up around 10% on average year-on-year. The drive to replace plastic carrier bags with paper-based alternatives
supported strong demand across our range of speciality kraft papers, while good growth in selected emerging markets drove
demand for sack kraft paper. Kraft paper prices in early 2019 are up between 7% and 8% on average compared to average 2018
price levels following price increases through the second half of 2018 and early 2019.

Industrial Bags sales volumes were up 3% on a like-for-like basis, due to strong growth in Iberia, emerging Europe, Middle East
and West Africa, partly offset by weaker US volumes. Price increases were achieved in the early part of the year to compensate for
higher paper input costs. However, margins came under pressure during the second half as higher paper prices, following mid-year
increases, could not be fully passed on to customers due to contractual agreements. Strong cost management and the benefit of
rationalisation activities resulted in significant fixed cost savings during the period. Annual contracts for 2019 have mostly been
finalised, with price increases implemented that largely reflect the full impact on the cost base of the recent sack kraft paper price
increases.

With the exception of paper for recycling, costs were above the prior year period, mitigated by our ongoing cost reduction
programme. We saw higher wood, chemical and energy costs and inflationary increases on cash fixed costs. This was partly offset
by higher average green energy prices in Poland.

We continue to optimise our production footprint and leverage our cost advantaged asset base. In 2018, we announced the closure
of two industrial bag plants in Europe and another in Kentucky (US). We are able to continue to serve customers from our existing
plant network, benefiting from economies of scale. We stopped production of in-line silicone coated products at Steti due to
technical challenges and process complexity. The restructuring initiatives undertaken in the year at the Steti and US industrial bag
operations led to related special item charges of EUR73 million.

We completed the sale of a flat sack kraft paper mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas as well as the acquisition of Powerflute, a producer of
high-quality semi-chemical fluting, and two industrial bag plants in Egypt, broadening our product portfolio and geographic reach.

A planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill and an extended shut at Richards Bay were completed during the first half of the
year. Planned maintenance shuts at Swiecie (Poland) and the majority of our kraft paper mills, including an extended shut at Steti
as we commissioned the extensive plant modernisation project, were completed in the second half. Maintenance shuts are planned at 
our Syktyvkar, Powerflute and Richards Bay mills for the first half of 2019, while the majority of the remaining shuts are scheduled 
for the second half of the year.

Underlying EBITDA of EUR194 million was down 13% on the prior year.

The business generated good growth in selected value-added segments in consumer goods packaging and technical films,
restructured the plant network and fixed cost base, and drove continuous improvement initiatives during the year. This saw the
subsegment consumer goods packaging deliver an improved performance in what remains a challenging trading environment.
Overall Consumer Packaging's performance was held back by declining volumes in personal care components, one-off costs,
rising paper input costs in release liner and negative currency effects.

In continuing to drive performance by aligning capacity to current market requirements, we restructured our UK operations,
including the closure of our plant in Scunthorpe in the second half of the year. A related net special item charge of EUR29 million 
was recorded.

As a producer of both paper and plastic packaging, we believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage our customer relationships
and paper, bag and barriers know-how to develop sustainable packaging solutions for our customers. Flexible plastic packaging,
when manufactured, used and disposed of appropriately, delivers many benefits from resource efficiency (by reducing material
usage and being less transport intense) to reducing food waste by enabling correct sized portions and extending shelf-life.

Mondi joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's (EMF) New Plastics Economy Initiative in 2017, and in 2018, we pledged to
increase investment in research and development, and drive deeper collaboration throughout our supply chain to move away from
non-renewable and non-recyclable plastic. We are one of the first signatories of The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment -
committing to 100% of plastic based packaging being reusable, recyclable or compostable, and 25% being from recycled content
(where it does not compromise functionality or food health requirements) by 2025. Efforts deployed in partnering with customers
and other stakeholders along the value chain to innovate and develop fully recyclable packaging solutions and new solutions with
increased recycled plastic content are well underway, with BarrierPack, our award winning recyclable pouch one such example.
Commercialisation and further innovation will be a focus in 2019 and beyond.

Underlying EBITDA was up 11% to EUR516 million. Higher average selling prices more than offset higher costs and negative currency
effects.

We estimate European uncoated fine paper demand declined around 4% on a strong prior year period, bringing the average rate
of decline over the past two years to 2%, at the higher end of our expected long-term trend of 1% to 2% decline per annum.
Demand in Russia and South Africa was flat, in line with our long-term estimate.

Uncoated fine paper sales volumes were 1% higher than the prior year, despite the ongoing structural decline in mature markets,
as we continue to benefit from our emerging market exposure and superior cost positioning. Average benchmark European
uncoated fine paper selling prices were 7% higher than the prior year and 4% up in the second half of the year compared to the
first half, following the implementation of price increases over the course of the year. Uncoated fine paper selling prices in Russia
and South Africa were also increased during the year, offsetting domestic cost inflation.

We saw an increase in input costs, most notably for wood, energy and chemicals while fixed costs were higher due to domestic
inflationary cost pressures and the impact of maintenance shuts, partly compensated by our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.

Due to the declining margins on unintegrated paper production following the rapid rise in hardwood pulp input costs, we ceased
production at one of our uncoated fine paper machines at Merebank (South Africa) during the second half of the year, which was
operating at 70,000 tonnes per annum production capacity, leading to a special item charge of EUR21 million.

To enhance the security of wood supply to our Richards Bay mill and improve cost competitiveness, we acquired around
11,000 hectares of well-located forest plantations in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) in May 2018 for ZAR408 million (EUR27 million) on
a debt and cash-free basis.

The forestry assets' fair value is dependent on a variety of external factors over which we have limited control, the most significant
being the export price of timber, the exchange rate and domestic input costs. Increases in export prices and a weaker rand at the
end of the year resulted in a fair value gain of EUR43 million, in line with the prior year, but with the second half gain EUR17 million above
that reflected in the first half of 2018.

A planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill and an extended shut at Richards Bay were completed during the first half of the
year. In the second half, we completed planned shuts at Ruzomberok and Neusiedler (Austria). In 2019, our Syktyvkar and
Richards Bay shuts are planned for the first half of the year while a project related shut at our Ruzomberok mill and the remaining
shuts are scheduled for the second half.

Special items
The net special item charge of EUR126 million before tax (2017: EUR61 million) comprised the following by business unit:
Fibre Packaging
   - Discontinuation of in-line silicone coating production at Steti. Restructuring costs of EUR4 million and related impairment of
     assets of EUR51 million were recognised.
   - Restructuring of industrial bags operations in the US. Restructuring costs of EUR9 million and related impairment of assets of 
     EUR9 million were recognised.
Consumer Packaging
  - Restructuring of operations, primarily in the UK. Restructuring costs of EUR13 million and impairment of assets of EUR16 million
    were recognised.
   - Following the discontinuation of in-line silicone coating production at Steti, restructuring costs of EUR3 million and related
     impairment of assets of EUR2 million were recognised. Reversal of impairment of assets of EUR2 million was recognised.
Uncoated Fine Paper
  - Closure of an uncoated fine paper machine at Merebank. Restructuring costs of EUR16 million and related impairment of assets
    of EUR5 million were recognised.

Further detail is provided in note 4 of our condensed combined and consolidated financial statements.

Tax
Our underlying tax charge for the year was EUR273 million (2017: EUR181 million) reflecting tax on higher profits combined with a higher
effective tax rate at 22% (2017: 19%), as a consequence of the full utilisation of tax incentives in Poland in 2017. Tax relief on
special items amounted to EUR34 million (2017: EUR8 million).

Assuming a similar geographic profit mix and stable statutory tax rates, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to be around
23%.

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations of EUR1,654 million (2017: EUR1,363 million), reflects the continued strong cash generating capability of
the Group.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 13.0%, in line with the prior year (12.7%) and within our expected range of 12% to
14%. The net cash outflow from movements in working capital during the year was EUR117 million (2017: EUR122 million).

In 2018, capital expenditure amounted to EUR709 million (2017: EUR611 million), in line with our expectations as outflows related to our
major capital expenditure projects increased. We completed the acquisition of Powerflute, two industrial bag plants in Egypt and
forest plantations in South Africa for a total consideration, on a debt and cash-free basis, of EUR424 million.

Further significant outflows from financing activities included the payment of ordinary dividends of EUR309 million (2017: EUR273 million)
and the payment of a special dividend (EUR484 million) (2017: zero). Interest paid of EUR73 million (2017: EUR97 million) was lower than in
the prior year period primarily due to the payment of the final coupon of the 5.75% 2017 EUR500 million Eurobond on maturity in the prior 
year. Tax paid of EUR248 million (2017: EUR151 million) was higher than the prior year due to improved profitability.

Capital investments
Investing in our cost advantaged asset base to maintain and enhance our competitiveness is of particular importance for our pulp
and paper operations where products are generally more standardised and relative cost competitiveness is a key value driver. We
focus on driving organic growth, strengthening our cost competitiveness, enhancing our product offering, quality and service to
customers and improving our environmental footprint.

Our disciplined approach to investigating, approving and executing capital projects is one of our key strengths and plays an important 
role in successfully delivering returns through the cycle. Over the past three years our major capital projects have contributed 
EUR95 million of incremental operating profit, including EUR20 million in 2018. We expect to generate a further EUR50 million in 2019.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we successfully commissioned the EUR335 million modernisation of the Steti mill to replace the 
recovery boiler, rebuild the fibre lines and debottleneck the existing packaging paper machines. The project is expected to result 
in additional annual production of 90,000 tonnes of softwood market pulp and 55,000 tonnes of packaging paper.

We have a focused capital expenditure project pipeline securing our future growth. Key developments include:
    -    We obtained the final necessary permitting to proceed with the EUR340 million investment in a new 300,000 tonne per
         annum kraft top white machine at Ruzomberok, with start-up expected towards the end of 2020. The related pulp mill
         upgrade at the same site is progressing according to plan with start-up expected in late 2019.
    -    Responding to continued good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers in Europe,
         supported by the drive to replace plastic carrier bags with paper-based alternatives, we have approved a EUR67 million
         capital investment project to convert a containerboard machine at Steti to be fully dedicated to the production of speciality
         kraft paper with a mix of recycled and virgin fibre content for shopping bags applications. This will also allow us to
         optimise productivity and efficiency at Swiecie, where this grade is currently produced. The project will result in an
         additional 75,000 tonnes per annum of speciality kraft paper capacity while reducing our containerboard capacity by around 
         30,000 tonnes per annum. Start-up is expected by the end of 2020.
    -    As part of our plan to maintain Syktyvkar's competitiveness and increase saleable production by around 100,000 tonnes
         per annum in the medium term, we are investing to debottleneck production and avoid unplanned shutdowns, including
         various upgrades of the mill infrastructure, fibre lines and pulp dryer, and a new evaporation plant.
    -    We are investigating alternatives for the modernisation of our Richards Bay facility, including the modernisation of the
         mill's energy and chemical plants.
    -    We continue to invest in our Fibre Packaging and Consumer Packaging converting plants with competitive advantages to grow with
         our customers, enhance our product and service offering and reduce conversion costs.

Our recently completed and planned major capital projects in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia are expected to increase
our current saleable pulp and paper production by around 10% when in full operation.

Given the approved project pipeline and in the absence of any other major investment, our capital expenditure is expected to be in
the range of EUR700-800 million per annum, on average, for 2019 and 2020.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 31 December 2018 was EUR2,220 million, up from EUR1,532 million at 31 December 2017, representing a reduction in net
debt of EUR220 million before the payment of a special dividend (EUR484 million) and acquisitions totalling EUR424 million.

In April 2018, we issued a 1.625% EUR600 million Eurobond with an 8-year tenor under our Euro Medium Term Note Programme,
thereby extending the Group's maturity profile and maintaining our strong liquidity.

The Group's liquidity position remains robust. At the end of the year, EUR616 million of our EUR2.5 billion committed debt facilities 
were undrawn and the weighted average maturity of committed debt facilities was 4.6 years. Gearing at the same date was 37% and our
net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, well within our key financial covenant requirement of
3.5 times.

During the year, Standard & Poor's upgraded the Group's credit rating to BBB+ (stable outlook) from BBB, while Moody's Investors
Service maintained their Baa1 (stable outlook) credit rating.

Net finance costs of EUR88 million were EUR3 million higher than the previous year as the benefit from a lower effective interest rate
(4.2% in 2018 compared to 4.8% in 2017) was offset by higher average net debt of EUR1,979 million (2017: EUR1,572 million).

Simplification of corporate structure
On 19 November 2018, the Boards announced a proposal to simplify the existing Mondi Group structure from the current dual
listed company structure into a single holding company structure under Mondi plc.

If approved, the simplification will be implemented by way of a South African scheme of arrangement whereby Mondi plc will
acquire Mondi Limited. Mondi Limited shareholders will receive one new Mondi plc share in exchange for each Mondi Limited
share held. Following the simplification, each Mondi plc shareholder will have the same voting and capital interests in the Group as
each Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shareholder currently has.

The proposed simplification will enhance strategic flexibility, increase transparency and remove the complexity associated with the
current structure. It will also simplify cash and dividend flows and facilitate continued investment in the South African operations.

Mondi plc will continue to have a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and will have an inward secondary listing on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange quoted in rand. Mondi plc shares will continue to be included in the FTSE 100 index. Today Mondi
Limited shares are not eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. Following the issue of Mondi plc shares in exchange for Mondi
Limited shares as a result of the simplification, it is expected that Mondi plc's weighting in the FTSE 100 index will increase. Mondi
plc shares are expected to continue to be eligible for inclusion in the key JSE indices.

The simplification is subject to certain conditions, including, among other things, the approval of the shareholders of Mondi Limited
and Mondi plc. Good progress has been made to date, with a shareholder circular, scheme document and prospectus expected to be made 
available to shareholders at the end of the first quarter, in accordance with the Annual General Meetings timetable. Implementation of 
the simplification is expected in the second half of 2019.

Dividend
The boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc aim to offer shareholders long-term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend
cover range of two to three times over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and the Boards' stated objective to
increase distributions to shareholders through the ordinary dividend, the Boards have recommended an increase in the final
ordinary dividend to 54.55 euro cents per share (2017: 42.90 euro cents per share). The final ordinary dividend, together with the
interim ordinary dividend of 21.45 euro cents per share, paid on 14 September 2018, amount to a total ordinary dividend for the
year of 76.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 23% on the 2017 total ordinary dividend of 62.0 euro cents per share.

The final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc at the respective Annual
General Meetings scheduled for 9 May 2019 and if approved is payable on 16 May 2019 to shareholders on the register on 
12 April 2019.

Growing Responsibly
We believe that being part of the solution to global sustainability challenges will secure the long-term success of our business and
the wellbeing of our communities and other stakeholders. Communicating openly and working together helps us to better
understand and address risks and opportunities so that we can continue to generate value for our stakeholders long into the future.

We remain committed to achieving a culture where everybody works safely and returns home safely every day. We were deeply
saddened by the fatality of a contractor at Syktyvkar in April 2018 during planned maintenance at the woodyard as well as five life-
altering injuries across the business. Unfortunately, we suffered another fatality in January 2019 when a contractor lost his life
during drilling works at the construction site of our new paper machine in Ruzomberok. Thorough investigations are conducted
after all incidents and action plans implemented to prevent repeat incidents. With zero harm our goal, we continue to work
tirelessly to eliminate fatal and life-altering injuries by focusing on the top risks at all operations enabling us to better anticipate 
and manage our highest risk activities. We continue to focus on the 24-hour safety mindset approach introduced in 2017. The concept
is designed to tap into people's awareness on an emotional, unconscious level by applying safety to all aspects of their lives, not
just at work. In 2018, we had 262 recordable cases, which equates to a Total Recordable Case Rate of 0.68. This is in line with the
previous year level (adjusted for acquisitions) and 11% lower compared to our 2015 baseline.

As one of the Group's strategic value drivers, 'growing responsibly' is an integral part of our future success. Our Growing
Responsibly model remains the framework through which we shape our long-term response to sustainability, and enables us to
demonstrate, monitor and improve our sustainability performance across the value chain. The model covers 10 Action Areas that
reflect the aspects of sustainability that are most relevant for Mondi and our stakeholders. Within these Action Areas, we have
made 16 public commitments to be achieved by 2020, along with a carbon emissions commitment that runs to 2030. In addition to
driving our response to the sustainability issues that are most relevant to our business, our commitments demonstrate Mondi's
positive contribution to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In 2018, we completed a new materiality assessment to understand the relative importance of our material issues to our
stakeholders and to identify new and emerging issues. The results will inform our commitments beyond 2020.

A number of our major capital projects currently in progress and recently completed are expected to contribute to our Growing
Responsibly commitments, particularly relating to greenhouse gas emissions and waste reduction. We are pleased our total
specific CO2e emissions (in tonnes per tonne of saleable production) have declined to 0.72, a 14.5% reduction against the 2014
baseline, as we continue to make progress in making our business less carbon intensive. The contribution of biomass-based
renewable energy to the total fuel consumption of our mills has increased from 59% in 2014 to 64% in 2018.

Our collaborative relationships and partnerships are key as we look to scale up our contribution beyond our own boundaries. It is
only by working together that we will achieve impact, innovation and scale necessary to bring about change. We continue working
closely with WWF in the fifth year of our global partnership focusing on water stewardship in South Africa, protection of intact forest
landscapes in Russia, sustainable forest management and biodiversity as well as setting long term reduction targets for our
greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, we joined WWF's Climate Savers, a leadership programme for businesses, as part of our commitment 
to continue to work on further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions using the science-based target setting methodology.

We engage with our people to ensure their commitment to a business which they feel is responsible, empowering and able to offer
a range of development opportunities. Creating an environment that fosters and respects diversity and inclusion is vital to our
success, and improves our competitive advantage in becoming an employer of choice.

As a Group, we aim to be an 'employer of choice' by attracting talent, creating a stronger culture of employee recognition and
retaining our high-performing workforce. We have a number of programmes currently in place and are defining further initiatives to
ensure we have the right talent and succession plans to deliver on our long-term strategic targets. In 2018, we focused in
particular, on creating a culture that encourages diversity and inclusion, which will enhance our competitive advantage going
forward.

Outlook
Looking ahead, while there are macro-economic uncertainties, we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging 
sectors in which we operate. Pricing is mixed going into 2019, with recent price reductions in containerboard grades and market pulp 
and stronger pricing in our kraft paper markets. During 2019, we are planning longer maintenance and project related shuts, while looking 
forward to the incremental contribution from recently completed major capital projects and acquisitions.

Mondi is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable packaging solutions. With our robust business model, strong balance sheet, focus 
on leveraging key industry trends of sustainability, e-commerce and enhancing brand value, and culture of continuously driving 
performance, we continue to look to the future with confidence.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. They
have put procedures in place for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks that the Group faces. In combination
with the audit committee, the Boards have conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which Mondi is exposed and
they are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk tolerance levels
established.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business, and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes. Our internal control environment is designed to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to provide reasonable assurance that the Group's business objectives will be achieved.

Strategic risks
The industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long-term risks which are accepted by the Boards as a
consequence of the Group's chosen strategy and operating footprint.

While there have been no significant changes in our strategic risk exposures during the year, we continue to monitor recent
capacity announcements and demand developments, the developments in the process as the UK seeks to exit the European Union, 
the stability of the Eurozone and the increasing prevalence of trade tariffs and economic sanctions.

The executive committee and Boards monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall
exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate
exposure to such risks.

Industry productive capacity
Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills. New capacity additions are usually in large increments,
which through their impact on the supply/demand balance, influence market prices. Unless market growth exceeds capacity additions, 
excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices. In our converting operations, investments in newer technology may lower operating 
costs and provide increased product functionality, increasing competition and impacting margins.

Our strategic focus on low cost production and innovation aims to achieve cost advantages and produce higher value added,
responsibly produced and sustainable products. Combined with our focus on growing markets and consistent investment in our
existing asset base this secures our competitiveness. We monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity, utilisation
levels both short and long term, as well as market trends and trade flows in our own product markets. This helps us to establish
target capacity utilisation levels in the short term and to evaluate capital investment projects in the long term. We maintain strong
relationships with machine suppliers to identify current market developments and technologies and we routinely review our asset
portfolio and capacity utilisation levels to identify underperforming assets and take decisive action to drive performance.

Product substitution
Global socio-economic and demographic trends and changing consumption patterns, including increased public awareness of
sustainability and increasing customer purchasing power, are driving changes in customers' needs and attitudes, and could affect
the demand for Mondi products. The increased public and stakeholder focus on the impact of plastic-based packaging on ocean
and land ecosystems has led to heightened environmental considerations, changes in legislation and a shift in consumer attitudes.
Substitution may be to different products not produced by Mondi or to different solutions meeting the same customer requirement.
Factors that may positively or negatively impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials,
increased use of recycled materials, electronic substitution of paper products, substitution of plastic packaging, substitution of 
rigid plastic by flexible packaging, increased demand for high-quality printed material, certified and responsibly produced goods, 
and specific material qualities such as recyclable/biodegradable.

Our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new
products on a sustainable, competitive and cost-effective basis. Opportunities also exist for us to take market share from
substitutes produced by our competitors. Our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics and growing regional
markets. We regularly monitor trends, new developments and innovations in our product markets. We conduct customer surveys to
get a better insight into our customers' needs. In our Consumer Packaging business we have established a sustainability task force
to monitor the market and legislative developments around sustainability of our plastic based packaging. We are a member of the
Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Initiative, where we collaborate with stakeholders across the plastic value
chain. Our research and development pipeline ensures that our products remain cutting-edge with added focus on sustainability
properties (e.g. recyclable, compostable or biodegradable products, sourced responsibly). Our broad range of converting products
provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic-based packaging products.

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins
The Group operates in cyclical markets and fluctuations in our key packaging and paper prices or converting margins can have
material profit and cash flow implications. Our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and demand for our products,
which are, in turn, influenced by macroeconomic conditions, competitive behaviour, consumer spending preferences, and inventory
levels maintained by our customers. Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions and the timing and
magnitude of such changes have varied significantly over time. Gross margins in our downstream converting operations are
impacted by fluctuations in key input costs, which cannot be passed on to customers in all cases.

Our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation,
proximity or production cost. We continue to invest in our high-quality, cost advantaged asset base to ensure we maintain our
competitive cost position. We continue to further develop businesses in higher growth markets with better long term fundamentals.
Our high levels of vertical integration reduce our exposure to price volatility of our key input costs. In our downstream operations
the focus is on passing through our main material costs to sales prices. Our financial policies and structures take the inherent price
volatility of the markets in which we operate into consideration. We regularly review and monitor the current market fundamentals,
market demand trends and market prices to evaluate price expectations in the short term but also to understand the long term trends. 
We monitor our order intake to identify changing trends and developments in our own product markets.

Country risk
The Group has operations across more than 30 countries with differing political, economic and legal systems. In some countries,
such systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic upheaval,
inflation, changes in laws, protectionism, nationalisation, or expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations 
in those countries. The current macroeconomic environment is impacted by the uncertainties from effects of increased protectionism,
use of trade tariffs, economic sanctions, the stability of the Eurozone and the uncertainty over the outcome of the UK's decision to
exit from the European Union.

In South Africa the Group is subject to land claims and could face an adverse land claim ruling. In February 2018 a motion was
passed in the National Assembly in South Africa for Section 25 of the South African Constitution to be reviewed and potentially
amended to allow government to expropriate land without compensation. A process may therefore start to have the South African
Constitution amended accordingly or there could be other changes in legislation governing land ownership in South Africa.

Our geographic diversity and decentralised management structure, utilising local resources in countries in which we operate,
reduces our exposure to any specific jurisdiction. To mitigate the effect of country specific risks we structure our capital and debt 
in each country based on assessed risks and exposures. We regularly review our sales strategies to mitigate export risk in countries
with less predictable environments and, where possible, we obtain credit insurance. The Boards have approved specific country
risk premiums to be added to the required returns on investment projects in those countries where risks are deemed to be higher
and new investments are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation. Where we have large operations in higher risk
locations, we maintain a permanent internal audit presence and operate asset protection units.

During the year further analysis has been undertaken to better understand the possible consequences of the UK's exit from the
European Union. The Group's exposure to the UK is limited. The Group operates two Consumer Packaging plants in the UK and
exports containerboard and uncoated fine paper to the UK. Revenues from customers in the UK represent around 3% of the Group's total. 
The impact on trade flows between the UK and the European Union continues to be monitored closely. Given our current knowledge of 
the Brexit process and the limited direct trading exposure of the Group to the UK, we do not expect Brexit to materially impact our 
ability to continue normal business operations. In South Africa the Group has settled a number of land claims structured as sale and 
leaseback arrangements which provide a framework for settling future land claims and continues to work with other stakeholders to engage 
with government on land matters. We actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate. Regular formal and informal 
interaction with government officials, local communities, and business partners assists us to remain abreast of changes and new 
developments.

Financial risks
We aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance with
all laws and regulations.

Despite ongoing short-term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies, our overall
residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years, reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management.

Capital structure
A strong and stable financial position increases our flexibility and provides us with the ability to take advantage of strategic
opportunities as they arise. Our ability to raise debt and/or equity financing is significantly influenced by general economic
conditions, developments in credit markets, equity market volatility, and our credit rating. Failure to obtain financing at reasonable
rates could prevent us from realising our strategy and have a negative impact on our competitive position.

We operate a central treasury function under a board-approved treasury policy. We target investment grade credit ratings and we
have access to diverse sources of funding with varying maturities. The majority of our external debt is issued centrally. We use a
blend of floating and fixed rate debt contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk. We report regularly to the Boards on our treasury
management policies. Our central treasury function monitors compliance with treasury policies at operating level and we engage
external advisors to review the treasury function at regular intervals.

Currency risk
As a multinational Group, operating globally, we are exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates. The impact of
currency fluctuations affects us because of mismatches between the currencies in which our operating costs are incurred and
those in which revenues are received.

Key operating cost currencies that are not fully offset by local currency denominated revenues include the South African rand,
Polish zloty, Swedish krona and Czech koruna; whilst the fluctuations in the US dollar, Russian rouble, UK pound sterling and
Turkish lira can also have a material impact as our revenues in these currencies are greater than operating costs incurred.
Additionally, appreciation of the euro compared with the currencies of the other key paper producing regions or paper pricing
currencies, notably the US dollar, reduces the competitiveness of Mondi products in Europe compared with imports from such
key paper-producing regions which can result in lower revenues and earnings.

Balance sheet exposures and material forecasted capital expenditures are hedged upon identification. We do not hedge our
exposure to projected future sales or operating costs and our businesses respond to adverse currency fluctuations by increasing
selling prices or increasing exports where competitiveness improves as operating currencies weaken. Entities also borrow in their
local currencies to minimise translation risk. We continuously monitor exchange rate movements and sensitivities, and evaluate
the impact of exchange variances on our results. We regularly review our prices and monitor the import and export trade flows.

Tax risk
We operate in a number of countries - all with different tax systems. In addition, the international tax environment is becoming
more onerous, requiring increasing transparency and reporting and in-depth scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies.
We make significant intragroup charges, the basis for which is subject to review during tax audits.

We aim to manage our affairs conservatively and our operations are structured tax efficiently to take advantage of available
incentives and exemptions. We have dedicated tax resources throughout the Group supported by a centralised Group tax team.
Arm's length principles are applied in the pricing of all intragroup transactions in accordance with Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development guidelines. The Boards have approved the Group tax strategy, and perform a formal review of the
Group's tax affairs at least annually. We obtain external advisory opinions for all major tax projects, such as acquisitions and
restructuring activities, and make use of external benchmarks where possible. We regularly engage with external advisors to stay
up-to-date with changes in tax legislation and tax practice.

Operational risks
A low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence, investment in our people and
commitment to the responsible use of resources.

Our investments to improve our energy efficiency, engineer out our most significant safety risks, improve operating efficiencies,
and renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events. However, the potential impact of any such
event remains unchanged.

Cost and availability of raw materials
Access to sustainable sources of raw materials is essential to our operations. The raw materials used by the Group include
significant amounts of wood, pulp, paper for recycling, plastic resins and chemicals. The prices for many of these raw materials
generally fluctuate in correlation with global commodity cycles. Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced
quantities of available wood supply that meet our standards for credibly certified or controlled wood, the impact of climate change
through increased frequency of severe weather events, changes in rainfall or increased instances of pest and disease outbreaks
and increasing use of wood as a biofuel.

We have access to our own sources of wood in Russia and South Africa and we purchase wood, paper for recycling, pulp, and
polymers to meet our needs in the balance of our operations. Where we source our raw materials in areas of weaker governance,
we may face potential social and environmental risks related to waste, pollution, poor safety and labour practices and human rights
issues.

We are committed to acquiring our raw materials from sustainable, responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial
or illegal supply. We are involved in multi-stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for
sustainable, responsible fibre and we encourage legislation supporting the local collection of recycled materials. Sustainable
management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall social and environmental impact, helping to protect
ecosystems, protect worker and community rights, and to develop resilient landscapes. We have multiple suppliers for each of
our operations and our centralised procurement teams work closely with our operations in actively pursuing longer term
agreements with strategic suppliers. In Europe, we source our wood from diverse regions and forest types to mitigate the
potential impacts of climate change on our wood supplies. We have developed an internal monitoring and risk assessment system, 
Responsible Procurement, to assess and evaluate the performance of our suppliers and their adherence to our Code of Conduct for 
Suppliers. Supplier performance is evaluated through questionnaires and audits.

We have built strong forestry management resources in Russia and South Africa to actively monitor and manage our wood
resources in those countries. We continue to certify our forests with credible external certifications. In South Africa, we have tree
improvement programmes in place, which aim to produce stronger, more robust hybrids that are better able to resist disturbances
such as drought, pests and diseases.

Energy security and related input costs
Mondi is a significant consumer of electricity which is generated internally and purchased from external suppliers. Where we do
not generate electricity from biomass and by-products of our production processes, we are dependent on external suppliers for
raw materials such as gas, oil and coal. Fossil-based energy sources could pose a sustainability and regulatory risk to our energy
security. Higher energy costs contribute significantly to increasing chemical, fuel, and transportation costs which are often difficult
to pass on to customers. As an energy-intensive business, operating globally and relying on global supply chains, we face
potential physical and regulatory risks related to climate change.

We focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations by investing in improvements to our energy profile and increased
electricity self-sufficiency, including the use of renewable energy sources, while reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon
emission levels. Where we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, we may sell such surplus externally. We also
generate income from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations at prices determined in the open market. We
focus on optimising the use of biomass-based fuels in order to reduce our use of fossil-based energy sources, and to decrease
carbon-intensive energy sources such as coal. Energy costs are closely monitored and benchmarked against external sources
and we monitor our electricity usage, carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy. Most of our larger operations have
high levels of electricity self-sufficiency. We actively monitor the renewable energy market fundamentals and changes in
legislation and maintain contact with local energy regulators. We have undertaken detailed compliance assessments regarding
Industry Emissions and Energy Efficiency Directives to determine future investment requirements.

Technical integrity of our operating assets
We have five major mills which account for approximately 75% of our total pulp and paper production capacity, and a significant
consumer packaging manufacturing facility in Germany. If operations at any of these key facilities are interrupted for any
significant length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance. Incidents such as fires,
explosions, or large machinery breakdowns or the inability of our assets to perform the required function effectively and efficiently
whilst protecting people, business, the environment and stakeholders could result in property damage, loss of production,
reputational damage, and/or safety and environmental incidents.

Our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity, and our
proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to improve production reliability and minimise breakdown risks. We conduct
detailed risk assessments of our high-priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the ongoing
management and maintenance of such equipment. We continue to develop our asset management system to ensure best
practices for maintenance procedures and we have a maintenance training programme for our employees. Benchmarking activities
enable us to optimise our production throughout the organisation by learning from our best performing operations and to identify
any emerging issues early.

We actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to share lessons learned across our operations,
identify emerging issues, conduct benchmarking, and evaluate the effectiveness of our risk reduction activities. We engage
external experts to perform technical integrity assessments in our major sites. Our Fire Protection programme is supported by
independent loss prevention audits and we take out property insurance cover for key risks.

Employee and contractor safety
We operate large facilities, often in remote locations. Accidents/incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors, property
damage, lost production time, and/or harm to our reputation. Risks include fatalities, serious injuries, occupational diseases, and
substance and drug abuse.

To ensure the safety of our employees and contractors, we apply safety management systems, including amongst others, risk
assessments, safety procedures and controls. We have a goal of zero harm and aim to continuously advance our 24-hour safety
mind-set and safety culture. We continue with the project to engineer out the most significant risks in our operations supported by
robust controls and procedures for operating those assets and conducting related tasks. During 2018 we rolled out the revised
Permit to Work methodology across the Group to improve safety performance. We provide extensive training to ensure that
performance standards and practice notes are communicated and understood and our incentives are impacted by the non-
achievement of safety milestones (lag indicators) as well as achievement of lead indicators. We continually investigate and
monitor incidents and major close calls and actively transfer learnings across our operations. Our Task Risk Management
Methodology provides a practical approach to conducting pre-task risk assessments, and our focus is on better understanding
the high risk tasks in our operations. We apply externally accredited safety management systems and conduct regular audits of
our operations to ensure our facilities remain fit-for-purpose.

Attraction and retention of key skills and talent
Our success is driven by our people. Key to our long-term success is attracting, retaining, recruiting and developing a skilled and
committed workforce. Access to the right skills, particularly management and technical skills, is critical to support the performance
and growth of our business. Operations in remote locations make attracting and retaining skilled employees challenging. Losing
skills or failing to attract new talent to our business has the potential to undermine our ability to drive performance and deliver on
our strategic objectives.

Our culture and values play a key role in empowering and inspiring our people. These are highlighted by various Inspire
Programmes and collaboration initiatives throughout our operations. We have a zero tolerance policy towards discrimination and
we provide equal opportunities for all employees. To attract skills and talent we are investing in employer branding; we are
engaged in fair and transparent recruitment practices; and have reviewed and updated our diversity and inclusion, labour and
human rights policies. We ensure competitive compensation levels through benchmarking and continue to support and invest in
group-wide as well as local training programmes. We have implemented measures to monitor and manage succession planning,
staff turnover, internal placements and training. We perform 360 degree feedback at a management level and regularly conduct
performance and development reviews at a local level. We carry out a group-wide employee survey approximately every two
years. Through a confidential reporting hotline, Speakout, employees can raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to
our values.

Environmental impact
We operate in a sector where the environmental impact of our business can be high and we need to manage the associated
risks. Our operations are water, carbon and energy intensive; consume materials such as fibre, polymers, metals and chemicals;
and generate emissions to air, water and land. We are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land. We
consider potential negative impacts on constrained resources and loss of biodiversity and ecosystems from our forestry and
manufacturing operations. We are subject to a wide range of international, national and local environmental laws and regulations,
as well as the requirements of our customers and expectations of our broader stakeholders. Costs of continuing compliance,
potential restoration and clean-up activities, and increasing costs from the effects of emissions could have an adverse impact on
our profitability. The impacts of climate change such as rising frequency and intensity of water shortages, floods and storms
worldwide and pests and diseases also have the potential to impact our operations and forests.

We ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements where we operate. Our own
policies and procedures, at or above local policy requirements, are embedded in all our operations and are supported through the
use of externally accredited environmental management systems. We focus on a clean production philosophy to address the
impact from emissions, discharge, and waste. We manage our water resources responsibly to address risks related to water
scarcity in some of our operations, and to ensure equitable use of water resources among local stakeholders wherever we
operate. We emphasise the responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems and protect high conservation value
areas. We ensure that we manage our forests responsibly and implement measures to protect biodiversity. We collaborate with
customers and supply chain stakeholders to better understand the concerns related to the environmental impact of plastics in the
environment, and to work together on scaleable, meaningful solutions to address this. Our product design and innovation focuses
on reducing the environmental impact of our products throughout their life cycle. We monitor our environmental performance
indicators and report our progress against our 2020 commitments, with our GHG emissions independently assured to reasonable
assurance level. We monitor regulatory developments to ensure compliance with existing operating permits and perform SEAT
(Socio-economic Assessment Toolbox) assessments and water impact assessments locally to better understand our local
environmental footprint and stakeholder needs.

Compliance risks
We have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks. Our strong culture and values, emphasised in every part of our business,
with a focus on integrity, honesty, and transparency, underpins our approach.

Reputational risk
Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct in any of the
jurisdictions in which we operate and within our supply chain could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. Failure 
to successfully manage relationships with our stakeholders could disrupt our operations and adversely impact the Group's
reputation. These requirements include laws relating to the environment, exports, price controls, taxation, competition
compliance, data protection, human rights, and labour. Fines imposed by authorities for non-compliance are severe and, in some
cases, legislation can result in criminal sanction for entities and individuals found guilty. Areas of weaker governance also present
the challenge of addressing potential human rights issues in our operations and supply chain. The introduction of human rights
legislation, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, has further highlighted the need to identify and address potential risks of
child labour, forced or bonded labour and human trafficking in our supply chain.

We operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported by self-certification and reporting, with personal
sanction for failure to comply with Group policies. We engage with our stakeholders through formal and informal processes such
as our SEAT assessment and Community Engagement Plans. Our legal and governance compliance is supported by a
centralised legal compliance team and is subject to regular internal audit review. We have a confidential reporting hotline,
Speakout, enabling employees, customers, suppliers, managers and other stakeholders to raise concerns about misconduct.

Information technology risk
Many of our operations are dependent on the availability of IT services and an extended interruption of such services may result
in a plant shutdown and an inability to meet customer requirements. Cybercrime continues to increase and attempts are
increasingly sophisticated, with the consequences of successful attacks including compromised data, financial fraud, and system
shutdowns.

We have a comprehensive IT Security Policy approved by the Boards and we operate an extensive training and awareness
programme for all our users. The IT infrastructure is regularly tested and verified and where possible, we have redundancies in
place. Our system landscape is based on well-proven products. We conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external
providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures and we have cybercrime insurance in place.

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget, considered the assumptions contained in the budget, and reviewed the significant
risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current macroeconomic
environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the annual financial
statements. At 31 December 2018, Mondi had EUR616 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have
maturity dates of between 1 and 8 years, with a weighted average maturity of 4.6 years.

Based on our evaluation the Boards considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2018

1 Basis of preparation
The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company (DLC)
structure. The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries,
operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition
and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). They have been derived from the audited
combined and consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared in accordance with IFRS; the South African Institute of
Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee; the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa 2008; Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council; and
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. They do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS.

The condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the
commentary under the heading 'Going concern'.

The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December
2018 or 2017 but is derived from those accounts. Statutory accounts for 2017 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies,
and those for 2018 will be delivered in due course. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified,
(ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their
report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006. Copies of their unqualified
auditors' reports on the Integrated report and financial statements 2018 are available for inspection at the Mondi Limited and Mondi 
plc registered offices.

These condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the
fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.

2a Accounting policies
The same accounting policies and alternative performance measures (APMs), methods of computation and presentation have
been followed in the preparation of the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2018 as were applied in the preparation of the Group's annual financial statements for 31 December 2017, except as
set out below:
    -   The new Standards IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' (including
        amendment), are effective and have been adopted, together with the early adoption of IFRS 16, 'Leases', for the financial
        year beginning on 1 January 2018. The accounting policies have been updated to reflect the changes required by the new
        accounting standards. The transitional options selected are detailed below.
    -   A number of further amendments to IFRS became effective for the financial period beginning on 1 January 2018, but the
        Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make material retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting
        these new amendments.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group's condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial
position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
are recognised immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

Cash and cash equivalents (note 14b)
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a
maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in
the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents presented in the condensed
combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in net debt (note 14c) are net of overdrafts.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less allowance for impairments.

Impairment of trade receivables
A simplified lifetime Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is used to assess trade receivables for impairment. ECL is the present
value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of a trade receivable. Expected credit losses are based on historical loss
experience on trade receivables, adjusted to reflect information about current economic conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. At the date of initial recognition, the credit losses expected to arise over the
lifetime of a trade receivable are recognised as an impairment.

Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Borrowings (note 11)
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption
value is recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the
effective interest rate method.

Borrowing costs (note 6)
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a
project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a project form part
of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general
borrowings of the Group during the construction period.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which
they are incurred.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and
commodity price risks.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair
value in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position within financial instruments, and are classified
as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised
immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net
finance costs, depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash
flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset then, at the time the asset is recognised, the associated
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Group's cash flow hedge reserve in equity are
included in the initial measurement of the asset. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, amounts
deferred in the Group's cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income
statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit and loss on a proportionate basis.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity
and is recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included
immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

Transitional application
The Group has adopted IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments', on 1 January 2018 and in accordance with the transitional provisions in
IFRS 9, comparative figures have not been restated. The comparative information provided continues to be accounted for in
accordance with the Group's previous accounting policy.

Revenue from contracts with customers

Sale of goods (note 3)
Revenue is recognised from the sale of goods and is measured at the amount of the transaction price received in exchange for
transferring goods. The transaction price is the expected consideration to be received, to the extent that it is highly probable that
there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in future, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other
sales taxes. When the period of time between delivery of goods and subsequent payment by the customer is less than one year,
no adjustment for a financing component is made.

Control of the goods is passed when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer, which is typically when the goods have
been delivered to a contractually agreed location.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are recognised as an expense when the period of amortisation over which the costs
would have been recognised is one year or less. If not, these costs are capitalised and amortised on a basis consistent with the
transfer of goods to the customer to which the asset relates.

Transport revenue
Transport revenue is considered distinct when the Group provides transport services beyond the point in time when control of
goods has passed to the customer. Such revenue is recognised over time.

Transitional application
The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', with the retrospective transitional option per
IFRS 15 C3 (a), in accordance with IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors', subject to
expedients. The Group has used the following practical expedients as permitted by IFRS 15:

-   for completed contracts that began and ended in the same annual reporting period, no restatement has been done;
-   for completed contracts that have variable consideration, the transaction price at the date on which the contract was
    completed has been used; and
-   for the comparative 2017 period, the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not
    disclosed.

Leases

To the extent that a right-of-control exists over an asset subject to a lease, with a lease term exceeding one year, a right-of-use
asset, representing the Group's right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability, representing the Group's obligation to
make lease payments, are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position at the
commencement of the lease.

The right-of-use asset is measured initially at cost and includes the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial
direct costs incurred, including advance lease payments, and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs
required in terms of the lease. Depreciation is charged to the condensed combined and consolidated income statement so as to
depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or
the end of the lease term. The lease term shall include the period of an extension option where it is reasonably certain that the
option will be exercised. Where the lease contains a purchase option the asset is written off over the useful life of the asset when it
is reasonably certain that the purchase option will be exercised.

The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments, including variable lease payments that depend on
an index and the exercise price of purchase options where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, discounted
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable. If the rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's
incremental borrowing rate is used. Finance charges are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income
statement over the period of the lease.

Lease expenses for leases with a duration of one year or less and low-value assets are charged to the condensed combined and
consolidated income statement when incurred. Low-value assets are based on qualitative and quantitative criteria.

Transitional application
The Group has elected to early adopt IFRS 16, 'Leases', with effect from 1 January 2018, with the retrospective transitional option
per IFRS 16 C5 (a), applying IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors'. The Group has elected to
apply the practical expedient per IFRS 16 C3, such that the IFRS 16 definition of a lease would only be applied to assess whether
contracts entered into after the date of initial application are, or contain, leases. All contracts previously assessed not to contain
leases have not been reassessed.

Alternative Performance Measures

The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the condensed combined and
consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to IFRS. These measures, referred to as Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs), are defined at the end of this document and where relevant reconciled to IFRS in the notes to the
condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, and are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented.

2b Restatement of comparative information
The following tables summarise the material impacts resulting from the changes in accounting policies on the Group's condensed
combined and consolidated income statement, condensed combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position and condensed combined and consolidated statement of
cash flows. The effect of restatement is purely attributable to the adoption of the new accounting standard IFRS 16, 'Leases'. IFRS
15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', which has been applied retrospectively has no material impact and therefore is not
included in any restatement of comparatives.

IFRS 16 introduces a single lease accounting model, requiring a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term
of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. The lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
Previously rental costs under operating leases were charged to the condensed combined and consolidated income statement in
equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis was more representative of the pattern of use.

3 Operating segments
Effective from 1 August 2018, the Group reorganised its business units to achieve improved strategic alignment and operational
coordination across the fibre-based packaging value chain. The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the
Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
    -    Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging were replaced by a single business unit called Fibre Packaging; and
    -    there were no changes to the Consumer Packaging or Uncoated Fine Paper business units.

Prior year figures have been restated to reflect the new organisational structure. The reorganisation has no impact on the overall
Group result.

Mondi acquired 100% of the outstanding share capital of Powerflute Group Holdings Oy (Powerflute) on 1 June 2018 for a total
consideration of EUR365 million on a debt and cash-free basis.

containerboard business.

The Group incurred transaction costs of EUR9 million relating to the acquisitions completed in 2018. The transaction costs were
expensed to the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

The fair value accounting of these acquisitions is provisional in nature. The nature of these businesses is such that further
adjustments to the carrying values of acquired assets and/or liabilities, and adjustments to the purchase price, are possible as the
detail of the acquired businesses is evaluated post acquisition. If necessary, any adjustments to the fair values recognised will be
made within 12 months of the acquisition dates.

In respect of trade and other receivables, the gross contractual amounts receivable less the best estimates at the acquisition dates
of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected approximate the book values and the revaluation amounts respectively
as presented.

Goodwill arising on the above business combinations is not tax deductible.

Capital commitments are based on capital projects approved by the end of the financial year and the budget approved by the
Boards. Major capital projects still require further approval before they commence and are not included in the above analysis. The
Group's capital commitments are expected to be financed from existing cash resources and borrowing facilities.

16 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts as at 31 December 2018 of EUR6 million (2017: EUR6 million) in respect of loans and
guarantees given to banks and other third parties. No acquired contingent liabilities have been recorded in the Group's condensed
combined and consolidated statement of financial position for either year presented.

The Group is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of
business. Legal proceedings may include, but are not limited to, alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of environmental,
competition, securities and health and safety laws. The Group may not be insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks. The
Group cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions or claims or complaints or investigations. The Group may settle
litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. The Group may do so to avoid the cost,
management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it
considers it has valid defences to liability. The Group considers that no material loss to the Group is expected to result from these
legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations. Provision is made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise
through legal and tax claims against the Group.

17 Fair value measurement
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in the
notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement
hierarchy:
- level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
  as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group's forestry assets as set out in
note 10 and certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations.

There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are
determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market
data and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.

Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include:
- the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash
  flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates;
- the fair values of the Group's commodity price derivatives are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows
  based on observable market data; and
- other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

Except as detailed below, the directors consider that the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at
amortised cost in the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

18 Related party transactions
The Group and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sale, purchase and service transactions with
equity accounted investees and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that are no
less favourable than those arranged with third parties. These transactions, in total, are not considered to be significant.

Transactions between Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and their respective subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated
on consolidation. There have been no significant changes to related parties as disclosed in note 30 of the Group's annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.

19 Events occurring after 31 December 2018
With the exception of the final ordinary dividend proposed for 2018 (see note 9), there have been no material reportable events 
since 31 December 2018.

Alternative Performance Measures
The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the condensed combined and
consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to IFRS. These measures, referred to as Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs), are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented in this report.

The most significant APMs are:

Net debt (note 14c)
A measure comprising short, medium, and long-term interest-bearing borrowings and the fair value of debt-related derivatives less
cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments. Net debt provides a measure of the Group's net indebtedness
or overall leverage.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) (note 3)
Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted investees' net profit/(loss), divided by trailing 12-
month average capital employed. Capital employed is adjusted for spend on major capital expenditure projects which are not yet in
production. Segments' 12-month average capital employed has been extracted from management reports. ROCE provides a
measure of the efficient and effective use of capital in the business.

Special items (note 4)
Those financial items which the Group considers should be separately disclosed on the face of the condensed combined and
consolidated income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Such items
are generally material by nature and exceed EUR10 million and the Group, therefore, excludes these items when reporting underlying
earnings and related measures in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group on a basis that is
comparable from year to year. Subsequent adjustments to items previously recognised as special items continue to be reflected as
special items in future periods even if they do not exceed the quantitative reporting threshold.

Underlying EBITDA (condensed combined and consolidated income statement)
Operating profit before special items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments not recorded as special items. Underlying
EBITDA provides a measure of the cash generating ability of the business that is comparable from year to year.

Underlying operating profit (condensed combined and consolidated income statement)
Operating profit before special items. Underlying operating profit provides a measure of operating performance that is comparable
from year to year.

Underlying profit before tax (condensed combined and consolidated income statement)
Profit before tax and special items. Underlying profit before tax provides a measure of the Group's profitability before tax that is
comparable from year to year.

Underlying earnings (and per share measure) (note 8)
Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders, before special items. Underlying earnings (and the related per share measure
based on the basic, weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding), provides a measure of the Group's earnings that is
comparable from year to year.

Headline EPS (note 8)
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and is calculated in
accordance with Circular 4/2018, 'Headline Earnings', as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

Cash flow generation (note 14d)
A measurement of the Group's cash generation before considering deployment of cash towards investment in property, plant and
equipment ('capex' or 'capital expenditure'), acquisitions and disposals of businesses, investment in equity accounted investees
and payment of dividends to shareholders. Cash flow generation is a measure of the Group's ability to generate cash through the
cycle before considering deployment of such cash.

Underlying EBITDA margin (note 3)
Underlying EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the cash-generating ability relative to revenue.

Underlying operating profit margin
Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the profitability of the operations relative
to revenue.

Ordinary dividend cover
Basic underlying EPS divided by total ordinary dividend per share paid and proposed provides a measure of the Group's earnings
relative to its deployment towards ordinary dividend payments.

Net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA
Net debt divided by trailing 12-month underlying EBITDA. A measure of the Group's net indebtedness relative to its cash-
generating ability.

Net interest expense (note 6)
Net interest expense comprises interest expense on bank overdrafts, loans and lease liabilities net of investment income providing
an absolute measure of the cost of borrowings.

Effective interest rate (note 6)
Net interest expense expressed as a percentage of trailing 12-month average net debt provides a measure of the cost of
borrowings.

Effective tax rate (note 7)
Underlying tax charge expressed as a percentage of underlying profit before tax. A measure of the Group's tax charge relative to
its profit before tax expressed on an underlying basis.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue
Working capital, defined as the sum of trade and other receivables and inventories less trade and other payables, expressed as a
percentage of trailing 12-month Group revenue. A measure of the Group's effective use of working capital relative to revenue.

Capex and investment in intangible assets as a percentage of depreciation, amortisation and impairments
Capex and investment in intangible assets divided by depreciation, amortisation and non-special impairments provides a measure
of reinvestment into the Group's asset base relative to depreciation, amortisation and impairments.

Mondi Group: Trading Statement

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are required to
publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

Mondi is currently finalising its results for the year ended 31 December 2018, which will be released on 28
February 2019. Mondi expects underlying EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2018 to be above that
of the comparable prior year period of €1,482 million.

In the prior year, the Group recognised special item net charges after tax of €53 million. Special item net
charges after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 are expected to be around €92 million of which €81
million were recognised in the first half.

Accordingly, Mondi advises that it expects earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended 31 December
2018 to be within the ranges shown below:

   ?   basic underlying EPS (euro cents) 186 to 192 (2017: 148.9), an increase of between 25% and 29%

   ?   basic EPS (euro cents) 167 to 173 (2017: 137.9), an increase of between 21% and 25%

   ?   basic headline EPS (euro cents) 182 to 188 (2017: 145.4), an increase of between 25% and 29%

Mondi has disclosed basic underlying EPS, which is defined as basic EPS excluding the impact of special
items, as the directors believe this provides a useful additional measure of the Group's earnings performance
that is comparable from year to year. Mondi has disclosed basic EPS which includes the effect of special
items. The disclosure of basic headline EPS is mandated under the Listings Requirements of the JSE
Limited and has been calculated in accordance with Circular 4/2018 ‘Headline Earnings', as issued by the
South African Institute of Chartered Accountants. 2017 comparative figures in this announcement have been
restated for the impact of the Group's early adoption of the new 'Leases' accounting standard, IFRS 16.

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited and Mondi
plc (together ‘Mondi Group’, the ‘Group’ or ‘Mondi’) notify both the JSE
Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters required to be
disclosed under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and/or the
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency and Listing Rules of the United
Kingdom Listing Authority.

This announcement contains inside information.

19 November 2018

Simplification of corporate structure

The Boards of Mondi plc and Mondi Limited (the ""Boards"") announce that
they are proposing to simplify the existing Mondi Group structure from
the current dual listed company structure (""DLC"") into a single holding
company structure under Mondi plc. Mondi plc will continue to have a
premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (""LSE"") and will have an
inward secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""JSE"")
quoted in rand.

The simplification will be implemented by way of a South African scheme
of arrangement whereby Mondi plc will acquire Mondi Limited. Mondi
Limited shareholders will receive one new Mondi plc share in exchange
for each Mondi Limited share held. Following the simplification, each
Mondi plc shareholder will have the same voting and capital interests in
the Group as each Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shareholder currently has.

Since its formation in 2007, Mondi has been an integrated corporate
group established under a DLC structure with dual holding companies,
Mondi plc, listed on the LSE with a secondary listing on the JSE holding
the non-South African interests of the Group, and Mondi Limited, listed
on the JSE holding the South African interests of the Group. Operating
as a combined group, Mondi is governed by complex arrangements to
maintain parity between the economic and voting rights of the Mondi plc
and Mondi Limited shareholders. At the time of formation, this structure
reflected the fact that the majority of Mondi's business was located in
Europe, whilst recognising Mondi's South African heritage and its
significant ongoing operations in the country. The shares in Mondi plc
and Mondi Limited currently represent approximately 76% and 24%,
respectively, of the Mondi Group’s combined ordinary share capital.

Mondi has achieved very strong profit growth since listing and, as the
Group has evolved, its non-South African interests have grown faster
than its South African interests, reflecting the relative scale of
opportunities in the respective markets. Today, over 90% of the Group's
underlying earnings are generated outside South Africa. This results in
an imbalance between the share of the Group dividend Mondi Limited is
required to support (approximately 24%) and the contribution of Mondi
Limited to Mondi’s profit available for distribution. The proposal will
simplify cash and dividend flows.

Mondi remains fully committed to South Africa with the South African
operations being an important part of Mondi, contributing to the Group’s
industry leading performance. Streamlining the corporate structure will
facilitate continued investment in the South African operations,
estimated at over R8 billion over the next five years, including the
ongoing investment in forestry assets and modernisation of the Group’s
pulp, containerboard, and paper assets.

The simplification will also enhance strategic flexibility, increase
transparency and remove the complexity associated with the current
structure. The simplification will not result in any changes to the
management, operations, locations, activities or staffing levels of the
Mondi Group.

Mondi has received written approval from the Minister of Finance through
the South African Reserve Bank (""SARB"") to simplify the existing Mondi
Group structure and to operate under Mondi plc as a single holding
company.

Mondi plc will continue to be incorporated in the UK and will remain UK
tax resident. Mondi Limited will remain incorporated and tax resident in
South Africa and will become a subsidiary of Mondi plc. Mondi plc will
continue to have a pound sterling quote on the LSE and will have an
inward secondary listing on the JSE quoted in rand. Dividends will
continue to be declared in euros. Shareholders holding Mondi plc shares
on the JSE will continue to receive payment in rand. The Group’s
dividend policy remains unchanged.

Mondi plc shares will continue to be included in the FTSE 100 index.
Today Mondi Limited shares are not eligible for inclusion in the FTSE
100 index. Following the issue of Mondi plc shares in exchange for Mondi
Limited shares as a result of the simplification, it is expected that
Mondi plc's weighting in the FTSE 100 index will increase. Mondi plc
shares are expected to continue to be eligible for inclusion in the key
JSE indices.

The simplification is not expected to have any significant impact on the
reported profits or net assets of the business.

The simplification is subject to certain conditions, including, among
other things, the approval of the shareholders of Mondi plc and Mondi
Limited. A shareholder circular, scheme document and prospectus are
expected to be made available to shareholders in the first half of 2019,
with implementation of the simplification currently expected in the
second half of 2019.

Peter Oswald, Chief Executive of Mondi, commented, ""Mondi has delivered
a strong track record of value accretive growth since listing. While we
have successfully operated as a DLC to date, the evolution of the Group
since its formation in 2007 means that we need to consider the
appropriate structure for the future. The proposed simplification is a
natural step to remove the complexities around our structure and make
our corporate framework more efficient. Our South African operations
remain important to the Group and the proposed simplification
facilitates the modernisation of our Richards Bay mill and ongoing
capital expenditure in South Africa. Our strategy of delivering value
accretive growth focused around innovative and sustainable packaging and
paper solutions remains unchanged"".

Further details will be announced in due course.

Update on Mondi’s investment in new 300,000 tonne kraft top white machine in Slovakia

Having recently obtained the necessary permitting, Mondi is proceeding with the investment in a new
300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine at Ruzomberok (Slovakia), with start-up expected towards
the end of 2020.

Commenting on the project, Mondi Group CEO Peter Oswald said, “This investment provides an exciting
opportunity for Mondi to leverage our cost advantaged mill in Slovakia to complement our portfolio and serve
a growing market with innovative and sustainable containerboard solutions.”

The machine will produce a new and unique environmentally sound containerboard grade, kraft top white,
which combines the strength, printability and appearance benefits of a white virgin fibre top layer with the
economic advantages of a recycled fibre bottom layer. Its access to integrated bleached hardwood pulp
production, scale and location benefits due to its brownfield nature will provide this machine a cost
advantage difficult to replicate. Kraft top white will target the growing white top liner markets for applications
such as shelf-ready packaging, point of sale displays, customised packaging, e-commerce, consumer
durables and other specialised applications.

The related pulp mill upgrade at the same site is progressing according to plan with start-up expected in late
2019. This upgrade will debottleneck pulp production by 100,000 tonnes per annum, which will be integrated
into the containerboard production once the new machine ramps up.

The total project cost has been revised to €340 million (up from €310 million), as a result of refinements to
the machine’s technical concept and higher construction costs since the project was initially scoped. Group
capital expenditure continues to be in line with our previous estimate of €700-800 million per annum in 2018
and 2019.

Mondi Group: Trading update 11 October 2018

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial position since the half
year ended 30 June 2018, based on management information up to 30 September 2018. These results have
not been audited or reviewed by Mondi’s external auditors.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or transactions impacting either
the financial performance or financial position of the Group since 30 June 2018 up to the date of this
statement.

Group performance overview

The Group delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average selling prices
across Fibre Packaging and Uncoated Fine Paper, a very strong operational performance, good cost
containment and contributions from recent acquisitions. Underlying EBITDA for the third quarter of 2018 of
€466 million was 30% up on the comparable prior year period (€359 million – restated1) and 4% up on the
second quarter of 2018 (€447 million).

Like-for-like sales volumes for the quarter were up on the comparable prior year period due to good growth
in the Fibre Packaging value chain. Selling prices for the Group’s key paper grades were significantly up on
the comparable prior year period and marginally up on the second quarter.

We continue to see manageable upward pressure on our cost base with input costs up on the comparable
prior year period and more moderately up when compared to the second quarter. The notable exception
was paper for recycling costs, where average benchmark European prices were down 42% on the prior year
period and stable sequentially. Cash fixed costs were higher as a result of the impact of mill maintenance
shuts and inflationary cost pressures, mitigated by ongoing cost reduction initiatives.

Planned mill maintenance shuts during the quarter had an estimated impact on underlying EBITDA of around
€30 million (2017: €30 million). Based on prevailing market prices, we continue to estimate that the impact
of maintenance shuts on underlying EBITDA for 2018 will be around €115 million (2017: €95 million).

Currency movements had a modest net negative impact on a sequential basis, with the strength of the US
dollar and weakness of the South African rand relative to the euro during the period largely offsetting the
negative impact from a weaker Russian rouble and Turkish lira.
Business unit overview

In Fibre Packaging, good containerboard and kraft paper demand coupled with limited industry capacity
additions continued to support pricing. Average selling prices for the quarter were higher than the
comparable prior year period and modestly up on the second quarter. Selling prices remain generally stable
going into the fourth quarter, with price changes limited to modest increases implemented early in the fourth
quarter in selected containerboard markets.

Going into the annual price negotiations in the fourth quarter, we see strong demand for kraft paper. This is
supported in part by the drive to replace plastic carrier bags with paper-based alternatives and increasing
demand for sustainable paper-based flexible packaging.

We saw good sales volume growth in Corrugated Packaging and Industrial Bags during the period, with
Industrial Bags benefiting from strong sales volume growth in emerging Europe, Middle East and west Africa,
partly offset by continued weakness in US markets. During the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, Industrial
Bags will take further measures to optimise its mature market production footprint.

The €335 million modernisation of our Steti mill is progressing according to plan and commissioning is
expected during the fourth quarter of the year. We are pleased with the progress achieved to date in the
integration of Powerflute and its positive contribution during the quarter. The integration of the two plants
recently acquired in Egypt, to build on our presence in the growing Middle East industrial bags market, is
progressing well.

Consumer Packaging benefited from previously announced restructuring initiatives, product mix
improvements and recently completed investments, although overall performance continues to be held back
by declining volumes in personal care components. We continue to work actively with our customers,
suppliers and other stakeholders to find innovative solutions that improve the sustainability of plastic
packaging, based on circular economy principles. We are seeking opportunities to leverage our product
know-how and customer relationships across our packaging businesses, as a leading producer of both
plastic and paper based solutions.

Uncoated Fine Paper continues to perform strongly with higher average selling prices during the quarter
offsetting higher input costs and negative currency effects. Further inflation-linked selling price increases
were recently implemented in Europe and Russia. High pulp prices continue to put pressure on our
unintegrated production in Europe.

Cash flow and financing activities

Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows related to our capital
expenditure programme and financing activities, resulting in a positive cash flow during the quarter.

Finance charges were marginally up on the second quarter, as a consequence of higher average net debt,
primarily due to the significant cash outflows during the first half of 2018 relating to the completion of
acquisitions (€415 million) and the payment of a special dividend (€484 million).

There have been no significant changes in the Group’s borrowing facilities since 30 June 2018.

Outlook

Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to benefit from stable pricing in key fibre based product segments.
However, as expected, the quarter will be impacted by the large project related shut and ramp-up at our
Steti mill, restructuring initiatives in Industrial Bags and continued pressure on the cost base across the
Group, mitigated by our ongoing proactive and comprehensive cost reduction programmes.
With our robust business model and culture of driving performance, we remain confident of continuing to
deliver an industry leading performance, and sustaining our track record of delivering value accretive growth.

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its dividend in South African rand cents. The applicable
exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 15.59068.

euro). The last date for euro currency elections was 24 August 2018. It was
stated in the announcement on 3 August 2018 that the exchange rate for this
payment would be set today. Accordingly, it is confirmed that sterling dividend
payments will be converted at a rate of EUR 1 to GBP 0.89641. Therefore, the
equivalent interim dividend in pence per ordinary share will be 19.22799.

Mondi plc South African branch register shareholders will receive the dividend in
South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1 to ZAR 15.59068.

Peter Oswald, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""Mondi delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2018, with underlying EBITDA of EUR852 million, up 17% in the
period. We benefited from good demand across our packaging businesses as well as higher average selling prices, while
remaining focused on initiatives to drive performance and mitigate inflationary pressures on our cost base. We saw
a strong operational performance across the pulp and paper businesses, with the exception of the extended shut at
our Richards Bay mill (South Africa).

We continue to make good progress in securing future growth and ensuring the ongoing cost competitiveness of our
operations through the delivery of our major capital expenditure programme of over EUR750 million, which is expected to
contribute to earnings from 2019. The modernisation of our kraft paper facility in Steti (Czech Republic) is on track to
start-up in late 2018 and work to upgrade the pulp mill at our Ruzomberok mill (Slovakia) has commenced, while we await
final permits to proceed with our investment in a new 300,000 tonne kraft top white machine at the same site. We continue to
make good progress on smaller capital expenditure projects at a number of our packaging operations, while integration
of the recently completed acquisitions is progressing according to plan.

The trading environment remains positive going into the second half of the year, with pricing in key fibre based product
segments remaining supportive. The second half of the year will be impacted by the usual seasonal downturn in Uncoated 
Fine Paper. We also expect continued pressure on the cost base across the Group, mitigated by our ongoing proactive and 
comprehensive cost reduction programmes. 

Mondi is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable fibre and plastic based packaging solutions. With our robust 
business model, focus on leveraging key industry trends of sustainability, e-commerce and convenience, and culture of 
driving performance, we remain confident of sustaining our track record of delivering value accretive growth.""

Group performance review
Underlying EBITDA for the half-year ended 30 June 2018 of EUR852 million was up 17% compared to the first half of 2017. Stable
volumes and higher prices more than offset higher costs, negative currency effects and the impact of maintenance shuts. The fibre
based packaging value chain, comprising Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging, was the main contributor to the improved
performance, driven by a combination of higher prices and strong operational performance.

Revenue was up 4% on a like-for-like basis, supported by higher average selling prices across all our businesses and volume
growth in Containerboard and Industrial Bags. Input costs were higher than the comparable prior year period with the notable
exception of paper for recycling costs, with average European benchmark prices down 27% and 30% on the comparable prior year
period and the second half of 2017, respectively. While there remains uncertainty, caused mainly by Chinese import policies, we
are seeing signs of stabilisation in European paper for recycling markets, with benchmark prices holding steady during the second
quarter and July. Wood costs were generally higher in local currency terms in northern and central Europe during the first
half of the year. Energy costs were higher than the comparable prior year period driven by increasing commodity input prices.
Cash fixed costs were higher as a result of inflationary cost pressures across the Group and the impact of mill maintenance shuts.
Depreciation and amortisation charges were marginally lower during the period.

In June 2018, we completed the acquisition of Powerflute, an integrated pulp and paper mill in Kuopio (Finland) with an annual
production capacity of 285,000 tonnes of high-performance semi-chemical fluting, for a total consideration of EUR363 million on a debt
and cash-free basis. We are pleased with the progress made to date with the integration of this business, which further broadens
our containerboard product portfolio and geographic reach.

In the first half of 2018, we completed a longer than anticipated annual maintenance shut at our Richards Bay mill, a maintenance
shut at our Syktyvkar mill (Russia) and smaller shuts at some of our other mills. The balance of our maintenance shuts are
scheduled for the second half of the year. Based on prevailing market prices, the full year impact on underlying EBITDA of the
Group's maintenance shuts is estimated at around EUR115 million (2017: EUR95 million) of which the first half effect was around
EUR55 million (2017: EUR40 million).

Currency movements had a net negative impact on underlying EBITDA versus the comparable prior year period. The weaker US
dollar had a net negative impact mainly on dollar denominated sales of a number of the Group's globally traded products, while the
weaker Russian rouble had a net negative impact on translation of the profits of the domestically focused Uncoated Fine Paper
business.

Basic underlying earnings were up 26% to 89.2 euro cents per share, with strong improvement in underlying operating profit and
lower net finance charges partly offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from 19% in the prior year period to 22% in the
current period. After taking the effect of special items into account, basic earnings of 72.5 euro cents per share were up 1% on the
comparable prior year period.

An interim dividend of 21.45 euro cents per share has been declared.

Underlying EBITDA of EUR430 million was up 43% on the comparable prior year period with higher selling prices, higher sales
volumes and a better mix more than offsetting higher costs and negative currency effects.

Containerboard markets remain robust, with good demand and limited capacity additions continuing to support pricing. Selling
prices were up significantly on the prior year period and up sequentially, following price increases implemented through the course
of 2017 and during the first quarter of 2018. Average benchmark European selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were up 24% on
the comparable prior year period and up 7% on the second half of 2017, while average benchmark European selling prices for
recycled containerboard were up 18% on the first half of 2017, and up 6% sequentially. By contrast, benchmark white top kraftliner and 
semi-chemical fluting prices were up a more modest 8% to 11% on the comparable year and 5% to 6% up on the preceding six month
period. Margins in containerboard were further supported by the significant decline in paper for recycling prices. On an annual
basis, the Group consumes around 1.3 million tonnes of paper for recycling in the production of containerboard.

In response to sustained good demand, a strong order position and higher input costs, we have announced further price increases
of EUR40/tonne for selected virgin containerboard grades to take effect across European markets from September 2018.

From January 2018, we implemented sack kraft paper price increases in the range of 8% to 9% compared to average 2017 price
levels across all geographies. Markets remain very tight, with good demand, particularly in our export markets, coupled with
constrained supply. At the end of the second quarter, further price increases in the range of 5% to 7% were implemented in
Europe, where most of our volumes are integrated. In overseas markets, price increases are being implemented for the limited
volumes that are not fixed by annual contracts.

We continue to see good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers in Europe, supported by the drive to replace plastic
carrier bags with paper-based alternatives. Selling prices were, on average, higher than the comparable prior year period and
higher than the second half of 2017.

With the exception of paper for recycling, costs were above the comparable prior year period, mitigated by our ongoing cost
reduction programmes. We saw higher wood and energy costs, inflationary increases on cash fixed costs and a higher depreciation
charge during the period. The business benefited from higher average green energy prices in Poland. In the first six months of the
year, we completed a planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill and an extended shut at our facility in Richards Bay. During
the second half of the year, planned maintenance shuts are scheduled at Swiecie (Poland) and the majority of our kraft paper mills,
including an extended shut at Steti as we progress to commission the modernisation of this operation.

In May 2018, we decided to stop production of in-line silicone coated products at our facility in Steti. The Group had rebuilt one of
its paper machines at the mill with an in-line coating extension, an innovative process technology. Despite the progress achieved,
the improvements did not outweigh the increased technical challenges and process complexity. Production of speciality kraft paper
at the machine will continue, while we will revert to off-line coating at our release liner operations to continue to serve our
customers. A related net special item charge of EUR55 million has been recorded in the period.

In June 2018, we completed the sale of a flat sack kraft paper mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas (US) with 130,000 tonnes of annual
production capacity.

Underlying EBITDA of EUR105 million was up 4% on the comparable prior year period, with higher average selling prices more than
offsetting higher costs and negative currency effects.

Corrugated Packaging made very good progress in implementing price increases required to compensate for the significantly
higher paper input costs and negative currency effects, while it continues to benefit from growing e-commerce activity. Sales
volumes were stable on a strong comparable prior year period. The business remains focused on continuous improvements to
reduce conversion costs and further enhance its product offering, quality and service to customers.

Industrial Bags volumes were up 3.6% on the comparable prior year period, with strong growth in Iberia, emerging Europe, Middle
East and West Africa more than offsetting weaker US volumes. As previously reported, annual contracts for 2018 were finalised
during the first quarter, with price increases implemented that largely reflected the full impact on the cost base of the paper price
increases that took effect from the beginning of the year. Further price increases are being negotiated following recent increases in
paper input costs, albeit the ability to influence pricing in the short term is limited due to the prevalence of annual contracts. The
business benefited from good cost management and restructuring measures to optimise the plant network in Europe and North
America that were implemented during 2017. Industrial Bags, together with the other Fibre Packaging businesses, is working closely with 
Consumer Packaging to develop paper based consumer packaging solutions.

In June 2018, we acquired an industrial bags plant in Giza near Cairo (Egypt), for a total consideration of EGP510 million 
(EUR25 million) on a debt and cash-free basis. This acquisition bolsters our leading position in the fast growing Middle East industrial 
bags market and will allow us to better serve our customers in the region. We have also agreed to acquire a control position in 
another plant near Cairo which is expected to complete in the third quarter.

Underlying EBITDA of EUR103 million was down on the comparable prior year period, as steady underlying performance was offset
by negative currency and one-off effects.

The business benefited from good growth in selected value-added segments in technical films and consumer goods packaging,
and the programme launched in the second half of 2017 to restructure the cost base. Short-term performance was held back by
declining volumes in personal care components and certain weaker plants in the portfolio.

In continuing to drive performance by aligning capacity to current market requirements, we are progressing with the restructuring of
our UK operations, including the closure of our plant in Scunthorpe in the second half of the year. A related net special item charge
of EUR24 million was recorded in the period.

We continue to drive various commercial excellence and innovation initiatives, aimed at improving our product and service offering
to customers. As previously disclosed, our commitment to work collaboratively with other stakeholders led us to join the Ellen
MacArthur Foundation New Plastics Economy Initiative in 2017. We are actively working with our customers, suppliers and
recycling companies to find innovative solutions that improve the sustainability of packaging. We believe flexible packaging, which
typically uses 70% less plastic than rigid based alternatives, can contribute towards a global sustainable plastics system, based on
circular economy principles. Furthermore, we continue to seek opportunities to leverage our customer relationships and product
know-how across our packaging businesses, being in a unique position as a leading producer of both plastics and paper based
solutions.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business continued to perform strongly, with underlying EBITDA of EUR230 million and ROCE of 26.5%.
Underlying EBITDA was down 4% on the comparable prior year period as higher average selling prices were offset by higher
costs, the impact of the extended shut at Richards Bay, a lower fair value gain and negative currency effects, mainly from a weaker
Russian rouble and US dollar compared to the prior year period.

Uncoated fine paper sales volumes were higher than the prior year period despite the ongoing structural decline in overall market
demand in mature markets, as we continue to benefit from our superior cost positioning and emerging market exposure. Average
benchmark European uncoated fine paper selling prices were up 6% on the comparable prior year period and 3% up sequentially,
following the implementation of price increases through the course of 2017 and at the end of March 2018. As a result of continued
cost pressures, we implemented price increases in July of between 2% and 6% for our range of uncoated fine papers in
Europe with a further price increase of up to 6% announced for implementation in September.

Variable input costs increased due to higher wood, chemical and energy costs, while fixed costs were higher due to domestic
inflationary cost pressures and maintenance shuts; partly compensated by our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. The forestry fair
value gain of EUR13 million was down EUR7 million on the prior year period.

Due to the declining margins on unintegrated paper production following the rapid rise in hardwood pulp input costs, we will cease
production at one of our uncoated fine paper machines at Merebank (South Africa) during the second half, which was operating at
70,000 tonnes per annum production capacity, leading to a net special item charge of EUR18 million in the period.

To enhance the security of wood supply to our Richards Bay mill and improve cost competitiveness, we acquired around 
11,000 hectares of well-located forest plantations in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) in May 2018 for ZAR408 million (EUR27 million) 
on a debt and cash-free basis.

During the period we completed a planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill and extended shut at our facility in Richards
Bay. Maintenance shuts at our Ruzomberok and Neusiedler (Austria) mills are scheduled for the second half of the year. In line
with previous years, the second half is also expected to be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in demand during the European
summer months.

Tax
The underlying effective tax rate in the first half was 22%, above the comparable prior year period and in line with our expectation
as previously disclosed. The increase in tax rate is partly due to the full utilisation in 2017 of key tax incentives in Poland. In
addition, in the prior year we recognised deferred tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses.

Special items
The net special item charge in the period of EUR100 million before tax (2017: net gain EUR5 million) comprises the following by business:
  -    Packaging Paper
           - Discontinuation of in-line silicone coating production at Steti. Restructuring costs of EUR8 million and related
             impairment of assets of EUR47 million were recognised.
  -    Consumer Packaging
           - Restructuring of operations, primarily in the United Kingdom. Restructuring costs of EUR9 million and impairment of
             assets of EUR15 million were recognised.
           - Following the discontinuation of in-line silicone coating production at Steti, restructuring costs of EUR3 million and
             related impairment of EUR2 million, offset by reversal of impairment of assets of EUR2 million, were recognised.
  -    Uncoated Fine Paper
           - Closure of an uncoated fine paper machine at Merebank. Restructuring costs of EUR13 million and related
             impairment of assets of EUR5 million were recognised.

Further detail is provided in note 5 of the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations of EUR722 million (2017: EUR612 million), reflects the continued strong cash generating capacity of the
Group.

Working capital at 30 June 2018 was 14.3% as a percentage of annualised revenue (30 June 2017: 13.4%), higher than the year
end level of 12.7%. This reflects the usual seasonal uptick in the first half of the year compounded by increasing average selling
prices, giving rise to a net cash outflow of EUR148 million in the period (2017: EUR141 million).

During the period we completed the acquisition of Powerflute, an industrial bags plant in Egypt and forest plantations in South
Africa for a total consideration, including net debt assumed of EUR415 million. Further significant cash outflows from financing activities
included the payment of the 2017 final ordinary dividend (EUR207 million) and the 2017 special dividend in May 2018 (EUR484 million).

Capital investments
During the first half of the year we invested EUR347 million (2017: EUR254 million) in our property, plant and equipment. Our recently
completed capital projects made good contributions during the period.

We are making good progress with our major capital expenditure programme, totalling over EUR750 million and securing future
growth:
    -    The modernisation of our Steti mill to replace the recovery boiler, rebuild the fibre lines and debottleneck the existing
         packaging paper machines is on track to start-up towards the end of the year.
    -    Our investment in a new 300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine and related pulp mill upgrade at our
         Ruzomberok mill is progressing well. Work on the pulp mill upgrade is ongoing, with start-up expected in late 2019. The
         investment in the paper machine remains subject to obtaining necessary permitting with start-up expected in 2020.
    -    As part of our plan to maintain Syktyvkar's competitiveness and increase saleable production by around 100,000 tonnes
         per annum in the medium term, we are investing to debottleneck production and avoid unplanned shutdowns.
    -    We continue to invest in our Fibre Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses to enhance our product and service
         offering.

Our major capital projects in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia will increase our current saleable pulp and paper production by
around 9% when in full operation.

Given the approved project pipeline and in the absence of any other major investments, our capital expenditure is expected to be
in line with our previous estimate of EUR700-800 million per annum in 2018 and 2019 as expenditure on these large projects
accelerates.

Net debt at 30 June 2018 was EUR2,450 million, up from EUR1,532 million at 31 December 2017, mainly as a consequence of the
payment of the 2017 special dividend at the end of May (EUR484 million) and the completion of acquisitions totalling EUR415 million in
the period. At 30 June 2018, the net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA ratio was 1.5 times.

In April 2018, we issued a 1.625% EUR600 million Eurobond with an 8-year tenor under our Euro Medium Term Note Programme,
thereby extending the Group's maturity profile and maintaining our strong liquidity. At 30 June 2018, we had EUR2.5 billion of
committed borrowing facilities of which EUR429 million were undrawn. The weighted average maturity of our committed debt facilities
is approximately 4.6 years.

Finance charges of EUR40 million were below those of the comparable prior year period (EUR47 million). Average net debt was up on the
comparable prior year period, while the average effective interest rate for the period was lower at 4.3% (six months ended
30 June 2017: 5.5%), primarily due to the redemption of the 5.75% EUR500 million Eurobond on maturity in April 2017.

During the period, Standard & Poor's upgraded the Group's credit rating to BBB+ (stable outlook) from BBB, while Moody's
Investors Service maintained their Baa1 (stable outlook) credit rating.

Dividend
The Boards' aim is to offer shareholders long-term dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times
underlying earnings over the business cycle.

An interim ordinary dividend of 21.45 euro cents per share has been declared by the directors and will be paid on
14 September 2018 to those shareholders on the register of Mondi plc on 24 August 2018. An equivalent South African rand
interim ordinary dividend will be paid on 14 September 2018 to shareholders on the register of Mondi Limited on 24 August 2018.
The dividend will be paid from distributable reserves of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc.

Outlook
The trading environment remains positive going into the second half of the year, with pricing in key fibre based product segments
remaining supportive. The second half of the year will be impacted by the usual seasonal downturn in Uncoated Fine Paper. We also 
expect continued pressure on the cost base across the Group, mitigated by our ongoing proactive and comprehensive cost reduction programmes. 

Mondi is uniquely positioned to develop sustainable fibre and plastic based packaging solutions. With our robust business model, 
focus on leveraging key industry trends of sustainability, e-commerce and convenience, and culture of driving performance, 
we remain confident of sustaining our track record of delivering value accretive growth.

Reorganisation of business units
Effective from 1 August 2018, the Group reorganised its business units to achieve improved strategic alignment and operational
coordination across the fibre based packaging value chain. The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the
Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
- Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging were replaced by a single business unit called Fibre Packaging; and
- there were no changes to the Consumer Packaging or Uncoated Fine Paper business units.

The Group's restated segmental reporting for the six months ended 30 June 2018 and the comparative reporting periods for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2017 are disclosed later in this document. The reorganisation has no impact 
on the overall Group result.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. They
have put procedures in place for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks that the Group faces. In combination
with the audit committee, at the beginning of 2018, the Boards have conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which
Mondi is exposed and they are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within
the risk tolerance levels established. There have been no significant changes to the principal risks since 31 December 2017 as
described on pages 34 to 40 of the Group's Integrated report and financial statements 2017.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business, and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes. Our internal control environment is designed to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to provide reasonable assurance that the Group's business objectives will be achieved.

Strategic risks
The industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long-term risks which are accepted by the Boards as a
consequence of the Group's chosen strategy and operating footprint.

While there have been no significant changes in our strategic risk exposure during the year, we continue to monitor recent capacity
announcements, the developments in the process as the UK seeks to exit the European Union, the stability of the Eurozone and
the increasing use of trade tariffs and economic sanctions.

The executive committee and Boards monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall
exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate
exposure to such risks.

Our principal strategic risks relate to the following:
    -    Industry productive capacity
    -    Product substitution
    -    Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins
    -    Country risk

Financial risks
We aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance with
all laws and regulations.

Despite ongoing short-term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies, our overall
residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years, reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management.

Our principal financial risks relate to the following:
    -    Capital structure
    -    Currency risk
    -    Tax risk

Operational risks
A low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence, investment in our people and
commitment to the responsible use of resources.

Our investments to improve our energy efficiency, engineer out our most significant safety risks, improve operating efficiencies, and
renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events. However, the potential impact of any such event
remains unchanged.

Our principal operational risks relate to the following:
    -    Cost and availability of raw materials
    -    Energy security and related input costs
    -    Technical integrity of our operating assets
    -    Environmental impact
    -    Employee and contractor safety
    -    Attraction and retention of key skills and talent

Compliance risks
We have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks. Our strong culture and values, emphasised in every part of our business
with a focus on integrity, honesty, and transparency, underpins our approach.

Our principal compliance risks relate to the following:
    -    Reputational risk
    -    Information technology risk

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's current financial position, performance expectations for the next twelve months, and the
significant risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current
macroeconomic environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements. 
At 30 June 2018, Mondi had EUR429 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have maturity dates of
between 1 and 8 years, with a weighted average maturity of 4.6 years.

Based on our evaluation the Boards considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements.

United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. is the appointed auditor of Mondi Limited, a company

and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.

We have reviewed Mondi plc and Mondi Limited's condensed combined and consolidated half-yearly financial statements (the
""interim financial statements"") in the half-yearly results for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Based on our review, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the South African
Financial Reporting Standards Council and the provisions of the Companies Act of South Africa.

What we have reviewed
The interim financial statements comprise:
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018;
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated income statement and the condensed combined and consolidated statement
         of comprehensive income for the period then ended;

    -    the condensed combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and
    -    the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements included in the half-yearly results have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the IASB and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the SAICA Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the South African
Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation
of the full annual financial statements of the Group is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union and as issued by the IASB.

Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review

Responsibilities of the directors of Mondi plc and Mondi Limited
The half-yearly results, including the interim financial statements, are the responsibility of, and have been approved by, the
directors. The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the interim financial statements in accordance with
International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the IASB,
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the SAICA
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
South African Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Our responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.

What a review of interim financial statements involves
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP conducted their review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and
Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. conducted their review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE)
2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' as issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements. A review of
interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement.

A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with either International Standards on Auditing (UK) or International Standards on Auditing and, consequently, does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these interim financial statements.

As part of our review, we have read the other information contained in the half-yearly results and considered whether it contains
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements.

Use of the review report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have prepared this review report, including their conclusion, for and only for Mondi plc for the
purpose of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and
for no other purpose. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.

a)   The maintenance and integrity of the Mondi Group website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by

b)   Legislation in the United Kingdom and South Africa governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
     may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2018

1 Basis of preparation
The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company (DLC)
structure. The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries,
operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated half-yearly financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'; the South African Institute of Chartered
Accountants (SAICA) Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee; Financial Pronouncements as
issued by the Financial Reporting Council; and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008. They should be read
in conjunction with the Group's Integrated report and financial statements 2017, prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU)
and, therefore, the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the
commentary under the heading 'Going concern'.

The financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the UK Companies Act
2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to
which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under
section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006.

These condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the
fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.

The preparation of these condensed combined and consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and
assumptions. Although the estimates used are based on management's best information about current circumstances and future
events and actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management
in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to
the Group's Integrated report and financial statements 2017, with the exception of changes in estimates that are required in
determining the provision for income taxes for an interim period and the estimates required under the new accounting standards as
described in note 2a.

These financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Group Chief Financial Officer, Andrew King CA (SA).

2a Accounting policies
The same accounting policies and alternative performance measures (APMs), methods of computation and presentation have
been followed in the preparation of the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements for the six months ended
30 June 2018 as were applied in the preparation of the Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017,
except as set out below.

The new Standards IFRS 9, 'Financial instruments' and IFRS 15, 'Revenue from contracts with customers' (including amendment),
are effective and have been adopted, together with the early adoption of IFRS 16, 'Leases', for the financial year beginning on 1
January 2018. The accounting policies have been updated to reflect the changes required by the new accounting standards. The
transitional options selected are detailed below.

A number of further amendments to IFRS became effective for the financial period beginning on 1 January 2018, but the Group did
not have to change its accounting policies or make material retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these new
amendments.

Taxes on income in the interim period are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual profits or
losses.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group's condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial
position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
are recognised immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

Cash and cash equivalents (note 16b)
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a
maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in
the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position. Cash and cash equivalents presented in the condensed
combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in net debt (note 16c) are net of overdrafts.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at their fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method, less allowance for impairments.

Impairment of trade receivables
A simplified lifetime Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is used to assess trade receivables for impairment. ECL is the present
value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of a trade receivable. Expected credit losses are based on historical loss
experience on trade receivables, adjusted to reflect information about current economic conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. At the date of initial recognition, the credit losses expected to arise over the
lifetime of a trade receivable are recognised as an impairment.

Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method.

Borrowings (note 13)
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption
value is recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the
effective interest rate method.

Borrowing costs (note 7)
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a
project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a project form part
of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general
borrowings of the Group during the construction period.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which
they are incurred.

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and
commodity price risks.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair
value in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments, and are
classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised
immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net
finance costs, depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash
flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset then, at the time the asset is recognised, the associated
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Group's cash flow hedge reserve in equity are
included in the initial measurement of the asset. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, amounts
deferred in the Group's cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income
statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit and loss on a proportionate basis.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity
and is recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included
immediately in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

Transitional application
The Group has adopted IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments', on 1 January 2018 and in accordance with the transitional provisions in
IFRS 9, comparative figures have not been restated.

Revenue from contracts with customers

Sale of goods (note 4)
Revenue is recognised from the sale of goods and is measured at the amount of the transaction price received in exchange for
transferring goods. The transaction price is the expected consideration to be received, to the extent that it is highly probable that
there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in future, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other
sales taxes. When the period of time between delivery of goods and subsequent payment by the customer is less than one year,
no adjustment for a financing component is made.

Control of the goods is passed when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer, which is typically when the goods have
been delivered to a contractually agreed location.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are recognised as an expense when the period of amortisation over which the costs
would have been recognised is one year or less. If not, these costs are capitalised and amortised on a basis consistent with the
transfer of goods to the customer to which the asset relates.

Transitional application
The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15, 'Revenue from contracts with customers', with the retrospective transitional option per
IFRS 15 C3 (a), in accordance with IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors', subject to
expedients. The Group has used the following practical expedients as permitted by IFRS 15:
-   for completed contracts that began and ended in the same annual reporting period, no restatement has been done;
-   for completed contracts that have variable consideration, the transaction price at the date on which the contract was
    completed has been used; and
-   for the comparative 2017 periods, the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not
    disclosed.

Leases (note 12)

To the extent that a right-of-control exists over an asset subject to a lease, with a lease term exceeding one year, a right-of-use
asset, representing the Group's right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability representing the Group's obligation to
make lease payments are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position at the
commencement of the lease.

The right-of-use asset is measured initially at cost and includes the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial
direct costs incurred, including advance lease payments, and an estimate of the dismantling, removal and restoration costs
required in terms of the lease. Depreciation is charged to the condensed combined and consolidated income statement so as to
depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or
the end of the lease term. The lease term shall include the period of an extension option where it is reasonably certain that the
option will be exercised. Where the lease contains a purchase option the asset is written-off over the useful life of the asset when it
is reasonably certain that the purchase option will be exercised.

The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments, including variable lease payments that depend on
an index and the exercise price of purchase options where it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised, discounted
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable. If the rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's
incremental borrowing rate is used. Finance charges are recognised in the condensed combined and consolidated income statement 
over the period of the lease.

Lease expenses for leases with a duration of one year or less and low-value assets are charged to the condensed combined and
consolidated income statement when incurred. Low-value assets are based on qualitative and quantitative criteria.

Transitional application
The Group has elected to early adopt IFRS 16, 'Leases', with effect from 1 January 2018, with the retrospective transitional option
per IFRS 16 C5 (a), applying IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors'. The Group has elected to
apply the practical expedient per IFRS 16 C3, such that the IFRS 16 definition of a lease would only be applied to assess whether
contracts entered into after the date of initial application are, or contain leases. All contracts previously assessed not to contain
leases have not been reassessed.

Alternative Performance Measures
The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the condensed combined and
consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to IFRS. These measures, referred to as Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs), are defined in the Alternative Performance Measure section at the end of this document, and
where relevant reconciled to IFRS in the notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, and are
prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented.

2b Restatement of comparative information
The following tables summarise the material impacts resulting from the changes in accounting policies on the Group's condensed
combined and consolidated income statement, condensed combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position and condensed combined and consolidated statement of
cash flows. The effect of restatement is purely attributable to the adoption of the new accounting standard IFRS 16, 'Leases'.

Acquisition of Powerflute Group Holdings Oy
Mondi acquired 100% of the outstanding share capital of Powerflute Group Holdings Oy (Powerflute) on 1 June 2018 for a total
consideration of EUR363 million on a debt and cash-free basis.

Powerflute operates an integrated pulp and paper mill in Kuopio, Finland, with an annual production capacity of 285,000 tonnes of
high-performance semi-chemical fluting. Powerflute's premium semi-chemical fluting is sold to a diverse range of customers,
primarily for packaging fresh fruit and vegetables, but also other end-uses such as electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
The provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated synergies from integrating Powerflute into
the Group, the benefits from the skilled workforce and the expansion of the product range and geographic reach of Mondi's 
containerboard business.

Powerflute's revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2018 was EUR84 million with a profit after tax of EUR10 million. Powerflute's

17 Capital commitments
Capital commitments are based on capital projects approved to date and the budget approved by the Boards. As previously indicated, 
capital expenditure for 2018 is expected to be in the range of EUR700-EUR800 million. These capital projects are expected to
be financed from existing cash resources and borrowing facilities.

18 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts as at 30 June 2018 of EUR6 million (as at 30 June 2017: EUR6 million; as at
31 December 2017: EUR6 million) in respect of loans and guarantees given to banks and other third parties. No acquired contingent
liabilities have been recorded in the Group's condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position for all periods
presented.

The Group is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of
business. Legal proceedings may include, but are not limited to, alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of environmental,
competition, securities and health and safety laws. The Group may not be insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks. The
Group cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions or claims or complaints or investigations. The Group may settle
litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. The Group may do so to avoid the cost,
management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it
considers it has valid defences to liability. The Group considers that no material loss to the Group is expected to result from these
legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations. Provision is made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise
through legal and tax claims against the Group.

19 Fair value measurement
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in the
notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement
hierarchy:
- level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
  (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group's forestry assets as set out in
note 11, certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations.

There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the period.

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are
determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market
data and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.

Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include:

21 Events occurring after 30 June 2018
With the exception of the interim dividend declared for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (see note 10), and the reorganisation of
business segments described below, there have been no material reportable events since 30 June 2018.

Reoganisation of business segments
Effective from 1 August 2018, the Group reorganised its business units to achieve improved strategic alignment and operational
coordination across the fibre based packaging value chain. The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the
Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
- Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging were replaced by a single business unit called Fibre Packaging; and
- there were no changes to the Consumer Packaging or Uncoated Fine Paper business units.

The Group's restated segmental reporting for the six months ended 30 June 2018 and the comparative reporting periods for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 and the year ended 31 December 2017 are disclosed later in this document. The reorganisation has no 
impact on the overall Group result.

Note:

Alternative Performance Measures
The Group presents certain measures of financial performance, position or cash flows in the condensed combined and
consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to IFRS. These measures, referred to as Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs), are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented in this report.

The most significant APMs are:

Net debt (note 16c)
A measure comprising short, medium, and long-term interest-bearing borrowings and the fair value of debt-related derivatives less
cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments. Net debt provides a measure of the Group's net indebtedness
or overall leverage.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) (note 4)
Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted investees' net profit/(loss), divided by trailing 
12-month average capital employed. Capital employed is adjusted for spend on those strategic projects which are not yet in
production. Segments' 12-month average capital employed has been extracted from management reports. ROCE provides a
measure of the efficient and effective use of capital in the business and is used for incentive purposes.

Special items (note 5)
Those financial items which the Group considers should be separately disclosed on the face of the condensed combined and
consolidated income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Such items
are generally material by nature and exceed EUR10 million and the Group, therefore, excludes these items when reporting underlying
earnings and related measures in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group on a basis that is
comparable from year to year.

Underlying EBITDA (note 4)
Operating profit before special items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments not recorded as special items. Underlying
EBITDA provides a measure of the absolute growth in the cash generating ability of the business and is used for incentive
purposes.

Underlying operating profit (condensed combined and consolidated income statement)
Operating profit before special items. Underlying operating profit provides a measure of operating performance and absolute
growth in profitability of the operations.

Underlying profit before tax (condensed combined and consolidated income statement)
Profit before tax and special items. Underlying profit before tax provides a measure of the absolute growth in profitability 
before tax.

Underlying earnings (and per share measure) (note 9)
Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders, before special items. Underlying earnings (and the related per share measure
based on the basic, weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding), provides a measure of the Group's absolute growth
in earnings.

Underlying and headline EPS (note 9)
Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure. It is included to provide an additional basis on
which to measure the Group's earnings performance. The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited and is calculated in accordance with Circular 4/2018, 'Headline Earnings', as issued by the South
African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

Cash flow generation
A measurement of the Group's cash generation before considering deployment of cash towards investment in property, plant and
equipment ('capex' or 'capital expenditure'), acquisitions and disposals, payment of dividends to shareholders and injection by or
outflow from purchase of non-controlling interests. Cash flow generation is a measure of the Group's ability to generate cash
through the cycle before considering deployment of such cash.

Underlying EBITDA margin (note 4)
Underlying EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the cash generating ability relative to revenue.

Underlying operating profit margin
Underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of revenue provides a measure of the profitability of the operations relative
to revenue.

Ordinary dividend cover
Basic underlying EPS divided by total ordinary dividend per share paid and proposed provides a measure of the Group's earnings
relative to its deployment towards ordinary dividend payments.

Net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA
Net debt divided by trailing 12-month underlying EBITDA. A measure of the Group's net indebtedness relative to its cash
generating ability.

Effective tax rate (note 8)
Underlying tax charge expressed as a percentage of underlying profit before tax. A measure of the Group's tax charge relative to
its profit before tax expressed on an underlying basis.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue
Working capital, defined as the sum of trade and other receivables and inventories less trade and other payables, expressed as a
percentage of trailing 12-month Group revenue. A measure of the Group's effective use of working capital relative to revenue.

Capex and investment in intangible assets as a percentage of depreciation, amortisation and impairments
Capex and investment in intangible assets divided by depreciation, amortisation and non-special impairments provides a measure
of reinvestment into the Group's asset base relative to depreciation, amortisation and impairments.

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc (together “Mondi Group” or “Mondi”) notify
both the JSE Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters required to be disclosed under the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited and/or the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and/or the Listing Rules
of the United Kingdom Listing Authority.

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of Logging Industries for the Year 2017

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31
December 2017 has been published in accordance with the UK’s Reports on Payments to Governments
Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). This regulation implements the two EU Directives in the UK,
mandating annual reports by companies in the extractives and logging industries of their payments to governments
in countries in which they operate.

To read details of Mondi’s payments to governments go to www.mondigroup.com.

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our logging activities and specifically to the disclosure of
payments to governments relating to the logging of primary forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations definition of ‘primary forest’ being:

‘Naturally regenerated forest of native species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and
the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed’.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ‘IFL 2000’ (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute (WRI) and
Transparent World) inventory of intact forests has been used as the base for reporting on the harvesting of primary
forests in the Komi Republic, Russia (‘Komi’).

Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi fall within the above definition of primary forests. Our
operations in South Africa comprise plantation forests that are not associated with any primary forests and
therefore are excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation. In terms of the Russian Forestry Code and Mondi’s
sustainable development policies all logged areas are naturally regenerated with supplementary plantings of
spruce and pine where required to make up full populations of young trees for the next sustainable forest cycle.
During logging operations protected areas, High Conservation Areas (HCV) areas and sensitive
biotopes, comprising approximately 25% of the area, are naturally set aside for conservation.

Exchange rate

Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group’s reporting currency) are translated for this report
using the average exchange rate during the financial year to which it relates.

Further information
 For further information regarding the Mondi Group’s approach to sustainably managing our forests, please refer to
 our Sustainable development report 2017 which can be found at www.mondigroup.com/sd17 and our sustainable
 forestry policy, one of our issue specific SD policies at www.mondigroup.com/en/sustainability/governance-of-

   For the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 a positive figure was included in respect of taxes
 paid rather than a negative figure to show a tax deduction. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the position has
 been corrected to show a tax deduction, resulting in a lower total payment figure than in previous years.

Mondi Group: Trading update 16 May 2018

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial position since the year
ended 31 December 2017, based on management information up to 31 March 2018 and estimated results
for April 2018. These results have not been audited or reviewed by Mondi’s external auditors.

Reviewed results for the half-year ending 30 June 2018 will be published on 3 August 2018.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or transactions impacting either
the financial performance or financial position of the Group since 31 December 2017 up to the date of this
statement.

Group performance overview

Underlying operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 of €295 million was 15% above the comparable prior
year period (€256 million – restated1) and 6% up on the fourth quarter of 2017 (€279 million - restated1).
Higher average selling prices and profit improvement initiatives across the Group more than offset higher
operating costs, the impact of maintenance shuts and negative currency effects.

Like-for-like sales volumes were stable on the comparable prior year period, with growth in Packaging Paper
offset by lower volumes in Uncoated Fine Paper due to the extended maintenance shut at Richards Bay
(South Africa). Selling prices for the Group’s key paper grades were, on average, above both the comparable
prior year period and the previous quarter as the upward pricing momentum witnessed during 2017
continued.

Costs were generally higher than the comparable prior year period and the previous quarter. Among key
input costs, wood, energy and chemical costs were higher than the comparable prior year period. The
notable exception was paper for recycling costs, where average benchmark European prices were down
15% compared to the first quarter of 2017, and 16% lower sequentially, as the Chinese import ban continued
to impact global trade. Cash fixed costs were higher, largely as a result of the impact of maintenance shuts.

Currency movements had a net negative impact on operating profit versus the comparable prior year period,
driven mainly by a weaker US dollar and Russian rouble relative to the euro, and a net negative impact
when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly as a result of a stronger South African rand.

As previously disclosed, a prolonged maintenance shut at our Richards Bay mill took place during the first
quarter. The estimated impact on operating profit of maintenance shuts completed during the period was
around €35 million (2017: €10 million). Based on prevailing market prices, we estimate that the impact of
maintenance shuts on operating profit for 2018 will be around €115 million (2017: €95 million), slightly above
our previous estimate, of which around half will be incurred in the first half of the year (H1 2017: €40 million).

Business unit overview

In Packaging Paper, containerboard markets remain robust with good demand and limited industry capacity
additions continuing to support pricing. Average selling prices were up significantly on the prior year period
and more modestly up sequentially, on the back of implemented price increases through the course of 2017
and in the first quarter of 2018. Volumes were up on the comparable prior year period due to the timing of
maintenance shuts and the ramp-up of production from expansionary projects completed in 2017.

The sack kraft paper market remains tight, supported by good demand and constrained supply growth. Sales
volumes for sack kraft paper were up compared to the first quarter of 2017, while selling prices were higher
both compared to the comparable prior year period and sequentially following price increases implemented
in all markets from the beginning of the year.

In April 2018, we signed an agreement to sell our flat sack kraft paper mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas (USA),
with 130,000 tonnes annual production capacity, to Twin Rivers Paper Company LLC. The transaction
remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018.

Fibre Packaging made good progress in implementing price increases to compensate for the significantly
higher packaging paper input costs. As previously reported, in Industrial Bags, annual contracts for 2018
were finalised during the first quarter, with price increases implemented that largely reflect the full impact on
the cost base of the paper price increases that took effect from the beginning of the year. Industrial Bags
also benefited from good volume growth, particularly in emerging Europe and the Middle East. In Corrugated
Packaging, good progress has been made in recovering the paper price increases, with efforts in this regard
ongoing, while volumes were flat on a very strong comparable prior year period and pricing discipline.

In April 2018, we signed an agreement to acquire an industrial bags plant near Cairo, Egypt, for a total
consideration of EGP510 million (€24 million) on a debt and cash free-basis. Together with the previously
announced agreement to acquire a control position in another plant near Cairo, this further expands our
production network in the fast growing Middle East region. We anticipate completion of these acquisitions
towards the end of the second quarter.

Consumer Packaging benefited from the ongoing initiatives to improve the product mix and the programme
launched in the second half of 2017 to restructure the cost base, although near term performance continues
to be held back by declining volumes in personal care components and the generally challenging trading
conditions. In continuing to drive performance by aligning capacity to current market requirements, we
initiated a consultation process in April 2018 regarding a plan to cease production at our consumer goods
packaging plant in Scunthorpe (UK) by the end of the year, while continuing to serve our customers from
our other plants.

Uncoated Fine Paper continues to perform strongly, although the first quarter was impacted by ongoing
cost pressures, the extended maintenance shut at our Richards Bay mill and a lower forestry fair value gain,
which more than offset the benefit of higher average selling prices during the quarter. As a result of continued
cost pressures, price increases were implemented on our range of uncoated fine papers from the end of
March 2018. While difficult to estimate, should the strength in the South African rand and current timber
export pricing levels prevail, we would expect a lower forestry fair value gain in 2018 than recorded in the
previous year.

Capital investment projects

We are making good progress on our previously announced major capital investment projects at our Steti
(Czech Republic), Ruzomberok (Slovakia) and Syktyvkar (Russia) mills and the smaller expansionary
projects at a number of our packaging operations. Technical challenges remain in the ramp-up of our rebuilt
paper and inline coating machine at Steti.
Cash flow and financing activities

Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows related to our capital
expenditure programme and financing activities, resulting in a positive cash flow during the quarter and lower
net debt at the end of the quarter compared to restated1 net debt as of 31 December 2017.

Finance charges were lower than the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the redemption of the
5.75% €500 million Eurobond on maturity in April 2017.

In April 2018, we issued a 1.625% €600 million Eurobond with an 8-year term under our Euro Medium Term
Note Programme, thereby extending the Group’s maturity profile and ensuring strong liquidity.

Standard & Poor’s upgraded the Group’s credit rating to BBB+ (stable outlook) from BBB, while we retained
our Baa1 (stable outlook) credit rating by Moody’s Investors Service.

Outlook

Our outlook for the business remains positive. We continue to experience a strong pricing environment in a
number of our key product segments, supported by good demand growth, although we do continue to see
inflationary cost pressures across the Group and currencies are currently a headwind. With our robust
business model, clear customer focus and culture of driving performance, we remain confident of sustaining
our track record of delivering value accretive growth.

Mondi Group – 2017 Final Ordinary and Special Dividends
ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

On 2 March 2018 Mondi Group announced, in its Preliminary
Results announcement, that a proposed final ordinary
dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 42.90 euro
cents per ordinary share will be paid on 25 May 2018 to all
Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on the
relevant registers on 4 May 2018.

In addition, Mondi Group announced that a proposed special
dividend of 100.00 euro cents per ordinary share will be
paid on 25 May 2018 to all Mondi Limited and Mondi plc
ordinary shareholders on the relevant registers on 4 May

The final ordinary and special dividends are subject to the

at the respective annual general meetings scheduled for 16
May 2018.

Mondi Limited and Mondi    plc   will   pay   their   respective
dividends as follows:

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its final ordinary and special
dividends in South African rand cents. The applicable
exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 14.58592.

Therefore, the equivalent gross final ordinary dividend in
rand cents per ordinary share will be 625.73597 and the
equivalent gross special dividend in rand cents per
ordinary share will be 1,458.59200. Dividend tax will be
withheld from Mondi Limited shareholders at a rate of 20%,
unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting
in a net final ordinary dividend of 500.58878 rand cents
per ordinary share      and  a net special    dividend of
1,166.87360 rand cents per ordinary share.

Mondi plc

Mondi plc will pay its final ordinary and special dividends
in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United
Kingdom will receive the final ordinary and special
dividends in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to
receive their dividends in euro). The last date for euro
currency elections will be 4 May 2018. The exchange rate
for this payment will be set on 8 May 2018.

In addition, Mondi plc South African branch register
shareholders will receive the final ordinary and special
dividends in South African rand cents, converted at a rate
of EUR 1 to ZAR 14.58592. Therefore, the equivalent gross
final ordinary dividend in rand cents per ordinary share
will be 625.73597 and the equivalent gross special dividend
in rand cents per ordinary share will be 1,458.59200.
Dividend tax will be withheld from Mondi plc South African
branch register shareholders at a rate of 20%, unless a
shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net
final ordinary dividend of 500.58878 rand cents per
ordinary share and a net special dividend of 1,166.87360
rand cents per ordinary share.

Additional Information

Notes:       
1  The Group presents underlying EBITDA, underlying operating profit and related per share information as non-IFRS measures which exclude 
   special items in order to provide a more effective comparison of the underlying financial performance of the Group and its operating segments 
   between financial reporting periods. This is consistent with the way financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Boards 
   and the DLC executive committee. A reconciliation of Group underlying EBITDA and underlying operating profit to profit before tax is provided 
   in note 3 of the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements. Special items are disclosed in note 4 of the condensed combined and 
   consolidated financial statements and defined in the glossary of terms at the end of this announcement
2  ROCE is underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of the average capital employed for the year, adjusted for spend on major capital 
   expenditure projects which are not yet in operation. ROCE provides a measure of the efficient and effective use of capital in the business and 
   is monitored by the Boards and the DLC executive committee

Peter Oswald, Mondi Group Chief Executive Officer, said:
""I am pleased to report another successful year for Mondi, with underlying operating profit up 4% to EUR1,018 million. We
benefited from good demand and higher average selling prices in most of our businesses, while our continuous drive for
operational performance improvements mitigated the inflationary pressures on our cost base caused by the general
economic recovery.

We continue to make good progress in securing future growth and the ongoing cost competitiveness of our operations
through delivery on our capital expenditure programme. Of the two largest projects currently in progress, the EUR335
million modernisation of our kraft paper facility in Steti (Czech Republic) remains on track, and work to upgrade the pulp
mill at our Ruzomberok mill (Slovakia) has commenced, while we await final permits to proceed with our investment in a
300,000 tonne kraft top white machine at the same site. In addition, we are making good progress on smaller
expansionary capital expenditure projects at a number of our packaging operations. These projects are expected to
contribute to earnings from 2019.

Supported by ongoing good demand, we have seen strong upward momentum in pricing across our key product
segments in Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging over the course of 2017 and into early 2018. We expect continued, but
manageable pressure on the cost base across the Group, a consequence of the turn in the commodity price cycle and the
general economic recovery we are seeing in many of the regions in which we operate. The recent US dollar weakness
coupled with stronger emerging market currencies, most notably the South African rand, are current headwinds.

Our outlook for the business is positive and we remain confident that our consistent and focused strategy, robust
business model centred around our cost advantaged assets, and firm focus on driving performance will sustain our track
record of delivering value accretive growth. The special dividend of 100.0 euro cents per share recommended by our
Boards in addition to the full year ordinary dividend of 62.0 euro cents per share reflects the strength of our financial
position and our continued confidence in the Group's cash generating capacity.""

Group performance review
Our strong performance in 2017 builds on our track record of value accretive growth. Our consistent and focused strategy, robust
business model, integrated approach to sustainability and firm commitment to drive performance all continue to contribute to our
results.

Group revenue of EUR7,096 million was up 7% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue was up 4% due to
higher average selling prices across all our businesses. While volume growth in the paper businesses, Packaging Paper and
Uncoated Fine Paper, was limited due to capacity constraints, we saw good growth in Fibre Packaging, most notably in 
Corrugated Packaging, which achieved like-for-like growth of around 6%. Volumes in Consumer Packaging were impacted by a 
combination of the ongoing challenging trading conditions and a targeted approach to exiting lower margin business.

Underlying operating profit of EUR1,018 million was up 4% on the prior year. Higher selling prices and marginally higher volumes
more than offset higher operating costs, a lower fair value gain on forestry assets (down EUR21 million year-on-year), the impact of
maintenance shuts (up EUR20 million year-on-year) and negative currency effects (estimated around EUR32 million). After taking into
consideration the impact of special items of EUR61 million (2016: EUR38 million), operating profit of EUR957 million was up 1% 
(2016: EUR943 million).

Packaging Paper benefited from higher average selling prices across all key grades only partly offset by higher costs and negative
currency effects. In our Fibre Packaging business, strong volume growth and higher average selling prices were more than offset
by higher packaging paper input costs, negative currency translation effects and ongoing restructuring costs related to our
initiatives to optimise our Industrial Bags network. We continue to make good progress in Consumer Packaging despite the difficult
trading environment, with improved product mix and a positive contribution from acquisitions more than offsetting lower volumes,
marginally higher fixed costs and negative currency effects. In Uncoated Fine Paper, higher average selling prices and stable
volumes during the period were offset by the lower forestry fair value gain and higher costs.

Our passion for performance will always be central to the way we run our business - from our focus on commercial excellence and
lean processes, to rigorous quality management and operational excellence programmes that enhance productivity and efficiency.
We invest in our existing operations and, where appropriate, in acquisitions. We aim to acquire businesses that responsibly
produce high-quality products with sustainable competitive advantage and the potential to achieve world class operating
standards. This enables us to generate synergies through integration, enhance our product and service offering and/or extend our
geographic reach to better serve our customers.

In February 2017 we acquired Excelsior Technologies, further supporting the development of Consumer Packaging and in
December 2017 we signed an agreement to acquire Powerflute, an integrated pulp and paper mill in Kuopio (Finland) with an
annual production capacity of 285,000 tonnes of high-performance semi-chemical fluting for EUR365 million on a debt and cash-free
basis. Powerflute's semi-chemical fluting is sold to a diverse range of customers, primarily for packaging fresh fruit and vegetables,
but also other end-uses such as electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Around half of the company's production is sold in
Europe, while the remainder is exported globally. We anticipate completion of this transaction in the first half of 2018, subject to
competition clearance and customary closing conditions.

The impact of maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit in 2017 was around EUR95 million (2016: EUR75 million), slightly above
our previous expectation of EUR90 million. Based on prevailing market prices, we estimate that the impact of maintenance
shuts on underlying operating profit in 2018 will be around EUR110 million, of which the first half effect is estimated at around
EUR55 million (2017: EUR40 million). This includes the effects of a prolonged shut at our Richards Bay facility (South Africa)
following a technical incident in mid-February, which halted production for three weeks longer than was planned for the annual
maintenance shut.

We saw input cost inflation across our businesses as a consequence of a general rise in commodity prices and the economic
upturn in many of the markets in which we operate. Wood costs were generally higher in local currency terms in central Europe
and Russia, compounded by stronger emerging market currencies when translated into euros. Wood supply was disrupted in
northern and central Europe due to wet weather conditions during the fourth quarter of 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018.
While the situation is expected to normalise as weather conditions improve, any prolonged disruption is likely to have a negative
impact on logistics costs and wood availability in the region in the short term. Average benchmark paper for recycling costs were
up around 12% on 2016. Prices increased during the first three quarters of the year on the back of strong demand, but declined
sharply during the fourth quarter due to lower demand from China following policy changes affecting paper for recycling imports.
Energy input costs were higher than the prior year due to higher average crude oil and gas prices. Polyethylene prices were stable
year-on-year, with slightly lower average prices during the second half. Labour costs were higher, particularly in central and
eastern Europe, Russia and South Africa. Looking forward, rising commodity input costs, temporary wood supply disruptions in
northern and central Europe and the ongoing economic growth and related inflationary pressures in a number of regions in which
we operate are expected to continue to put upward pressure on our cost base.

Currency movements had a net negative impact on underlying operating profit. The net positive impact of a stronger rouble on
translation of our domestically focused Uncoated Fine Paper business was more than offset by the impact of the stronger South
African rand and various central European currencies on margins from our export oriented businesses in these regions. The
weaker US dollar had a net negative impact on our second half results.

Cash generated from operations of EUR1,325 million (2016: EUR1,401 million), including the impact of an increase in working capital,
reflects the continued strong cash generating capability of the Group. Net debt reduced by EUR57 million to EUR1,326 million or 0.9
times net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA.

Underlying basic earnings of 149.5 euro cents per share were up 8% compared to 2016. After taking the effect of special items into
account, basic earnings of 138.6 euro cents per share were up 5% compared to 2016.

Our Boards have recommended payment of a final ordinary dividend of 42.90 euro cents per share, bringing the total ordinary
dividend for the year to 62.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 9% on 2016.

Given our strong financial position and confidence in the Group's cash generating capacity, the Boards have recommended a
special dividend of 100.0 euro cents per share, in addition to the recommended final ordinary dividend.

Packaging Paper's underlying operating profit was up 21% on the prior year driven by significantly higher average selling prices
and sales volume growth in higher value added products, partly offset by higher costs and negative currency effects.

Strong demand, limited industry capacity additions and lower kraftliner imports drove up European containerboard prices over the
course of the year, although the magnitude of the increases varied by grade. Average benchmark European prices for unbleached
kraftliner were up 13% year-on-year, and up 16% in the second half when compared to the first half of the year, while benchmark
recycled containerboard prices were up around 10% over the same period. By contrast, white top kraftliner prices and semi-
chemical fluting were up in the range of 2% to 3% year-on-year.

In response to continued strong demand driven by a generally positive economic environment and ongoing growth in e-commerce,
price increases in the range of EUR30 to EUR50 per tonne were implemented in Europe across all containerboard grades during January
and February 2018.

We saw good demand across our kraft paper grades during the year, while sack kraft paper prices were up around 5% to 6% on
average year-on-year. Given good demand, particularly in export markets, we implemented sack kraft paper price increases in all markets 
from the beginning of 2018, resulting in increases in the range of 8% to 9% compared to average 2017 price levels.

Demand across our range of speciality kraft papers was good and prices were, on average, higher than in the prior year.

Input costs were generally higher than the prior year with higher paper for recycling, wood, chemical, energy and transport costs.
Cash fixed costs also increased on higher maintenance costs and inflationary cost pressures. As a result of recent capital
investments, the depreciation charge was higher than the comparable period.

We completed a project-related shut at our Swiecie mill (Poland) and a planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill (Russia)
during the first half of the year. A further planned maintenance shut at Swiecie and the majority of our kraft paper mill shuts were
completed in the second half. Maintenance shuts are planned at our Syktyvkar and Richards Bay mills for the first half of 2018 while 
the majority of the remaining shuts are scheduled for the second half of the year, including an extended shut at our Steti mill as we 
progress to commission the major capital project at that operation.

Fibre Packaging's underlying operating profit was down 10% on the prior year to EUR111 million. Strong volume growth, higher
average selling prices and the positive impact from our 2016 acquisitions in Corrugated Packaging were more than offset by higher
packaging paper input costs, negative currency translation effects and restructuring costs related to our initiatives to optimise our
Industrial Bags network in Europe and North America.

Corrugated Packaging achieved strong organic volume growth of 6%, driven by good market growth across the central and
eastern European region, continued growth in e-commerce activity and a recovery in Turkey. Our recently completed capital
investments across our corrugated operations to broaden our capabilities to meet our customers increasingly sophisticated product
and service needs were instrumental in achieving this growth. Good progress was made during the year in implementing price
increases required to compensate for the significantly higher paper costs. Our efforts in this area are ongoing. We anticipate
continued short-term margin pressure, given the normal delay in passing on paper price increases compounded by the
containerboard price increases implemented early in 2018.

Industrial Bags sales volumes were up 2% on average, driven by strong growth in eastern Europe, Russia, Africa and South East
Asia, partly offset by weaker western European and North American volumes. Price increases were achieved in the early part of
the year to compensate for higher paper input costs, although margins came under pressure during the second half as higher
paper prices, following mid-year increases, could not be fully passed on to customers given the majority of industrial bag contracts
are fixed on an annual basis. Strong cost management and the benefit of recent rationalisation activities resulted in significant fixed
cost savings during the period. We continue to work on optimising our production network to serve our customers more efficiently.
During the year we closed two plants in Europe and a plant in the US, while continuing to serve our customers from other sites. To
further expand our network in the fast growing Middle East region, we signed an agreement to buy a control position in a plant near
Cairo in Egypt. The acquisition is expected to complete during the first half of 2018. Annual contracts for 2018 have been finalised,
with price increases implemented that largely reflect the full impact on the cost base of the recent paper price increases.

Underlying operating profit increased 9% on the prior year to EUR132 million, with improved product mix, one-off gains and a positive
contribution from acquisitions more than offsetting lower like-for-like sales volumes, higher fixed costs and negative currency
effects.

During the year we continued with our initiatives to improve the product mix by focusing on increasing our sales in value-added
segments while exiting lower margin business, although this was hindered by declining volumes in personal care components.
We also benefited from the successful integration of Kalenobel in Turkey and Uralplastic in Russia, both acquired in July 2016, 
and Excelsior Technologies in the UK, acquired in early 2017, further supporting the development of this business.

Our focus to drive Consumer Packaging's performance continues in what remains a challenging trading environment. During the
year we closed a release liner plant in the US and in the second half we launched a programme to restructure the cost base and
align capacity to current market requirements. This included the closure of a plant in Poland, streamlining the UK operations and
reducing the fixed cost base across the business. We are also making good progress on our various commercial excellence and
innovation initiatives, aimed at improving our product and service offering to our customers.

The environmental impact of Mondi's plastic-based flexible packaging offering is important for us. In line with Mondi's Growing
Responsibly model, we have worked on improving our energy efficiency and waste to landfill. We are also working with our
customers to find innovative solutions that improve the sustainability of their products and packaging. Our commitment to work
collaboratively with other stakeholders has led us to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy Initiative this
year. This is an ambitious, three-year initiative to mobilise the transition towards a global plastics system, based on circular
economy principles.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business delivered another strong performance, generating underlying operating profit of EUR331 million
and ROCE of 27.8%. Higher average selling prices were achieved across all regions on stable volumes, partly offsetting the negative
impact of a lower fair value gain on our forestry assets (down EUR21 million year-on-year) and higher costs.

We estimate European market demand was flat year-on-year, above our expected long-term trend of 1% to 2% decline per annum.
Demand in Russia and South Africa was in line with our long-term estimate of 0% to 1% growth per annum.

Average benchmark European uncoated fine paper selling prices were similar to the prior year and 2% up in the second half of the
year compared to the first half following the implementation of price increases during the period. Supported by steady demand,
reduced imports, supply disruptions in Europe and cost pressures, a price increase of up to 5% was implemented in January 2018.
Uncoated fine paper domestic selling prices were increased in Russia and South Africa towards the end of 2017 to offset domestic
inflation. Further price increases have been announced across our range of uncoated fine papers in Europe, Russia and South Africa 
for implementation from the end of March 2018. Discussions are underway and the actual price increase achieved remains subject to 
individual negotiations with customers.

Generally rising commodity prices saw an increase in input costs, most notably for wood and energy in Europe and South Africa.
Higher maintenance costs, inflationary cost pressures on the cash fixed cost base and a higher depreciation charge were also
seen across the business, mitigated by our continued focus on driving operational excellence.

Due to the accelerated rate of local demand decline, we ceased production of newsprint at our Merebank mill (South Africa) at the
end of the year. During the third quarter we restarted an idled uncoated fine paper machine at the same site which will produce
annually around 70,000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper to serve the local market.

The forestry assets fair value is dependent on a variety of external factors over which we have limited control, the most significant
being the export price of timber and the exchange rate. Moderate increases in export prices, resulted in a fair value gain of EUR43
million being recognised in the year, EUR21 million lower than the unusually high gain recognised in the prior year. While difficult to
estimate, should the current strength in the South Africa rand prevail, we would expect a significantly lower fair value gain in 2018.

Planned maintenance shuts were completed at Syktyvkar in the first half of the year, and at Ruzomberok and Neusiedler (Austria)
in the second half of the year. In 2018, our Syktyvkar and Richards Bay shuts are planned for the first half of the year and the
remaining shuts are scheduled for the second half.

Special items
The net special item charge of EUR61 million before tax (2016: EUR38 million) comprised the following by business unit:
 -  Packaging Paper: partial impairment of kraft paper assets in the US of EUR16 million and partial reversal of the impairment
    of a kraft paper mill in Bulgaria of EUR14 million. Release of restructuring and closure provisions of EUR5 million on finalisation
    of the sale of a kraft paper mill in Finland.
 -  Consumer Packaging: restructuring and closure costs of EUR22 million and related impairment of EUR28 million as a result of
    the restructuring of this business. Recognition of a EUR1 million gain on the release of a restructuring and closure provision
    following the finalisation of a release liner plant closure in the US.
 -  Uncoated Fine Paper: restructuring costs of EUR7 million and related impairment of EUR8 million following the closure of a
    newsprint machine at our Merebank mill.

Further detail is provided in note 4 of our condensed combined and consolidated financial statements.

Tax
Based on our geographic profit mix and the applicable tax rates, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%. However, we
benefited from tax incentives related to our capital investments mainly in Poland and Russia. In addition, we recognised deferred
tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses which we now expect to be able to utilise in the coming years. As such,
our underlying tax charge for 2017 of EUR181 million (2016: EUR166 million) reflects an effective tax rate of 19%, consistent with 2016.
Tax relief on special items amounted to EUR8 million (2016: EUR9 million).

Tax paid in 2017 of EUR151 million (2016: EUR173 million) is lower than the 2017 charge due to final tax payments for 2017 becoming
payable in 2018.

Going forward, assuming a similar profit mix, we would anticipate upward pressure on the tax rate over the next three years as it
moves towards the expected tax rate of 22%.

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations of EUR1,325 million (2016: EUR1,401 million), including the impact of an increase in working capital,
reflects the continued strong cash generating capability of the Group.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 12.7%, marginally up on the prior year (12.0%). The net cash outflow from
movements in working capital during the year was EUR122 million (2016: inflow of EUR68 million).

We paid dividends of EUR273 million to external shareholders (2016: EUR274 million). Interest paid of EUR83 million 
(2016: EUR82 million) was in line with the prior year.

In 2017, capital expenditure amounted to EUR611 million (2016: EUR465 million) and we completed the acquisition of Excelsior
Technologies Limited with a total purchase price, on a debt and cash-free basis, of EUR40 million.

In April 2017, we paid the final coupon and redeemed the 5.75% 2017 EUR500 million Eurobond on maturity.

Capital investments
Investing in our cost advantaged asset base to maintain and enhance our competitiveness is of particular importance for our pulp
and paper operations where products are generally more standardised and relative cost competitiveness is a key value driver. We
focus on enhancing our cost competitiveness, improving energy efficiency, reducing waste and emissions and driving organic
growth.

Our disciplined approach to investigating, approving and executing capital projects is one of our key strengths and plays an
important role in successfully delivering strong returns through the cycle. Over the last four years, our major capital projects have
contributed around EUR175 million of incremental operating profit, including EUR25 million in 2017. We expect to generate a further
EUR15 million in 2018.

In the first half of 2017, we commissioned the final phase of our EUR260 million investment programme in Swiecie. This project
provides an additional 100,000 tonnes per annum of softwood kraft pulp forward integrated to 80,000 tonnes per annum of light-
weight kraftliner and an increased share of kraft top liner. We continue to see progress in ramping up production of the requisite
quality at our rebuilt paper and inline coating machine at Steti although technical challenges remain.

We have a strong major capital expenditure project pipeline totalling over EUR750 million, securing future growth:
-   We are making good progress on the EUR335 million modernisation of our Steti mill to replace the recovery boiler, rebuild the
    fibre lines and debottleneck the existing packaging paper machines. Start-up is anticipated in late 2018. During the year
    we also completed the EUR41 million woodyard upgrade and bleaching line modernisation at this mill.
-   The European Commission approved EUR49 million in tax incentives for our EUR310 million investment in a new 300,000 tonne
    per annum kraft top white machine and related pulp mill upgrade at our Ruzomberok mill. Work on the pulp mill upgrade
    has commenced, with start-up expected in late 2019. The investment in the paper machine remains subject to obtaining
    necessary permitting with start-up expected in 2020.
-   As part of our plan to maintain Syktyvkar's competitiveness and increase saleable production by around 100,000 tonnes per annum in the 
    medium term, we are investing to debottleneck production and avoid unplanned shutdowns.
-   We continue to invest in our Fibre Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses to enhance our product and service offering.

Our major capital projects in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia will increase our current saleable pulp and paper
production by around 9% when in full operation.

Given the approved project pipeline and in the absence of any other major investment, our capital expenditure is expected to be in
the range of EUR700-800 million per annum in 2018 and 2019 as expenditure on these large projects accelerates.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was down EUR57 million at EUR1,326 million (2016: EUR1,383 million), reflecting our strong cash generating
capacity despite our ongoing capital expenditure programme.

The Group's liquidity position remains robust. At the end of the year, EUR791 million of our EUR2.0 billion committed debt facilities
remained undrawn. The weighted average maturity of committed debt facilities was 3.8 years at 31 December 2017. Gearing at the
same date was 24.7% and our net debt to 12-month trailing underlying EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times, well within our key financial
covenant requirement of 3.5 times.

In the second half of the year, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the Group's credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1 (stable outlook).
Our BBB credit rating from Standard & Poor's was reaffirmed and put on positive outlook during the year.

Net finance costs of EUR71 million were EUR30 million lower than the previous year, primarily due to the repayment in April of the 5.75%
2017 EUR500 million Eurobond and lower average net debt. Average net debt of EUR1,376 million was 7% lower than the prior year and
our effective interest rate was 4.5% (2016: 6.2%).

Growing Responsibly
Our people are important to us, and we want to develop a fair, safe and diverse workplace that supports us in delivering our
strategy. We want to inspire innovation and creativity in our people, and to ensure that everyone returns home safely to their
families every day.

We are deeply saddened to have had two fatalities in 2017 and one employee missing (presumed deceased) in our Syktyvkar
operation. In February, a contractor lost his life in our South African forestry operations following a timber vehicle incident; and in
August, an employee lost his life at our Tire Box operation (Turkey) during electrical fault finding activities at a bundle-strapping
machine. We also regret that we had three life-altering injuries during the year.

With zero harm our ultimate goal, we continue to work very hard to eliminate fatal and life-altering injuries. Our focus on the top
fatal risks at all operations has allowed us to better anticipate and manage our highest risk activities - which usually occur during
annual maintenance shuts and project implementation. We remain determined to focus on top risks so that fatalities and life-
altering injuries are not a part of our future. In 2017, we introduced a new 24-hour mindset approach, designed to help shape a
culture where we act safely in everything we do. It is encouraging that the steps we have taken resulted in an improved Total
Recordable Case Rate in 2017 to 0.60 from 0.66 in 2016 and a 21% reduction against our 2015 baseline of 0.76 (which has been
adjusted to include acquisitions).

We believe that being part of the solution to global sustainability challenges will secure the long-term success of our business and
the wellbeing of our communities and other stakeholders. We address the risks and opportunities that arise from global
environmental and societal trends, so that we retain our competitive edge and generate value for our stakeholders long into the
future.

We have a strong track record of delivering on our sustainability commitments, as reflected in our performance across the 10
action areas of our Growing Responsibly model, which saw excellent improvements in safety, increasing sustainable fibre, and
reducing carbon emissions, other air and water emissions, and waste. Built on our past achievements and designed for our future
success, our Growing Responsibly model provides the business with a formal structure to demonstrate, monitor and improve the
way sustainability is embedded in the business. The model includes 16 commitments to 2020 (the climate commitment runs to
2030) across 10 action areas.

In addition to committing to clear sustainability targets, we also believe that working collaboratively with stakeholders across the
entire value chain is key to ensuring long-term value creation and addressing shared challenges. In 2014, Mondi entered into a
three-year global partnership with WWF, focusing on promoting environmental stewardship in the packaging and paper sector. In
2017, we extended this global partnership by a further three years to 2020. Phase II of the partnership will embed and extend
Mondi's stewardship of forests, climate and energy and freshwater.

With the resultant strong focus on a safe, fair and diverse workforce, working towards a more transparent and responsible supply
chain, and continued commitment to minimising our climate footprint, we are able to address risks and opportunities across our
business. A number of our current and planned capital expenditure projects will contribute to meeting our Growing Responsibly
commitments, particularly those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and waste reduction. We are pleased our total specific CO2e
emissions (in tonnes per tonne of saleable production) have declined to 0.72, a 15% reduction against the 2014 baseline, as we
continue to make progress in making our business less carbon intensive. The contribution of biomass-based renewable energy to
the total fuel consumption of our mills has increased from 59% in 2014 to 65% in 2017. We have adopted a new science-based
greenhouse gas target to reduce our production related total scope 1 and 2 GHG emission intensity to 0.25 tonnes of CO2e per
tonne of saleable production by 2050 against a 2014 baseline of 0.59.

Dividend

The boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc's aim is to offer shareholders long-term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted
dividend cover range of two to three times over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and the Boards' stated
objective to increase distributions to shareholders through the ordinary dividend, the Boards have recommended an increase in the
final ordinary dividend to 42.90 euro cents per share (2016: 38.19 euro cents per share). The final ordinary dividend, together 
with the interim ordinary dividend of 19.10 euro cents per share, paid on 19 September 2017, amount to a total ordinary dividend 
for the year of 62.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 9% on the 2016 total ordinary dividend of 57.0 euro cents per share.

The Boards regularly review the Group's capital allocation priorities to optimise value accretive growth and long-term returns for
shareholders. Our strong cash generation has allowed us to reinvest to grow the business and sustain a cost advantaged position,
while supporting growth in the ordinary dividend and deleveraging the balance sheet. As a result, our balance sheet leverage is
well within our stated policy of maintaining investment grade credit metrics. Given the confidence in the Group's ongoing cash
generating capacity, the Boards have decided to recommend a special dividend of 100.0 euro cents per share in addition to the
recommended final ordinary dividend. In coming to this view, the Boards have taken full account of the Group's access to funding
and development plans, including ongoing expansionary capital expenditure programmes and the possibility of further small to
mid-sized acquisitions over the coming years.

The final ordinary dividend and the special dividend are subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi Limited and 
Mondi plc at the respective Annual General Meetings scheduled for 16 May 2018 and if approved are payable on 25 May 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 4 May 2018.

Outlook
Supported by ongoing good demand, we have seen strong upward momentum in pricing across our key product segments in
Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging over the course of 2017 and into early 2018. We expect continued, but manageable
pressure on the cost base across the Group, a consequence of the turn in the commodity price cycle and the general economic
recovery we are seeing in many of the regions in which we operate. The recent US dollar weakness coupled with stronger
emerging market currencies, most notably the South African rand, are current headwinds.

Our outlook for the business is positive and we remain confident that our consistent and focused strategy, robust business
model centred around our cost advantaged assets, and firm focus on driving performance will sustain our track record of delivering
value accretive growth. The special dividend of 100.0 euro cents per share recommended by our Boards in addition to the full
year ordinary dividend of 62.0 euro cents per share reflects the strength of our financial position and our continued confidence in
the Group's cash generating capacity.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. They
have put procedures in place for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks that the Group faces. In combination
with the audit committee, the Boards have conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which Mondi is exposed and
they are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk tolerance levels
established.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business, and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes. Our internal control environment is designed to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to provide reasonable assurance that the Group's business objectives will be achieved. In
considering the ever increasing competition for talent in a number of the markets in which the Group operates, the Boards have
included attraction and retention of key skills and talent as a significant risk, as the only change from the prior year.

Strategic risks
The industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long-term risks which are accepted by the Boards as a
consequence of the Group's chosen strategy and operating footprint.

While there have been no significant changes in our strategic risk exposure during the year, we continue to monitor recent capacity
announcements and the developments in the process as the UK seeks to exit the European Union.

The executive committee and Boards monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall
exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate
exposure to such risks.

Industry productive capacity
Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills. New capacity additions are usually in large increments
which, through their impact on the supply/demand balance, influence market prices. Unless market growth exceeds capacity
additions, excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices. In our converting operations investments in newer technology may
lower operating costs and provide increased product functionality increasing competition and impacting margins.

We monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity and utilisation levels, as well as trends and developments in our
own product markets. We routinely review our asset portfolio and capacity utilisation levels to drive performance and safeguard our
assets. Our strategic focus on production at low cost and innovation activities to achieve cost advantages and produce higher
value added responsibly produced and sustainable products, combined with our focus on growing markets and consistent
investment in our operating capacity, ensures that we can remain competitive.

Product substitution
Changing global socio-economic and demographic trends and consumption patterns and increased public awareness of
sustainability challenges affect the demand for Mondi's products. Customers' needs and purchasing power are changing in
emerging markets. Substitution may be to different products not produced by Mondi or to different solutions meeting the same
customer requirement.

Factors that may positively or negatively impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials,
increased use of recycled materials, electronic substitution of paper products, substitution of plastic packaging, increased
demand for high-quality printed material, certified and responsibly produced goods, and specific material qualities.

Our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new
products on a sustainable, competitive and cost-effective basis. Opportunities also exist for us to take market share from
substitutes produced by our competitors. Our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics and growing regional
markets as we work with our customers to develop new markets and new products. Our broad range of converting products
provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic-based packaging products.

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins
Our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and demand for our products, which are, in turn, influenced by
macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending preferences, and inventory levels maintained by our customers.

Changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied
significantly over time. Gross margins in our downstream converting operations are impacted by fluctuations in key input costs
which cannot be passed on to customers in all cases.

Our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation,
proximity or production cost. We continue to invest in our high-quality, cost advantaged asset base to ensure we maintain our
competitive cost position and continue to further develop businesses with better long term fundamentals. We are committed to
meeting service levels and product quality requirements. Our high levels of vertical integration reduce our exposure to price
volatility of our key input costs. In our downstream operations the focus is on passing through our main material costs to sales
prices. Our financial policies and structures take the inherent price volatility of the markets in which we operate into consideration.

Country risk
We have production operations across more than 30 countries; some in jurisdictions where the political, economic and legal
systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic upheaval,
inflation, changes in laws, nationalisation, or expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations in those
countries. Uncertainties remain over the outcomes of the UK's decision to exit from the European Union.

We actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate. Regular formal and informal interaction with government
officials, local communities and business partners assist us to remain abreast of changes and new developments. The Boards
have approved specific country risk premiums to be added to the required returns on investment projects in those countries where
risks are deemed to be higher and new investments are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation.

Where we have large operations in higher risk locations, we maintain a permanent internal audit presence and operate asset
protection units. We are in the process of reviewing how we assess, monitor and manage risks in our supply chain, including the
use of country-based risk assessment tools and databases. Our geographic diversity and decentralised management structure,
utilising local resources in countries in which we operate, reduces our exposure to any specific jurisdiction.

Financial risks
We aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance 
with all laws and regulations.

Despite ongoing short-term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies, our overall
residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years, reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management.

Capital structure
A strong and stable financial position increases our flexibility and provides us with the ability to take advantage of strategic
opportunities as they arise. Our ability to raise debt and/or equity financing is significantly influenced by general economic
conditions, developments in credit markets, equity market volatility, and our credit rating. Failure to obtain financing at reasonable
rates could prevent us from realising our strategy and have a negative impact on our competitive position.

We operate a central treasury function under a board-approved treasury policy. We provide regular reporting to the Boards on our
treasury management policies. Compliance with treasury policies at operating level is monitored by our central treasury function
and we engage external advisors to review our central treasury function. We aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
we have access to a variety of sources of funding with varying maturities.

Currency risk
We operate in more than 30 countries and are thus exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates. The impact of
currency fluctuations affects us because of mismatches between the currencies in which our operating costs are incurred and
those in which revenues are received.

Key operating cost currencies that are not fully offset by local currency denominated revenues include the South African rand,
Polish zloty, Swedish krona, and Czech koruna; while the revenues generated in US dollar, Russian rouble and UK pound
sterling are greater than operating costs incurred in those currencies. In addition, appreciation of the euro compared with the
currencies of the other key paper producing regions or paper pricing currencies, notably the US dollar, would reduce the
competitiveness of the products Mondi produces in Europe compared with imports from such key paper-producing regions which
could potentially lead to lower revenues and earnings.

We fund our entities in their local currencies to minimise translation risk. This exposes us to interest rate risk from these
currencies which we aim to manage through interest rate swaps and fixed rate borrowings. Balance sheet exposure and material
forecast future capital expenditure transactions are hedged. We do not permit speculative currency positions. We do not hedge
our exposure to projected future sales or purchases and our businesses respond to currency fluctuations through changes in
selling prices or increasing the level of exports where competitiveness improves as currencies weaken. Our strategic focus on
sustainable value and driving performance along the value chain provides inherent cost advantages, protecting us from adverse
currency fluctuations.

Tax risk
We operate in a number of countries - all with different tax systems. We make significant intragroup charges, the basis for which is
subject to review during tax audits. In addition, the international tax environment is becoming more onerous, requiring increasing
transparency and reporting and in-depth scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies.

The Boards have approved the Group's Tax Policy. We aim to manage our affairs conservatively and our operations are structured
tax efficiently to take advantage of available incentives and exemptions. We have dedicated tax resources throughout the Group
supported by a centralised Group tax team. We obtain external advisory opinions for all major tax projects, such as acquisitions
and restructuring activities, and make use of external benchmarks where possible. Arm's length principles are applied in the pricing
of all intragroup transactions in accordance with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines.

Operational risks
A low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence, investment in our people and
commitment to the responsible use of resources.

Our investments to improve our energy efficiency, engineer out our most significant safety risks, improve operating efficiencies,
and renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events. However, the potential impact of any such
event remains unchanged.

Cost and availability of raw materials
Access to sustainable sources of raw materials is essential to our operations. We have access to our own sources of wood in
Russia and South Africa and we purchase wood, paper for recycling, pulp, and polymers for film production to meet our needs in
the balance of our operations. Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced quantities of available wood
supply that meet our standards for chain-of-custody certified or controlled wood, and initiatives to promote the use of wood as a
renewable energy source.

We are committed to acquiring our raw materials from sustainable, responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial
or illegal supply. We are involved in multi-stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for
sustainable, responsible fibre and we encourage legislation supporting the local collection of recycled materials. The sustainable
management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall environmental impact, helping to protect ecosystems, and
developing resilient landscapes. We have built strong forestry management resources in Russia and South Africa to actively
monitor and manage our wood resources in those countries. We continue to certify our forests with credible external certifications.
We have multiple suppliers for each of our operations and our centralised procurement teams work closely with our operations in
actively pursuing longer term agreements with strategic suppliers. We have developed an internal monitoring and risk assessment
system to understand and manage the performance of our suppliers and their adherence to our Suppliers' Code of Conduct. We
are working to improve our understanding and management of sustainability risks within our supply chain. We support the
introduction of legislation to address human rights issues, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and are committed to
achieving more transparency in the supply chain to address the risks.

Energy security and related input costs
Mondi is a significant consumer of electricity which is generated internally and purchased from external suppliers. Where we do not
generate electricity from biomass and by-products of our production processes, we are dependent on external suppliers for raw
materials such as gas, oil and coal. Increasing energy costs contribute significantly to increasing chemical, fuel, and transportation
costs which are often difficult to pass on to customers. As an energy-intensive business, we face potential physical and regulatory
risks related to climate change.

We monitor our electricity usage, carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy. Most of our larger operations have high
levels of electricity self-sufficiency. We focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations by investing in improvements to
our energy profile and increased electricity self-sufficiency, while reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon emission levels.
Where we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, we may sell such surplus externally. We also generate income
from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations at prices determined in the open market. We focus on optimising
the use of biomass-based fuels in order to reduce our use of fossil-based energy sources.

Technical integrity of our operating assets
We have five major mills which account for approximately 75% of our total pulp and paper production capacity, and a significant
consumer packaging manufacturing facility in Germany. If operations at any of these key facilities are interrupted for any significant
length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance. Accidents or incidents such as fires,
explosions, or large machinery breakdowns or the inability of our assets to perform the required function effectively and efficiently
whilst protecting people, business, the environment and stakeholders could result in property damage, loss of production,
reputational damage, and/or safety incidents.

Our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity, and our
proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to improve production reliability and minimise breakdown risks. We conduct
detailed risk assessments of our high-priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the ongoing
management and maintenance of such equipment. We actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to
share lessons learnt across our operations, identify emerging issues, conduct benchmarking, and evaluate the effectiveness of our
risk reduction activities. Our Fire Protection programme is supported by independent loss prevention audits and we take out
property insurance cover for key risks.

Environmental impact
We operate in an environmentally high-impact sector and need to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Our operations
are water, carbon and energy intensive; consume materials such as fibre, polymers, metals and chemicals; and generate
emissions to air, water and land. We are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land. We consider potential
impacts on constrained resources, loss of biodiversity and ecosystems negatively impacted by our forestry and manufacturing
operations. We are subject to a wide range of international, national and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the
requirements of our customers and expectations of our broader stakeholders. Costs of continuing compliance, potential restoration
and clean-up activities, and increasing costs from the effects of emissions have an adverse impact on our profitability. The impacts
of climate change such as rising frequency and intensity of water shortages, floods and storms worldwide and pests and diseases
also have the potential to impact on our operations and forests.

We ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements where we operate. Our own
policies and procedures, at or above local policy requirements, are embedded in all our operations and are supported through the
use of externally accredited environmental management systems. We focus on a clean production philosophy to address the
impact from emissions, discharge, and waste. We emphasise the responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems
and protect high conservation value areas. We ensure that we manage our forests responsibly and implement measures to protect
biodiversity. We collaborate with stakeholders to contribute to addressing sustainability challenges such as creating a circular
economy for plastics. We undertake compliance assessments in relation to regulatory requirements such as the EU Industry
Emissions and Energy Efficiency Directives to determine future investment requirements.

Employee and contractor safety
We operate large facilities, often in remote locations. Accidents/incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors, property
damage, lost production time, and/or harm to our reputation. Risks include: fatalities, serious injuries, illness, disease, and
substance abuse.

We have a goal of zero harm and aim to continuously advance our 24-hour safety mindset and safety culture. We continually
monitor incidents and close calls and actively transfer learnings across our operations. We apply an externally accredited safety
management system and conduct regular audits of our operations to ensure our facilities remain fit-for-purpose. We have
implemented a project to engineer out the most significant risks in our operations supported by robust controls and procedures for
operating those assets. We provide extensive training to ensure that performance standards and practice notes are communicated
and understood and our incentives are impacted by the non-achievement of safety milestones.

Attraction and retention of key skills and talent
Our success is driven by our people. Key to our long-term success is attracting, retaining, recruiting and developing a skilled and
committed workforce. Access to the right skills, particularly management and technical skills is critical to support the performance
and growth of our business. Operations in remote locations make attracting and retaining skilled employees challenging. Losing
skills or failing to attract new talent to our business has the potential to undermine our ability to drive performance and deliver on
our strategic objectives.

Our culture and values play a key role in empowering and inspiring our people. These are highlighted by various Inspire
Programmes and collaboration initiatives throughout our operations. We have a zero tolerance policy towards discrimination and
we provide equal opportunities for all employees. To attract skills and talent we are investing in employer branding. We have
implemented measures to monitor and manage succession planning, staff turnover, internal placements and training. We are
engaged in fair and transparent recruitment practices, and have reviewed and updated our diversity as well as our labour and
human rights policies. We ensure competitive compensation levels through benchmarking and continue to support and invest in
Group-wide as well as local training programmes. We regularly conduct performance and development reviews at a local level
and carry out a Group-wide employee survey approximately every two years. Through a confidential reporting hotline Speakout,
employees can raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our values.

Compliance risks
We have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks. Our strong culture and values, emphasised in every part of our business,
with a focus on integrity, honesty and transparency, underpins our approach.

Reputational risk
Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct in any of the
jurisdictions in which we operate and within our supply chain could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. Failure to
successfully manage relationships with our stakeholders could disrupt our operations and adversely impact the Group's reputation.
These requirements include laws relating to the environment, exports, price controls, taxation, competition compliance, human
rights, and labour. Fines imposed by authorities for non-compliance are severe and, in some cases, legislation can result in
criminal sanction for entities and individuals found guilty. Areas of weaker governance also present the challenge of addressing
potential human rights issues in our operations and supply chain. The introduction of human rights legislation, such as of the UK
Modern Slavery Act 2015 has further highlighted the need to identify and address potential risks of child labour, forced or bonded
labour and human trafficking in our supply chain.

We operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported by self-certification and reporting, with personal
sanction for failure to comply with Group policies. Our legal and governance compliance is supported by a centralised legal
compliance team and is subject to regular internal audit review. We engage with our stakeholders through formal and informal
processes such as our Socio-economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT) and Community Engagement Plans. We have a confidential
reporting hotline, Speakout, enabling employees, customers, suppliers, managers and other stakeholders to raise concerns about
conduct that may be contrary to our values. We increasingly work with our suppliers to identify and assess risks and promote
responsible business conduct in the value chain.

Information technology risk
Many of our operations are dependent on the availability of IT services and an extended interruption of such services may result in
plant shutdown and an inability to meet customer requirements. Cyber crime continues to increase and attempts are increasingly
sophisticated, with the consequences of successful attacks including compromised data, financial fraud, and system shutdowns.

We have a comprehensive IT Security Policy approved by our Boards. We conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external
providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures. Where possible, we have redundancies in place, our system
landscape is based on well-proven products, and we have cyber crime insurance. We operate an extensive training and
awareness programme for all our users.

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget, considered the assumptions contained in the budget, and reviewed the significant
risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current macroeconomic
environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the annual financial
statements. At 31 December 2017, Mondi had EUR791 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have
maturity dates of between 1 and 8 years, with a weighted average maturity of 3.8 years.

Based on our evaluation the Boards considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017

1 Basis of preparation
The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company (DLC)
structure. The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries,
operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition
and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). They have been derived from the audited
combined and consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared in accordance with IFRS; the South African Institute of
Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee; the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa 2008; Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council; and
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. They do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS.

The condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the
commentary under the heading 'Going concern'.

The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December
2017 or 2016 but is derived from those accounts. Statutory accounts for 2016 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies,
and those for 2017 will be delivered in due course. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified,
(ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their
report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006. Copies of their unqualified
auditors' reports on the Integrated report and financial statements 2017 as well as the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements are available for inspection at the Mondi Limited and Mondi plc registered offices.

These condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the
fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.

2 Accounting policies
The same accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation have been followed in the preparation of the condensed
combined and consolidated financial statements as were applied in the preparation of the Group's annual financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2016, except as follows:
     -     A number of amendments to IFRS became effective for the financial period beginning on 1 January 2017, but the Group
           did not have to change its accounting policies or make material retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these
           new standards.

3 Operating segments
Identification of the Group's externally reportable operating segments
The Group's operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive
committee, the chief operating decision-making body. The operating segments are managed based on the nature of the underlying
products produced by those businesses and comprise four distinct segments.

Each of the reportable segments derives its income from the sale of manufactured products.

Effective from 1 October 2017, the Group reorganised its business units to reflect the nature of the underlying products produced.
The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
     -     Uncoated Fine Paper and South Africa, excluding the containerboard operations, were merged into a single business unit;
     -     the containerboard operations of South Africa were merged into Packaging Paper; and
     -     there were no changes to the Fibre Packaging or Consumer Packaging business units.

Prior year figures have been restated to reflect the new organisational structure. The reorganisation had no impact on the overall
Group result.

The expected maturity of these capital commitments is:
EUR million                                                                                                        2017                 2016

Capital commitments are based on capital projects approved by the end of the financial year and the budget approved by the
Boards. Major capital projects still require further approval before they commence and are not included in the above analysis. The
Group's capital commitments are expected to be financed from existing cash resources and borrowing facilities.

16 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts as at 31 December 2017 of EUR6 million (2016: EUR11 million) in respect of loans and
guarantees given to banks and other third parties. No acquired contingent liabilities have been recorded in the Group's condensed
combined and consolidated statement of financial position for either year presented.

The Group is subject to certain legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of
business. Legal proceedings may include, but are not limited to, alleged breach of contract and alleged breach of environmental,
competition, securities and health and safety laws. The Group may not be insured fully, or at all, in respect of such risks. The
Group cannot predict the outcome of individual legal actions or claims or complaints or investigations. The Group may settle
litigation or regulatory proceedings prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. The Group may do so to avoid the cost,
management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing to contest liability, even when it
considers it has valid defences to liability. The Group considers that no material loss to the Group is expected to result from these
legal proceedings, claims, complaints and investigations. Provision is made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise
through legal and tax claims against the Group.

17 Fair value measurement
Financial instruments that are measured in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value,
or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in the notes to the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
- level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
  as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The only assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group's forestry assets as set
out in note 10 and certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations.

There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are
determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market
data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.

Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include:
- the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash
  flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates;
- the fair values of the Group's commodity price derivatives are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows
  based on observable market data; and
- other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

Except as detailed below, the directors consider that the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at
amortised cost in the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

                                                                             Carrying amount                     Fair value

The non-controlling interest holder in Kalenobel holds an option to put its shares to Mondi until June 2021, but not before
March 2018, at a price determined based on future earnings. The present value of the option is EUR4 million (2016: EUR9 million) based
on the current expected business plan, and is capped at EUR25 million. Further analysis is not provided as the option is not
considered material.

18 Related party transactions
The Group and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sale, purchase and service transactions with
equity accounted investees and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that are no
less favourable than those arranged with third parties. These transactions, in total, are not considered to be significant.

Transactions between Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and their respective subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated
on consolidation.

There have been no significant changes to the related parties as disclosed in note 31 of the Group's annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2016.

19 Events occurring after 31 December 2017
In addition to the final ordinary and special dividends proposed for 2017 (see note 9) there has been the following material
reportable event since 31 December 2017:
- A new EUR600 million one year multicurrency revolving credit facility was signed on 22 February 2018 on normal commercial terms
  for such a facility. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes.

Glossary of terms
This announcement contains a number of terms which are explained below:

Net debt                                    A measure comprising short, medium, and long-term interest-bearing borrowings
                                            and the fair value of debt-related derivatives less cash and cash equivalents and
                                            current financial asset investments.
Return on capital employed (ROCE)           Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted
                                            investees' net profit/(loss), divided by trailing 12-month average capital employed
                                            and for segments has been extracted from management reports. Capital employed
                                            is adjusted for spend on those strategic projects which are not yet in production.
Special items                               Those financial items which the Group considers should be separately disclosed on
                                            the face of the condensed combined and consolidated income statement to assist in
                                            understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Such
                                            items are generally material by nature and exceed EUR10 million and the Group,
                                            therefore, excludes these items when reporting underlying earnings and related
                                            measures in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group
                                            on a basis that is comparable from year to year.
TRCR                                        Total recordable case rate (TRCR) is calculated as the number of total recordable
                                            cases (the sum of fatalities, lost-time injuries, restricted work cases, medical
                                            treatment cases and compensated occupational illnesses) divided by the number of
                                            hours worked per 200,000 man hours.
Underlying EBITDA                           Operating profit before special items, depreciation, amortisation and impairments
                                            not recorded as special items.
Underlying operating profit                 Operating profit before special items.
Underlying profit before tax                Profit before tax and special items.
Underlying earnings                         Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders, before special items.

“Mondi Group”, the “Group” or “Mondi”) notify both the JSE Limited and the London Stock Exchange of

Mondi Group signs an agreement to acquire Powerflute

Mondi Group has signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares in Powerflute Group
Holdings Oy (“Powerflute” or the “Company”), a division of Nordic Packaging and Container Holdings
(“NPAC Holdings”), for a total consideration of €365 million on an enterprise value basis.

Powerflute operates an integrated pulp and paper mill in Kuopio (Finland) with an annual production capacity
of 285,000 tonnes of high-performance semi-chemical fluting. Powerflute’s premium semi-chemical fluting
is sold to a diverse range of customers, primarily for packaging fresh fruit and vegetables, but also other
end-uses such as electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Around half of the Company’s production is
sold in Europe, while the remainder is exported globally.

For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company is expected to generate revenues of around €183
million and unaudited pro-forma adjusted EBITDA of around €42 million. Powerflute will be integrated into
Mondi’s Packaging Paper Business Unit.

Commenting on the acquisition, Peter Oswald, Chief executive of Mondi Group, said: “The acquisition of
Powerflute supports our strategy of investing in high-quality packaging and paper assets. We are excited by
this opportunity to expand our customer offering by further broadening our containerboard product range
and geographic reach.”

The transaction remains subject to competition clearance and customary closing conditions and is expected
to complete in the first half of 2018.

Mondi Group: Capital Markets Day 17 October 2017

Mondi Group is hosting a Capital Markets Day in London today at which it will provide an overview of its
business strategy and detail various organic growth opportunities. Presentations will be delivered by CEO
Peter Oswald, CFO Andrew King, as well as the CEOs of the Group’s four business units – Paper
Packaging, Fibre Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Uncoated Fine Paper.

Since its listing in 2007, Mondi Group has doubled ROCE and tripled underlying EPS. Mondi enters its
next decade as a listed entity well-positioned to benefit from general economic trends – such as e-
commerce and the ongoing strong growth in central eastern Europe, as well as specific industry trends –
such as the growing preference across a wide customer base for lighter, stronger packaging
(lightweighting); the substitution of rigid by flexible packaging; and smart, environmentally responsible
packaging solutions.

Mondi Group CEO Peter Oswald said, “Mondi’s industry leading margins and returns are a consequence
of our inherent competitive advantages. Today we will show our investors how we plan to further develop
our culture of driving performance; leverage our cost-advantaged assets; increase our focus on partnering
with customers for innovation; inspire our people and grow responsibly. We are positioning ourselves to
benefit from various general economic and industry specific trends. I believe this will deliver robust value
accretive growth well into the future, both organically and through acquisitions.”

No material new information, forward looking financial information nor update on trading will be provided.

Mondi Group: Trading update 11 October 2017
This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial position since the half
year ended 30 June 2017, based on management information up to 30 September 2017. These results
have not been audited or reviewed by Mondi's external auditors.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or transactions impacting either
the financial performance or financial position of the Group since 30 June 2017 up to the date of this statement.

Group performance overview
Underlying operating profit for the third quarter of 2017 of EUR245 million was 8% above the comparable
prior year period (EUR227 million). The Group benefited from higher average selling prices partly offset by
higher costs and negative currency effects. Underlying operating profit was in line with the second quarter
of 2017, with the positive pricing momentum seen across most product segments offset by
rising costs, negative currency effects and the usual seasonal downturn in Uncoated Fine Paper.

Like-for-like sales volumes were above the comparable prior year period, driven by good growth in
containerboard and Fibre Packaging. Selling prices for the Group's key paper grades were above those of
both the comparable prior year period and the previous quarter as the upward momentum in pricing
witnessed over the first half continued.

Costs were generally higher than the comparable prior year period and the previous quarter. Wood, energy
and chemical costs were higher than the comparable prior year period while benchmark paper for recycling
prices were up 15% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and 6% higher sequentially. Cash fixed costs were 
higher as a result of inflationary cost pressures and the impact of maintenance shuts, while depreciation and
amortisation charges were up due to the impact of the Group's ongoing capital investment programme.
Our recently completed projects in Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging are making good contributions.

Currency movements had a net negative impact on operating profit versus the comparable prior year period
driven mainly by a weaker US dollar and sharply weaker Turkish Lira. On a sequential basis, the
weakening Russian rouble and US dollar contributed to a net negative impact.

Planned mill maintenance shuts were completed during the quarter with an estimated impact on operating
profit of EUR30 million (2016: EUR20 million). Based on prevailing market prices, we continue to estimate that the
impact of planned maintenance shuts on operating profit for 2017 will be around EUR90 million, with an
expected impact in the fourth quarter of around EUR20 million (2016: EUR35 million).

Business unit overview
In Packaging Paper, containerboard markets remain strong with healthy demand and limited industry
capacity additions continuing to support pricing, albeit with the level of price increases achieved varying by
grade. Average benchmark European unbleached kraftliner prices were up 20% on the prior year
comparable period, and up 8% sequentially. By contrast, benchmark European white-top kraftliner prices were up by
a more moderate 4% on the prior year comparable period, and up 1% sequentially. Average benchmark European 
recycled containerboard prices were up 18% on the prior year, and up 5% sequentially. Price increases in
recycled containerboard (EUR30/tonne) and unbleached kraftliner (EUR50/tonne) were implemented in July and
August respectively.

The sack kraft paper market remains tight, supported by good demand growth in our export markets, stable
core European markets, and constrained supply growth. Sales volumes for sack kraft paper remained at
similar levels to the comparable prior year period and selling prices were higher following the
implementation of previously announced price increases. On a sequential basis, prices were marginally up
on average as most external volume is sold on fixed price annual contracts.

The EUR335 million modernisation of the Steti mill (Czech Republic) is progressing well. As previously announced, we have 
postponed the EUR135 million investment in a new 90,000 tonne per annum machine glazed paper machine at the 
same site due to concerns around a potential market imbalance following recently announced industry 
capacity expansions. 

Our Fibre Packaging business continues to benefit from good volume growth, particularly in Corrugated
Packaging. Recent paper price increases were partly recovered through box price increases during the
quarter. In Industrial Bags the opportunity to recover paper price increases implemented early in the
second quarter was limited due to annual fixed price contracts. Strong cost management continues to limit
the impact of cost pressures.

Consumer Packaging delivered an improved performance in the quarter although low growth in certain value added 
product areas remains a challenge. In response, a programme has been launched to restructure the cost base and align 
capacity to current market requirements. This involves various initiatives, including the closure of a plant in Poland, 
streamlining the UK operations and reducing the fixed cost base across the business. As a result, a special item charge 
estimated at EUR45 million, including an asset impairment of EUR27 million, will be recognised during the second half of 2017.

The Uncoated Fine Paper business continues to perform strongly, although the quarterly performance was
impacted by ongoing cost pressures, particularly in South Africa, planned maintenance shuts and limited
pricing momentum. Average benchmark European uncoated fine paper prices were flat on the comparable
prior year period and up 1% on the second quarter of 2017. Pricing in the domestic Russian and South
African markets remained stable over the period. Supported by steady demand and cost pressures from
rising pulp prices, price increases are currently in the process of implementation in the European, Russian
and South African markets for selected products.

Due to the accelerated rate of local demand decline, the decision has been taken to cease production of
newsprint at our Merebank mill (South Africa). A special item charge of around EUR15 million will be recognised
during the second half of 2017. During the quarter, we restarted an idled uncoated fine paper machine
which will produce annually around 70,000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper to serve the local market,
displacing imports.

Cash flow and financing activities
Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows related to our capital
expenditure programme and financing activities, resulting in a reduction in net debt during the quarter.

Finance charges were lower than the comparable prior year period and in line with the previous quarter
primarily due to the 5.75% 2017 Eurobond maturing in the first half of the year.

There have been no other significant changes in the Group's borrowing facilities since 30 June 2017.

During the quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the Group's credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1
(stable outlook).

Outlook
We remain confident of making progress for the year and expect a strong final quarter, supported by 
generally higher average selling prices and good growth. However, continuing cost pressures and negative 
currency impacts are expected to result in an underlying performance for the year modestly below market expectations.

With our robust business model, strong project pipeline and culture of driving performance, we remain confident 
of continuing to grow and deliver industry leading returns.

Reorganisation of business segments
As previously announced, effective from 1 October 2017, the Group reorganised its business units to reflect the 
nature of the underlying products produced. The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the 
Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
-  Uncoated Fine Paper and South Africa, excluding the containerboard operations, were merged into a single 
   business unit;
-  the containerboard operations of South Africa were merged into Packaging Paper; and
-  there were no changes to the Fibre Packaging or Consumer Packaging business units.
Restated segmental information is included as an appendix to this statement. The reorganisation had no impact on 
the overall Group result.

Update on Mondi’s machine glazed speciality kraft paper machine investment at its Steti
mill

Mondi has decided to postpone its €135 million investment in a new 90,000 tonne per annum
machine glazed speciality kraft paper machine at its Steti mill in the Czech Republic.

Commenting on the decision, Peter Oswald, Mondi CEO, said, “We have decided to postpone
the machine glazed speciality kraft paper machine investment after a careful review of market
conditions. While the proposed new machine remains an exciting investment opportunity,
offering the lowest cost production of its sort in Europe, recently announced industry capacity
expansions are expected to result in a market imbalance over the period in which the new
machine was planned to come on line.

There is no change to our €335 million investment in modernising the mill including rebuilding
the fibre lines, de-bottlenecking the existing packaging paper machines and a new recovery
boiler, which is progressing as planned.”

Mondi Group – 2017 Interim Dividend ZAR/euro Exchange Rate

On 3 August 2017 Mondi Group announced, in its Half-Yearly Results
announcement, that an interim dividend for the year ending 31 December 2017
of 19.10 euro cents per ordinary share will be paid on 19 September 2017 to all
Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shareholders on the relevant registers on
25 August 2017.

Mondi Limited and Mondi plc will pay their respective dividends as follows:

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its dividend in South African rand cents. The applicable
exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 15.70411.

Therefore, the equivalent gross interim dividend in rand cents per ordinary share
will be 299.94850. Dividend tax will be withheld from Mondi Limited shareholders
at a rate of 20%, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a
net dividend of 239.9588 rand cents per ordinary share.

Mondi plc

Mondi plc will pay its dividend in euro.

However, ordinary shareholders resident in the United Kingdom will receive the
dividend in sterling (unless shareholders have elected to receive their dividend in

ordinary share will be 299.94850. Dividend tax will be withheld from Mondi plc
South African branch register shareholders at a rate of 20%, unless a
shareholder qualifies for an exemption, resulting in a net dividend of 239.9588
rand cents per ordinary share.

Peter Oswald, Mondi Group chief executive, said:
""Mondi delivered a robust performance in the first half of 2017, with revenue up 8%, underlying operating profit of EUR497 million and a
return on capital employed of 18.7%, reflecting management's ongoing value focus and the strength of our business
model. Profitability was down on the comparable prior year period, mainly driven by a significantly lower forestry fair
value gain in South Africa and the impact of mill maintenance shuts.

We continue to drive growth through our capital investment programme. During the period, we commissioned the second
phase of our major investment in the ongoing development of our world-class facility in Swiecie, Poland, while good
progress is being made on the modernisation of our kraft paper facility in Steti, Czech Republic. 
The integration of acquisitions completed during 2016 and early 2017 is on track. These acquisitions enhance
our geographic reach and product portfolio in Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging.

The market outlook remains broadly positive. We saw strong demand across Packaging Paper and Corrugated Packaging
in the first half and successfully implemented price increases across certain paper grades, the full effect of which is
anticipated in the second half. The second half of the year will be impacted by planned maintenance shuts at a number of
our mills and the usual seasonal downturn in Uncoated Fine Paper. While we continue to see some inflationary cost
pressures, we remain confident of making progress in the year and continuing to deliver industry leading returns.""

Group performance review
Underlying operating profit for the half-year ended 30 June 2017 of EUR497 million was down 6% compared to the first half of 2016.
Sales volume growth and higher prices were more than offset by higher costs, a significantly lower forestry fair value gain (down
EUR28 million year-on-year), the impact of maintenance shuts (up EUR20 million year-on-year) and a higher depreciation and
amortisation charge. Underlying EBITDA for the half-year ended 30 June 2017, adjusted for the year-on-year movement in the
forestry fair value gain, was up 3% on the first half of 2016.

Revenue was up 4% on a like-for-like basis, driven by higher sales volumes, higher sales prices and positive currency effects.
Organic growth was supplemented by the acquisitions in our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging businesses in 2016
and the first quarter of 2017. Including acquisitions, revenue was up 8% compared to the first half of 2016.

Selling prices for the Group's packaging paper grades were, on average, above those of the comparable prior year period and
South Africa also benefited from higher domestic paper prices. This was partially offset by marginally lower European uncoated
fine paper prices.

Input costs were higher than the comparable prior year period. Wood costs were generally higher in local currency terms in central
Europe and Russia, exacerbated by stronger emerging market currencies when translated into euros. Energy costs were higher
than the comparable prior year period as a result of higher commodity input prices. Average benchmark paper for recycling costs
were up 18% on the comparable prior year period and 4% higher compared to the second half of 2016. Cash fixed costs were
higher as a result of inflationary cost pressures across the Group and the impact of mill maintenance shuts. Depreciation and
amortisation charges were up 15% at EUR213 million resulting from a combination of acquisitions, foreign exchange effects and the
ongoing capital investment programme.

In the first half of 2017, we completed a longer than anticipated annual maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill (Russia), a
project-related shut at our Swiecie mill (Poland) and some smaller shuts at a number of our other mills. The balance of our
maintenance shuts are scheduled for the second half of the year. Based on prevailing market prices, the full year impact on
underlying operating profit of the Group's maintenance shuts is now estimated at around EUR90 million (previously EUR80 million, 
2016: EUR75 million) of which the first half effect was around EUR40 million (2016: EUR20 million).

Currency movements had a small net negative impact on underlying operating profit versus the comparable prior year period. The
net positive impact of the stronger rouble on translation of the profits of our domestically focused Uncoated Fine Paper business
was more than offset by the impact of the stronger rand and weaker Turkish lira.

Underlying earnings were down 5% to 71.2 euro cents per share, as lower net finance charges provided some offset to the lower
underlying operating profit. After taking the effect of special items into account, basic earnings of 72.3 euro cents per share were
down 4% on the comparable prior year period.

An interim dividend of 19.10 euro cents per share has been declared.

Underlying operating profit of EUR207 million was up 8% on the comparable prior year period with higher selling prices and marginally
higher sales volumes more than offsetting higher costs.

Strong demand, limited capacity additions and lower kraftliner imports drove European containerboard price increases during the
period. Selling prices for containerboard were, on average, higher than the first half of 2016, although the magnitude of price
increase varied by grade. Average benchmark European selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were up 4% on the comparable
prior year period and up 6% on the second half of 2016. However, average benchmark European white-top kraftliner selling prices
were similar to the first half of 2016 and marginally up on the second half of 2016, with only limited price increases achieved to
date. Similarly, we have seen only limited price increases achieved to date in semi-chemical fluting. Average benchmark European 
selling prices for recycled containerboard were up 1% on the comparable prior year period, and up 7% on the second half of 2016.

In response to sustained good demand, a strong order position and higher input costs, we have announced further price increases
of EUR50/tonne for recycled containerboard and unbleached kraftliner grades to take effect during July and August 2017, respectively.

Sack kraft paper selling prices increased by 3-4% from the beginning of 2017 in all markets. Markets remain very tight, with good
demand, particularly in our export markets, coupled with constrained supply. During the second quarter, we implemented a further
price increase of 3-4% in Europe, where most of our volumes are integrated. In overseas markets, prices were increased by 6-7%
for the limited volumes that are not fixed by annual contracts.

We saw good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers during the period. Selling prices were, on average, similar to the
comparable prior year period and higher than the second half of 2016.

Costs were above the comparable prior year period, driven by higher average paper for recycling costs, higher energy costs,
inflationary increases on cash fixed costs and a higher depreciation charge. Green energy prices in Poland remained under
pressure, limiting the contribution from the sale of green energy credits.

We completed a planned maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill and a project-related shut at Swiecie during the first half of the
year. A planned maintenance shut is scheduled at Swiecie in the third quarter and the majority of our kraft paper mill shuts will take
place in the fourth quarter of the year.

Underlying operating profit of EUR60 million was up 2% on the comparable prior year period, with good volume growth and sales price
increases partly offset by rising input costs and negative foreign exchange effects.

Corrugated Packaging benefited from 9% like-for-like volume growth, driven by good market growth in central Europe, strong
volume growth in e-commerce activities and a strong recovery in Turkey. This growth is supported by our focused capital
investment programme which has allowed us to better serve our customers and meet their increasingly sophisticated product and
service needs. Good progress was made during the period in implementing price increases required to compensate for the
significant paper input cost increases. Efforts in this regard are ongoing, with short-term margin pressure anticipated due to the
normal delays in passing on paper price increases. Profitability of this segment was negatively impacted by the significantly weaker
Turkish lira.

Industrial Bags volumes were up around 1%, driven by strong growth in Africa, South East Asia and CIS, partly offset by lower
European and North American volumes. Sales price increases and strong cost management more than offset the impact of higher
paper prices during the period. Further selling price increases are being negotiated in light of recent paper price increases.

Underlying operating profit of EUR63 million was marginally down on the comparable prior year period. Like-for-like performance was
steady, while net acquisition benefits in the current period were largely offset by one-off gains in the first half of the prior year.

We continue to make progress in our initiatives to improve product and customer mix, although in the current period this was
hindered by low growth in certain value-added product segments, notably personal care components and technical films. While
like-for-like gross margin contribution improved, this was offset by fixed cost increases, negative foreign exchange
effects and higher depreciation and amortisation charges.

We benefited from the successful integration of Kalenobel in Turkey and Uralplastic in Russia, acquired in the second half of 2016.
In February 2017, we acquired Excelsior Technologies Limited in the UK, further supporting the development of Consumer
Packaging in high-growth product applications. With this acquisition, we are currently evaluating opportunities to streamline
activities at our UK based operations.

We continue to focus on initiatives to improve performance across our operations. Capital expenditure is directed at both growth
opportunities and the modernisation of equipment at a number of our sites to ensure we are well positioned to serve our
customers' needs.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business continued to perform very strongly, with underlying operating profit of EUR135 million, delivering a
36.7% ROCE. Lower average European selling prices and higher costs were offset by the combination of ongoing cost
improvement initiatives, stable domestic pricing in Russia and foreign exchange benefits from the significant strengthening of the
Russian rouble.

Sales volumes were marginally up on the comparable prior year period. Supported by good demand, reduced imports and rising
pulp prices, price increases totalling up to EUR50 per tonne were successfully implemented in the European market during the period,
although prices were still on average lower than those achieved in the first half of 2016. Average benchmark European selling
prices were down over 3% on the comparable prior year period and marginally down on the second half of 2016. In Russia,
domestic selling prices were stable during the first half of 2017 despite increasing pressure from imports.

Variable input costs increased marginally due to higher wood and energy costs. Fixed costs were higher due to domestic
inflationary cost pressures and a longer than anticipated maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill.

Maintenance shuts at our Ruzomberok (Slovakia) and Neusiedler (Austria) mills are scheduled for the second half of the year. In
line with previous years, the second half is also expected to be impacted by a seasonal slowdown in demand.

Underlying operating profit of EUR55 million was down 44% on the first half of 2016, with a significantly lower fair value gain on our
forestry assets (down EUR28 million year-on-year), the negative impact of a stronger rand, higher input costs and inflationary cost
pressures more than offsetting higher average selling prices and volume growth.

Average domestic uncoated fine paper and containerboard prices were above both the comparable prior year period and the
second half of 2016. Export selling prices for white-top kraftliner were in line with the comparable prior year period, while pulp
export prices were up from those achieved in the first half of 2016.

Forestry gains are dependent on a variety of external factors, the most significant of which are the export price of timber and the
exchange rate. Moderate increases in export prices coupled with a strengthening rand, resulted in a fair value gain of EUR20 million
being recognised in the first half of the year, EUR28 million lower than the unusually high gain recorded in the comparable prior year
period.

Tax
Based on the Group's geographic profit mix and the relevant tax rates applicable, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%.
However, we continued to benefit from tax incentives related to our capital investments in Poland and Russia. In addition, we
recognised deferred tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses which we now expect to be able to utilise in the
coming years. As such, our underlying effective tax rate in the first half was 19%, consistent with the comparable prior year period.

Special items
Special items are those items of financial performance that we believe should be separately disclosed to assist in the
understanding of our underlying financial performance. Special items are considered to be material either in nature or in amount
and generally exceed EUR10 million.

During the first half of the year, we recognised a EUR5 million gain in Packaging Paper on the release of restructuring and closure
provisions following finalisation of the sale of our speciality kraft paper mill in Finland. Restructuring and closure costs and related
impairment of assets of EUR14 million were previously recognised in special items in 2015.

After taking the effect of special items into account, operating profit of EUR502 million was down 5% on the comparable prior year
period (EUR529 million).

Cash flow
Cash generated from operations of EUR592 million (2016: EUR620 million), including the impact of an increase in working capital, reflects
the continued strong cash generating capacity of the Group.

Working capital at 30 June 2017 was 13.4% of revenue (30 June 2016: 13.3%), in line with our target of 12-14% and higher than
the year-end level of 12.0%. This reflects the usual seasonal uptick in the first half of the year compounded by increasing average
sales volumes and selling prices, giving rise to a net outflow of EUR141 million (2016: EUR61 million).

Significant net cash outflows from financing activities included the payment of the final 2016 dividend in May 2017, the final
payment of the 5.75% coupon on the EUR500 million 2017 Eurobond, the redemption of this bond in April 2017, and payments of
dividends to holders of non-controlling interests.

Capital investments
During the first half of the year we invested EUR254 million (2016: EUR214 million) in our property, plant and equipment.

Our recently completed capital projects in our Packaging Paper, Fibre Packaging and South African businesses are making strong
contributions. The EUR94 million final phase of our EUR260 million investment programme in Swiecie to provide an additional
100,000 tonnes per annum of softwood kraft pulp integrated to 80,000 tonnes per annum of lightweight kraftliner and increased
share of kraft top liner, involving the rebuild of a paper machine, was commissioned during the period although ramp-up has been
slower than anticipated. We are encouraged by the progress achieved in ramping up production of the requisite quality at our
rebuilt paper and inline coating machine in Steti, although technical challenges remain.

As a result of the prolonged start-up of the rebuilt paper machine at Swiecie and ongoing challenges on the inline coating machine
at Steti, the incremental operating profit contribution in 2017 from our capital investment programme is now estimated to be
EUR25 million (previously EUR30 million).

We have a strong major capital investment project pipeline totalling over EUR800 million:
    -    The European Commission has recently approved EUR49 million in tax incentives for our EUR310 million investment in a new
         300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine and related pulp mill upgrade at our Ruzomberok mill. This project
         remains subject to obtaining necessary permitting, which is taking longer than originally anticipated. Start-up is expected
         in 2020; and
    -    We are making good progress on our new woodyard and bleaching line at Steti (EUR41 million). Work has also commenced
         on the modernisation of the mill, to replace the recovery boiler, rebuild the fibre lines and debottleneck the existing
         packaging paper machines, with start-up anticipated in late 2018. The investment in a new 90,000 tonne per annum machine glazed 
         speciality kraft paper machine remains subject to obtaining approval for tax incentives. The total investment in the mill 
         modernisation and new paper machine amounts to EUR470 million, of which the investment in the paper machine is EUR135 million.

Given the delays on the Ruzomberok project, capital expenditure is expected to come in at the lower end of the previously
indicated ranges of EUR600-EUR650 million for 2017 and EUR800-EUR850 million for 2018.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 30 June 2017 was EUR1,468 million (31 December 2016: EUR1,383 million). The net debt to 12-month trailing EBITDA ratio
was 1.1 times.

In April 2017, we redeemed our 5.75% EUR500 million Eurobond from available cash and undrawn debt facilities. At 30 June 2017, we
had EUR2.0 billion of committed facilities of which EUR667 million were undrawn. The weighted average maturity of our committed debt
facilities is approximately 4.3 years.

Finance charges of EUR40 million were below those of the comparable prior year period. Average net debt was down on the
comparable prior year period. The average effective interest rate for the period was lower at 5.3% (six months ended
30 June 2016: 5.9%; six months ended 31 December 2016: 6.6%) mainly as a result of the 2017 Eurobond redemption. Cash
interest paid was EUR52 million.

Dividend
The Boards' aim is to offer shareholders long-term dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times
over the business cycle.

An interim dividend of 19.10 euro cents per share has been declared by the directors and will be paid on 19 September 2017 to
those shareholders on the register of Mondi plc on 25 August 2017. An equivalent South African rand interim dividend will be paid
on 19 September 2017 to shareholders on the register of Mondi Limited on 25 August 2017. The dividend will be paid from
distributable reserves of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, as presented in the respective company annual financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2016.

Outlook
The market outlook remains broadly positive. We saw strong demand across Packaging Paper and Corrugated Packaging in the
first half and successfully implemented price increases across certain paper grades, the full effect of which is anticipated in the
second half. The second half of the year will be impacted by planned maintenance shuts at a number of our mills and the usual
seasonal downturn in Uncoated Fine Paper. While we continue to see some inflationary cost pressures, we remain confident of
making progress in the year and continuing to deliver industry leading returns.

Reorganisation of business units
With effect from 1 October 2017, the Group will reorganise its business units to reflect the nature of the underlying products
produced. The changes to the Group's business units, and consequently to the Group's segmental reporting, are as follows:
    -    Uncoated Fine Paper and South Africa, excluding the containerboard operations, will be merged into a single business
         unit;
    -    The containerboard operations of South Africa will be merged into Packaging Paper; and
    -    There will be no changes to the Fibre Packaging or Consumer Packaging business units.
We believe that this reorganisation both streamlines the organisational structure and offers the potential to deliver further
synergies.

The reorganisation will have no impact on the overall Group result.

Restated segmental information will be published during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. They
have put procedures in place for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks that the Group faces. In combination
with the audit committee, at the beginning of 2017, the Boards have conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which
Mondi is exposed and they are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within
the risk tolerance levels established. There have been no significant changes to the principal risks since 31 December 2016 as
described on pages 34 to 38 of the Group's Integrated report and financial statements 2016.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business, and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes. Our internal control environment is designed to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to provide reasonable assurance that the Group's business objectives will be achieved.

Strategic risks
The industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long-term risks which are accepted by the Boards as a
consequence of the Group's chosen strategy and operating footprint.

While there have been no significant changes in our strategic risk exposure during the year, we continue to monitor recent capacity
announcements and the developments in the process as the UK seeks to exit the European Union.

The executive committee and Boards monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall
exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate
exposure to such risks.

Our principal strategic risks relate to the following:
    -    Industry productive capacity
    -    Product substitution
    -    Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins
    -    Country risk

Financial risks
We aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance with
all laws and regulations.

Despite ongoing short-term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies, our overall
residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years, reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management.

Our principal financial risks relate to the following:
    -    Capital structure
    -    Currency risk
    -    Tax risks

Operational risks
A low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence, investment in our people and
commitment to the responsible use of resources.

Our investments to improve our energy efficiency, engineer out our most significant fatal risks, improve operating efficiencies, and
renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events. However, the potential impact of any such event
remains unchanged.

Our principal operational risks relate to the following:
    -    Cost and availability of raw materials
    -    Energy security and related input costs
    -    Technical integrity of our operating assets
    -    Environmental impact of our operations
    -    Employee and contractor safety

Compliance risks
We have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks. Our strong culture and values, emphasised in every part of our business
with a focus on integrity, honesty, and transparency, underpins our approach.

Our principal compliance risks relate to the following:
    -    Reputational risk
    -    Information technology risk

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget and latest outlook for 2017, considered the assumptions contained therein and
reviewed the critical risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current
macroeconomic environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements. At
30 June 2017, Mondi had EUR667 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have maturity dates of
between 1 and 8 years, with a weighted average maturity of 4.3 years.

Based on their evaluation, the Boards are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity to meet its
obligations and continue in operational existence.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements.

Capital Markets Day
The Group will hold a Capital Markets Day on the morning of Tuesday 17 October 2017 in London and a site visit to two consumer
packaging plants in Germany on Wednesday 18 October 2017. This event will provide attendees with the opportunity to meet Mondi's
leadership team and gain insights into how the business is operated in line with its strategic priorities. If you have interest in
attending this event please contact: ir@mondigroup.com.

Report on the interim financial statements

Conclusion of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for Mondi plc
We have reviewed Mondi plc and Mondi Limited's condensed combined and consolidated half-yearly financial statements (the
""interim financial statements"") in the half-yearly results of the Group for the six month period ended 30 June 2017. Based on our
review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the
European Union and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct
Authority.

Conclusion of PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. for Mondi Limited
We have reviewed Mondi plc and Mondi Limited's condensed combined and consolidated half-yearly financial statements (the
""interim financial statements"") in the half-yearly results of the Group for the six month period ended 30 June 2017. Based on our
review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements are not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA)
Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the
South African Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

What we have reviewed
The interim financial statements comprise:
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2017;
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated income statement and the condensed combined and consolidated statement
         of comprehensive income for the period then ended;
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then ended;
    -    the condensed combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and
    -    the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.

The interim financial statements included in the half-yearly results have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the IASB and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the SAICA Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the South African
Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation
of the full annual financial statements of the Group is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union and as issued by the IASB.

Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review

Responsibilities of the directors of Mondi plc and Mondi Limited
The half-yearly results, including the interim financial statements, are the responsibility of, and have been approved by, the
directors. The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the interim financial statements in accordance with
International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the
IASB, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the
SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by
the South African Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Our responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review. PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP have prepared this review report, including their conclusion, for and only for Mondi plc for the purpose of the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in
writing.

What a review of interim financial statements involves
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP conducted their review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and
Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. conducted their review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE)
2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' as issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements. A review of
interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement.

A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with either International Standards on Auditing (UK)
or International Standards on Auditing and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these interim financial
statements.

As part of our review, we have read the other information contained in the half-yearly results and considered whether it contains
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements.

   a)   The maintenance and integrity of the Mondi Group website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by
        the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any
        changes that may have occurred to the interim financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
   b)   Legislation in the United Kingdom and South Africa governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
        may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2017


1 Basis of preparation
The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company (DLC)
structure. The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries,
operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated half-yearly financial statements and notes 1 to 20 for the six months ended
30 June 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 34, 'Interim Financial
Reporting'; the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting
Practices Committee; the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa; and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued
by the Financial Reporting Council. They should be read in conjunction with the Group's Integrated report and financial statements
2016, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB). There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by
the European Union (EU) and therefore the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the
commentary under the heading 'Going concern'.

The financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts as defined by section 434 of the UK Companies Act
2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
The previous auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any
matters to which the previous auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a
statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006.

These condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the
fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.

The preparation of these condensed combined and consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by management
in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to
the Group's Integrated report and financial statements 2016, with the exception of changes in estimates that are required in
determining the provision for income taxes for an interim period.

These financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Group chief financial officer, Andrew King CA (SA).

2 Accounting policies
The same accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation have been followed in the preparation of the condensed
combined and consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as were applied in the preparation of the
Group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, except as follows:
    -    A number of amendments to IFRS became effective for the financial period beginning on 1 January 2017, but the Group
         did not have to change its accounting policies or make material retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these
         new standards; and
    -    Taxes on income in the interim period are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual
         profits or losses.

3 Seasonality
The seasonality of the Group's operations had no significant impact on the condensed combined and consolidated financial
statements.

4 Operating segments
Identification of the Group's externally reportable operating segments
The Group's externally reportable operating segments reflect the internal reporting structure of the Group. Due to its unique
characteristics in terms of geography, currency and underlying risks, the operating segment South Africa is managed and reported
as a separate geographic segment. The remaining operating segments are managed based on the nature of the underlying
products produced by those businesses and comprise four distinct segments.

Each of the reportable business segments derives its income from the sale of manufactured products.

16 Capital commitments
Capital commitments are based on capital projects approved to date and the budget approved by the Boards. As previously
indicated, capital expenditure is expected to be at the lower end of the EUR600-EUR650 million range as previously published. These
capital projects are expected to be financed from existing cash resources and borrowing facilities.

17 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts as at 30 June 2017 of EUR6 million (as at 30 June 2016: EUR10 million; as at
31 December 2016: EUR11 million) in respect of loans and guarantees given to banks and other third parties. No acquired contingent
liabilities have been recorded in the Group's condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position for all periods
presented.

Provision is made for all liabilities that are expected to materialise through legal and tax claims against the Group.

18 Fair value measurement
Financial instruments that are measured in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value,
or where the fair value of financial instruments has been disclosed in the notes to the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

- level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
  as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).


The only assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group's forestry assets as set
out in note 11 and certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations.

There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the period.

The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are
determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market
data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.

Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include:
- the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash
  flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates;
- the Group's commodity price derivatives are valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the
  present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data; and
- other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

Except as detailed below, the directors consider that the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at
amortised cost in the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

Glossary of financial terms
This announcement contains a number of terms which are explained below:

Return on capital employed (ROCE)   Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of equity accounted
                                    investees' net profit, divided by trailing 12-month average capital employed and for
                                    segments has been extracted from management reports. Capital employed is
                                    adjusted for impairments in the 12-month period and spend on those strategic
                                    projects which are not yet in production.
Special items                       Those financial items which the Group believes should be separately disclosed on
                                    the face of the condensed combined and consolidated income statement to assist in
                                    understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Special
                                    items generally exceed EUR10 million and affect year-on-year comparability and the
                                    Group therefore excludes these items when reporting underlying earnings and
                                    related measures in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of
                                    the Group on a basis that is comparable from year to year.
Underlying EBITDA                   Operating profit before special items, depreciation and amortisation.
Underlying operating profit         Operating profit before special items.
Underlying profit before tax        Profit before tax and special items.
Underlying earnings                 Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders, before special items.

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited
and Mondi plc (together ?Mondi Group? or ?Mondi?) notify both
the JSE Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters
required to be disclosed under the Listings Requirements of
the   JSE   Limited  and/or   the   Disclosure   Guidance and
Transparency Rules and/or the Listing Rules of the United
Kingdom Listing Authority. To comply with the requirements in
Articles 7 and 9 of the regulatory technical standards of the
Transparency Directive (2004/109/EC), this announcement falls
within the ?Payments to governments? classification.

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of
Logging Industries for the Year 2016

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and
its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December
2016 has been published in accordance with the UK?s Reports on
Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in
December 2015). This regulation implements the two EU
Directives in the UK, mandating annual reports by companies in
the extractives and logging industries of their payments to
governments in countries in which they operate.

To read details of     Mondi?s   payments   to   governments   go   to
www.mondigroup.com.

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our
logging activities and specifically to the disclosure of
payments to governments relating to the logging of primary
forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations definition of ?primary forest? being:
?Naturally regenerated forest of native species, where there
are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the
ecological processes are not significantly disturbed?.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ?IFL 2000?
(Greenpeace, World Resources Institute (WRI) and Transparent
World) inventory of intact forests has been used as the base
for reporting on the harvesting of primary forests in the Komi
Republic, Russia (?Komi?).

Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi
fall within the above definition of primary forests. Our
operations in South Africa comprise plantation forests that
are not associated with any primary forests and therefore are
excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation.
In terms of the Russian Forestry Code and Mondi?s sustainable
development policies all logged areas are naturally
regenerated with supplementary plantings of spruce and pine
where required to make up full populations of young trees for
the next sustainable forest cycle. During logging operations
protected areas, High Conservation Areas (HCV) areas and
sensitive biotopes, comprising approximately 25% of the area,
are naturally set aside for conservation.

Exchange rate

Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group?s
reporting currency) are translated for this report using the
average exchange rate during the financial year to which it
relates.

Further information

For further information regarding the Mondi Group?s approach
to sustainably managing our forests, please refer to our
Sustainable development report 2016 which can be found at
www.mondigroup.com/sd16 and our sustainable forestry policy,

Mondi Group: Trading update 11 May 2017

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial
position since the year ended 31 December 2016, based on management
information up to 31 March 2017 and estimated results for April 2017. These results
have not been audited or reviewed by Mondi’s external auditors.

Reviewed results for the half-year ending 30 June 2017 will be published on 3
August 2017.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or
transactions impacting either the financial performance or financial position of the
Group since 31 December 2016 up to the date of this statement.

Group performance overview

Underlying operating profit for the first quarter of 2017 of €252 million was 6% down
on the comparable prior year period (€269 million). Strong sales volume growth was
more than offset by a significantly lower forestry fair value gain, inflationary cost
pressures and lower average selling prices. Underlying operating profit was up 12%
on the fourth quarter of 2016 (€225 million) as the Group benefited from higher sales
volumes and prices.

Sales volumes grew across the Group’s Packaging Paper, Fibre Packaging and
Consumer Packaging business units compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was
further enhanced by the acquisitions in our Corrugated and Consumer Packaging
businesses during 2016.
Selling prices for the Group’s main paper grades were, on average, below those of
the comparable prior year period as prices decreased over the course of 2016. As
previously highlighted, during the first quarter of 2017, we implemented price
increases across a number of our paper grades, although these had only limited
impact in the quarter.

Wood costs were higher than the comparable prior year period, while benchmark
paper for recycling prices rose sharply, up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2016,
and were at similar levels to the fourth quarter of 2016. Benchmark polyethylene
prices were also higher, on the back of higher crude oil prices. Energy costs
increased due to the weather conditions in Europe and higher energy input costs.
Inflationary cost pressure resulted in higher fixed costs and the depreciation charge
was up due to the impact of the Group’s capital investment programme.

Currency movements had a small net positive impact on operating profit versus the
comparable prior year period and a small net negative impact when compared to the
fourth quarter of 2016.

Planned maintenance shuts were completed in Packaging Paper during the quarter
with an estimated impact on operating profit of €10 million. There were no significant
maintenance shuts during the first quarter of 2016. Based on prevailing market
prices, we continue to estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on
operating profit for 2017 will be around €80 million, of which around €35 million will
be incurred in the first half of the year (€20 million in the first half of 2016).

Divisional overview

In Packaging Paper, average selling prices for containerboard were down on the
comparable prior year period due to price erosion seen over the course of 2016.
Compared to the first quarter of 2016, average benchmark European kraftliner prices
were down 2.7%, recycled containerboard prices were down 5.8%, and white-top
kraftliner prices were marginally down. Supported by strong demand, price increases
were implemented in recycled containerboard, with a cumulative €80/tonne increase
having been achieved by the beginning of the second quarter. In unbleached
kraftliner grades, increases of €50/tonne were implemented towards the end of the
first quarter, while increases of up to €30/tonne in white top kraftliner have been
agreed for implementation in the second quarter of 2017. Given sustained good
demand and a strong order position, we have announced a further price increase of
€50/tonne for unbleached kraftliner grades to take effect during the second quarter of
2017.

Sales volumes for sack kraft paper remained at similar levels to the comparable prior
year period. As previously indicated, selling prices were increased by 3-4% from the
beginning of 2017 in all markets. Demand remains strong, particularly in our export
markets, supporting further price increases during the second quarter of 2017 of
3-4% in our European business and, where not fixed by annual contracts, in
overseas markets.

Our Fibre Packaging business benefited from good volume growth, particularly in
Corrugated Packaging, and a positive contribution from the acquisitions completed
during 2016. Recent paper price increases are impacting margins in the near term,
while strong cost management continues to limit the impact of other inflationary cost
pressures.

Consumer Packaging was impacted by inflationary cost pressures and negative
sales mix effects which were offset by increased volumes and the contributions from
recent acquisitions. Short term profit growth is proving challenging due to low growth
in certain value added product areas.

Uncoated Fine Paper continued to perform strongly despite weaker European
pricing, benefiting from good demand, stable Russian domestic pricing and a
stronger Russian rouble. Average benchmark European selling prices were down
4% on the comparable prior year period. During the first quarter, price increases of
around €15-€25 per tonne were implemented in Europe. Given continued good
demand, a further price increase of up to 6% was announced to be implemented in
Europe during May.

Our South Africa Division was impacted by a significantly lower forestry fair value
gain, lower average export selling prices for both hardwood pulp and white top
kraftliner, and a stronger rand, which more than offset higher average domestic
selling prices.

Capital investment projects

We are making good progress on our capital investment projects. The recently
completed projects in our Richards Bay (South Africa) and Syktyvkar (Russia) mills
are making good contributions. Ramp-up of the rebuilt paper and inline coating
machine in Steti (Czech Republic) remains challenging. Our investment at Swiecie
(Poland) to provide an additional 100,000 tonnes per annum of softwood pulp and
80,000 tonnes per annum of lightweight kraftliner is currently in ramp-up. The
process of obtaining approval for tax incentives and permitting for the proposed new
paper machines at our Steti and Ruzomberok (Slovakia) mills is ongoing and work
has started on the modernisation of the Steti pulp mill.

Cash flow and financing activities

Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows
related to our capital expenditure programme, acquisitions, and financing activities,
resulting in a reduction in net debt during the quarter.
In April 2017, we redeemed our 5.75% €500 million Eurobond from available cash
and committed undrawn debt facilities. This will result in a lower finance cost charge
for 2017.

There have been no other significant changes in the Group’s borrowing facilities
since 31 December 2016.

Outlook

As previously advised, we are experiencing some inflationary cost pressures across
the Group and the forestry fair value gain is expected to be lower than in 2016.
Supported by good demand, we have successfully implemented price increases in a
number of key paper grades and we expect to continue to benefit from our recently
completed capital projects and acquisitions. We remain confident of making progress
in the year and continuing to deliver industry leading returns.

In accordance with Rules 3.63-3.74 of the Listings Requirements of the JSE and/or
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules we advise that on 7 March 2017, a
number of transactions took place in relation to the Mondi Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”)
on behalf of directors/PDMRs of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc and the company
secretary of Mondi plc.
The SIP is an all-employee trust arrangement approved by UK HM Revenue and
Customs under which UK employees are able to buy Ordinary shares in Mondi plc
(“Mondi Shares”) using monthly deductions from salary and to receive allocations of
free matching Mondi Shares (“Matching Shares”).

There follow notification forms for three directors/PDMRs of Mondi Limited and Mondi
plc. In addition, in order to satisfy the Listings Requirements of the JSE, a notification
form for the Company Secretary of Mondi plc is also included. The price given for the
nil consideration matching shares reflects the market value on the day of purchase.

Notes:

(1) The Group presents underlying EBITDA, operating profit and related per share information as measures which exclude special items in 
    order to provide a more effective comparison of the underlying financial performance of the Group between financial reporting periods. 
    A reconciliation of underlying operating profit to profit before tax is provided in note 3 of the condensed financial statements.
(2) ROCE is underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of the average capital employed for the year, adjusted for impairments 
    and spend on strategic projects which are not yet in operation.

David Hathorn, Mondi Group chief executive, said:
""I am pleased to announce another strong performance, building on our track record of steadily improving profitability
over the last five years. Underlying operating profit was up 3% to EUR981 million and our return on capital 
employed was 20.3%.

We saw good contributions from all our businesses despite pricing headwinds in a number of key paper grades.
We made considerable progress in driving growth through our capital investment programme, delivering incremental
operating profit of around EUR50 million in 2016 from recently completed capital projects, with a further EUR30 million
anticipated in 2017. In addition to our significant pipeline of projects already in progress, the Boards have approved the
replacement of the recovery boiler at our Stetí mill in the Czech Republic and installation of a 90,000 tonne per annum
machine glazed speciality kraft paper machine for a total investment of EUR470 million.

We completed four acquisitions totalling EUR185 million in 2016, enhancing our product offering and geographic reach in
our Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses.

Our outlook for the business is positive. We have implemented or announced price increases in containerboard, sack kraft 
and uncoated fine paper grades, supported by good demand. We expect some inflationary cost pressures across the 
Group and a lower forestry fair value gain. Furthermore, we anticipate a more challenging trading environment in certain 
uncoated fine paper markets following price erosion in Europe over the course of 2016, combined with emerging market currency 
volatility. However, we expect to continue to benefit from contributions from our recently completed capital projects 
and acquisitions, together with steady organic growth in our downstream converting businesses.

Our consistent and focused strategy, robust business model and firm focus on operational excellence all continue to
contribute to our performance. We remain confident of continuing to deliver industry-leading returns.""

Group performance review
Our strong performance in 2016 builds on our track record of continuous improvement in profitability over the last five years. Our
consistent and focused strategy, robust business model and firm focus on operational excellence all continued to contribute 
to our performance.

Group revenue of EUR6,662 million was down 2% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue was in line
with the prior year. Good volume growth in Packaging Paper and Consumer Packaging and higher domestic selling prices in South
Africa and Russia were offset by lower average selling prices in Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging.

Underlying operating profit of EUR981 million was up 3% on the prior year. Packaging Paper was negatively impacted by lower selling
prices across most key grades and lower green energy prices, partially offset by like-for-like sales volume growth. Fibre Packaging
continued its positive development, with volume growth in Corrugated Packaging and a good performance from the core European
industrial bags business, partly offset by negative currency translation effects and ongoing challenges in the US industrial bags
business. We continue to make good progress in Consumer Packaging with strong volume growth and improving margins. In
Uncoated Fine Paper, Russian domestic price increases and a strong focus on productivity and efficiency more than offset
negative currency effects from the weaker rouble and flat average European pricing. Our South Africa Division was negatively
affected by sharply lower average export pulp selling prices and higher input costs which were only partially offset by positive
currency effects and a higher fair value gain on forestry assets. After taking the impact of special items of EUR38 million into
consideration, operating profit of EUR943 million was up 5% (2015 : EUR900 million).

Our passion for performance is central to the way we run our business and is demonstrated through a continuous focus on quality,
productivity and efficiency. We invest in our existing operations and, where appropriate, in strategic acquisitions to strengthen our
cost advantages, generate synergies through integration and enhance our product and service offering and/or geographic reach to
better serve our customers. In 2016 our recently completed capital investments contributed around EUR50 million in incremental
operating profit. We completed four acquisitions during the year: two corrugated packaging acquisitions, SIMET in Poland and
Lebedyan in Russia; and two in Consumer Packaging, Kalenobel in Turkey and Uralplastic in Russia. In February 2017, we
announced the acquisition of Excelsior Technologies Limited in the UK, further supporting the development of Consumer Packaging.

The impact of maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit in 2016 was around EUR75 million (2015: EUR90 million), slightly above
expectation due to a longer than anticipated shut at our Richards Bay mill (South Africa). Based on prevailing market prices, we
estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit in 2017 will be around EUR80 million.

Input costs were generally lower across our European businesses. Wood costs were lower than the prior year with a stable supply
and demand balance. Average benchmark costs for paper for recycling were up around 11% on 2015 as prices increased in the
second half of the year on strong export demand and increased European consumption. Energy costs were lower than the prior
year due to lower average crude oil and gas prices. Looking forward, rising commodity input costs are expected to put some
upward pressure on energy costs. Following the significant volatility in polyethylene prices in 2015, pricing was more stable during
the year, but on average at similar levels to the prior year. In our South Africa Division, inflationary pressures and higher imported
costs resulted in an increase in input costs.

Volatility in foreign exchange rates had a net negative impact on underlying operating profit of EUR31 million. The weakening of a
number of emerging market currencies, particularly the Russian rouble, Turkish lira, Polish zloty and Mexican peso, had a negative
impact on translation of the profits of our Fibre Packaging and domestically focused Russian uncoated fine paper operations, while
our South Africa Division benefited from the weakening of the rand due to its significant export position.

Our cash generation remained strong with cash generated from operations of EUR1,401 million up 10% on the prior year. Net debt
reduced by EUR115 million to EUR1,383 million, or 1.0 times EBITDA.

Underlying earnings of 137.8 euro cents per share were up 3% compared to 2015. After taking the effect of special items into
account, basic earnings of 131.8 euro cents per share were up 6% compared to 2015.

Our Boards have recommended payment of a final dividend of 38.19 euro cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year
to 57.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 10% on 2015.

Profitability in Packaging Paper, down 8% on the prior year, was impacted by lower average selling prices across most key grades,
lower green energy prices and the loss of contribution from the Raubling mill sold during 2015, partially offset by the benefits of
completed capital investment projects. However, the business unit delivered a strong ROCE performance of 22.4%.

On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the sale of the Raubling mill, sales volumes were marginally up across all
containerboard grades.

As anticipated, we saw some price erosion in the kraftliner grades in the first half of the year. While demand growth remained solid,
the market came under some pressure from increased supply from new capacity in Europe and competition from importers
benefiting from weak emerging market currencies. Average European benchmark selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were
down 5% on the prior year and white-top kraftliner prices were down around 2%. Supported by sustained good demand and a
strong order position, a price increase of EUR20 per tonne was implemented for unbleached kraftliner in August across all European
markets excluding southern Europe, partly offsetting the price erosion seen over the course of the first half of the year. In Russia,
price increases for white-top kraftliner were implemented at the beginning of 2016 and remained stable throughout the year.

In response to strong demand, price increases of EUR50 per tonne were recently implemented on all unbleached kraftliner grades in
Europe, effective from March 2017. A price increase of EUR50 per tonne has also been announced for white-top kraftliner to take
effect from the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. In Russia, prices for white-top kraftliner were increased from the 
beginning of 2017.

Average European benchmark selling prices for recycled containerboard were down 3% on the prior year period. Price increases
of EUR40 per tonne were achieved from February 2017 and a further increase of EUR40 per tonne has been announced to take effect
from the beginning of the second quarter of 2017.

Sales volumes for sack kraft paper increased compared to the prior year, benefiting from good demand, fewer planned
maintenance shuts and productivity improvements. Average selling prices for sack kraft paper produced in Europe declined by 5-
6% in the early part of 2016 and remained at those levels through the balance of the year. Given strong demand, selling prices
were increased by 3-4% from the beginning of 2017 in all markets.

We saw good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers, although sales volumes of certain grades were impacted by the
closure of high cost production capacity in 2015. Selling prices were, on average, marginally lower than in the prior year.

We have completed a number of investments across our mills in recent years and our focus in 2016 was on fully realising the
benefits of these investments. These benefits include a reduction in energy costs at our Swiecie mill (Poland) following the
completion in 2015 of the new recovery boiler, and improved productivity following the completion of a number of smaller
investments across our production base.

Input costs were at a similar level to the prior year with the business benefiting from cost savings initiatives and generally lower raw
material and energy costs which offset higher paper for recycling costs and other inflationary increases. Green energy prices were
significantly lower in Poland due to legislative changes, resulting in a EUR20 million reduction in income from green energy credits
compared to the prior year, including the impact of a write-down of EUR6 million in the carrying value of the inventory of green energy
credits held at year end.

Planned maintenance shuts at our Syktyvkar (Russia) and Swiecie (Poland) mills were completed during the first half of the year,
and a further planned maintenance shut at Swiecie and the majority of our kraft paper mill shuts were completed in the second half
of the year. A similar planned maintenance schedule is anticipated in 2017 although the shuts at our Swiecie and Stetí mills will be
extended as we progress our major capital investments in those operations.

In Fibre Packaging our underlying operating profit increased 3% to EUR123 million and ROCE was 13.5%, with volume growth in
Corrugated Packaging and a good performance from the core European industrial bags business partly offset by negative currency
translation effects and ongoing challenges in the US and CIS industrial bags businesses.

Corrugated Packaging achieved good organic volume growth, particularly in the Czech Republic and Germany, supplemented by
two acquisitions to expand our corrugated network. Mondi SIMET S.A. (Poland) complements our existing geographic footprint,
allows for logistics optimisation and provides increased production capacity in the growing Polish market. We started building work
for the conversion of this plant to a high-efficiency, heavy-duty box plant early in 2017. Mondi Lebedyan (Russia) provides us with
excellent opportunities in the local agricultural market and increases our ability to serve our multinational customers. Sales
volumes were negatively impacted in Turkey, due to ongoing political turbulence in the region, and Poland, where sales growth
was tempered by the Russian embargo preventing the export of fresh fruit and vegetables to that market. Profitability was also
negatively affected by the weaker Turkish lira and Polish zloty. Over the last two years, we have invested significantly in all our
corrugated operations, helping us to better serve our customers and meet their more sophisticated product needs. The business
benefited from lower paper input costs and productivity gains.

In Industrial Bags, while European markets remained robust, the business was negatively impacted by challenging market
conditions in the US and CIS. Overall, sales volumes declined 1% with good growth in Europe and the Middle East offset by
declines in the US and CIS. The breadth and geographic reach of our Industrial Bags network gives us the unique ability to fully
optimise our production network to better serve our customers. In 2016, we closed our facility at Sendenhorst (Germany), while
continuing to serve our customers from other sites and, in December 2016, announced the closure of our facility in southern
Belgium. We have also significantly increased the level of exports from our Mexican operations into the US, and started production
at our new operation in Cote d'Ivoire. Lower sales volumes were partly compensated by significant cost savings resulting from a
strong focus on cost management and the benefits of the restructuring and rationalisation activities. The weaker Mexican peso had
a negative impact on the translation of profits from our Mexican operations.

Consumer Packaging made good progress with strong volume growth and improving margins. Underlying operating profit
increased 12% to EUR121 million with a ROCE of 10.5%.

Good progress was made in our ongoing initiatives to improve the product mix. Strong volume growth was achieved in our higher
value-added segments of personal care components, consumer laminates, technical films, and release liners. The favourable
product mix and focus on value-added segments resulted in an improvement in our gross margin. On a like-for-like basis,
excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals, sales volumes grew around 4%. We remain well positioned for further growth.

The integration of the businesses acquired during 2015 is progressing well and we are realising the synergies from these
acquisitions. Two further acquisitions were completed in 2016, growing our product offering and geographic reach. Mondi
Kalenobel (Turkey) produces flexible consumer packaging for ice cream and other applications, as well as aseptic cartons, and
serves both international FMCG companies and regional food and beverage producers. The company exports approximately half
of its production - mainly to Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Mondi Uralplastic (Russia) manufactures a range
of consumer flexible packaging products for food, personal care, homecare, and other applications for both local and international
customers. A small net charge to underlying operating profit was incurred from these acquisitions in the second half of the year due
to the effects of acquisition accounting and transaction costs.

In February 2017, we announced the acquisition of Excelsior Technologies Limited in the UK, further supporting the development
of Consumer Packaging in high growth product applications. Excelsior is a vertically-integrated producer of innovative flexible
packaging solutions, mainly for food applications, with a unique packaging technology for microwave steam cooking,
complementing and enhancing our global food packaging offering.

We completed the closure of operations in Italy and Spain, announced in 2015, while retaining the ability to continue to serve
customers from our sites in central and eastern Europe. During 2016, we further debottlenecked some of our plants and
reallocated production between our sites to allow for site specialisation, optimised production activities, cost savings, productivity
improvements, and reduced waste. In the US, we announced the restructuring of our release liner operations, including the closure
of one site. We appointed a chief innovation officer and reorganised our research and development activities to further strengthen
our capabilities in this area. Fixed costs were higher, in line with our increased focus on innovation and customer service, partially
offset by one-off gains in the first half of the year.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business delivered an exceptional performance, generating underlying operating profit of EUR264 million,
up 25% on the prior year, with a ROCE of 36%. Domestic price increases in the CIS markets and a strong focus on productivity
and efficiency more than offset negative currency effects from the weaker rouble and flat European pricing.

Uncoated fine paper sales volumes increased 1% over the prior year, reflecting a strong performance in an overall declining
market. European market demand is estimated to have contracted in 2016 by 3-4%, following stable demand in 2015, bringing the
average demand contraction over the past two years to 1-2% per year, in line with the longer-term trend. Demand in the CIS
remained stable.

Benchmark average selling prices in Europe were similar to the prior year, but 2% down in the second half of the year compared to
the first half. Selling price increases were implemented at the beginning of the year but came under pressure early in the second
half due to weak European demand and pressure from imports offsetting the benefits of industry capacity rationalisation in the prior
year. Demand improved towards the end of year and a price increase of 5-7% has been announced across all uncoated fine paper
grades in Europe from February 2017.

Selling prices were increased in Russia at the beginning of 2016, offsetting the effects of domestic cost inflation. Prices remain
stable going into 2017.

The business benefited from generally lower input costs, particularly energy costs. In Russia, wood costs were lower in rouble
terms, while in Europe wood costs increased marginally. Our commercial excellence programmes, focused on purchased material,
operating efficiencies and productivity improvements, contributed to good cost control, offsetting inflationary cost pressures, most
notably in Russia. Hardwood pulp prices were 11% lower in euro terms providing a benefit to our semi-integrated Neusiedler
(Austria) operations.

Planned maintenance shuts were completed at Syktyvkar in the first half of the year, at Ruzomberok in both the first and second
half, and at Neusiedler in the second half of the year. In 2017, our Syktyvkar shut is planned for the first half of the year and our
Ruzomberok and Neusiedler mill shuts are scheduled for the second half.

Our South Africa Division was negatively affected by sharply lower average pulp export selling prices and higher input costs which
were only partially offset by positive currency effects, a higher fair value gain on forestry assets and domestic price increases.
Underlying operating profit of EUR147 million was down 9% on a very strong performance in the prior year and ROCE was 27.8%.

Strong domestic demand for uncoated fine paper and white-top kraftliner was met by reducing exports of these products and
increasing the amount of pulp converted to these paper grades. Domestic demand for pulp decreased, compensated by a higher
level of exports. Overall, sales volumes were marginally lower than in the prior year.

Domestic selling prices were higher across all our grades. Export prices for white-top kraftliner were broadly in line with the prior
year and average benchmark US dollar pulp prices were around 11% lower than the previous year. Lower export prices were
partially compensated by the weaker rand.

Forestry gains are dependent on a variety of factors over which we have limited control. In 2016, selling prices of timber increased
significantly and a fair value gain of EUR64 million (2015: EUR40 million) was recognised, of which EUR48 million was recognised in the first
half of the year. The increase in the fair value gain was offset by the consequent impact of higher felling costs.

Inflationary price increases in labour and electricity, higher wood costs mainly due to the forestry revaluation, and the impact of the
weaker South African rand on imported materials put pressure on input costs. These impacts were partially mitigated by our focus
on cost optimisation, driving efficiencies and reducing waste.

An extended planned maintenance shut at Richards Bay, which included the tie-in of our recent capital investments, took place
during the second half of 2016 and a much shorter shut is planned for the second half of 2017.

Special items
Special items are those items of financial performance that we believe should be separately disclosed to assist in the
understanding of our underlying financial performance. Special items are considered to be material either in nature or in amount.

The net special item charge of EUR38 million before tax comprised the following:

-    Restructuring and closure costs of EUR17 million and related impairments of EUR15 million for the closure of an Industrial Bags
     (Fibre Packaging) plant in southern Belgium and restructuring of our US release liner business (Consumer Packaging),
     including the closure of one operation.
-    In our South Africa Division, we took the decision to restart our second uncoated fine paper machine to meet domestic
     demand for reels and, at the same time, reduce our production of newsprint in response to declining demand. This gave
     rise to a further impairment of the newsprint assets of EUR7 million, the reversal of impairment of the uncoated fine paper
     assets of EUR2 million, and restructuring costs of EUR1 million.

Further detail is provided in note 4 of our condensed combined and consolidated financial statements.

Tax
Based on our geographic profit mix and the applicable tax rates, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%. However, we
benefited from tax incentives related to our capital investments in Slovakia, Poland and Russia. In addition, we recognised
deferred tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses which we now expect to be able to utilise in the coming years. As
such, our underlying tax charge for 2016 of EUR166 million (2015: EUR161 million) reflects an effective tax rate of 19%, consistent with
2015. Tax relief on special items amounted to EUR9 million (2015: EUR10 million).

Tax paid in 2016 of EUR173 million (2015: EUR160 million) is higher than the 2016 tax charge as a result of the timing of final tax
payments for 2015 and earlier financial years.

Going forward, assuming a similar profit mix, we would anticipate marginal upward pressure on the tax rate over the next three
years as it moves towards the expected tax rate of 22%.

Cash flow
Our cash generation remained strong. In 2016, the cash generated from our operations was EUR1,401 million, up 10%. On average
over the last five years, cash generated from operations has increased by 10.5% per year.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 12%, marginally up on the prior year (11.6%). The net cash inflow from
movements in working capital during the year was EUR68 million (2015: inflow of EUR9 million).

We paid dividends of EUR274 million to shareholders (2015: EUR209 million). Interest paid of EUR82 million (2015: EUR93 million) was lower
than the prior year, mainly due to the lower average net debt and composition of our borrowings.

In 2016, we invested EUR465 million (2015: EUR595 million) in capital expenditure and completed four acquisitions with a total purchase
price, on a debt and cash free basis, of EUR185 million.

Capital investments
Investing in our high-quality, low-cost assets to maintain and enhance our competitive advantage is of particular importance in our
pulp and paper assets where products are generally more commoditised and low-cost production is key. Our focus is on enhancing
our cost competitiveness, improving energy efficiency, meeting the needs of our customers and delivering organic growth in our
packaging businesses.

Our disciplined approach to investigating, approving and executing capital projects is one of our key strengths and plays an
important role in successfully delivering the returns we require. Over the last three years, our major capital projects have
contributed around EUR150 million of incremental operating profit, including EUR50 million in 2016, and we expect to generate a further
EUR30 million in 2017.

We are in the process of commissioning the second phase of our project at Swiecie (Poland), which will provide an additional
100,000 tonnes per annum of softwood pulp and 80,000 tonnes per annum of lightweight kraftliner. At our Stetí mill (Czech
Republic), the ramp-up of our rebuilt paper and inline coating machine has been slower than anticipated. We have allocated
additional capital to meet quality requirements that are higher than the original project specifications, and expect to ramp up
production over the course of 2017.

Towards the end of 2016 we completed the investment project to upgrade the woodyard at our Richards Bay mill (South Africa),
which has significantly improved efficiencies at the mill and facilitated improved efficiencies in wood handling processes in our
forests, providing higher-quality fibre, reduced maintenance costs, improved reliability, and some energy savings. Our investment
to produce unbleached kraftliner in addition to white-top kraftliner at our Richards Bay mill gives us the opportunity to supply our
customers with this specialised product.

In recent years, we have invested significantly in the modernisation and growth of our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer
Packaging businesses. Looking forward, while still considering capital investment opportunities in these businesses, we are
focused on the optimisation of our existing operations and recent investments.

We have a strong pipeline of large projects over the next few years:

-    The new 300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine at Ruzomberok (EUR310 million). This project remains subject to
     obtaining approval of tax incentives from the European Commission and necessary permitting.
-    During 2016, the Boards approved a new woodyard and bleaching line modernisation at Stetí (EUR41 million).
-    In January 2017, the Boards approved a further EUR470 million for the replacement of the recovery boiler at Stetí, the rebuild
     of the fibre lines, the debottlenecking of the paper machines and an investment in a new 90,000 tonnes per annum
     machine glazed speciality kraft paper machine. This project remains subject to obtaining tax incentives and necessary permitting.

Given the approved project pipeline, our annual capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of EUR600-650 million in 2017 and
EUR800-850 million in 2018 as expenditure on these large projects accelerates.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 31 December 2016 was down EUR115 million at EUR1,383 million (2015: EUR1,498 million), reflecting our strong cash
generating capacity despite our ongoing capital expenditure programme and EUR185 million spent on acquisitions.

On 14 April 2016, we issued a 1.5% EUR500 million Eurobond with an eight-year term under our European Medium Term Note
Programme, thereby extending the Group's maturity profile and ensuring ample liquidity. At the end of the year, EUR812 million of our
EUR2.5 billion committed debt facilities remained undrawn and we held net cash of EUR377 million. The weighted average maturity of our
Eurobonds and committed debt facilities was 3.9 years at 31 December 2016. Gearing at 31 December 2016 was 27.2% and our
net debt to 12 month trailing EBITDA ratio was 1.0 times, well within our key financial covenant requirement of 3.5 times.

Our credit ratings were reaffirmed during the year. Our credit rating from Standard & Poor's is BBB (stable outlook) and from
Moody's Investors Service is Baa2 (stable outlook).

Net finance costs of EUR101 million were EUR4 million lower than the previous year. Average net debt of EUR1,476 million was 11% lower
than the prior year and our effective interest rate was 6.2% (2015: 6.3%). Net finance costs are expected to reduce in 2017 due to
the redemption of the April 2017 5.5% EUR500 million Eurobond from available cash and committed undrawn debt facilities.

Growing Responsibly
Our long-term success is dependent on our ability to integrate sustainability across the Group. This ensures that we can continue
to address the risks and opportunities that arise from global environmental and societal trends, retain our competitive edge and
generate value for our stakeholders. We believe that being part of the solution to global challenges will secure the long-term
success of our business and secure the wellbeing of our communities and other stakeholders.

We have a strong track record of delivering on our sustainability commitments. At the end of 2015 we completed our previous
commitment period and this year we launched our Growing Responsibly model. While growing responsibly has long been part of
our philosophy, the model provides the business with a formal framework to demonstrate, monitor and improve the way
sustainability is embedded in the business. The model includes 16 clearly defined 2020 commitments (the climate commitment
runs to 2030) across 10 action areas.

With the resultant strong focus on a safe, fair and diverse workforce, working towards a more transparent and responsible supply
chain, and continued commitment to minimising our climate footprint, we are able to address risks and opportunities across our
business. A number of our recent, ongoing and planned capital expenditure projects will help us to meet our new commitments,
particularly those relating to green energy and emissions reduction.

Our people are important to us, particularly when it comes to ensuring that everyone returns home safely to their families every
day. It is very encouraging that the steps we have taken resulted in a significantly improved total recordable case rate in 2016. With
zero harm our ultimate goal, we have been working hard to eliminate fatal and life-altering injuries. Our focus on the top fatal risks at all
operations has allowed us to better anticipate and manage our highest risk activities - which usually occur during annual
maintenance shuts and project implementation. These efforts thankfully contributed to us experiencing no fatalities or life-
altering injuries during the year. Regrettably in February 2017 we suffered a fatality in our South African forestry operations 
following a timber vehicle accident. We remain determined to focus on top risks so that fatalities and life-altering injuries are 
not a part of our future.

Dividend
The Boards' aim is to offer shareholders long-term dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times
over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and the Boards' stated objective to increase distributions to
shareholders through the ordinary dividend, the Boards have recommended an increase in the final dividend.

The Boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc have recommended a final dividend of 38.19 euro cents per share (2015: 37.62 euro
cents per share), payable on 18 May 2017 to shareholders on the register on 21 April 2017. Together with the interim dividend of
18.81 euro cents per share, paid on 13 September 2016, this amounts to a total dividend for the year of 57.0 euro cents per share,
an increase of 10% on the 2015 total dividend of 52.0 euro cents per share.

The final dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc at the respective Annual General
Meetings scheduled for 11 May 2017.

Outlook
Our outlook for the business is positive. We have implemented or announced price increases in containerboard, sack kraft and 
uncoated fine paper grades, supported by good demand. We expect some inflationary cost pressures across the Group and a 
lower forestry fair value gain. Furthermore, we anticipate a more challenging trading environment in certain uncoated fine paper 
markets following price erosion in Europe over the course of 2016, combined with emerging market currency volatility. However, 
we expect to continue to benefit from contributions from our recently completed capital projects and acquisitions, together 
with steady organic growth in our downstream converting businesses.

Our consistent and focused strategy, robust business model and firm focus on operational excellence all continue to contribute to
our performance. We remain confident of continuing to deliver industry-leading returns.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. They
have put procedures in place for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks that the Group faces. In combination
with the audit committee, the Boards have conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which Mondi is exposed and
they are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk tolerance 
levels established.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business, and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes. Our internal control environment is designed to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to provide reasonable assurance that the Group's business objectives will be achieved.

Strategic risks
The industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long-term risks which are accepted by the Boards as a
consequence of the Group's chosen strategy and operating footprint.

While there have been no significant changes in our strategic risk exposure during the year, we continue to monitor recent capacity
announcements and the developments in the process as the UK seeks to exit the European Union.

The executive committee and Boards monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall
exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate
exposure to such risks.

Industry productive capacity
Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills. New capacity additions are usually in large increments
which, through their impact on the supply/demand balance, influence market prices. Unless market growth exceeds capacity
additions, excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices. In our converting operations newer technology may lower operating
costs and provide increased product functionality impacting margins.

We monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity and utilisation levels, as well as trends and developments in our
own product markets.

Our strategic focus on low-cost production and innovation activities to produce higher value added products, combined with our
focus on growing markets and consistent investment in our operating capacity, ensures that we remain competitive.

Product substitution
Changing global socio-economic and demographic trends and consumption patterns and increased public awareness of
sustainability challenges affect the demand for Mondi's products. Customers' needs and purchasing power are changing in
emerging markets. Substitution may be to different products not produced by Mondi or to different solutions meeting the same
customer requirement. Factors that impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials, increased
use of recycled materials, electronic substitution of paper products, increased demand for high-quality printed material, certified
and responsibly produced goods, and specific material qualities.

Our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new
products on a sustainable, competitive and cost-effective basis. Opportunities also exist for us to take market share from
substitutes produced by our competitors. Our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics and growing regional
markets as we work with our customers to develop new markets and new products. Our broad range of converting products
provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic-based packaging products.

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins
Our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and demand for our products, which are, in turn, influenced by macro-
economic conditions, consumer spending preferences, and inventory levels maintained by our customers. Changes in prices differ
between products and geographic regions and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied significantly over time.

Our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation,
proximity or production cost. We continue to invest in our high-quality, low-cost production assets to ensure we maintain our
competitive cost position. We are committed to meeting service levels and product quality requirements. Our high levels of vertical
integration reduce our exposure to price volatility of our key input costs. Our financial policies and structures take the inherent price
volatility of the markets in which we operate into consideration.

Country risk
We have production operations across more than 30 countries; some in jurisdictions where the political, economic, and legal
systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic upheaval,
inflation, changes in laws, nationalisation, or expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations 
in those countries.

Despite improvements in certain segments of the global economy, uncertainties remain over slowing growth, political and
economic structural weakness in the eurozone's single currency framework, and uncertainty over the outcomes of the UK's
decision to exit from the European Union.

Areas of weaker governance also present the challenge of addressing potential human rights issues in our operations and supply
chain. The introduction of the UK Modern Slavery Act has further highlighted the need to identify and address potential risks of
child labour, forced or bonded labour and human trafficking in our supply chain. From a human capital perspective, we face
different demographic and social conditions in each country which affects the availability of skills and talent for the Group.

We actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate. Regular formal and informal interaction with government
officials, local communities, and business partners assist us to remain abreast of changes and new developments. The Boards
have approved specific country risk premiums to be added to the required returns on investment projects in those countries where
risks are deemed to be higher and new investments are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation. Where we have
large operations in higher risk locations, we maintain a permanent internal audit presence and operate asset protection units.

We are in the process of reviewing how we assess, monitor, and manage risks in our supply chain, including the use of country-
based risk assessment tools and databases. We actively engage with our employees, communities and other stakeholders for a
better understanding of local socio-economic conditions and development needs. Our geographic diversity and decentralised
management structure, utilising local resources in countries in which we operate, reduces our exposure to any specific jurisdiction.

Financial risks
We aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance with
all laws and regulations.

Despite ongoing short-term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies, our overall
residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years, reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management.

Capital structure
A strong and stable financial position increases our flexibility and provides us with the ability to take advantage of strategic
opportunities as they arise. Our ability to raise debt and/or equity financing is significantly influenced by general economic
conditions, developments in credit markets, equity market volatility, and our credit rating. Failure to obtain financing at reasonable
rates could prevent us from realising our strategy and have a negative impact on our competitive position.

We operate a central treasury function under a board-approved treasury policy. We provide regular reporting to the Boards on our
treasury management policies. We aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and we have access to a variety of sources of
funding with varying maturities. We only enter into contracts relating to financial instruments with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings.

Currency risk
We operate in more than 30 countries and are thus exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates. The impact of
currency fluctuations affect us because of mismatches between the currencies in which our operating costs are incurred and those
in which revenues are received. Key operating cost currencies that are not fully offset by local currency denominated revenues
include the South African rand, Polish zloty, Swedish krona, and Czech koruna; while the revenues generated in US dollar,
Russian rouble and UK pound sterling are greater than operating costs incurred in those currencies. In addition, appreciation of the
euro compared with the currencies of the other key paper producing regions or paper pricing currencies, notably the US dollar,
would reduce the competitiveness of the products Mondi produces in Europe compared to imports from such key paper-producing
regions which could potentially lead to lower revenues and earnings.

We fund our entities in their local currencies to minimise translation risk. This exposes us to interest rate risk from these currencies
which we aim to manage through interest rate swaps and fixed rate borrowings. Balance sheet exposure and material forecast
future capital expenditure transactions are hedged. We do not permit speculative currency positions. We do not hedge our
exposure to projected future sales or purchases and our businesses respond to currency fluctuations through changes in selling
prices or increasing the level of exports where competitiveness improves as currencies weaken. Our strategic focus on low-cost
production assets and operational efficiency provide inherent cost advantages, protecting us from adverse currency fluctuations.

Tax risks
We operate in a number of countries - all with different tax systems. We make significant intragroup charges, the basis for which is
subject to review during tax audits. In addition, the international tax environment is becoming more onerous, requiring increasing
transparency and reporting and in-depth scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies.

The Boards have approved the Group's Tax Policy. We aim to manage our affairs conservatively and our operations are structured
tax efficiently to take advantage of available incentives and exemptions. We have dedicated tax resources throughout the Group
supported by a centralised Group tax team. We obtain external advisory opinions for all major tax projects, such as acquisitions
and restructuring activities, and make use of external benchmarks where possible. Arm's length principles are applied in the pricing
of all intra-group transactions in accordance with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines.

Operational risks
A low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence, investment in our people and
commitment to the responsible use of resources.

Our investments to improve our energy efficiency, engineer out our most significant fatal risks, improve operating efficiencies, and
renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events. However, the potential impact of any such event
remains unchanged.

Cost and availability of raw materials
Access to sustainable sources of raw materials is essential to our operations. We have access to our own sources of wood in
Russia and South Africa and we purchase wood, paper for recycling, pulp, and polymers for film production to meet our needs in
the balance of our operations. Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced quantities of available wood
supply that meet our standards for chain-of-custody certified or controlled wood and initiatives to promote the use of wood as a
renewable energy source.

We are committed to acquiring our raw materials from sustainable, responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial
or illegal supply. We are involved in multi-stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for
sustainable, responsible fibre and we encourage legislation supporting the local collection of recycled materials. The sustainable
management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall environmental impact, helping to protect ecosystems, and
developing resilient landscapes. We have built strong forestry management resources in Russia and South Africa to actively
monitor and manage our wood resources in those countries. We have multiple suppliers for each of our operations and our
centralised procurement teams work closely with our operations in actively pursuing longer term agreements with strategic
suppliers. We have developed an internal monitoring and risk assessment system to understand and manage the performance of
our suppliers and their adherence to our Suppliers' Code of Conduct.

Energy security and related input costs
Mondi is a significant consumer of electricity which is generated internally and purchased from external suppliers. Where we do not
generate electricity from biomass and by-products of our production processes, we are dependent on external suppliers for raw
materials such as gas, oil and coal. Increasing energy costs contribute significantly to increasing chemical, fuel, and transportation
costs which are often difficult to pass on to customers. As an energy-intensive business, we face potential physical and regulatory
risks related to climate change.

We monitor our electricity usage, carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy. Most of our larger operations have high
levels of electricity self-sufficiency. We focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations by investing in improvements to
our energy profile and increased electricity self-sufficiency, while reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon emission levels.
Where we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, we may sell such surplus externally. We also generate revenue
from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations at prices determined in the open market.

Technical integrity of our operating assets
We have five major mills which account for approximately 74% of our total pulp and paper production capacity and a significant
consumer packaging manufacturing facility in Germany. If operations at any of these key facilities are interrupted for any significant
length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance. Accidents or incidents such as fires,
explosions, or large machinery breakdowns could result in property damage, loss of production, reputational damage, and/or
safety incidents.

Our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity and our
proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to improve production reliability and minimise breakdown risks. We conduct
detailed risk assessments of our high-priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the ongoing
management and maintenance of such equipment. We actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to
share lessons learnt across our operations, identify emerging issues, conduct benchmarking, and evaluate the effectiveness of our
risk reduction activities.

Environmental impact of our operations
We operate in a high-impact sector and need to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Our operations are water,
carbon and energy intensive; consume materials such as fibre, polymers, metals and chemicals; and generate emissions to air,
water and land. We are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land. We are subject to a wide range of
international, national and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of our customers and
expectations of our broader stakeholders. Costs of continuing compliance, potential restoration and clean-up activities, and
increasing costs from the effects of emissions have an adverse impact on our profitability.

We ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements where we operate. Our own
policies and procedures, at or above local policy requirements, are embedded in all our operations and are supported through the
use of externally accredited environmental management systems. We focus on a clean production philosophy to address the
impact from emissions, discharge, and waste. We focus on increasing the energy efficiency of our operations and using biomass-
based fuels in order to reduce our use of fossil-based energy sources. We have undertaken detailed compliance assessments
regarding Industry Emissions and Energy Efficiency Directives to determine future investment requirements. We emphasise the
responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems and protect high conservation value areas.

Employee and contractor safety
We operate large facilities, often in remote locations. Accidents/incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors, property
damage, lost production time, and/or harm to our reputation. Risks include: fatalities, serious injuries, illness, disease, and
substance abuse.

We have a goal of zero harm. We continually monitor incidents and close calls and actively transfer learnings across our
operations. We apply an externally accredited safety management system and conduct regular audits of our operations to ensure
our facilities remain fit-for-purpose. We have implemented a project to engineer out the most significant risks in our operations
which is supported by robust controls and procedures for operating those assets. We provide extensive training to ensure that
performance standards and practice notes are communicated and understood and our incentives are impacted by the non-
achievement of safety milestones.

Compliance risks
We have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks. Our strong culture and values, emphasised in every part of our business
with a focus on integrity, honesty, and transparency, underpins our approach.

Reputational risk
Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct in any of the
jurisdictions in which we operate and within our supply chain could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. These
requirements include laws relating to the environment, exports, price controls, taxation, human rights, and labour. Fines imposed
by authorities for non-compliance are severe and, in some cases, legislation can result in criminal sanction for entities and
individuals found guilty.

We operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported by self-certification and reporting, with personal
sanction for failure to comply with Group policies. Our legal and governance compliance is supported by a centralised legal
compliance team and is subject to regular internal audit review. We operate a confidential reporting hotline, Speakout, enabling
employees, customers, suppliers, managers and other stakeholders to raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our
values. We increasingly work with our suppliers to promote responsible business conduct in the value chain.

Information technology risk
Many of our operations are dependent on the availability of IT services and an extended interruption of such services may result in
plant shutdown and an inability to meet customer requirements. Cyber crime continues to increase and attempts are increasingly
sophisticated, with the consequences of successful attacks including compromised data, financial fraud, and system shutdowns.

We have a comprehensive IT Security Policy approved by our Boards. We conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external
providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures. Where possible, we have redundancies in place, our system
landscape is based on well-proven products, and we have cyber crime insurance. We operate an extensive training and
awareness programme for all our users.

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget, considered the assumptions contained in the budget, and reviewed the critical
risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current macroeconomic
environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the annual financial
statements. At 31 December 2016, Mondi had EUR812 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have
maturity dates of between 1 and 9 years, with a weighted average maturity of 3.9 years.

Based on their evaluation, the Boards are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity to meet its
obligations and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Notes to the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2016

1 Basis of preparation
The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company (DLC)
structure. The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries,
operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition
and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). They have been derived from the audited
combined and consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared in accordance with IFRS; the South African Institute of
Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee; the requirements of the
Companies Act of South Africa 2008; Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council; and
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. They do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS.

The condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the
commentary under the heading 'Going concern'.

The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December
2016 or 2015 but is derived from those accounts. Statutory accounts for 2015 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies,
and those for 2016 will be delivered in due course. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were (i) unqualified,
(ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their
report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006. Copies of their unqualified
auditors' reports on the Integrated report and financial statements 2016 as well as the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements are available for inspection at the Mondi Limited and Mondi plc registered offices.

These condensed combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the
fair valuing of financial instruments and forestry assets.

2 Accounting policies
The same accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation have been followed in the preparation of the condensed
combined and consolidated financial statements as were applied in the preparation of the Group's annual financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2015, except that the quantitative threshold for recognition of special items incurred after 1 January
2016 has been increased to EUR10 million (2015: EUR5 million). Subsequent adjustments to items previously recognised as special
items continue to be reflected as special items in future periods even if they do not exceed the reporting threshold.

3 Operating segments
Identification of the Group's externally reportable operating segments
The Group's operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive
committee, the chief operating decision-making body. Due to its unique characteristics in terms of geography, currency and
underlying risks, the South Africa Division is managed and reported as a separate geographic segment. The remaining operating
segments, consolidated as the Europe & International Division, are managed based on the nature of the underlying products
produced by those businesses and comprise four distinct segments.

Each of the reportable segments derives its income from the sale of manufactured products.

Transaction costs of EUR5 million were charged to the condensed combined and consolidated income statement.

The fair value accounting of these acquisitions is provisional in nature. The nature of these businesses is such that further
adjustments to the carrying values of acquired assets and/or liabilities, and adjustments to the purchase price, are possible as the
detail of the acquired businesses is evaluated post acquisition. If necessary, any adjustments to the fair values recognised will be
made within 12 months of the acquisition dates.

In respect of trade and other receivables, the gross contractual amounts receivable less the best estimates at the acquisition dates
of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected approximate the book values and the revaluation amounts respectively
as presented.

Purchase price adjustment of KSP
In accordance with the KSP purchase agreement, a payment of EUR13 million has been recognised in the current year, and reflected
as an adjustment to Goodwill recognised.

To 31 December 2015

Mondi acquired 100% of the outstanding share capital of Ascania nonwoven Germany GmbH (Ascania) (Germany) on 2 November 2015 for a
consideration of EUR53 million on a debt and cash-free basis. Ascania is a producer of nonwoven fabrics and nonwoven composites
primarily used for personal care, hygiene and medical products as well as household applications.

On 14 December 2015, Mondi acquired a 95% interest in KSP, Co. (KSP) (South Korea and Thailand), for a consideration of EUR54 million on 
a debt and cash-free basis. The preliminary purchase price of EUR41 million reported in 2015 was based on provisional results. On finalisation of the
2015 financial results the purchase price was confirmed at EUR54 million. KSP is a flexible packaging company specialising in the
production of high-quality spouted and retort stand-up pouches for the food, pet food and beverage industries.

The provisional fair values at acquisition of KSP have been adjusted. Property, plant and equipment reduced by EUR1 million, trade
and other receivables by EUR2 million. Trade and other payables increased by EUR1 million and borrowings reduced by EUR4 million. The
net effect of the adjustments is EURnil and has been recorded during the year ended 31 December 2016.

Capital commitments are based on capital projects approved by the end of the financial year and the budget approved by the
Boards. Major capital projects still require further approval before they commence and are not included in the above analysis. The
Group's capital commitments are expected to be financed from existing cash resources and borrowing facilities.
In January 2017, the Boards approved a further EUR470 million capital spend at Stetí (Czech Republic). Capital expenditure is
expected to be incurred in the three years from 2017 to 2019 and is not included in the capital commitments detailed above.



16 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities comprise aggregate amounts as at 31 December 2016 of EUR11 million (2015: EUR9 million) in respect of loans and
guarantees given to banks and other third parties. No acquired contingent liabilities have been recorded in the Group's condensed
combined and consolidated statement of financial position for either year presented.



17 Fair value measurement
Financial instruments that are measured in the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value,
or where the fair value of financial instruments have been disclosed in notes to the condensed combined and consolidated
financial statements, are based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
- level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
  as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
The only assets measured at fair value on level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy are the Group's forestry assets as set
out in note 10 and certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations.
There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are
determined using generally accepted valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market
data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.
Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include:
- the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash
  flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates;
- the Group's commodity price derivatives are valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the
  present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data; and
- other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.
Except as detailed below, the directors consider that the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at
amortised cost in the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.

The non-controlling interest holder in Kalenobel holds an option to put its shares to Mondi until June 2021, but not before
March 2018, at a price determined based on future earnings. The present value of the option is EUR9 million based on the current
expected business plan, and is capped at TRY100 million (EUR27 million).

18 Related party transactions
The Group and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sale, purchase and service transactions with
equity accounted investees and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that are no
less favourable than those arranged with third parties. These transactions, in total, are not considered to be significant.

Transactions between Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and their respective subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated
on consolidation.

There have been no significant changes to the related parties as disclosed in note 31 of the Group's annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Glossary of financial terms
This announcement contains a number of terms which are explained below:

Net debt                               A measure comprising short, medium, and long-term interest-bearing borrowings
                                       and the fair value of debt-related derivatives less cash and cash equivalents and
                                       current financial asset investments.
Return on capital employed (ROCE)      Trailing 12-month underlying operating profit, including share of associates' net
                                       profit, divided by trailing 12-month average capital employed and for segments has
                                       been extracted from management reports. Capital employed is adjusted for
                                       impairments in the year and spend on those strategic projects which are not yet in
                                       production.
Special items                          Those financial items which the Group believes should be separately
                                       disclosed on the face of the combined and consolidated income statement to assist
                                       in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
                                       Special items affect year-on-year comparability and the Group therefore excludes
                                       these items when reporting underlying earnings and related measures in order to
                                       provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group on a basis that is
                                       comparable from year to year.
Underlying EBITDA                      Operating profit before special items, depreciation and amortisation.
Underlying operating profit            Operating profit before special items.
Underlying profit before tax           Reported profit before tax and special items.
Underlying earnings                    Net profit after tax before special items attributable to shareholders.

David Hathorn to retire and Peter Oswald to be appointed as Group Chief Executive
Officer

Mondi Group (“Mondi” or “the Group”) announces that David Hathorn, Group Chief Executive
Officer, has informed the Boards of his decision to retire. Peter Oswald, currently an Executive
Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Europe & International Division, will succeed David
as Group Chief Executive Officer.

In order to ensure a smooth transition, David and Peter will work together over the next three
months and David will stand down as Group Chief Executive Officer and as a director of Mondi
plc and Mondi Limited at the conclusion of the Annual General Meetings on 11 May 2017, at
which time Peter will assume the full responsibility as the Group Chief Executive Officer.
Thereafter David will support Peter as required and continue to work in an executive capacity
until his retirement in February 2018.

The joint chairmen, David Williams and Fred Phaswana, commented:

“David has made an immense contribution to the growth and development of Mondi. David
joined the Group in 1991, and has served as CEO since 2000. He was instrumental in the
Group’s international expansion and the development of the high-quality asset base that forms
the foundation of the Group today. He has led Mondi through major change in this period, most
notably in the establishment of Mondi as an independently listed Group through the demerger
from Anglo American plc in 2007. Since listing in 2007 the market capitalisation of the Group
has more than quadrupled, with a compound annual return to shareholders of over 18%. The
Boards are extremely grateful to David for his contribution to the Group over the past 26 years
of service and wish him all the best in his retirement.

We are delighted to have someone of Peter’s calibre and experience to succeed David as
CEO. Peter has been with the Group in various roles since joining in 1992, serving as an
Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Europe & International Division since
January 2008. Peter is a proven leader with an intimate knowledge of the business, having
been involved in the development of much of what comprises the Group today. We are
confident that Peter will offer strong continuity, while bringing his own dynamism to the role.
We look forward to David and Peter working together to ensure a smooth transition of
leadership.”
Commenting on his appointment, Peter Oswald said:

“I am honoured to accept the appointment and look forward to working with the Boards and
the rest of our team in continuing the successful development of the business. With our clear
and consistent strategic focus, robust business model, world class assets, rigorous and
disciplined approach to capital allocation, and strong financial position, we are well equipped
to serve our growing customer base and deliver the ongoing success of the Group for the
benefit of all stakeholders.”

David Hathorn, Group Chief Executive Officer, added:

“It has been a great privilege to have worked for the Mondi Group over the past 26 years, being
involved in its development from a regional business to a truly international group delivering
industry leading returns. It gives me great confidence in the future success of the business to
be able to hand over to Peter, who has been alongside me for much of this journey. I wish
Peter and the team all the very best.”



Notes:

Peter Oswald graduated in law from the University of Vienna and in business administration
from WU-Vienna Business School.

Peter has over 25 years’ experience in the packaging and paper sector with detailed
knowledge of operations and extensive experience of the acquisition, disposal, restructuring,
turnaround and organic growth of businesses. He began his career with Deutsche Bank and
automotive company KTM. He joined the Frantschach Group in 1992 as the head of internal
audit, later becoming corporate controller.

After serving as chief executive of the bag and flexibles business from 1995 to 2001, he was
appointed chief executive of Mondi Packaging Europe in 2002, leading its subsequent
integration with Frantschach into the new Mondi packaging division. Having held a number of
senior executive roles within Mondi, Peter was appointed chief executive officer of the Europe
& International Division in January 2008. He was a non-executive director of Telekom Austria
AG between 2008 and 2014 and of MIBA AG between 2014 and 2015 and chairman of the
supervisory board of OMV AG between 2015 and 2016. Peter is currently serving as Chairman
of the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI). In 2013, Peter was named
European and Global CEO of the year by RISI, a leading information provider for the global
forest products industry. Peter will continue to be based in Vienna.

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc (together “Mondi
Group” or “Mondi”) notify both the JSE Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters
required to be disclosed under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and/or the
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom
Listing Authority. This announcement contains inside information and falls within the ‘inside

Modernisation and expansion of the Steti mill in the Czech Republic

As previously stated, Mondi continues to assess capital investment opportunities centred on
the Group’s high-quality, low-cost packaging paper assets in central Europe.

The Mondi Boards have approved the modernisation and expansion of the Steti mill for a total
investment of €470 million, subject to obtaining approval for various tax incentives and
necessary permitting. The project consists of the installation of a new recovery boiler, the
rebuild of the fibre lines, the debottlenecking of the paper machines and an investment in a
new 90,000 tonnes per annum machine glazed kraft paper machine. Key benefits of the project
are:

   -   Increased electricity self-sufficiency, lower energy costs and reduced environmental
       footprint of the mill
   -   Increased pulp production of 130,000 tonnes per annum and lower pulp production
       costs per tonne
   -   Debottlenecking of existing packaging paper machines providing total incremental
       production of 55,000 tonnes per annum
   -   Additional capacity to produce 90,000 tonnes per annum of machine glazed kraft paper
       to supply fast growing end-uses in flexible packaging and food service applications
   -   Avoidance of maintenance capital expenditure over the next five years of around €105
       million.

The new recovery boiler and rebuilt fibre lines are expected to start up in late 2018 while the
new paper machine is expected to start up in the first half of 2019. Based on the current
timetable, capital expenditure on the project is expected to be incurred in the three years from
2017 to 2019.

Given the approved project pipeline, the Group’s annual capital expenditure is now expected
to be in the range of €600-650 million in 2017 and €800-850 million in 2018.

Commenting on the project, Mondi Group CEO David Hathorn said, “This investment
represents an exciting step in the continued development of our Packaging Paper business,
further leveraging our low-cost production footprint in central Europe to produce high quality
products that meet the growing needs of our customers.”

Mondi Group: Trading update 13 October 2016

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial
position since the half year ended 30 June 2016. These results have not been
audited or reviewed by our external auditors.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or
transactions impacting either the financial performance or financial position of the
Group since 30 June 2016 up to the date of this statement.

Group performance overview

Underlying operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 of EUR227 million was 3%
above the comparable prior year period (EUR221 million). As anticipated, generally
lower average selling prices and a significantly lower fair value gain on forestry
assets resulted in a 12% reduction in underlying operating profit from the second
quarter of 2016 (EUR259 million).

On a like-for-like basis, sales volumes of our key paper grades were in line with the
comparable prior year period.

Of our key input costs, wood and chemical costs remained stable during the period.
Energy costs were down on the comparable prior year period due to lower energy
prices and the benefits of various energy efficiency investments. While we continue
to benefit from the energy investments completed in 2015 at Swiecie, prices
achieved for green energy resulting from these investments were significantly lower
than both the comparable prior year period and the second quarter and remain under
pressure going into the fourth quarter. The average cost per tonne of paper for
recycling was up 8% on the comparable prior year period and up 10% on the second
quarter. Polyethylene prices were down on the comparable prior year period and
stable on the second quarter.

While generally weaker compared to the third quarter of 2015, the emerging market
currencies in which we operate were relatively stable to stronger versus the Euro
when compared to the second quarter of 2016.

We completed planned maintenance shuts at our Swiecie (Poland) and Ruzomberok
(Slovakia) mills during the quarter. The estimated impact on operating profit was
around EUR20 million (EUR35 million in Q3 2015) and we continue to estimate that
the full year impact of planned maintenance shuts will be around EUR70 million
(2015: EUR90 million). In the fourth quarter, maintenance shuts are planned at the
Richards Bay mill (South Africa) and at our kraft paper operations, with an estimated
impact on operating profit of around EUR30 million (Q4 2015: EUR20 million). In
2015, the Richards Bay shut took place in the first quarter.

Divisional overview

In Packaging Paper, average benchmark European virgin containerboard prices
were similar to the previous quarter but over 7% down on the comparable prior year
period. Supported by sustained good demand and a strong order position, a price
increase of EUR20/tonne was implemented in August across all European markets
excluding southern Europe, partly offsetting the price erosion seen over the course
of the first half of the year. Average benchmark recycled containerboard prices were
down by around 3% versus the previous quarter and around 7% down on the
comparable prior year period.

Average kraft paper prices were marginally down versus the previous quarter and
around 8% down on the comparable prior year period. During the quarter we
announced a EUR60/tonne increase in sack kraft paper for all European markets
and an 8-12% increase in export markets.

In the Industrial Bags segment of Fibre Packaging, while European markets remain
robust, the business continued to be negatively impacted by challenging market
conditions in the US and CIS. The fourth quarter will be impacted by the usual
seasonal slowdown in demand. Corrugated Packaging achieved good organic
volume growth, supplemented by the acquisition of SIMET S.A. earlier in the year.
On 10 October 2016, we announced the acquisition of a corrugated packaging
facility in Russia (LLC Beepack) for a consideration of RUB2,825 million
(EUR41 million) on a cash and debt free basis, supporting the ongoing development
of our Corrugated Packaging business in central and eastern Europe.

During the third quarter, we concluded the acquisitions of Kalenobel (Turkey) and
Uralplastic (Russia), supporting the growth of our Consumer Packaging business.
While the integration of these businesses is progressing, a small net charge to
operating profit in the second half of 2016 is expected from these acquisitions due to
the effects of acquisition accounting and transaction costs.

Benchmark European uncoated fine paper prices were down by around 1% versus
the previous quarter and marginally down on the comparable prior year period. In
Europe, prices were under pressure through the quarter from a combination of
seasonally weak demand and an increase in imports, but recent indications are that
pricing has stabilised as order books strengthen into the seasonally stronger winter
months. Pricing in the CIS markets remains stable. The marginal strengthening of
the rouble in the quarter gave rise to translation gains for our domestically focused
Russian uncoated fine paper operations.

In our South Africa Division, the notable strengthening of the rand in the quarter
and the continued weakness of the USD pulp price (down 16% on the comparable
prior year period and down 3% on the previous quarter) negatively impacted the
profitability of the export oriented pulp and containerboard operations. Forestry gains
of EUR8 million were significantly lower than those recognised in the first half of the
year (EUR48 million).

Capital investment programme

We continue to make good progress on our previously announced major capital
investment projects at our high-quality, low-cost operations in central Europe and
South Africa.

At our Richards Bay mill (South Africa) the projects to upgrade the woodyard and
provide capacity to produce unbleached kraftliner are nearing completion with
planned project tie-ins to be completed during the maintenance shut in October.

As a result of lower prices for green energy in Poland and the slower than
anticipated ramp-up of the paper and in-line coating machine at Steti (Czech
Republic), the incremental operating profit contribution in 2016 from our capital
investment programme is now estimated to be EUR50 million (previously
EUR60 million).

Cash flow

Strong cash generation from operating activities largely offset the cash outflows
related to our capital expenditure programme, acquisitions totalling EUR132 million
and payment of the interim dividend. Net debt increased during the quarter to
EUR1,560 million (30 June 2016: EUR1,491 million).

Outlook

We expect to benefit from stable to higher selling prices in a number of key product
segments as we move into 2017 following the downward pressure seen over the
course of 2016. Costs remain generally stable, albeit with near-term pressure in
certain areas. Our ongoing capital investment programme continues to deliver strong
returns. With our clear strategy, robust business model and culture of continuous
improvement, we remain confident of continuing to deliver an industry leading
performance.

South African branch register shareholders at a rate of 15%, unless a

Notes:

(1)The Group presents underlying EBITDA, operating profit and related per share information as measures which exclude special items in order to provide a more
   effective comparison of the underlying financial performance of the Group between financial reporting periods. A reconciliation of underlying operating 
   profit to profit before tax is provided in note 4 of the condensed financial statements.
(2)ROCE is the 12-month rolling average underlying operating profit expressed as a percentage of the average rolling 12-month capital employed, adjusted for
   impairments and spend on strategic projects which are not yet in operation.

David Hathorn, Mondi Group chief executive, said:
""Mondi delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2016 with underlying operating profit up 8% to EUR529 million and
a return on capital employed of 21.2%. We saw strong contributions from Consumer Packaging, Uncoated Fine Paper and
the South Africa Division, partially offset by the anticipated price weakness in certain of our packaging paper grades.

We continue to make good progress in driving growth through our capital investment programme. We are on track to
deliver an anticipated EUR60 million in incremental operating profit in 2016 from recently completed major capital projects,
and our projects in development remain on time and on budget. The Boards recently approved the first phase of a
modernisation programme at our Steti mill in the Czech Republic with follow-on investments still under evaluation.

In April 2016 we completed the acquisition of a corrugated packaging plant in Poland, and we have recently completed
two acquisitions that will further enhance our product offering and geographic reach in the growing consumer packaging
segment.

While we saw some price weakness in certain of our packaging grades in the first half, demand for these products
remains strong and pricing has generally stabilised with increases recently achieved in certain grades. The second half
will be impacted by planned maintenance shuts at a number of our mills and the usual seasonal downturn in our
Uncoated Fine Paper business. Furthermore, we anticipate a lower forestry fair value gain than was recognised in the
first half. We expect to continue to benefit from stable input costs and incremental contributions from our capital
investment programme, together with the stability afforded by our downstream converting businesses.

While mindful of the heightened macroeconomic and political uncertainties in Europe, we remain confident of continuing to deliver an

Our underlying operating profit for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 increased 8% to EUR529 million compared to the first half of
2015. We saw strong contributions from Consumer Packaging, Uncoated Fine Paper and the South Africa Division, driven by
volume growth, pricing benefits and forestry fair value gains, respectively. This was partially offset by Packaging Paper, which was
negatively impacted by lower average selling prices, and Fibre Packaging, which saw lower sales volumes and experienced
negative currency effects.

Revenue was down 4%, primarily due to currency effects and disposals completed in 2015. Excluding these effects revenue grew 1%.

Like-for-like sales volumes were similar to the comparable prior year period, with generally stable volumes in the paper businesses
and strong volume growth in Consumer Packaging offset by lower sales volumes in the Industrial Bags and Extrusion Coatings
segments of Fibre Packaging.

Pricing movements in the Group's key paper grades were mixed, with domestic currency selling prices significantly up in Uncoated
Fine Paper, more modestly up in the South Africa Division, and down in Packaging Paper on the comparable prior year period.

Input costs were generally lower in our Europe & International businesses. Wood, fuel and energy input costs were lower than the
comparable prior year period, enhanced by the benefits of the green energy investments at Swiecie, Poland, completed in the
second half of 2015. Average benchmark paper for recycling costs were up 13% on the comparable prior year period, at similar
levels to the second half of 2015. In the South Africa Division, higher domestic wood costs and inflationary increases contributed to
higher variable costs in local currency terms, partially offset by higher energy sales. A significantly higher fair value gain on forestry
assets reduced the net cost base in South Africa.

In the first half of 2016, we completed the annual maintenance shut at our Syktyvkar mill in Russia and some smaller shuts at a
number of our other mills. The balance of our maintenance shuts are scheduled for the second half of the year. Based on
prevailing market prices, the full year impact on underlying operating profit of the Group's maintenance shuts is estimated at
around EUR70 million (2015: EUR90 million) of which the first half effect was around EUR20 million (2015: EUR35 million).

Generally weaker emerging market currencies had a net negative impact on translation of the profits of our domestically focused
uncoated fine paper and Fibre Packaging operations in those countries, partly offset by the benefits of the export oriented
packaging paper and pulp operations in Russia, Poland and South Africa.

Underlying earnings increased 11% to 75.0 euro cents per share, reflecting the increase in underlying operating profit and the
benefit of lower net finance charges.

An interim dividend of 18.81 euro cents per share has been declared.

Underlying operating profit of EUR192 million was down 9% on the comparable prior year period.

On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the sale of the Raubling mill during 2015, sales volumes were marginally up across
all containerboard grades.

As anticipated, despite solid demand, increased supply from new capacity in Europe and competition from importers benefiting
from weak emerging market currencies resulted in downward pressure on kraftliner prices during the period. Average European
benchmark selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were down 2% on the comparable prior year period and down 5% on the second
half of 2015. European white-top kraftliner prices were similar to the comparable prior year period and down around 2% on the
second half of 2015. In response to sustained good demand and a strong order position, by the beginning of August, selling price
increases of EUR20/tonne had been implemented for both unbleached kraftliner and white-top kraftliner in all European markets excluding
southern Europe. In Russia, price increases for white-top kraftliner were implemented at the beginning of the year.

Average European benchmark selling prices for recycled containerboard were up 3% on the comparable prior year period, but
down around 3% on the second half of 2015.

Sales volumes for sack kraft paper were at similar levels to the comparable prior year period. As previously indicated, demand
softness in a number of export markets and seasonal weakness in European markets towards the end of the prior year lead to
average selling prices for sack kraft paper produced in Europe declining by 5-6% in the early part of 2016. Demand has since
improved in the important export markets of south east Asia and the Middle East, while Europe has seen the usual seasonal pick-
up in demand, supporting the stabilising of pricing.

We saw good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers, although sales volumes of certain grades were impacted by the
closure of high cost production capacity in 2015. Selling prices were, on average, marginally higher than in the comparable prior
year period.

Input costs were at a similar level to the comparable prior year period with the business benefiting from stable raw material input
costs and lower energy costs which offset higher paper for recycling costs and other inflationary increases. Green energy prices
were lower in Poland, reducing the contribution from the sale of green energy credits.

We completed planned maintenance shuts at our Syktyvkar, Russia and Swiecie, Poland mills during the first half. A further
planned maintenance shut is scheduled at Swiecie in the third quarter and the majority of our kraft paper mill shuts will take place
during the final quarter of the year.

Underlying operating profit of EUR59 million was down by 13%. Lower sales volumes in Industrial Bags and Extrusion Coatings and a
one-off gain recorded in the comparable prior year period were partially offset by the benefits of restructuring and rationalisation
activities. Weaker emerging market currencies had a significant negative impact on the translation of the results of our domestically
focused Fibre Packaging operations.

Sales volumes in our Corrugated Packaging segment were in line with the comparable prior year period. We achieved good growth
in central Europe, offset by lower volumes in Turkey which continued to be impacted by political turbulence in the region. In
Poland, sales volumes were up following the acquisition of SIMET S.A. in the early part of the year, although sales growth was
tempered by the ongoing Russian embargo preventing the export of fresh fruit and vegetables to that market.

In the Industrial Bags segment, while volumes in European markets were up around 3%, capacity rationalisation and challenging
market conditions in the US and weakness in the CIS region resulted in an overall decline in sales volumes. This was partly offset
by significant cost savings resulting from a strong focus on cost management and the benefits of restructuring and rationalisation
activities completed during 2015.

Lower sales volumes in Extrusion Coatings were largely offset by improved sales margins and ongoing cost management.

Consumer Packaging continues to show good progress, with a 31% increase in operating profit over the comparable prior year
period to EUR64 million driven by strong volume growth.

Sales volumes grew across most product segments on a like-for-like basis, with particularly strong growth in the high value-added
segment of consumer laminates and bags.

Fixed costs were higher, in line with the increased focus on innovation and customer service, incorporating an enhanced sales and
application engineering infrastructure. This was partially offset by one off gains during the period. We are making good progress with
initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of our operations and capital expenditure is directed at both growth
opportunities and the modernisation of equipment at a number of our sites.

We also benefited from the successful integration of Ascania, Germany and KSP, South Korea and Thailand, acquired in the
second half of 2015. During July 2016, we completed two further acquisitions supporting the growth of this business. In Turkey, 
we acquired 90% of the outstanding share capital in Kalenobel, a consumer packaging company focused on the manufacture of
flexible consumer packaging for ice cream and other applications, as well as aseptic cartons. The company is headquartered in
Istanbul and operates two manufacturing sites northwest of the city, serving both international FMCG companies as well as
regional food and beverage producers. In Russia, we acquired 100% of Uralplastic which manufactures a range of consumer
flexible packaging products for food, hygiene, homecare and other applications. The company serves both local and international
customers.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business continued to perform strongly, with underlying operating profit of EUR133 million, up 18% on the
comparable prior year period. Strong pricing, stable volumes and lower input costs, particularly energy costs, more than offset
negative currency effects and inflationary pressures on the fixed cost base.

The business maintained sales volumes at a similar level to the comparable prior year period. European prices were stable
following the increases seen in the second half of 2015, with the benefits of industry capacity rationalisation in the prior year offset
by subdued demand and pressure from imports. Average benchmark European selling prices were up 2.4% on the comparable
prior year period and in line with the second half of 2015.

In Russia, we achieved higher average selling prices following the increases implemented during 2015 and at the beginning of the
current year.

We completed maintenance shuts at Syktyvkar, Russia and Ružomberok, Slovakia in the first half of 2016. A further shut is
scheduled for the Ružomberok mill during the second half of the year. In line with previous years, the second half is also expected
to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown in demand during the third quarter.

Underlying operating profit of EUR98 million was up 42% on the first half of 2015, benefiting from higher domestic selling prices,
forestry gains and the timing of the Richards Bay shut.

Average domestic selling prices were above both the comparable prior year period and the second half of 2015 across all product
grades. Export selling prices for white-top kraftliner were in line with the comparable prior year period, while pulp export prices
were well below those achieved in the first half of the previous year. Average benchmark US dollar hardwood pulp prices were
down 5% on the comparable prior year period and down 9% on the second half of 2015.

Forestry gains are dependent on a variety of external factors, the most significant of which is the export price of timber. Significant
increases in selling prices resulted in a fair value gain of EUR48 million being recognised in the first half of the year, an increase of
EUR25 million over the comparable prior year period. This level of gain is not expected to recur in the second half of 2016.

In 2015, the annual maintenance shut of our Richards Bay mill in South Africa took place in the first quarter of the year, while in
2016 it is scheduled for the fourth quarter.

Tax
Based on the Group's geographic profit mix and the relevant tax rates applicable, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%.
However, we continued to benefit from tax incentives related to our capital investments in Poland, Slovakia and Russia, giving rise
to an underlying effective tax rate of 19%, consistent with the comparable prior year period.

Special items
Special items are those items of financial performance that we believe should be separately disclosed to assist in the
understanding of our underlying financial performance. Special items are considered to be material either in nature or in amount.

There were no special items in the six months ended 30 June 2016. In the six months ended 30 June 2015, the Group recognised
a net special item charge after tax of EUR36 million.

Cash flow
Cash generated from our operations of EUR620 million was up 15% on the comparable prior year period.

Working capital at 30 June 2016 was 13.3% of revenue, in line with our target of 12-14% and higher than the year-end level of
11.6%. This reflects the usual seasonal uptick in the first half of the year, giving rise to a net outflow of EUR61 million 
(2015: EUR101 million).

Significant net cash outflows from financing activities included the payment of the final 2015 dividend in May 2016, payment of the
5.75% coupon on the EUR500 million 2017 Eurobond and payments of dividends to holders of non-controlling interests.

Capital investments
During the first half of the year we invested EUR214 million in our property, plant and equipment.

We benefited from the contributions from a number of our recently completed capital projects and remain on track to deliver an
anticipated incremental operating profit contribution of EUR60 million in 2016. These include the EUR166 million recovery and biofuel
boiler project at Swiecie, Poland, which started up in the second half of 2015; the ongoing ramp-up of the rebuilt paper and inline
coating machine at Steti, Czech Republic and investments in our Packaging Paper and Fibre Packaging operations.

We made good progress with our ongoing projects, all of which are running on time and on budget. These include the EUR94 million
second phase of the investment at Swiecie to provide 100,000 tonnes of additional softwood pulp capacity and 80,000 tonnes of
lightweight kraftliner; the upgrade of the woodyard and project to provide capacity to produce unbleached kraftliner at Richards
Bay, South Africa; and a number of investments to modernise and expand our facilities in our Fibre and Consumer Packaging
businesses.

During the period, the Boards approved:

-  an investment of EUR310 million in a new 300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine at our Ružomberok mill in Slovakia and 
   related pulp mill upgrades. This project remains subject to obtaining approval of tax incentives from the European 
   Commission and necessary permitting; and
-  the first phase of the modernisation of the Steti mill in the Czech Republic, which includes a new woodyard and bleaching
   line for a total investment of EUR41 million.

Further investments in the Steti mill, including the possible replacement of the recovery boiler, remain under evaluation.

Given the current approved major project pipeline, annual capital expenditure is expected to remain in line with previous estimates
at between EUR400 million and EUR450 million per annum over the 2016/2017 period.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 30 June 2016 was EUR1,491 million (31 December 2015: EUR1,498 million). The net debt to 12 month trailing EBITDA ratio
was 1.1 times.

On 14 April 2016 we issued a 1.5% EUR500 million Eurobond with an 8 year term under our European Medium Term Note
Programme, thereby extending the Group's maturity profile and ensuring ample liquidity. At 30 June 2016, we had EUR2.5 billion of
committed facilities of which EUR757 million were undrawn and EUR293 million in cash. The weighted average maturity of our committed
debt facilities is approximately 4.4 years.

Finance charges of EUR47 million were below those of the comparable prior year period. Average net debt was around 14% down on
the comparable prior year period and the average effective interest rate for the period was 5.9% (six months ended 30 June
2015: 6.9%; six months ended 31 December 2015: 5.6%). Cash interest paid decreased to EUR46 million.

Dividend
The Boards' aim is to offer shareholders long-term dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times
over the business cycle.

An interim dividend of 18.81 euro cents per share has been declared by the directors and will be paid on 13 September 2016 to
those shareholders on the register of Mondi plc on 19 August 2016. An equivalent South African rand interim dividend will be paid
on 13 September 2016 to shareholders on the register of Mondi Limited on 19 August 2016. The dividend will be paid from
distributable reserves of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, as presented in the respective company annual financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2015.

Outlook
While we saw some price weakness in certain of our packaging grades in the first half, demand for these products remains strong
and pricing has generally stabilised with increases recently achieved in certain grades. The second half will be impacted by
planned maintenance shuts at a number of our mills and the usual seasonal downturn in our Uncoated Fine Paper business. Furthermore, 
we anticipate a lower forestry fair value gain than was recognised in the first half. We expect to continue to benefit from stable 
input costs and incremental contributions from our capital investment programme, together with the stability afforded by our downstream 
converting businesses.

While mindful of the heightened macroeconomic and political uncertainties in Europe, we remain confident of continuing to deliver an industry
leading performance in line with our expectations.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. The
Boards have put in place procedures for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks that the Group faces.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible, to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business; and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes.

Over the course of the year, the audit committee will review each of the principal risks set out below. In evaluating the Group's risk
management and internal control processes, the committee considers both internal and external audit reports and receives
confirmation from the finance heads of the business units that financial control frameworks have operated satisfactorily.

The Boards are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk
tolerance levels established by the Boards and that there have been no significant changes to these risks during the reporting
period.

Industry capacity
Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills. New capacity additions are usually in large increments
which, through their impact on the supply/demand balance, influence market prices. Unless market growth exceeds capacity
additions, excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices. In our converting operations, newer technology may lower operating
costs and provide increased product functionality, impacting margins.

We monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity as well as trends and developments in our own product
markets. Our strategic focus on low-cost production and innovation activities to produce higher value-added products, combined
with our focus on growing markets and consistent investment in our operating capacity, ensures that we remain competitive.

Product substitution
Changing global socio-economic and demographic trends and increased public awareness of sustainability challenges affect the
demand for Mondi's products.

Factors that impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials; increased use of recycled
materials; electronic substitution of paper products; increased demand for high-quality printed material; certified and responsibly
produced goods; and specific material qualities.

Our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new
products on a sustainable, competitive and cost-effective basis. Our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics
and growing regional markets. We work with our customers to develop new markets and new products. Our broad range of
converting products provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic-based packaging
products.

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices and gross margins
Our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and by demand for our products, which are, in turn, influenced by
macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers. Changes in prices
differ between products and geographic regions and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied significantly over time.

Our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation,
proximity or a production cost advantage. We continue to invest in our high-quality, low-cost production assets to ensure we
maintain our competitive cost position. Our high levels of vertical integration reduce our exposure to price volatility of our key input
costs. Our financial policies and structures are designed taking the inherent price volatility of the markets in which we operate 
into consideration.

Economic risks in the markets in which we operate
We are an international packaging and paper group with more than 100 production operations across more than 30 countries.
Consequently, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations are affected by changes in global economic conditions.

A number of our operations are in jurisdictions where the political, economic and legal systems are less predictable than in
countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic upheaval, inflation, changes in laws, nationalisation or
expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations in those countries. Areas of weaker governance also present
the challenge of addressing potential human rights issues in our operations and supply chain. From a human capital perspective,
we face different demographic and social conditions in the countries we operate in, affecting the availability of skills and talent 
for the Group.

We actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate. We engage in regular formal and informal interaction with
the authorities to ensure we remain abreast of any new developments. Despite recent improvements in certain segments of the
global economy, uncertainties remain concerning the future economic environment, including concerns over slowing growth
(particularly in China), political and economic structural weakness in the Eurozone's single currency framework, the impact of
political challenges in Turkey and uncertainty over the UK's continued membership of the European Union.

Our geographic diversity and decentralised management structure, utilising local resources in countries in which we operate,
reduces our exposure to any specific jurisdiction.

Cost and availability of responsibly produced wood, pulp and paper for recycling
We have access to our own sources of wood in Russia and South Africa and we purchase wood, pulp and paper for recycling to 
meet our needs in the balance of our operations. Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced quantities 
of available wood supply that meet FSC or PEFC Chain-of-Custody standards and our minimum wood standard that complies with 
the standard for Controlled Wood (FSC-STD-40-005), as well as initiatives to promote the use of woody biomass from residues 
of pulp and paper processes as a renewable energy source.

We are committed to acquiring fibre from sustainable, responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial or illegal
supply. The sustainable management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall environmental impact, helping to
protect ecosystems and develop resilient landscapes. We have built strong forestry management resources in Russia and South
Africa to actively monitor and manage our wood resources in those countries.

We have multiple suppliers for each of our mills and actively pursue longer term agreements with strategic suppliers of wood, pulp
and paper for recycling. We are involved in multi-stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for
sustainable, responsible fibre.

Energy security and related input costs
Mondi is a significant consumer of electricity, which we generate internally and purchase from external suppliers. Where we don't
generate electricity from biomass and by-products of our production processes, we are dependent on external suppliers for raw
materials such as gas, oil and coal.

As an energy-intensive business, we face potential physical and regulatory risks related to climate change.

We monitor our electricity usage, carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy. Most of our larger operations have high
levels of electricity self-sufficiency. We focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations and have invested in our
operations to improve our energy profile and increase electricity self-sufficiency, while reducing ongoing operating costs and
carbon emission levels.

To the extent that we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, we may sell such surplus externally. We also generate
revenue from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations, the prices of which are determined in the open market.

Technical integrity of our operating assets
We have five major mills which together account for approximately 70% of our total pulp and paper production capacity and a
significant consumer packaging manufacturing facility in Germany. If operations at any of these key facilities were interrupted for
any significant length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance. Accidents or
incidents such as fires, explosions or large machinery breakdowns, could result in property damage, loss of production,
reputational damage and/or safety incidents.

Our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity and our
proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to minimise breakdown risks.

We conduct detailed risk assessments of our high-priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the
ongoing management and maintenance of such equipment.

We actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to share lessons learnt across our operations, identify
emerging issues, conduct benchmarking and evaluate the effectiveness of our risk reduction activities.

Environmental impact
We operate in a high-impact sector and need to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Our operations are water,
carbon and energy intensive; consume materials such as fibre, polymers, metals and chemicals; and generate emissions to air,
water and land. We are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land. We are subject to a wide range of
international, national and local environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of our customers and expectations
of our broader stakeholders.

We ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements where we operate. Our own
policies and procedures, at or above local policy requirements, are embedded in all our operations.

We focus on a clean production philosophy to address the impact from emissions, discharge and waste. We focus on increasing
the energy efficiency of our operations and using biomass-based fuels, reducing our use of fossil-based energy sources. We
emphasise the responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems, protecting high conservation value areas.

Employee and contractor safety
We operate large facilities, often in remote locations. Accidents or incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors, property
damage, lost production time and/or harm to our reputation.

We have a zero harm policy. We continually monitor incidents and close calls and actively transfer learnings across our operations.
We apply an externally accredited safety management system and conduct regular audits of our operations to support safe and
productive workplaces.

We focus on engineering out the most significant risks in our operations, supported by robust controls and procedures for operating 
those assets.

Reputational risk
Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct practices in
any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. These include laws relating
to the environment, exports, price controls, taxation, human rights and labour.

We operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported by self-certification and reporting. Our legal and
governance compliance is managed at business unit level, supported by a central team of relevant professionals, and is subject to
regular internal audit review.

We also operate a confidential reporting hotline, Speakout, enabling employees, customers, suppliers, managers and other
stakeholders to raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our values.

We increasingly work with our suppliers to promote responsible business conduct in the value chain.

Information technology risk
Many of our operations are dependent on the availability of IT services and an extended interruption of such services may result in
plant shutdown. Cyber crime continues to increase and attempts are more and more sophisticated, with the consequences of
successful attacks including compromised data, financial fraud and system shutdowns.

We have a comprehensive IT Security Policy approved by our Boards. We conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external
providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures. Where possible, we have redundancies in place, our system
landscape is based on well-proven products and we have cyber crime insurance.

Financial risks
Our trading and financing activities expose the Group to financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact our financial
position. These risks relate to the currencies in which we conduct our activities, interest rate and liquidity risks and exposure to
customer credit risk.

Our approach to financial risk management is described in notes 18 and 30 of the Group's annual financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2015.

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget and latest outlook for 2016, considered the assumptions contained therein and
reviewed the critical risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current
macroeconomic environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial statements. At
30 June 2016, Mondi had EUR757 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have maturity dates of
between 1 and 9 years, with a weighted average maturity of 4.4 years.

Based on their evaluation, the Boards are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity to meet its
obligations and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed financial statements.

Directors' responsibility statement

The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:

-    the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with
     International Financial Reporting Standards and in particular with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting';
-    the half-yearly results announcement includes a fair review of the significant events during the six months ended 30 June
     2016 and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year ending
     31 December 2016;
-    there have been no significant individual related party transactions during the first six months of the financial year; and
-    there have been no significant changes in the Group's related party relationships from that reported in the Integrated
     report and financial statements 2015.

The Group's condensed combined and consolidated financial statements, and related notes, were approved by the Boards and
authorised for issue on 3 August 2016 and were signed on their behalf by:

Independent auditor's review report on interim financial information to the shareholders of Mondi Limited

We have reviewed the condensed combined and consolidated financial statements of Mondi Limited contained in the
accompanying interim report, which comprise the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial position as at
30 June 2016 and the condensed combined and consolidated income statement, the condensed combined and consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, condensed combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity and condensed
combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' responsibility for the interim financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with
International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' (IAS 34), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides, as issued by
the Accounting Practices Committee, and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and
the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with
International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity' (ISRE 2410). ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us
to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial
reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying
analytical procedures to evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial
statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed combined and
consolidated financial statements of Mondi Limited for the six months ended 30 June 2016 are not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with IAS 34, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and
Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of
South Africa 2008.

Independent review report to Mondi plc

We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly report for the six
months ended 30 June 2016, which comprises the condensed combined and consolidated income statement, the condensed
combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the condensed combined and consolidated statement of financial
position, the condensed combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity, the condensed combined and consolidated
statement of cash flows and the related notes 1 to 21. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly report and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set
of financial statements.

This report is made solely to the company in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland)
2410,'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' (ISRE 2410), issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to
state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.

Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing
the half-yearly report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.

As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-
yearly report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' (IAS 34),
as adopted by the European Union.

Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly report
based on our review.

Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with ISRE 2410, issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in
the half-yearly report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as
adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.

Mondi Group: Trading Statement

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited,
companies are required to publish a trading statement as soon as they become
reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be reported on next will
differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

Mondi is currently finalising its results for the half year ended 30 June 2016, which will
be released on 4 August 2016. It can now be confirmed that underlying operating profit
for the half year ended 30 June 2016 is expected to be above that of the comparable
prior year period of EUR490 million.

There have been no special items in the six months ended 30 June 2016. In the six
months ended 30 June 2015, the Group recognised a net special item charge after tax
of EUR36 million.

Accordingly, Mondi advises that it expects earnings per share (EPS) for the half year
ended 30 June 2016 to be within the ranges shown below:

-   basic underlying EPS (euro cents) 73 to 77 (2015: 67.8), an increase of between
    8% and 14%
-   basic EPS (euro cents) 73 to 77 (2015: 60.3), an increase of between 21% and
    28%
-   basic headline EPS (euro cents) 73 to 77 (2015: 60.1), an increase of between
    21% and 28%
Mondi has disclosed basic underlying EPS, which is defined as basic EPS excluding
the impact of special items, as the directors believe this provides a useful additional
measure of the Group’s underlying performance. Mondi has disclosed basic EPS
which includes the effect of special items. The disclosure of basic headline EPS is
required under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and has been calculated
in accordance with Circular 2/2015 as issued by the South African Institute of
Chartered Accountants.

The above information has neither been reviewed nor audited by Mondi’s auditors.

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc (together “Mondi
Group” or “Mondi”) notify both the JSE Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters
required to be disclosed under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and/or the
Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules and/or the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom
Listing Authority.

Regulatory Report on Payments to Governments in respect of Logging Industries for
the Year 2015

The report of payments to governments made by Mondi plc and its subsidiary undertakings
for the year ended 31 December 2015 has been published in accordance with the UK’s
Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015).
This regulation implements the two EU Directives in the UK, mandating annual reports by
companies in the extractives and logging industries of their payments to governments in
countries in which they operate.

To read details of Mondi’s payments to governments go to www.mondigroup.com.

Basis of preparation

The application of the Regulation for Mondi relates to our logging activities and specifically to
the disclosure of payments to governments relating to the logging of primary forests.

We have used the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations definition of
‘primary forest’ being:

‘Naturally regenerated forest of native species, where there are no clearly visible indications
of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed’.

Also, for the purposes of this report, the original ‘IFL 2000’ (Greenpeace, World Resources
Institute (WRI) and Transparent World) inventory of intact forests has been used as the base
for reporting on the harvesting of primary forests in the Komi Republic, Russia (‘Komi’).

Only a portion of our Syktyvkar logging operations in Komi fall within the above definition of
primary forests. Our operations in South Africa comprise plantation forests that are not
associated with any primary forests and therefore are excluded from the report.

Our logging operations in Komi do not result in deforestation. In terms of the Russian
Forestry Code and Mondi’s sustainable development policies all logged areas are naturally
regenerated with supplementary plantings of spruce and pine where required to make up full
populations of young trees for the next sustainable forest cycle. During logging operations
       protected areas, High Conservation Areas (HCV) areas and sensitive biotopes, comprising
       approximately 25% of the area, are naturally set aside for conservation.

       Exchange rate

       Payments made in currencies other than the euro (Mondi Group’s reporting currency) are
       translated for this report using the average exchange rate during the financial year to which it
       relates.

       Further information

       For further information regarding the Mondi Group’s approach to sustainably managing our
       forests, please refer to our Sustainable development report 2015 which can be found at
       www.mondigroup.com/sd15 and our sustainable forestry policy, one of our issue specific SD

Annual General Meetings – Mondi Limited and Mondi plc

As part of the dual listed company structure, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc notify both the JSE
Limited and the London Stock Exchange of matters required to be disclosed under the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited and/or the Disclosure and Transparency and Listing Rules of the
United Kingdom Listing Authority.

The Annual General Meetings of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc were both held on 12 May 2016. As
required by the dual listed company structure, all resolutions were treated as Joint Electorate
Actions and were decided on a poll. All resolutions at both meetings were passed. The voting
results of the Joint Electorate Actions are identical and are given below. Overall in excess of
76% of the total Group shares were voted.

The directors have noted that the votes against resolutions 20, 21, 22, 31 and 32 were higher
than for other resolutions. These resolutions relate to the authority to be given to directors
to allot and issue shares. The voting is in line with the pattern Mondi has seen at previous
Annual General Meetings. Having engaged with shareholders in this regard over recent years the
directors are aware that South African shareholders in particular (who represent over 33% of the
total voting shares) have particular concerns about these types of resolution. We understand
from our engagement with shareholders that this is not specific to Mondi and they routinely vote
against such resolutions as a matter of policy.

Mondi Group: Trading update 12 May 2016

This trading update provides an overview of our financial performance and financial
position since the year ended 31 December 2015, based on management
information up to 31 March 2016 and estimated results for April 2016. These results
have not been audited or reviewed by Mondi’s external auditors.

Reviewed results for the half-year ending 30 June 2016 will be published on or
around 4 August 2016.

Except as discussed in this update, there have been no significant events or
transactions impacting either the financial performance or financial position of the
Group since 31 December 2015 up to the date of this statement.

Group performance overview

Underlying operating profit for the first quarter of 2016 of EUR269 million was 14%
above the comparable prior year period (EUR236 million). Strong contributions from
Consumer Packaging, Uncoated Fine Paper and the South Africa Division more than
offset the impact of lower selling prices in certain Packaging Paper segments and
margin pressure in Fibre Packaging. Underlying operating profit was up 9% on the
fourth quarter of 2015 (EUR246 million).

On a like-for-like basis, sales volumes were in line with the comparable prior year
period, with lower volumes in the industrial bags segment offset by good growth in
Consumer Packaging.
Selling prices for the Group’s main paper grades were, on average, up on the
comparable prior year period, with strong gains in Uncoated Fine Paper, and more
modest gains in the South Africa Division and containerboard, partly offset by lower
kraft paper prices.

Wood and chemical input costs were at similar levels to the comparable prior year
period while paper for recycling costs were up 15%, but broadly unchanged from the
fourth quarter of 2015. Energy costs were lower, driven by generally lower raw
material input costs and the benefits from the green energy investments at Swiecie,
Poland, completed in the second half of 2015.

Currency movements had a net negative impact versus the comparable prior year
period, with the benefits of weaker emerging market currencies in our export oriented
businesses more than offset by the impact of the weaker rouble on our domestically
focused uncoated fine paper operations in Russia.

There were no significant planned maintenance shuts during the first quarter. In the
comparable prior year period the impact of maintenance shuts on operating profit
was estimated at around EUR17 million. Based on prevailing market prices, we
continue to estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on operating
profit for 2016 will be around EUR70 million, of which around EUR25 million will be
incurred in the first half of the year (EUR35 million in the first half of 2015).

Divisional overview

In Packaging Paper, selling prices for the containerboard grades were marginally up
on average over the comparable prior year period but down on the prior quarter.
While demand remains solid, increased supply from new capacity in Europe and
competition from importers benefiting from weak emerging market currencies
resulted in lower selling prices for unbleached kraftliner. Average benchmark
European kraftliner prices were down 3.4% on the previous quarter, and at similar
levels to the comparable prior year period. Benchmark selling prices for white-top
kraftliner were marginally down on the previous quarter, while recycled
containerboard prices were down 1.8% on the previous quarter, but 5.2% above the
comparable prior year period. Given sustained good demand and a strong order
position, we have announced a price increase of EUR40/tonne for all kraftliner and
kraft-top liner grades from 6 June 2016.

Sales volumes for sack kraft paper remained at similar levels to the comparable prior
year period. As previously indicated, demand softness in a number of export markets
and seasonal weakness in European markets towards the end of the prior year lead
to average selling prices for sack kraft paper produced in Europe declining by 5-6%
in the early part of 2016. Demand has since improved in the important export
markets of south east Asia and the Middle East and pricing remains stable.
In Fibre Packaging, continued strong cost management, the benefits of
restructuring and rationalisation activities and contributions from capital investments
provided some offset to negative currency effects and lower sales volumes in
Industrial Bags, which has been impacted by capacity rationalisation and challenging
market conditions in the US.

On 26 April 2016, the acquisition of SIMET S.A., a corrugated plant in Poland, was
completed. The plant will be upgraded to a high-efficiency box plant, improving our
customer offering and supporting the strong growth in the region.

The Consumer Packaging business continued to make good progress. Good
volume growth, coupled with incremental improvements in fixed costs and the
benefits from acquisitions completed at the end of 2015 contributed to the improved
performance.

Uncoated Fine Paper performed strongly with higher average selling prices and
stable volumes versus the comparable prior year period offsetting the negative
impact of the weaker rouble. European prices have stabilised following the increases
seen in the second half of 2015, with the benefits of industry capacity rationalisation
in the prior year offset by subdued demand in the first quarter. Average benchmark
selling prices in Europe were up 2.8% on the comparable prior year period and in
line with prices in the fourth quarter of 2015.

The South Africa Division benefited from higher average selling prices for
uncoated fine paper, pulp and white-top kraftliner, currency gains and higher fair
value gains on forestry than the comparable prior year period. Pulp prices have
shown some softness from the highs seen in the prior year, with the average US
dollar benchmark price down 5% on the previous quarter. In 2015, the Richards Bay
maintenance shut took place in the first quarter of the year, while in 2016 the shut is
planned for the final quarter.

Capital investment projects

Good progress is being made on our previously announced major capital investment
projects at our high-quality, low-cost operations in central Europe and South Africa.
These projects remain on schedule and on budget.

Capital expenditure for the year is expected to remain in line with previous guidance
of between EUR400 million and EUR450 million.

Cash flow and financing activities

On 14 April 2016 we issued a 1.5% EUR500 million Eurobond with an 8 year term
under our European Medium Term Note Programme, thereby extending the Group’s
maturity profile and ensuring ample liquidity.
Strong cash generation from operating activities more than offset the cash outflows
related to our capital expenditure programme and financing activities, resulting in a
reduction in net debt during the quarter.

Finance charges were lower than those of the previous quarter and the comparable
prior year period, mainly due to lower average net debt levels and mix effects.

There have been no other significant changes in the Group’s borrowing facilities
since 31 December 2015.

Outlook

As anticipated, we have seen some price weakness in certain of our packaging
paper grades. However, demand for these products remains strong and we believe
the fundamentals remain robust. Furthermore, we continue to benefit from higher
uncoated fine paper prices, lower energy and related input costs and the incremental
contributions from our recently completed capital investment projects, together with
the stability afforded by our downstream converting businesses.

Our outlook remains positive and we are confident of delivering in line with our
expectations.

19 May 2016 as follows:

Mondi Limited

Mondi Limited will pay its dividend in South African rand cents. The applicable
exchange rate is EUR 1 to ZAR 17.29284.

euro). The last date for euro currency elections was 22 April 2016. It was stated
in the announcement on 25 February that the exchange rate for this payment
would be set today. Accordingly, it is confirmed that sterling dividend payments
will be converted at a rate of EUR 1 to GBP 0.78810. Therefore, the equivalent

Mondi plc South African branch register shareholders will receive the dividend in
South African rand cents, converted at a rate of EUR 1 to ZAR 17.29284.

David Hathorn, Mondi Group chief executive, said:
""2015 was an extremely successful year for Mondi. We made significant progress across a number of key areas and
again delivered excellent results. Our focus continues to be on growing the packaging side of our business while at the
same time investing appropriately in our uncoated fine paper operations.

It is very pleasing to see the strong contribution from all our business units, driven by generally higher selling prices,
volume growth, good cost control and important contributions from recently completed capital projects.

We continue to make good progress in driving growth through our capital investment programme, delivering incremental
operating profit of around EUR50 million from major capital projects in 2015, with a further EUR60 million anticipated in 2016.
The Boards recently approved a EUR310 million investment in a new 300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine at our
Ružomberok mill in Slovakia, adding to our strong pipeline of major projects approved and in development, now totalling
around EUR450 million. Acquisitions of EUR94 million during the year further enhance our product offering in the high-growth
consumer packaging segment.

Our outlook for the business remains positive. While we are currently seeing some softness in certain of our packaging
paper grades, we are also seeing firmer prices in the European uncoated fine paper markets following recent industry
capacity rationalisation. In addition, lower energy and related input costs, the generally positive impact of weaker
emerging market currencies and the incremental contribution from recently completed major capital projects are
expected to benefit the Group's performance in the near term.

Underpinned by the Group's robust business model, centred around our high-quality, low-cost asset base, clear strategic
focus and culture of continuous improvement, we remain confident of continuing to deliver an industry-leading
performance.""

Overview
2015 was an extremely successful year for the Group. We achieved excellent results on all key metrics and the strong contribution
from all our business units is testament to our consistent strategy, robust business model and high-quality, low-cost asset base.

Group revenue of EUR6,819 million was 7% above the prior year. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and disposals, revenue was up
3.9%, driven by generally higher domestic selling prices in the upstream paper businesses and good volume gains in
Containerboard, Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging. Currency movements also had a net positive effect on revenue.

Our underlying operating profit of EUR957 million was up 25% on the prior year. Packaging Paper delivered another very strong
performance, supported by higher selling prices and volume growth in Containerboard, the benefits of completed capital
investments and positive currency effects. Fibre Packaging benefited from higher gross margins, currency benefits and the
contribution from recently completed investments. We have made steady progress in repositioning Consumer Packaging, with
good volume growth in higher value-added segments leading to margin expansion. Our Uncoated Fine Paper business benefited
from domestic selling price increases and contributions from capital investments, which more than offset the negative currency
effects from the weaker rouble. Our South Africa Division delivered strong results through higher selling prices, good cost control
and currency benefits.

In 2015 we continued to seek out and exploit opportunities for value-enhancing growth and cost optimisation through a
combination of capital investments, acquisitions and asset rationalisation. We completed the acquisitions of Ascania nonwoven
Germany GmbH and KSP, Co. (South Korea and Thailand) during the second half of the year, broadening our product portfolio and
expanding our geographic reach in the fast growing Consumer Packaging business. In our continued efforts to improve
performance, we took the decision to close our speciality kraft mill at Lohja (Finland), two Consumer Packaging plants in Italy and
Spain, and three Industrial Bags plants in the US and Germany. We also sold three Consumer Packaging plants, two in Malaysia
and one in Germany and a recycled containerboard mill at Raubling (Germany). These actions allow us to focus on those
operations where we enjoy sustainable market and/or cost advantages.

Our capital investments completed during 2014 and 2015 contributed strongly to underlying operating profit. The incremental
operating profit from these projects amounted to around EUR50 million in 2015. We expect a further incremental contribution from
major projects of around EUR60 million in 2016.

Input costs were generally lower across most of our operations. Central European wood costs were lower than the prior year given
reduced industry consumption and stable supply. In Russia, higher domestic wood costs were more than offset by the weaker
rouble. Benchmark paper for recycling costs were around 7% higher on average than the prior year, with prices increasing in the
second half of the year. Energy costs were significantly lower than the prior year due to lower average crude oil, gas and coal
prices, together with the benefits of our energy related investments completed in 2014. Polyethylene prices were highly volatile in
2015, but were, on average, at similar levels to the prior year. Currently favourable cost conditions, combined with our ongoing
productivity improvements and strong cost control should provide further benefits in 2016.

Volatility in foreign exchange rates had a significant impact on the performance of the different divisions, although the net impact
on the Group was minimal. The 34% weakening of the rouble against the euro had a net negative impact on translation of the
profits of our domestically focused Russian uncoated fine paper business, although this was more than offset by domestic selling
price increases and the transactional benefits from our export orientated Russian packaging paper operations. The stronger US
dollar had a net positive impact on US dollar denominated sales, particularly in our Fibre and Consumer Packaging businesses
and our South Africa Division. Going into the new year, our export oriented businesses in emerging Europe and South Africa are
benefiting from margin expansion as a result of the recent weakness in emerging market currencies.

The impact of maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit in 2015, which included a number of longer project related shuts,
was in line with expectations at around EUR90 million. In 2016, based on prevailing market prices, we estimate that the impact of
planned maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit will reduce to around EUR70 million.

Our cash generation remained strong with cash generated from operations of EUR1,279 million up 24% on the prior year. Net debt
reduced by EUR115 million to EUR1,498 million, or 1.1 times EBITDA.

Underlying earnings of 133.7 euro cents per share were up 25% compared to 2014.

Our Boards have recommended payment of a final dividend of 37.62 euro cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year
to 52.0 euro cents per share, an increase of 24% on 2014.

Our Packaging Paper business delivered another very strong performance with underlying operating profit increasing by 14% to
EUR391 million and ROCE increasing to 25.5%. The improvements were delivered through volume growth, higher selling prices,
generally lower input costs, the benefits of completed capital investments and positive currency effects.

European demand for containerboard is estimated to have grown 4.1% in 2015, with virgin grades growing by 4.7% and recycled
grades by 3.9%. Demand in Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was stable. Our total
containerboard sales volumes grew by 1.2%, driven by operational debottlenecking, with all operations running at capacity.

Average European benchmark selling prices for unbleached kraftliner were up 4.4% on 2014 levels, with a series of price
increases implemented during the year before some moderate price erosion towards the end of the year. White-top kraftliner prices
were relatively stable during the year, with the average benchmark price marginally up compared to 2014.

Average benchmark recycled containerboard prices were up 0.9% on the prior year. Price increases were implemented in the
second half of the year and closing prices were 3.4% higher than the average price for the year.

Recent capacity increases in the European virgin containerboard market, coupled with an increase in imports from certain
emerging markets benefiting from weaker currencies versus the euro, have resulted in downward pressure on selling prices. In the
early part of 2016, selling prices for the Group's unbleached kraftliner grades sold into Europe declined by an average of around
EUR20-EUR25/tonne, while white-top kraftliner prices were EUR10-EUR15/tonne lower. A 10% increase in the domestic Russian market was
implemented for white-top containerboard in February.

Sales volumes of sack kraft paper were up 10.4%, benefiting from the ramp-up of the 155,000 tonne per annum bleached kraft
paper machine in Štetí (Czech Republic), commissioned in 2014 and forward integrating pulp that was previously sold in the open
market; and the full year contribution from the Pine Bluff, Arkansas (US) mill acquired in mid 2014.

Selling prices for sack kraft paper in Europe declined at the beginning of 2015, giving up much of the gains achieved in the second
half of 2014. Thereafter prices remained stable for most of the year, and average prices were broadly in line with those of the prior
year. In export markets, a combination of a slowdown in construction activity in certain south east Asian markets and political
instability in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa had a negative effect on demand in the second half of the year.
Seasonal weakness towards the end of the year also impacted European markets. As a result, in early 2016, average selling
prices for sack kraft paper produced in Europe have reduced by approximately 5-6%.

We saw good demand for our speciality grades of kraft paper, with higher selling prices on average than the prior year, although
sales volumes were negatively impacted by the closure of the Lohja mill in Finland. Selling prices remain stable in the early part of
2016.

The full year contributions of our projects completed in 2014, including the Syktyvkar (Russia) pulp dryer and rebuilt bleached kraft
paper machine in Štetí, contributed significantly to our performance. The completion of our new recovery boiler in Swiecie
(Poland), conversion of the existing boiler to a biofuel boiler and closure of the coal fired boilers contributed to lower energy costs
in the second half of the year.

Input costs were generally lower than in 2014 as a result of various cost savings initiatives and lower market prices. Wood,
chemicals and biofuel costs were all lower and in Syktyvkar, the weaker rouble more than offset domestic inflationary cost
increases. Paper for recycling costs were, on average, 7% higher than in 2014, with significant increases experienced during the
third quarter of the year before decreasing again towards the end of the year. Income from green energy was lower than the prior
year due to lower market prices and volumes sold.

Planned annual maintenance shuts of our Swiecie, Dynäs (Sweden) and Stambolijski (Bulgaria) mills were completed in the first
half of the year with the balance of shuts taking place in the second half of the year. In 2016, the maintenance shuts of our Swiecie
and Syktyvkar mills are scheduled to take place in the middle of the year and our kraft paper mill shuts are scheduled for the fourth
quarter.

Underlying operating profit of EUR120 million reflected an 18% increase on the prior year, with ROCE increasing to 13.9%.
Continuous improvements in underlying operating performance, acquisitions and currency gains contributed to our performance.

On a like-for-like basis, sales volumes in Corrugated Packaging were 3.3% higher than the prior year, with good volume growth in
Poland and the Czech Republic and stable volumes in central Europe and Turkey. Margins were supported through innovative
customer solutions, high-quality service and the benefits of restructuring activities completed in 2014. We invested in a number of
new converting machines to improve our customer offering, especially in the higher-value product segments, and these
investments have contributed to our improved performance. We have planned further similar investments to take advantage of
these growing markets. Profitability of the Turkish business was negatively impacted by ongoing political turbulence in the region
affecting demand growth, domestic cost inflation and the weaker Turkish lira. In February 2016, we announced our intentions to
acquire SIMET S.A., a corrugated plant in Poznan (Poland), and upgrade the plant to a high-efficiency box plant, improving our
customer offering and supporting the strong growth in this region.

In Industrial Bags, sales volumes were up 11% on the prior year, benefiting from the full year contribution of our US bags business,
acquired in 2014, and good volume growth in the Middle East and Africa which, combined with a number of innovative new
products, more than offset softer European markets. Selling prices were higher than the previous year and we saw currency gains
from sales in our US dollar based markets. We completed various commercial excellence projects, generating cost savings and
productivity improvements. A one-off gain from the sale of land and buildings in Italy also contributed to the improved results.

Our focus on improving the product portfolio in Extrusion Coatings resulted in positive gains from product mix effects, further
supported by good cost management.

A 13% increase in underlying operating profit to EUR108 million and the improvement in ROCE to 10.7% reflect the steady progress
we have made in repositioning our Consumer Packaging business to take advantage of value-added growth opportunities.

Volume growth was supported by the ramp-up of the Chinese plant, opened in early 2014, and the Polish start-up acquired in July
2014. In line with our strategy, good progress was made in our ongoing initiatives to improve the product mix. Strong volume
growth was achieved in our higher value-added segments of hygiene components, consumer laminates and bags, while we have
further reduced our exposure to a number of lower value-added products. Margins were further boosted by the benefits from
various commercial excellence activities.

During 2015, we took a number of steps to accelerate the repositioning of the business. The closures of the operations in Spain
and Italy and the sale of plants in Malaysia and Germany reduced our exposure to lower value-added and/or higher-cost
production. The acquisitions of Ascania nonwoven Germany GmbH and KSP, Co., completed during the second half of the year,
increase the Group's exposure to high-growth, high value-added segments. Ascania is a key supplier to our business, producing
nonwoven fabrics and composites used as components in personal care products. KSP, Co. has operations in South Korea and
Thailand, specialising in the production of high-quality spouted and retort stand-up pouches for the food, pet food and beverage
industries, offering an excellent fit with our existing stand-up pouch operations in Austria and the US.

Capital investment has been focused on achieving incremental improvements in our existing operations. Commercial excellence
activities have contributed to improved operating profit margins in the short term, while at the same time ensuring that the business
is correctly positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunities. These activities have focused on improved sales
infrastructure, material usage and efficiency, leveraging the purchasing power of the Group, improving productivity and enhancing
the innovation process.

Our Uncoated Fine Paper business generated underlying operating profit of EUR212 million, up 43% on the prior year, with a ROCE of
25.6%. Higher selling prices in the CIS, including Russia, lower input costs across the business and contributions from capital
investments more than offset the negative currency effects, primarily from the weaker rouble.

Our uncoated fine paper sales volumes increased by 1.7% over the prior year, reflecting market share gains in an overall declining
market. European demand was stable, while in the CIS, including Russia, demand contracted by an estimated 4%. The business
also benefited from increased sales of market pulp following the investments completed in 2014 at the Ružomberok mill to improve
energy efficiencies and increase pulp production.

Benchmark average selling prices in Europe were down 0.7% on average over the prior year, but 1.9% up comparing the second
half of the year to the first half. Selling price increases were implemented in April and September in a tight market, supported by
significant capacity rationalisation through conversions and closures and stable demand. We have successfully implemented a
further price increase of up to 4% in European markets from January 2016.

Selling prices were increased in Russia at the beginning of the year and again in the fourth quarter offsetting the effects of
domestic cost inflation. Price increases were implemented during February 2016 with further increases announced for
implementation in April 2016.

Overall the business benefited from generally lower input costs, with wood, chemical and energy costs all declining. In Russia,
higher prices in local currency were more than offset by the rouble devaluation. Our commercial excellence programmes, focused
on purchased material, operating efficiencies and productivity improvements, also contributed to good cost control. The benefits of
our new recovery boiler at the Ružomberok mill, completed in October 2014, were fully realised during the year. Hardwood pulp
prices were however significantly higher in euro terms, up around 26%, negatively impacting the profitability of the semi-integrated
Neusiedler (Austria) operations.

We completed our planned maintenance shuts during the third quarter of 2015. In 2016, the maintenance shuts of our
Ružomberok and Syktyvkar mills are planned for the first half of the year.

In February 2016 we agreed to sell our Neusiedler operations to one of our subsidiaries, Mondi SCP a.s. (which owns and
operates our Ružomberok mill), reducing our effective ownership in Neusiedler to 51%. The transaction enables Neusiedler 
and Ružomberok to better align and optimise their product portfolio and production capacity.

Our South Africa Division's underlying operating profit increased 44% to EUR161 million and ROCE improved to 30.1%. Higher selling
prices, good cost control, forestry revaluation gains and currency benefits more than offset domestic cost inflation.

Sales volumes were marginally lower than the previous year as a result of an extended planned maintenance shut at our Richards
Bay mill. Strong domestic demand for uncoated fine paper was met by reducing export volumes into the rest of Africa, while export
volumes of pulp were increased due to favourable export pricing and weaker domestic demand.

Selling prices for pulp and white-top containerboard were higher on average than in the previous year for both our domestic market
and exports. For uncoated fine paper, domestic prices were higher on average while US dollar export prices were lower. Significant
currency gains were realised from the effect of the stronger US dollar and euro on export sales volumes. Selling price increases
were implemented in early 2016 in certain domestic uncoated fine paper segments.

Above inflationary price increases in labour and electricity and the impact of the weaker South African rand on imported materials
put pressure on our input costs. However, a continued focus on improving productivity, driving efficiencies and reducing waste
ensured that fixed cost increases were limited.

Forestry gains are dependent on a variety of factors over which we have limited control. In 2015, selling prices of timber increased
which, combined with the benefit of the lower average crude oil price, resulted in a fair value gain of EUR40 million (2014: EUR34 million)
being recognised, of which EUR23 million was recognised in the first half of the year. We also benefited from land sales as we sought
to further optimise our forestry operations.

The planned maintenance shut at Richards Bay took place during the first half of 2015. In 2016, a shorter shut is planned, again for
the first half of the year.

Tax
Based on the Group's geographic profit mix and the relevant tax rates applicable, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%.
However, we benefited from tax incentives related to our capital investments in Slovakia, Poland and Russia. In addition, we
recognised deferred tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses which we now expect to be able to utilise in the
coming years. As such, our tax charge for 2015 of EUR161 million reflects an effective tax rate for 2015 of 19%, consistent with 2014.

Tax paid in 2015 was EUR160 million (2014: EUR106 million) as a result of the increased profitability and the timing of final tax payments
for the 2014 and earlier financial years.

Going forward, in the absence of further investment related tax incentives and assuming a similar profit mix, we would anticipate
marginal upward pressure on the tax rate over the next three years as it moves towards the expected tax rate of 22%.

Special items
Special items are those items of financial performance that we believe should be separately disclosed to assist in the
understanding of our underlying financial performance. Special items are considered to be material either in nature or in amount.

The net special item charge of EUR57 million before tax comprised the following:

- Restructuring and closure costs of EUR45 million and related impairments of EUR4 million for the closures of our Lohja kraft
  paper mill in Finland, a Consumer Packaging operation in Spain and four Industrial Bags plants
- EUR8 million write off of a receivable and provision for settlement of a legal case relating to the 2012 Nordenia acquisition

Further detail is provided in note 4 of our condensed combined and consolidated financial statements.

Treasury and borrowings
Net debt at 31 December 2015 was down EUR115 million compared to the prior year at EUR1,498 million, reflecting our strong cash
generating capacity and despite an increase in capital expenditure on major projects.

The weighted average maturity of our Eurobonds and committed debt facilities was 3.6 years at 31 December 2015. At the end of
the year, EUR598 million of our EUR2 billion committed debt facilities remained undrawn.

In May 2015, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BBB (stable outlook). This follows the upgrade of our
credit rating by Moody's Investors Service to Baa2 in October 2014.

Gearing at 31 December 2015 was 32.0% and our net debt to 12 month trailing EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, well within our key
financial covenant requirement of 3.5 times.

Net finance costs of EUR105 million were EUR8 million higher than the previous year. Average net debt of EUR1,650 million was similar to
the prior year and our effective interest rate increased to 6.3% (2014: 5.4%), primarily as a result of certain one-off effects and
sharply higher interest rates in Russia.

Cash flow
In 2015, the cash generated from our operations was EUR1,279 million. On average over the last five years, our cash generated from
operations has increased by 8.7% per year.

Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 11.6%, marginally below our revised targeted range of 12-14% and down on the
prior year (12.3%). We have increased our targeted average working capital range to reflect the increased contribution from our
more working capital intensive Industrial Bags and Consumer Packaging businesses as we continue to grow our downstream
packaging interests. The net cash inflow from movements in working capital during the year was EUR9 million (2014: outflow of
EUR87 million).

We paid dividends of EUR209 million to shareholders (2014: EUR193 million). Interest paid of EUR93 million (2014: EUR125 million) was lower
than the prior year, largely due to the refinancing in July 2014 of the 9.75% EUR280 million bond, assumed as part of the acquisition
of Nordenia in 2012.

Dividends paid to holders of non-controlling interests in the Group's subsidiaries increased in 2015, primarily due to the increased
dividend from the 51% held Ružomberok operations.

In 2015, we invested EUR595 million in capital expenditure and completed a number of smaller acquisitions with a total purchase
price, on a debt and cash free basis, of EUR94 million.

Capital investments
While acquisition-led growth remains a key component of our strategy, and we continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise, we
have been deterred in a number of instances by, in our view, inflated asset prices. We anticipate that there will be further
opportunities for value-accretive acquisitions as the availability of cheap financing decreases and asset prices become potentially
more attractive. In the meantime, we continue to see greater opportunity for value-enhancing growth through capital investments in
our existing operations.

Our completed major capital investment projects have delivered an incremental underlying operating profit contribution of
approximately EUR100 million over the past two years. In 2015, we continued to make good progress on a number of major projects.
These include:

-  The EUR166 million Swiecie recovery and biofuel boiler project in Poland, which started up as planned in the second half of
   2015. This first phase involved a new recovery boiler, new turbine and conversion of the existing recovery boiler to a
   biofuel boiler to replace the existing coal boilers. The project was designed to deliver a reduction in ongoing maintenance
   costs, an improvement in overall efficiencies, a reduction in CO2e emissions, full electricity self-sufficiency of the mill and
   valuable options for further growth.
-  The EUR94 million second phase of the Swiecie investment will provide an additional 100,000 tonnes per annum of softwood
   pulp and 80,000 tonnes per annum of lightweight virgin containerboard, ensuring full utilisation of the new recovery
   boiler's capacity. This project remains on track for completion in early 2017.
-  The ramp-up of the rebuilt paper and inline coating machine at Štetí in the Czech Republic was slower than anticipated,
   but is now progressing in line with the revised plan.
-  In our South Africa Division, the two major projects are progressing according to plan and we expect them to be
   completed in the latter part of 2016. They involve upgrading the woodyard at Richards Bay and providing the mill with the
   capacity to produce unbleached kraftliner in addition to the current white-top kraftliner.
-  In our Corrugated Packaging business we invested in a number of new converting machines across our operations,
   improving our customer offering, especially in the higher-value product segments in the growing markets where we
   operate. These investments are delivering strong returns and the Boards have approved further similar investments.
-  A number of smaller projects were completed or are in progress, primarily focused on our Packaging Paper and Fibre and
   Consumer Packaging operations.

The incremental operating profit expected from major projects in 2016 is around EUR60 million (2015: EUR50 million), further
demonstrating the benefits that arise from these high-return investments.

In addition to those projects already in development for start-up over the coming two years, the Boards have recently approved an
investment of EUR310 million in a new 300,000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine at our Ružomberok mill in Slovakia and
related pulp mill upgrades, subject to obtaining approval for various tax incentives from the European Commission and necessary 
permitting. The project offers low-cost production in a fast growing sub-segment of the containerboard market. Based on the current 
timetable, significant capital expenditure on the project is only expected to start in 2017, with the new board machine expected to 
start production in 2019.

We have a strong pipeline of projects under consideration for implementation in the medium term. These projects include:

- replacement of the recovery boiler at our Štetí mill in the Czech Republic as part of a debottlenecking and optimisation
  project; and
- the installation of a 90,000 tonne per annum kraft paper machine at one of our central European operations with
  integrated pulp capacity, producing machine glazed paper to replace capacity reductions as a result of the closure of the
  Lohja mill and conversions to other grades at the Štetí mill.

We anticipate being in a position to make a final investment decision on these projects during the course of 2016.

Given the current approved project pipeline, annual capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of EUR400-EUR450 million per
annum over the next two years.

Sustainable development
Our long-term success is dependent on our ability to integrate sustainability across the business. In 2011 we identified six material
issues and defined 35 commitments to guide our work to 2015. We are proud of the progress we've made across all areas, having
successfully delivered on almost all our 2015 commitments.

The safety of our people is of particular importance to Mondi. In 2015 our operations continued to make good progress in
eliminating their Top 5 Fatal Risks and we have seen a significant improvement in our total recordable case rate. We did however
experience one fatality and three life-altering injuries, highlighting the need for us to remain vigilant and keep safety right at the top
of all our people's minds.

Over the course of 2015 we conducted an inclusive and comprehensive review of our material issues and have defined a new set
of commitments for delivery over the next five years, centred on 10 action areas. Our new action areas are focused on providing a
safe, healthy, fair and inspiring workplace for our people; considering climate change, constrained resources and environmental
impacts in our business decisions; ensuring our fibre sources are sustainable; adding value to our communities; promoting
responsibility in our supply chain; and developing products that create value for our customers.

Dividend
The Boards' aim is to offer shareholders long-term dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times
over the business cycle. Given our strong financial position and the Boards' stated objective to increase distributions to
shareholders through the ordinary dividend, the Boards have recommended an increase in the final dividend.

The Boards of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc have recommended a final dividend of 37.62 euro cents per share (2014: 28.77 euro
cents per share), payable on 19 May 2016 to shareholders on the register on 22 April 2016. Together with the interim dividend of
14.38 euro cents per share, paid on 15 September 2015, this amounts to a total dividend for the year of 52.0 euro cents per share.
In 2014, the total dividend for the year was 42.0 euro cents per share.

The final dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc at the respective Annual General
Meetings scheduled for 12 May 2016.

Outlook
Our outlook for the business remains positive. While we are currently seeing some softness in certain of our packaging paper
grades, we are also seeing firmer prices in the European uncoated fine paper markets following recent industry capacity
rationalisation. In addition, lower energy and related input costs, the generally positive impact of weaker emerging market
currencies and the incremental contribution from recently completed major capital projects are expected to benefit the Group's
performance in the near term.

Underpinned by the Group's robust business model, centred around our high-quality, low-cost asset base, clear strategic focus and
culture of continuous improvement, we remain confident of continuing to deliver an industry-leading performance.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Boards are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes. The
Boards have put in place procedures for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks that the Group faces.

The executive committee, audit committee and Boards conduct an annual review of the most significant risks and uncertainties
faced by the Group, including how these risks are monitored and managed. Risk management is embedded in all decision-making
processes, with ongoing review by the Boards of the Group's risks throughout the year as well as risk assessments being
conducted as part of all investment decisions. A number of our most significant risks are long-term in nature and do not tend to
change significantly from year to year as they are linked to our strategy.

We aim to manage risk within the risk management framework and accepted tolerance limits which are determined by the Boards
in relation to our strategy. Risks, if they develop positively, may lead to opportunities. Our business units are managed locally and
are responsible for implementing their own risk management policies and procedures within the framework approved by the
Boards. Our business units also play a critical role in the identification of emerging risks. Certain more specialised risk areas such
as information security, sustainable development, safety and health, legal, treasury and tax are managed centrally, allowing more
effective coordination.

Risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process. Our approach is flexible, to ensure that it remains relevant at all
levels of the business; and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions. This is particularly important
given the diversity of the Group's locations, markets and production processes.

Over the course of the past year, the audit committee has reviewed each of the principal risks set out below. In evaluating the
Group's risk management and internal control processes, the committee has considered both internal and external audit reports
and received confirmation from the finance heads of the business units that financial control frameworks have operated
satisfactorily.

The Boards are satisfied that the Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk
tolerance levels established by the Boards.

Industry capacity
Plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills. New capacity additions are usually in large increments
which, through their impact on the supply/demand balance, influence market prices. Unless market growth exceeds capacity
additions, excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices. In our converting operations, newer technology may lower operating
costs and provide increased product functionality impacting margins.

We monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity as well as trends and developments in our own product
markets. Our strategic focus on low-cost production and innovation activities to produce higher value-added products, combined
with our focus on growing markets and consistent investment in our operating capacity, ensures that we remain competitive.

Product substitution
Changing global socio-economic and demographic trends and increased public awareness of sustainability challenges affect the
demand for Mondi's products. Customers' needs and purchasing power are changing in emerging markets.

Factors that impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials; increased use of recycled
materials; electronic substitution of paper products; increased demand for high-quality printed material; certified and responsibly
produced goods; and specific material qualities.

Our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new
products on a sustainable, competitive and cost-effective basis. Our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics
and growing regional markets. We work with our customers to develop new markets and new products. Our broad range of
converting products provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic-based packaging
products.

Fluctuations and variability in selling prices and gross margins
Our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and by demand for our products, which are, in turn, influenced by
macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers. Changes in prices
differ between products and geographic regions and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied significantly over time.

Our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation,
proximity or a production cost advantage. We continue to invest in our high-quality, low-cost production assets to ensure we
maintain our competitive cost position. Our high levels of vertical integration reduce our exposure to price volatility of our key input
costs. Our financial policies and structures are designed taking the inherent price volatility of the markets in which we operate into
consideration.

Country risk
We have production operations across more than 30 countries, a number of which are in jurisdictions where the political, economic
and legal systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic
upheaval, inflation, changes in laws, nationalisation or expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations in
those countries.

Areas of weaker governance also present the challenge of addressing potential human rights issues in our operations and supply
chain. From a human capital perspective, we face different demographic and social conditions in the countries we operate in,
affecting the availability of skills and talent for the Group.

We actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate. We engage in regular formal and informal interaction with
the authorities to ensure we remain abreast of any new developments.

New investments are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation.

We actively engage with our employees, communities and other stakeholders for a better understanding of the local socio-
economic conditions and development needs.

Our geographic diversity and decentralised management structure, utilising local resources in countries in which we operate,
reduces our exposure to any specific jurisdiction.

Cost and availability of responsibly produced wood, pulp and paper for recycling
Wood, pulp and paper for recycling comprise approximately a third of our input costs. We have access to our own sources of wood
in Russia and South Africa and we purchase wood, pulp and paper for recycling to meet our needs in the balance of our
operations. Wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced quantities of available wood supply that meet our
standards for Chain-of-Custody certified or FSC-controlled wood, and initiatives to promote the use of woody biomass from
residues of pulp and paper processes as a renewable energy source.

We are committed to acquiring fibre from sustainable, responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial or illegal
supply. The sustainable management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall environmental impact, helping to
protect ecosystems and develop resilient landscapes. We have built strong forestry management resources in Russia and South
Africa to actively monitor and manage our wood resources in those countries.

We have multiple suppliers for each of our mills and actively pursue longer term agreements with strategic suppliers of wood, pulp
and paper for recycling. We are involved in multi-stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for
sustainable, responsible fibre.

Energy security and related input costs
Energy and related input costs comprise approximately a third of our variable costs.

Mondi is a significant consumer of electricity, which we generate internally and purchase from external suppliers. Where we don't
generate electricity from biomass and by-products of our production processes, we are dependent on external suppliers for raw
materials such as gas, oil and coal.

As an energy-intensive business, we face potential physical and regulatory risks related to climate change. We monitor our
electricity usage, carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy. Most of our larger operations have high levels of electricity
self-sufficiency. We focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations and have invested in our operations to improve our
energy profile and increase electricity self-sufficiency, while reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon emission levels.

To the extent that we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements, we may sell such surplus externally. We also generate
revenue from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations, the prices of which are determined in the open market.

Technical integrity of our operating assets
We have five major mills which together account for approximately 70% of our total pulp and paper production capacity and a
significant consumer packaging manufacturing facility in Germany. If operations at any of these key facilities were interrupted for
any significant length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance. Accidents or
incidents such as fires, explosions or large machinery breakdowns, could result in property damage, loss of production,
reputational damage and/or safety incidents.

Our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity and our
proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to minimise breakdown risks.

We conduct detailed risk assessments of our high-priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the
ongoing management and maintenance of such equipment.

We actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to share lessons learnt across our operations, identify
emerging issues, conduct benchmarking and evaluate the effectiveness of our risk reduction activities.

Environmental impact
We operate in a high-impact sector and need to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Our operations are water,
carbon and energy intensive; consume materials such as fibre, polymers, metals and chemicals; and generate emissions to air,
water and land. We are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land. We are subject to a wide range of
international, national and local environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of our customers and expectations
of our broader stakeholders.

We ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements where we operate. Our own
policies and procedures, at or above local policy requirements, are embedded in all our operations.

We focus on a clean production philosophy to address the impact from emissions, discharge and waste. We focus on increasing
the energy efficiency of our operations and using biomass-based fuels, reducing our use of fossil-based energy sources. We
emphasise the responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems, protecting high conservation value areas.

Employee and contractor safety
We operate large facilities, often in remote locations. Accidents or incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors, property
damage, lost production time and/or harm to our reputation.

We have a zero harm policy. We continually monitor incidents and close calls and actively transfer learnings across our operations.
We apply an externally accredited safety management system and conduct regular audits of our operations to support safe and
productive workplaces.

We have implemented a project to engineer out the most significant risks in our operations, supported by robust controls and
procedures for operating those assets.

Reputational risk
Non-compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct practices in
any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed. These include laws relating
to the environment, exports, price controls, taxation, human rights and labour.

We operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme, supported by self-certification and reporting. Our legal and
governance compliance is managed at business unit level, supported by a central team of relevant professionals and is subject to
regular internal audit review.

We also operate a confidential reporting hotline, Speakout, enabling employees, customers, suppliers, managers and other
stakeholders to raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our values.

We increasingly work with our suppliers to promote responsible business conduct in the value chain.

Information technology risk
Many of our operations are dependent on the availability of IT services and an extended interruption of such services may result in
plant shutdown. Cyber crime continues to increase and attempts are more and more sophisticated,with the consequences of
successful attacks including compromised data, financial fraud and system shutdowns.

We have a comprehensive IT Security Policy approved by our Boards. We conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external
providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures. Where possible, we have redundancies in place, our system
landscape is based on well-proven products and we have cyber crime insurance.

Financial risks
Our trading and financing activities expose the Group to financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact our financial
position. These risks relate to the currencies in which we conduct our activities, interest rate and liquidity risks and exposure to
customer credit risk.

Our approach to financial risk management is described in notes 18 and 30 of the annual financial statements.

Going concern
The directors have reviewed the Group's budget for 2016, considered the assumptions contained in the budget and reviewed the
critical risks which may impact the Group's performance in the near term. These include an evaluation of the current
macroeconomic environment and reasonably possible changes in the Group's trading performance.

The Group's financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the annual financial
statements. At 31 December 2015, Mondi had EUR598 million of undrawn, committed debt facilities. The Group's debt facilities have
maturity dates of between 1 and 10 years, with a weighted average maturity of 3.6 years.

Based on their evaluation, the Boards are satisfied that the Group remains solvent and has adequate liquidity to meet its
obligations and continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the integrated report and financial statements.

Mondi to sell Neusiedler to its 51% held subsidiary Mondi SCP a.s. (Ruzomberok)

Mondi has signed an agreement to sell its wholly owned uncoated fine paper operations in
Austria, Hausmening and Kematen (together, “Neusiedler”) to one of its subsidiaries, Mondi
SCP, a.s. (“SCP”). Mondi has a 51% interest in SCP, while the remaining 49% is held by
ECO-INVEST, a.s., (“Ecoinvest”). The resultant disposal reduces Mondi’s effective
ownership in Neusiedler from 100% to 51%, with Ecoinvest owning the remaining 49%.

SCP owns and operates the uncoated fine paper mill in Ruzomberok, Slovakia. The
transaction will enable Neusiedler and SCP to better align and optimise their product portfolio
and production capacity.

SCP will pay a cash consideration of EUR30 million for 100% of Neusiedler. SCP will also
assume debt and debt-like liabilities relating to the business which imply an enterprise value
of EUR115 million for 100% of Neusiedler. If certain EBITDA targets are met, SCP would pay
an additional, limited, consideration (1).

Ecoinvest is a related party as defined in LR 11.1.4R of the UKLA Listing Rules and this
announcement is made in accordance with paragraph LR11.1.10R of the UKLA Listing Rules
(smaller related party transactions). The transaction does not fall into the requirements set
out in Section 10 (transactions with related parties) of the JSE Listing Requirements.

The transaction is expected to complete in March 2016.
(1) For regulatory reasons, a notional EUR100 million earn-out cap has been agreed.

Mondi Group: Trading Statement
In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, companies are
required to publish a trading statement as soon as they become reasonably certain that the
financial results for the period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of
the previous corresponding period.

Mondi is currently finalising its results for the year ended 31 December 2015 which will be
released on 25 February 2016. As indicated in Mondi’s Interim Management Statement
released on 8 October 2015, the Group’s underlying operating profit for the first nine months
of 2015 of EUR711 million was 29% above that of the comparable prior year period of
EUR551 million. It can now be confirmed that underlying operating profit for the year ended
31 December 2015 is expected to be above that achieved in 2014 (EUR767 million).

In the prior year, the Group recognised a net special item charge after tax of EUR48 million.
The equivalent special item charge for the year ended 31 December 2015 is expected to be
around EUR47 million, of which EUR36 million was recognised in the first half. In the second
half of the year, additional restructuring and closure costs and related impairments as well as
provision for settlement of a legal case relating to the 2012 acquisition of Nordenia were
recognised.

Accordingly, Mondi advises that it expects earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended 31
December 2015 to be within the ranges shown below:

-   basic earnings per share (euro cents) 121-126 (2014 97.4), increasing between 24%
    and 29%
-   basic headline earnings per share (euro cents) 121-126 (2014 99.5), increasing between
    22% and 27%
-   basic underlying earnings per share (euro cents) 131 - 136 (2014 107.3), increasing
    between 22% and 27%
Mondi has disclosed basic underlying EPS, which is defined as basic EPS excluding the
impact of special items, as the directors believe this provides a useful additional measure of
the Group’s underlying performance. Special items are those items of financial performance
that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the
underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Mondi has disclosed basic EPS
which includes the effect of special items. The disclosure of basic headline EPS is required
under the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited and has been calculated in accordance
with Circular 2/2015 as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

The above information has neither been reviewed nor audited by Mondi’s auditors.

Following the announcement made on 22 May 2015 that Mondi Group (Mondi) agreed to
acquire two of Walki Group’s (Walki) extrusion coatings plants located in Finland and Poland,
Mondi and Walki have been in discussions with the European Commission about ways to
alleviate concerns related to the impact on the competitive environment. However, no
workable solution suitable for all parties has been found and therefore Walki and Mondi have
decided to withdraw the application to the Commission and terminate the acquisition
agreement.

Extrusion coatings remain a core part of Mondi’s business and product portfolio and Mondi
will continue to operate its extrusion coatings business as before to the benefit of its
customers and other stakeholders.
