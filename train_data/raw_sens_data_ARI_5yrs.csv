Safety performance

We remain committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy 
work environment for all employees. As reported in the first half
of the financial year (1H F2020), three colleagues were fatally
injured in separate accidents at the Two Rivers, Nkomati and
Tweefontein mines. No fatalities were reported in the second half
of the 2020 financial year (2H F2020).

The group lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per 200 000 man-
hours increased marginally to 0.45 (F2019: 0.42). There were 86
lost time injuries (LTIs) reported in F2020 compared to 90 in
F2019. Of these, 63 were reportable injuries (F2019: 76).

Safety achievements in F2020 include:

-   Beeshoek Mine achieved 18 000 fatality-free production shifts
    on 16 August 2019, an accomplishment that has taken 16 years
    and 5 months to achieve. On 9 September 2019 the mine recorded
    365 successive days without an LTI
-   Khumani Mine achieved 3 million fatality-free shifts on 29 November 2019
-   Black Rock Mine achieved 8 million fatality free shifts on 
    11 March 2020 which was a first for ARM Ferrous and took 11 years
    and two months to achieve. The mine also improved its LTIFR
    by 21% year-on-year
-   Modikwa Mine achieved 1 million fatality-free shifts on 6 January 2020

Note: LTIs and LTIFR are presented on a 100% basis and are reported
for those operations where ARM has direct or joint management and
exclude the ARM Coal, Sakura and Harmony operations.

Financial performance

Headline earnings

The financial year ended 30 June 2020 was challenging, particularly
in the second half of the year with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.
In this environment we are pleased to report a 6% increase in
headline earnings to R5 534 million (F2019: R5 226 million). Our
diversified portfolio of commodities again stood us in good stead
as higher PGM and iron ore prices more than offset the negative
impact of lower manganese ore, manganese alloys and thermal coal
prices.

The weaker Rand against the US Dollar also contributed positively
to headline earnings. The average realised Rand weakened by 11%
versus the US Dollar to R15.68/US$ compared to R14.19/US$ in F2019.
For reporting purposes, the closing exchange rate was R17.36/US$
(30 June 2019: R14.09/US$).

The F2020 headline earnings include re-measurement gains on partner
loans of R441 million (F2019: R49 million).

Attributable headline earnings for ARM Ferrous were 10% lower at
R4 479 million (F2019: R4 960 million) as a 9% increase in headline
earnings in the iron ore division was more than offset by a 48%
decrease in the manganese division headline earnings. Despite lower
iron ore sales volumes (mainly as a result of the lockdown),
profitability in the iron ore division improved driven by higher
Rand export iron ore prices. In contrast, average realised Rand
manganese ore prices were 22% lower which, coupled with a 6%
decrease in manganese ore sales volumes, significantly impacted
the manganese divisions headline earnings. Unit costs were well
controlled at the manganese ore operations with on-mine unit
production costs decreasing by 2% in the reporting period.

ARM Platinum attributable headline earnings increased by 
R1 030 million to R1 142 million in F2020 from R112 million in F2019. 
The Two Rivers and Modikwa mines benefitted from 6%, 54% and 144%
increase in average realised platinum, palladium and rhodium
prices, respectively. Modikwa Mine further benefited from its
almost 1:1 platinum to palladium ratio. It should be noted that
the temporary improvement in the purchase-of-concentrate agreement
at Modikwa Mine expired on 31 December 2019.

Headline earnings at the PGM operations were impacted by penalty
and treatment charges of R303 million and R11 million for Two
Rivers and Modikwa Mine, respectively.

Production and sales volumes at both PGM operations were lower
owing to grade challenges experienced in 1H F2020 and the lockdown
in 2H F2020 (as discussed on page 6 of the full announcement). Unit
cost increases at both operations were above inflation mainly due
to the decline in volumes.

Nkomati Mine reported an attributable headline loss of R704 million
for F2020. Scaling down of the Nkomati Mine in preparation for care
and maintenance is progressing well with the mine now expected to
cease production in February 2021 (previously September 2020).

Due to Nkomati Mine approaching the end of its economic life of
mine and the planned care and maintenance the following expenses
and provisions were included in the mine's F2020 attributable
headline earnings:

-   a provision relating to an increase in rehabilitation and
    decommissioning obligations of R384 million (discussed in
    detail on pages 12 and 13 of the full announcement).
-   a provision relating to a tax diesel rebate currently under
    dispute with the South African Revenue Services of R131 million
-   a provision for restructuring costs of R77 million
-   an inventory write-down of R76 million
-   off-take penalties for out of specification concentrate of
    R99 million

ARM Coal reported an attributable headline loss of R2 million
(F2019: R411 million headline earnings) which includes re-
measurement gains of R485 million (F2019: R245 million) on partner
loans. Excluding the re-measurement gains, the ARM Coal headline
loss was R487 million (F2019: R272 million headline earnings) as a
result of the sharp decline in export thermal coal prices, lower
sales volumes (owing to weather-related mining challenges) and
above-inflation unit cost increases.

The Machadodorp Works headline loss was R163 million as research
into the development of more energy efficient smelting technology
progressed. In 2H F2020 expenditure at Machadodorp Works was
curtailed to conserve cash in light of uncertainty due to COVID-19.

ARM Corporate and other headline loss was R85 million compared to
R257 million in F2019. The reduced loss was mainly due to an
increase in re-measurement gains of R108 million, and higher
interest received of R62 million.

Basic earnings and impairments

Basic earnings were R3 965 million and include attributable
impairments of the ARM Coal assets of R1 680 million before tax
and R1 524 million after tax. An impairment indicator assessment
was performed on Goedgevonden Mine and the PCB investment (as
stand-alone and separate cash generating units). Impairment
indicators were identified (including lower expected production
and above inflation unit cost increases) which resulted in
attributable impairment losses (after tax) of R559 million and
R1 121 million being recognised for the Goedgevonden Mine and PCB
investment cash generating units, respectively.

The recoverable amounts for the Goedgevonden Mine and PCB
investment cash generating units were determined based on the fair
value less cost of disposal calculation performed in terms of
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Financial position

ARM improved its financial position despite the operational and
economic challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are
pleased be able to declare a final dividend of R7.00 per share even
during these difficult times while maintaining a robust financial
position to further navigate this uncertain environment.

At 30 June 2020, ARM was in net cash position of R3 790 million
(30 June 2019: R2 601 million), an improvement of R1 189 million
compared to the net cash at the end of the corresponding year. This
amount excludes attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM
Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R 3 208 million (30 June 2019: 
R3 053 million). There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either of the two
reporting periods.

ARM's financial position was further strengthened by a positive
revaluation adjustment of R2 325 million (net of deferred capital
gains tax) on the Harmony Gold Mining Company (Harmony) investment
as the Harmony share price increased by 126% from R31.74 at 30 June
2019 to R71.86 per share at 30 June 2020.

Cash flow

Cash generated from operations increased by R1 743 million to
R3 866 million (F2019: R2 123 million) after a R1 189 million
increase in working capital requirements (F2019: R555 million)
which was mainly due to an increase in debtors at the PGM
operations.

Dividends received from the Assmang joint venture were R3 750 million 
(F2019: R3 315 million). In F2020, R2 717 million in
dividends was paid to ARM shareholders representing the final
dividend of R9.00 per share declared in F2019 (total amount paid
was R1 741 million) and the interim dividend of R5.00 per share
declared for 1H F2020 (total amount paid was R976 million).

Net cash outflow from investing activities was R2 343 million
(F2019: R1 271 million) and include investments in financial assets
of R1 539 million. Certain cash and cash equivalents were invested
in longer dated fixed deposits in F2020 to achieve better returns.

The Board approved a share buy-back which commenced on 19 March
2020. R57 million was spent acquiring approximately 623 thousand
ARM shares at an average price of R90.86 per share. The share buy-
back was terminated on 24 March 2020 to conserve cash owing to
uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management continues
to review share buy-backs in line with ARM's capital allocation
guiding principles.

Borrowings of R264 million (F2019: R595 million) were repaid in
the period, reducing gross debt to R1 925 million (30 June 2020:
R2 031 million). Modikwa Mine repaid R485 million of its partner
loans.

The Broad-Based Economic Empowerment (BBEE) Trust fully repaid its
loan with Nedbank in October 2019.

Capital expenditure

Segmental capital expenditure was R3 506 million (F2019: R3 242 million) 
and included R394 million of capitalised waste stripping
at the iron ore operations (F2019: R397 million).

Dividend declaration

ARM aims to pay ordinary dividends to shareholders equal to
approximately 40-70% of annual dividends received from its group
companies.

Dividends remain at the discretion of the Board which considers
the company's capital allocation guiding principles as well as
other relevant factors such as financial performance, commodities
outlook, investment opportunities, gearing levels as well as
solvency and liquidity requirements of the Companies Act.

ARM aims to pay an interim and final dividend. The weighting between
the interim and final dividends is likely to result in the final
dividend being higher than the interim dividend. ARM does not
borrow funds to pay dividends.

For F2020, the Board has approved and declared a final dividend of
700 cents per share (gross) (F2019: 900 cents per share). The
amount to be paid is approximately R1 563 million.

The dividend declared will be subject to dividend withholding tax.

JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional information is
disclosed:

AFRICAN RAINBOW MINERALS (ARM) BUSINESS UPDATE ON IMPACT OF COVID-19

ARM refers to the SENS announcement released on 27 March 2020 in which
the Company announced that in compliance with the nationwide lockdown,
all ARM mining operations including Khumani, Beeshoek, Black Rock,
Modikwa, Two Rivers and Nkomati mines had been placed on temporary
care and maintenance for the duration of the 21-day lockdown period.

Subsequent to the initial announcement made by the President of the
Republic of South Africa on 23 March 2020, the list of essential goods
and services has been refined through continuous engagement and
consultation with stakeholders.

Exemptions to the lockdown restrictions have been granted for certain
additional goods which are considered critical to the nation's economy
and its revitalisation post the COVID-19 pandemic.

ARM’s joint venture, Assmang (Pty) Ltd, has received authorisation
from the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy to operate its load-
out stations at Khumani and Beeshoek mines in order to continue loading
iron ore from the mines’ respective stockpiles.

Transnet has mobilised the requisite resources and reactivated the
rail and port export system from the Northern Cape to the Port of
Saldanha which reactivation supports exports at approximately 40% of
normalised iron ore volumes for the week commencing 30 March 2020.
Transnet plans to ramp up volumes for the remainder of the lockdown
period depending on availability of rail and port services. The iron
ore operations have sufficient inventory to load for the remainder of
the lockdown period.

The safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors remains a
key priority. The loading functions require less than 2% of the total
mine workforce to be on-site. Strict hygiene, health and safety
protocols are being maintained to protect employees who will be
executing the loading functions.

ARM refers shareholders to the SENS announcement released on 24
March 2020.

The safety and wellbeing of all ARM employees and contractors
remains a priority in ARM’s response to the evolving COVID-19
global pandemic.

In compliance with the nationwide lockdown, all ARM mining
operations including Khumani, Beeshoek, Black Rock, Modikwa, Two
Rivers and Nkomati mines have been placed on temporary care and
maintenance for the duration of the lockdown period.

All activities at Machadodorp Works have been suspended. Cato
Ridge Works has switched off its furnaces and converter. The Sakura
Ferroalloys operation located in Malaysia remains in full
operation in accordance with local Malaysian regulations.

ARM Coal operations supply coal to Eskom and are considered
essential to the maintenance of power generation in South Africa.
These operations continue to operate in terms of the lockdown
regulations, and in terms of the guidelines issued by the
Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to continue to supply
Eskom. Any export of coal will need to be approved by the
Department of Mineral Resources and Energy and will be subject to
the availability of rail capacity.

Necessary care and maintenance work will continue at all affected
operations to ensure that integrity of assets is maintained and
to ensure a safe and efficient ramp up after the lockdown.

Additional safety, health and hygiene provisions are in place to
protect the wellness of employees that continue to work during the
lockdown.

In addition to the above, Two Rivers Mine received notice of force
majeure from Impala Platinum Limited (Impala). In terms of this
notice, Impala indicated that for the duration of the lockdown
period it will not be able to receive concentrate in terms of the
agreement whereof Impala purchases concentrate as delivered by Two
Rivers Mine.
                                                                
Management does not anticipate this notice will have any
additional negative impact over and above the impact of the
temporary care and maintenance described above.

We remain committed to preventing the spread of COVID-19 and to
South Africa’s return to social and economic stability. Under no
circumstances will the safety of our employees be compromised.

ARM’s robust financial position gives us flexibility to
responsibly navigate this period of uncertainty and ensure ARM’s
long term sustainability.

FORCE MAJEURE NOTIFICATION RECEIVED FROM ANGLO AMERICAN
PLATINUM LIMITED (AMPLATS) WITH RESPECT TO MODIKWA MINE
PURCHASE OF CONCENTRATE AGREEMENT

ARM refers to the announcement by Amplats on Friday, 6 March
2020 regarding temporary shutdown of its converter plant.

ARM confirms that its subsidiary, ARM Mining Consortium
Limited (ARM MC), has received written notification of force
majeure from Rustenburg Platinum Mines Limited (RPM) in terms
of the purchase of concentrate agreement between ARM MC and
RPM. ARM MC holds 50% of Modikwa Mine while the remaining 50%
is held by RPM, a subsidiary of Amplats.

RPM indicated that it will not be able to complete the
processing of concentrate produced at Modikwa Mine until
repair work to the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B is
complete. According to Amplats, repair work on ACP Phase B is
expected to take approximately 80 days to complete.

ARM MC will continue to deliver concentrate produced at
Modikwa Mine to RPM.

Safety

We are committed to creating and maintaining a safe work environment for all our employees. Regrettably three
colleagues were fatally injured in separate accidents at our operations.

On 8 September 2019, Mr Mpedi Ishmael Malatji, a load haul dump operator at Two Rivers Mine was fatally injured
in an accident involving moving machinery. At Nkomati Mine Mr Makoti Marks Tshwale, a water truck operator
employed by a contractor, was fatally injured on 31 October 2019 when he lost control of the truck he was driving
which overturned. At Tweefontein Coal Mine, Mr Simon Sandamela was fatally injured in a blasting accident on 
10 November 2019.

We extend our deepest condolences to the families of Mr Malatji, Mr Tshwale and Mr Sandamela and to their
colleagues and friends.

Initiatives are ongoing at the operations to ensure that safety training continues and safety standards are
strictly upheld.

A total of 52 lost time injuries (LTIs) occurred in the six months under review (1H F2019: 40) of which 41 were
reportable injuries (1H F2019: 37). The group's lost time injury frequency rate per 200 000 man-hours was 0.48
compared to 0.36 in the corresponding period.

Note: Lost time injuries and lost time injury frequency rates are presented on a 100% basis and are reported for
those operations where ARM has direct or joint management and exclude the ARM Coal, Sakura and Harmony operations.

Financial results overview

Headline earnings

ARM continued to benefit from its commodity portfolio diversification as higher palladium, rhodium, platinum and
iron ore prices offset the decline in manganese ore, manganese alloys and thermal coal prices. Headline earnings
were therefore only marginally lower at R2 155 million or R11.14 per share (1H F2019: R2 201 million or R11.49
per share). A 4% weakening of the average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate to R14.69/US$ (1H F2019: R14.19/US$) 
contributed positively to earnings. The closing exchange rate was R14.00/US$ (31 December 2018: R14.09/US$).

Headline earnings for ARM Ferrous were 13% lower at R1 848 million (1H F2019: R2 127 million) as a 16% increase
in headline earnings in the iron ore division was more than offset by a 52% decline in headline earnings in the
manganese division. The iron ore division's improved profitability was driven mainly by higher average realised
US Dollar iron ore prices due to supply disruptions in the global seaborne iron ore market coupled with 
better-than-expected steel production in China. Conversely, manganese ore prices declined sharply in the latter part 
of the review period as increased seaborne manganese ore supply put prices under pressure. The negative impact of
lower manganese ore prices on headline earnings was partially offset by a 13% increase in export sales volumes
as ramp-up of Black Rock Mine progressed on schedule and within budget. The manganese ore operations decreased
on-mine unit production costs which also contributed positively to headline earnings. Headline earnings for the
manganese alloy operations were 153% lower, primarily due to lower alloy prices and sales volumes, increased
production costs, as well as inventory net realisable value adjustments at period end.

ARM Platinum headline earnings increased by 193% to R489 million as both the Two Rivers and Modikwa mines doubled
headline earnings compared to the corresponding period. Average realised platinum, palladium and rhodium prices
were up 9%, 58% and 97% respectively and Modikwa Mine benefited from its almost 1:1 platinum to palladium ratio.
Production volumes were lower at both operations as Two Rivers Mine continued to be affected by lower grades due
to mining a split reef. Installation of 40 000 tonnes per month of additional milling capacity at Two Rivers Mine
has been approved and is expected to increase production volumes to between 360 000 to 380 000 PGM ounces per
annum. Construction and installation of this milling capacity is expected to take 18 months from May 2020 and
ramp-up to steady state within six months thereafter. At Modikwa Mine lower-grade material was blended with
higher-grade fines to optimise plant milling capacity, which negatively impacted the grade. Production volumes
are expected to improve slightly for 2H F2020 at Two Rivers Mine, while volumes are expected to recover to an
annualised rate of approximately 320 000 tonnes at Modikwa Mine.

Nkomati Mine headline loss was impacted by the following charges (100% basis):

  -  a provision relating to South African Revenue Services (SARS) diesel rebates (and related interest) currently
     under dispute of R271 million;
  -  a provision for restructuring costs of R84 million;
  -  an inventory adjustment of R96 million; and
  -  penalty and treatment charges of R63 million.
 
Scaling down this loss-making operation is progressing on schedule. As previously reported, production at Nkomati
Mine will cease from end-September 2020, after which the mine will be placed on care and maintenance in preparation
for closure. Engagement with affected employees, communities and suppliers is continuing. An assessment of total
closure and rehabilitation costs for the operation is under way and expected to be completed by end of March 2020.

ARM Coal reported a headline loss of R101 million which includes a re-measurement gain of R104 million 
(1H F2019: R202 million re-measurement loss) on the ARM Coal loans which were restructured in F2018. Excluding the 
re-measurement gain, ARM Coal headline loss was R209 million, mainly due to a sharp decline in seaborne thermal coal
prices (as lower natural gas and renewable energy prices in the United States and Europe put seaborne thermal
coal prices under pressure). In addition, lower volumes owing to weather-related mining challenges and above-inflation 
unit cost increases negatively affected headline earnings. Seaborne thermal coal prices have improvedin recent months 
and production volumes are expected to recover to normal annualised levels at both the Goedgevonden (GGV) and Participative 
Coal Business(PCB).

ARM Corporate and other headline loss was R81 million compared to R158 million in 1H F2019. The decrease is
mainly due to higher interest income (R60 million), higher ARM Mining Consortium and ARM Coal intercompany loan
re-measurement gains (R118 million), partially offset by lower fee income (R26 million), higher operating expenses
(R25 million), higher taxation (R30 million) and Machadodorp Works operating expenses which are included in the
Corporate and other segment (R11 million) since acquiring this business from Assmang. The intercompany loans 
re-measurement are partially eliminated at group level.

Basic earnings were R2 132 million (1H F2019: R1 306 million). Comparative basic earnings included an attributable
impairment of Nkomati Mine assets of R892 million after tax.

Financial position

ARM maintained a robust financial position which allows continued investment in our existing business while giving
us flexibility to pursue growth and pay dividends in line with our dividend guiding principles.

At 31 December 2019, ARM was in a net cash position of R2 869 million (30 June 2019: R2 601 million, 
31 December 2018: R2 914 million). This amount excludes attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM Ferrous 
(50% of Assmang) of R3 107 million (30 June 2019: R3 053 million, 31 December 2018: R2 186 million). Total borrowings of
R147 million (1H F2019: R167 million) were repaid in the period, reducing gross debt to R2 024 million 
(31 December 2018: R2 132 million) which mostly relates to the ARM Coal debt. The ARM Broad-based Economic Empowerment
(BBEE) Trust loan from Nedbank was fully repaid in October 2019. There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either of the two 
reporting periods.

Cash flow

Cash generated from operations increased by R140 million to R921 million (1H F2019: R781 million) despite a 
R1 280 million increase in working capital requirements (1H F2019: R570 million increase). Dividends received from
the Assmang joint venture were R2 000 million (1H F2019: R1 750 million). Capital expenditure for the period was
R492 million, all for sustaining capital (1H F2019: R505 million). Dividends paid to ARM shareholders in 1H F2020
include R1 741 million paid in October 2019 as a final dividend (1H F2019: R1 433 million).

Net cash outflow from investing activities was R492 million (1H F2019: R715 million). The corresponding period
included ARM's R211 million participation in a Harmony rights issue.

Capital expenditure

Segmental capital expenditure (attributable basis) was R1 573 million for the review period and included R215 million 
(H1 F2019: R242 million) of capitalised waste stripping at the iron ore operations. Waste is no longer capitalised at 
Nkomati Mine as the operation scales down.

Changes to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as disclosed in the integrated
annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 2019, other than depletion due to continued mining activities
at the operations. An updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Statement will be issued in our F2020
integrated annual report.

Changes to board of directors

ARM announced the following changes to its board of directors, effective from 18 December 2019:

  -  Mr Andre Wilkens stepped down as an executive director of ARM. Mr Wilkens served for many years as an
     executive director, including a long and successful tenure as the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
  -  Mrs Jongisa Magagula was appointed as Executive Director for Investor Relations and New Business Development.

Dividend declaration

ARM aims to pay ordinary dividends to shareholders equal to approximately 40-70% of annual dividends received
from its group companies.

Dividends remain at the discretion of the board of directors and consider the company's capital allocation
principles as well as other relevant factors such as financial performance, commodities outlook, investment
opportunities, gearing levels as well as solvency and liquidity requirements of the Companies Act.

ARM aims to pay an interim and a final dividend. The weighting between the interim and final dividends is
likely to result in the final dividend being higher than the interim dividend. ARM does not borrow funds to pay
dividends.

For the review period, the board has approved and declared an interim dividend of 500 cents per share (gross)
(1H F2019: 400 cents per share). The amount to be paid is approximately R1 119 million.

The dividend declared will be subject to dividend withholding tax. In line with paragraphs 11.17(a) (i) to (x)
and 11.17(c)of the JSE Listings Requirements the following additional information is disclosed:

    -   The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
    -   The South African dividends tax rate is 20%;
    -   The gross local dividend is 500 cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividends tax;
    -   The net local dividend is 400 cents per share for shareholders liable to pay dividends tax;
    -   At the date of this declaration, ARM has 223 879 043 ordinary shares in issue; and
    -   ARM's income tax reference number is 9030/018/60/1.

A gross dividend of 500 cents per ordinary share, being the dividend for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
has been declared payable on Monday, 23 March 2020 to those shareholders recorded in the books of the company
at the close of business on Friday, 20 March 2020. The dividend is declared in the currency of South Africa.
Any change in address or dividend instruction applying to this dividend must be received by the company's
transfer secretaries or registrar not later than Tuesday, 17 March 2020. The last day to trade ordinary shares
cum dividend is Tuesday, 17 March 2020. Ordinary shares trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 18 March 2020. The
record date is Friday, 20 March 2020 while the payment date is Monday, 23 March 2020.
 
No dematerialisation or rematerialisation of share certificates may occur between Wednesday, 18 March 2020 and
Friday, 20 March 2020, both dates inclusive, nor may any transfers between registers take place during this period.

Review by independent auditors

The financial results for the six months ended 31 December 2019 have not been reviewed nor audited by the
Company's registered auditors, Ernst & Young Inc.

Any reference to future financial performance included in these results has not been reviewed nor reported
on by ARM's external auditors.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, a listed
company is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it
is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the
financial results for the period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding period.

ARM's basic earnings for 1H F2020 are expected to increase by
between 60% and 65% to between R2 090 million and R2 155 million
(1H F2019: R1 306 million). Basic earnings for the six months ended
31 December 2018 (1H F2019) included an attributable impairment of
Nkomati Mine assets of R892 million after tax. The 1H F2020 basic
earnings per share are expected to be between 1 081 and 1 114 cents
(1H F2019: 682 cents).

Headline earnings for 1H F2020 are expected to decrease by between
1% and 3% to between R2 128 million and R2 176 million (1H F2019:
R2 201 million) as higher headline earnings at the platinum group
metals (PGM) and iron ore operations were offset by lower headline
earnings from the manganese, nickel and coal operations. Headline
earnings per share are therefore expected to be between 1 100 cents
and 1 125 cents (1H F2019: 1 149 cents).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based
has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors
of ARM.

The Company's 1H F2020 financial results will be released on or

Salient features of the provisional results for the financial
year ended 30 June 2019 (F2019):

  - Revenue increased by 5% to R9 595 million (F2018: R9 112  million).
  - Headline earnings increased by 9% to R5 226 million or
    R27.18 per share (F2018: R4 814 million or R25.26 per
    share).
  - The iron ore division delivered a 103% increase in headline
    earnings to R3 397 million (F2018: R1 672 million).
  - Basic earnings were R3 554 million (F2018: R4 562 million)
    and include attributable impairments (after tax) of the
    Nkomati Mine and Sakura Ferroalloys of R1 070 million and
    R507 million, respectively.
  - A final dividend of 900 cents was declared. An interim
    dividend of 400 cents per share was paid in April 2019
    bringing the total dividend for F2019 to 1 300 cents per share 
    (F2018: 1 000 cents per share).
  - ARM received dividends of R3 315 million for F2019 (F2018:R3 000 million) 
    from Assmang.
  - A robust financial position was maintained with consolidated
    net cash increasing by R1 606 million to R2 601 million
    (R995 million at 30 June 2018).
  - The Company net asset value increased by 29% from R21 907 million 
    to R28 180 million.
  - An agreement to scale down the loss-making Nkomati Mine was
    reached by the joint venture partners. Engagements with
    affected stakeholders are under way.

Safety

ARM is committed to creating and maintaining a safe work
environment for all employees. Despite our initiatives and
determination to achieve the target of zero harm, an employee, Mr
Thomas Maluleke was fatally injured in a fall of ground accident
at Modikwa Mine on 27 March 2019. The Board and the management
team extend sincere condolences to the family, friends and
colleagues of Mr Maluleke.

The number of lost time injuries across our directly or jointly
managed operations reduced marginally from 91 to 90 in F2019
while the number of reportable injuries increased from 68 to 76.
A Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of 0.42 per 200 000
man-hours was reported for the financial year under review
(F2018: 0.38 per 200 000 man-hours).

Safety figures and statistics are reported only for the
operations where ARM has direct or joint management and therefore
do not include the ARM Coal and Sakura Ferroalloys operations.
Reported safety figures and statistics are on a 100% basis.

Financial performance

Headline earnings increased by 9% to R5 226 million or R27.18 per
share in F2019 (F2018: R4 814 million or R25.26 per share) driven
mainly by higher headline earnings delivered by the iron ore and
Two Rivers operations.

The F2018 headline earnings included a net fair value gain of
R977 million while the F2019 headline earnings include net fair
value and re-measurement gains of R49 million. Excluding the net
fair value and re-measurement gains, the F2019 adjusted headline
earnings are up by 35%.

Segmental earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) were 16% higher at R9 336 million 
(F2018: R8 024 million).

ARM continued to benefit from its portfolio diversification as
lower US Dollar prices for manganese ore, manganese alloy,
platinum, nickel and thermal coal were more than offset by higher
US Dollar prices in iron ore, palladium and rhodium. The average
realised Rand/US Dollar weakened by 11% during F2019 to
R14.19/US$ (F2018: R12.84/US$). For reporting purposes, the
closing exchange rate was R14.09/US$ (30 June 2018: R13.72/US$).

ARM Ferrous - Headline earnings increased by 41% to R4 960 million 
(F2018: R3 528 million) as the iron ore division
delivered a 103% increase. Iron ore prices were high in the
financial year under review with the index price for 62% Fe iron
ore fines CIF North China increasing from US$64.45/t in July 2018
to close at US$116.35/t at the end of June 2019. Concurrently,
lump premiums increased by 9% over the financial year. A
combination of higher fines prices, increased lump premiums and a
higher lump to fines ratio in sales volumes resulted in average
realised iron ore prices increasing by 34% (on a Free on Board
(FOB) equivalent basis). On-mine unit production costs at the
iron ore operations increased by 8%.

Headline earnings in the manganese division were 15% lower mainly
due to reduced profitability at the manganese alloy operations
owing to lower manganese alloy prices and high input costs
(particularly for manganese ore and reductants).

ARM Platinum - Headline earnings declined by 73%. Two Rivers Mine
delivered a 5% increase in headline earnings benefitting from an
increase in the Rand PGM basket price which was partially offset
by lower sales volumes. Two Rivers Mine continues to be impacted
by lower head grades. Initiatives to improve the PGM volumes at
Two Rivers Mine are being considered, including installation of
additional milling capacity. An addition of approximately 40 thousand 
tonnes per month of milling capacity to the Two Rivers Mine plant 
would result in an increase of PGM production volumes
to approximately 380 thousand 6E PGMs per annum.

Modikwa Mine headline earnings remained flat at R105 million.
Although Modikwa also benefitted from higher PGM prices, reported
headline earnings were negatively impacted by a R156 million fair
value loss on intercompany loans in accordance with new
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9. This loss
is partially eliminated in ARM Company with a R19 million net
gain effect on the group consolidated earnings. EBITDA at Modikwa
Mine was 34% higher at R327 million (F2018: R244 million).

Nkomati Mine reported a headline loss of R315 million impacted by
an increase in unit production costs and a R130 million negative
mark-to-market adjustment as the nickel price reduced to US$12 675/t 
at 30 June 2019. An agreement was reached by the joint
venture partners to scale down production at the loss-making
Nkomati Mine and place the mine on care and maintenance from
September 2020 in preparation for closure.

ARM Coal - Headline earnings were R411 million including a loan
re-measurement gain of R245 million. The corresponding financial
year headline earnings of R1 485 million included a fair value
gain of R1 210 million on restructuring of the ARM Coal loans.
Excluding the fair value and re-measurement gains, GGV Mine
recorded a headline loss of R53 million in F2019 (F2018: R33 million 
headline loss) while the PCB operations recorded headline
earnings of R219 million (F2018: R308 million).

The ARM Corporate and other headline loss of R257 million is R356
million lower than the R613 million reported in F2018. This is
mainly due to higher fee income (R130 million); lower unrealised
and an intercompany loan re-measurement gain on the ARM Mining
Consortium loan (R175 million). These were partially offset by a
higher bonus provision (R35 million), Machadodorp Works expenses
now included in the Corporate and other segment (R39 million) and
intercompany loan re-measurement loss on the ARM Coal loans of
R215 million (F2018: R233 million loss).

*     Modikwa Mine's F2019 headline earnings include a fair value
      loss of R156 million (net of non-controlling interest and tax)
      on the re-measurement of mostly inter-company loans in
      accordance with new IFRS 9 accounting standard which became
      effective for ARM from 1 July 2018. This fair value loss is
      partly eliminated at the ARM Corporate and other segment with a
      R19 million gain effect on the group consolidated headline earnings.

**    In F2018 the Chrome Division comprised of Machadodorp Works
      where slag was being processed to produce ferrochrome.
      Machadodorp Works was sold to ARM in F2019 and is now included
      in ARM Corporate and other segment from 1 March 2019.

***   The F2019 headline earnings include a R245 million re-measurement 
      gain on the ARM Coal loans which were restructured in F2018. 
      R215 million of this fair value gain is eliminated in the 
      ARM Corporate and other segment. In F2018 (when the loans
      were restructured) a fair value gain of R1 210 million was
      included in the ARM Coal headline earnings and a R233 million
      fair value loss was included in the ARM Corporate and other
      segment.

****  ARM Copper comprised Lubambe Mine which was sold in F2018.


These results have been achieved in conjunction with ARM's
partners at the various operations, Anglo American Platinum
Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala
Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk Nickel Africa (Pty)
Ltd (Norilsk) and Glencore South Africa (Glencore).

Basic earnings for the financial year were R3 554 million (F2018:
R4 562 million) and include amongst others the following
attributable impairments:

  - Nkomati Mine assets of R1 070 million after tax;
  - Sakura Ferroalloys assets and investment (included in the
    equity-accounted Assmang joint venture) of R507 million
    after tax; and
  - Goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Machadodorp Works
    of R146 million with no tax effect.

Dividend declaration

The Board has approved and declared a final dividend of 900 cents
per share (gross) in respect of the year ended 30 June 2019
(F2018: 750 cents per share). The amount to be paid is
approximately R1 998 million.

An interim dividend of 400 cents per share was declared and paid
in F2019 bringing the total dividend for F2019 to 1 300 cents per share.

This declaration is consistent with ARM's commitment, as a
globally competitive company, to pay dividends while retaining
the ability to fund efficiency improvements and sustaining production.

ARM has updated its dividend declaration guiding principles to
include a formula in determining dividends. ARM will aim to pay
ordinary dividends to shareholders equal to approximately 40-70%
of annual dividends received from its group companies.

Dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
will take into account the Company's capital allocation
principles as well as other relevant factors such as financial
performance, commodities outlook, investment opportunities,
gearing levels as well as solvency and liquidity requirements of
the Companies Act.

ARM will aim to pay an interim and a final dividend. The
weighting between the interim and final dividends is likely to
result in the final dividend being higher than the interim
dividend.

Where appropriate, the Board will consider supplementing ordinary
dividends with special dividends. ARM will not borrow funds to
pay dividends.

The dividend declared will be subject to Dividend Withholding
Tax. In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a) (i) to (x) and
11.17(c) of the JSE Listings Requirements the following
additional information is disclosed:

    - The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
    - The South African Dividends Tax (""Dividends Tax"") rate is
      20% (twenty percent);
    - The gross local dividend amount is 900 cents per ordinary
      share for shareholders exempt from the Dividends Tax;
    - The net local dividend amount is 720.00000 cents per share
      for shareholders liable to pay the Dividends Tax;
    - As at the date of this declaration ARM has 222 008 324
      ordinary shares in issue; and
    - ARM's income tax reference number is 9030/018/60/1.
    - A gross dividend of 900 cents per ordinary share, being the
      dividend for the year ended 30 June 2019 has been declared
      payable on Monday, 30 September 2019 to those shareholders
      recorded in the books of the Company at the close of
      business on Friday, 27 September 2019. The dividend is
      declared in the currency of South Africa. Any change in
      address or dividend instruction to apply to this dividend
      must be received by the Company's transfer secretaries or
      registrar not later than Monday, 23 September 2019. The last
      day to trade ordinary shares cum divided is Monday,  
      23 September 2019. Ordinary shares trade ex-dividend from
      Wednesday, 25 September 2019. The record date is Friday, 
      27 September 2019 whilst the payment date is Monday, 
      30 September 2019.

No dematerialisation or rematerialisation of share certificates
may occur between Wednesday, 25 September 2019 and Friday, 27
September 2019, both dates inclusive, nor may any transfers
between registers take place during this period.

Changes to the Board

On 26 June 2019 Mr Kobus Moller resigned as an independent non-executive 
director of the Company, to pursue other interests.

The following changes were made to the composition of ARM board
committees to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the board.

    - Messrs D C Noko and J A Chissano have been appointed as
      members of the social and ethics committee; and
    - Mr D C Noko has been appointed as a member of the investment
      committee.

TRADING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019
(F2019)

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, a listed company
is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a
reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous period.

ARM continued to benefit from portfolio diversification as higher US Dollar
prices realised for iron ore, palladium and rhodium more than offset lower
US Dollar prices realised for manganese ore, manganese alloy, platinum and
thermal coal. Earnings for F2019 were also positively impacted by a weaker
average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. The iron ore division delivered
its highest reported earnings.

Headline earnings per share for F2019 are therefore expected to increase by
between 2% and 10% to between 2 577 and 2 779 cents (F2018: 2 526 cents).

Basic earnings per share for F2019 are expected to reduce by between 22% and
29% to between 1 700 and 1 866 cents (F2018: 2 393 cents) and were negatively
impacted by attributable impairments (after tax) of Nkomati Mine and Sakura
Ferroalloys of R1 070 million and R507 million, respectively.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has neither
been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors of ARM.

The Company's F2019 provisional results will be released on 30 August 2019.

Results overview

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces a 13% increase in headline earnings to R2 201 million (R11.49 per
share) for the six months ended 31 December 2018 (1H F2018: R1 945 million or R10.23 per share) and declares an
interim dividend of 400 cents per share (1H F2018: 250 cents per share). The increase in headline earnings was driven
mainly by improved headline earnings at Modikwa Mine, the iron ore division and the manganese ore operations which
were partly offset by a headline loss at Nkomati Mine.

Basic earnings for the period were R1 306 million (1H F2018: R1 753 million) and include an impairment of the Nkomati
Mine assets of R892 million after tax. Basic earnings per share therefore decreased from 922 cents to 682 cents.

The Nkomati Mine impairment is discussed in further detail on page 48 and a reconciliation of basic earnings to headline
earnings is provided in note 12 to the financial statements.

US Dollar prices realised for all commodities, except platinum, were higher and the 1H F2019 average Rand/US Dollar
was R14.19/US$ (1H F2018: R13.39/US$). For reporting purposes, the closing exchange rate at 31 December 2018 was
R14.38/US$ (31 December 2017: R12.29/US$).

Sales from continuing operations (which are consolidated into ARM's revenue) were marginally lower in 1H F2019 at R4 147
million (1H F2018: R4 174 million). Sales for ARM Ferrous increased by 17% to R7 999 million (1H F2018: R6 816 million).

The average gross profit margin was 19% for both reporting periods. The gross profit margins achieved at each operating
division may be ascertained from the detailed segment reports provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

ARM's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations, excluding special
items and income from associates and joint ventures, were 11% lower at R889 million (1H F2018: R999 million). The
change was largely as a result of a lower EBITDA contribution from Nkomati Mine (of R267 million) and ARM Corporate (of
R113 million) which was partially offset by a higher EBITDA contribution from Modikwa Mine (of R243 million).

The income from joint venture (ARM Ferrous) was R2 121 million (1H F2018: R1 765 million) after special items and is 20%
higher than the corresponding period.

The detailed and expanded segmental contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

ARM Ferrous - Headline earnings at ARM Ferrous were 21% higher at R2 127 million (1H F2018: R1 765 million). The
iron ore division delivered a 41% increase in headline earnings as average realised US Dollar prices for export iron ore
increased by 15%, driven by a combination of higher fines market prices, increased lump premiums and a higher lump
to fines ratio in iron ore sales volumes. The manganese ore operations delivered a 41% increase in headline earnings,
however, a 62% decrease in headline earnings at the manganese alloy operations (mainly comprising of Cato Ridge Works
and Alloys) resulted in the manganese division's overall earnings increasing by 5%.

ARM Platinum - Interventions implemented at Modikwa Mine to improve the operational and financial performance of
the mine are yielding results. These, together with a higher Rand basket price and an improved purchase of concentrate
agreement (as concluded in F2018 for three years from 1 January 2017), contributed to the R173 million headline earnings
reported by Modikwa Mine (1H F2018: R36 million). Two Rivers Mine continues to experience grade challenges as a
result of complexity of the ore body. This impacted both PGM and chrome volumes in the six months under review. The
mine reported headline earnings of R180 million (1H F2018: R173 million). Nkomati Mine recorded a headline loss of
R186 million mainly as a result of reduced nickel and by-product sales volumes together with above inflation cost increases.
ARM has completed its review given the mine's operational challenges, cash support that could be required from the
partners and the relatively limited (eight year) life of the open pit mine. Part of this review indicated a decline in head grade,
resulting in decreased metal output, the mine's inability to generate sufficient cash to meet operational requirements and
an increase in production costs.

We are in discussions with our partner on the future of the mine.

ARM Coal - Headline earnings for ARM Coal were 59% lower at R65 million (1H F2018: R160 million) and include a
re-measurement loss of R206 million on the revaluation of the loans between ARM, ARM Coal and Glencore which were
restructured in F2018. The coal operations delivered improved operational cash flows which has resulted in accelerated
loan repayments. The value of the restructured loans is revalued at each reporting period to reflect the net present value
of the expected loan repayment profile. Where the repayment profile is expected to accelerate compared to expectations
in the previous reporting period, a re-measurement loss is recognised.

Although ARM Corporate EBITDA was lower, headline loss by R158 million improved by R42 million compared to the
corresponding period. EBITDA was lower mainly due to a R62 million increase in research and development costs.
Headline earnings were higher mainly due to R93 million lower tax expense.

A detailed segmental headline earnings contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

*  1H F2019 includes a re-measurement loss of R206 million at ARM Coal and a re-measurement loss of R59 million at ARM
   Corporate on the valuation of the loans between ARM, ARM Coal and Glencore which were restructured in F2018.

 These results have been achieved in conjunction with ARM's partners at the various operations, Anglo American Platinum
 Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk Nickel Africa (Pty) Ltd
 (Norilsk) and Glencore South Africa (Glencore).

 The interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
 Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

 Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

Capital allocation guiding principles

Cash generated from operations was R781 million (1H F2018: R 940 million) and is reported after a R570 million increase
in working capital requirements outflow (1H F2018: R471 million). Dividends received from the ARM Ferrous joint venture
were R 1 750 million (1H F2018: R1 000 million).

Net cash outflow from investing activities of R 707 million was recorded (1H F2018: R160 million inflow) mainly as a result
of a R211 million investment in Harmony in July 2018, as previously reported, while 1H F2018 included R741 million
proceeds on disposal of the Lubambe Mine received in December 2017.

The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was R8 million for the year (1H F2018: R359 million increase).

Capital expenditure to maintain operations was 16% lower at R505 million for the period (1H F2018: R603 million).
Attributable capital expenditure at the Assmang joint venture was 70% higher at R946 million (1H F2018: R558 million).

Further details on the Assmang capital expenditure are included in the ARM Ferrous section on page 50.

Total borrowings repaid were R167 million (1H F2018: R325 million).

Gross debt at the end of the period was 29% lower than the corresponding period at R2 132 million (31 December 2017:
R3 021 million). This was mainly due to R390 million reduction in ARM Corporate and R461 million reduction in ARM Coal
debt. There was no debt at ARM Ferrous at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: nil).

ARM Company's Revolving Credit Facility expired on 24 August 2018. A new facility for R2 250 million which matures in
August 2021 was finalised on improved terms and conditions. This facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2018.

Dividends paid to ARM shareholders in October 2018 were R1 433 million (1H F2018: R1 236 million).

At 31 December 2018 cash and cash equivalents were R3 297 million (31 December 2017: R1 919 million), details of which
are reflected in note 9 to the financial statements. This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM
Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R2 186 million (31 December 2017: R3 198 million).

Net cash at 31 December 2018 of R1 165 million (31 December 2017: R1 102 million net debt).

Assets

The consolidated ARM total assets of R34.7 billion (1H F2018: R32.5 billion) include ARM's investment in Harmony which
was R1 882 million as at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: R1 444 million). Harmony's share price was R25.20 per
share at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: R22.69 per share, 30 June 2018: R21.22 per share).

Nkomati Impairment

As at 31 December 2018, an impairment loss of the Nkomati Mine cash generating unit was recognised, largely due to a
combination of:

- A decline in head grade, resulting in decreased metal output;
- An inability to generate sufficient cash to meet operational requirements; and
- An increase in production costs.

ARM's attributable share of the impairment loss amounted to R1 166 million before tax and R892 million after tax. The
difference between the pre and post-tax charge does not correspond with the South African Corporate tax rate of 28%, as
the tax charge on the impairment was limited to the deferred tax liability available for off-set on the Statement of financial
position. Management did not recognise a deferred tax asset as the recoverability of such an asset is uncertain in the
foreseeable future.

The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in
terms of International Financial Reporting Standards.

A pre-tax discount rate of 20.2% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and
exchange rate assumptions:

                                                                      2H F2019     F2020     F2021     F2022   Long-term

Operating safely

We are committed to creating and maintaining a safe work environment for all our employees. There were no fatalities at
any of the ARM operations in the period under review. The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) improved to 0.36 in 1H
F2019 from 0.41 per 200 000 man-hours for 1H F2018. 40 Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) were recorded compared to 51 in the
corresponding period. All the South African ARM operations held annual Safety Days in alignment with the Mineral Council
South Africa's National Safety Day.

Safety achievements in the period under review:

-    At the annual Mine Safe Conference held in August 2018, Beeshoek Mine was awarded the first prize for ""best improved
     safety performance"" and second prize for ""best safety performance in class"". The mine recorded 17 000 fatality-free
     production shifts on 18 September 2018, an accomplishment that took 15 years and 6 months to achieve. In addition,
     Beeshoek Mine was announced second runner-up for the Best Performing Surface Mine in the annual Northern Cape
     Mine Managers' Association on 23 November 2018.
-    As at 31 December 2018, Cato Ridge Works has been lost time injury free for 18 months.
-    As at December 2018, Nkomati Mine has been lost time injury free for 8 months.

Safety figures and statistics in this report are presented on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations which are
managed by ARM's partner.

Changes to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as disclosed in the Integrated
Annual Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2018, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the
operations. An updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Statement will be issued in the Company's F2019
Integrated Annual Report.

ARM Ferrous

Headline earnings were 21% higher at R2 127 million (1H F2018: R1 765 million) driven by a 41% and 26% increase in
headline earnings at the iron ore and manganese ore operations, respectively. Headline earnings for the alloy operations
(including Sakura Ferroalloys) were 62% lower, impacted by reduced sales volumes and above inflation cost increases.

Capital expenditure

Assmang capital expenditure (on 100% basis) increased by 70% to R1 978 million (1H F2018: R1 166 million).

Capital expenditure at the Iron ore division (on a 100% basis) increased from R609 million to R1 028 million mainly due to:

- Commencement of capitalised waste stripping in the Bruce Pit;
- Increased capitalised waste stripping at the Khumani King Pit and Beeshoek Village Pit; and
- Fleet and mining equipment replacement at Khumani Mine as part of the life cycle of the machinery.

The Manganese division's capital expenditure increased by 71% to R950 million (1H F2018: R557 million). R713 million
of the capital expenditure related to the modernisation and optimisation of the Gloria Mine within the Black Rock Mine
as approved in F2018. The Gloria Mine decline shaft shut-down commenced in November 2018 and is on schedule
for completion in April 2019. Site establishment of the civils and earthworks contractor has also commenced while the
design work for the new Gloria Plant has been completed. The capital approved for Gloria Mine will enable Black Rock
Mine flexibility to produce different product specifications (from high to medium grade) as the ability to deliver different
specification products to customers has become a key differentiator. In addition, production capacity at Black Rock Mine
will increase to approximately 5 million tonnes per annum with any ramp up to be closely synchronised with Transnet rail
availability.

Cato Ridge Works' capital expenditure (on 100% basis) was R20 million compared to R12 million in 1H F2018.

Iron ore division

Assmang's average realised US Dollar prices for export iron ore were 12% higher at US$69/t (1H F2018: US$59/t) (on an
FOB basis). This increase in realised prices was driven mainly by an increase in lump premiums together with higher lump
to fines ratio in iron ore sales (58% compared to 52% in 1H F2018).

Total iron ore sales volumes were 4% lower at 8.8 million tonnes (1H F2018: 9.1 million). Of the 8.8 million tonnes sold
7.2 million tonnes were exported (1H F2018: 7.4 million tonnes) and 1.6 million tonnes were sold locally (1H F2018:
1.7 million tonnes).

Production volumes decreased by 4% mainly due to water supply challenges at Khumani Mine. Assmang continues to
engage with the Sedibeng Water Board to address challenges experienced on the Vaal Gamagara Water System and
is part of a collaborative team effort to recapitalise and upgrade the water system to ensure sufficient capacity and the
sustainability of the system. The financial impact of possible adjustments to the capital user charge, as a result of the
upgrade of the Vaal Gamagara Water System, remains uncertain.

In addition, availability challenges were experienced on the Sishen Saldanha Export Channel. In December 2018 a truck
carrying an abnormal load which exceeded the bridge height collided into a railway bridge, causing structural damage to
the bridge and the railway line above. Train movements in both directions were therefore impacted. Transnet responded
by putting in place a temporary bridge during the construction of a new bridge, which was delivered two days earlier than
scheduled.

On-mine unit production costs at Khumani Mine increased by 8% to R218//t compared to R201/t in 1H F2018 mainly due
to the 5% decline in production volumes and above inflation increases in diesel and labour costs. Beeshoek Mine achieved
a 1% reduction in on-mine unit production costs.

Manganese ore division

Manganese ore sales volumes increased by 3% from 1.56 million tonnes in 1H F2018 to 1.61 million tonnes in 1H F2019. Of
the 1.61 million tonnes sold 1.53 million tonnes were exported. Production volumes at Black Rock Mine decreased by 7%
mainly as a result of the planned shutdown of the Gloria Mine conveyor together the commissioning of new infrastructure
at the mine as part of the Black Rock Project.

Black Rock on-mine unit production costs increased by 14% from R534 per tonne in 1H F2018 to R608 per tonne in
1H F2019. The main reasons for this above-inflation increase were higher labour costs and fuel prices, as well as lower
production volumes as discussed above.

Total manganese alloy sales volumes increased by 1% to 164 thousand tonnes (1H F2018: 162 thousand tonnes).
Manganese alloy production at Sakura increased from 122 thousand tonnes to 129 thousand tonnes.

At Cato Ridge (Works and Alloys) production volumes were lower by 1% to 68 thousand tonnes, however, sales volumes
were 9% higher at 62 thousand tonnes (1H F2018: 57 thousand tonnes).

Logistics:

Assmang's manganese ore export volumes are fully contracted with Transnet for F2019, F2020 and F2021 through both
the Port Elizabeth and Saldanha export channels. In terms of the long-term allocation from F2022 onwards, Assmang is
in ongoing negotiations with Transnet to synchronise the ramp up of Black Rock Mine with the medium and longer-term
(MECA2 and MECA3) Transnet capacity process.

Transnet is expected to run short on deliveries for Assmang's export contractual commitments for manganese ore and
iron ore for F2019, due to availability challenges on the Sishen Saldanha Export Channel. Management have introduced
alternative modes of transport to achieve sales targets by the end of F2019.


 The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese and
 chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum's attributable headline earnings decreased by 26% to R167 million (1H F2018: R226 million), mainly due to
a headline loss reported for Nkomati Mine. Modikwa Mine's attributable headline earnings improved due to an increase in
metal prices combined with a reduction in unit costs. As previously reported, the concentrate offtake agreements for both
Modikwa and Nkomati mines were renegotiated with temporary improvement to the agreement terms and conditions. This
impacted positively on Modikwa Mine's headline earnings and partly offset the headline loss at Nkomati Mine.

Lower PGM production at Modikwa Mine (2%), Two Rivers Mine (10%) and Nkomati Mine (23%) resulted in ARM Platinum's
PGM ounces (on a 100% basis) reducing by 9% to 384 849 6E ounces (1H F2018: 422 104 6E ounces).

Nkomati Mine's nickel production decreased by 2% to 6 624 tonnes (1H F2018: 6 733 tonnes) as a result of a 5% decrease
in the average concentrator recovery due to Very Low Grade (VLG) MMZ stock pile material being milled.

Capital expenditure

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on a 100% basis) slightly increased to R655 million (1H F2018:
R644 million).

Capital expenditure at Modikwa Mine (on 100% basis) decreased by 30% to R152 million (1H F2018: R218 million). Of
the capital spent in 1H F2018, 31% is associated with the North Shaft Project and 6% with the South Shaft Project, (both
of which are discussed further under Projects in this section). Thirty-nine percent of the capital expenditure was spent on
fleet refurbishment and critical spares.

Of the R247 million capital spent at Two Rivers in 1H F2019, 35% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment.
The deepening of the Main and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 55% of
the total capital expenditure.

Nkomati Mine's 1H F2019 capital expenditure of R256 million (on 100% basis) was mainly for capitalised waste stripping
which increased by 97% to R225 million as a result of accelerated waste stripping in order to expose higher grade MMZ ore.

Two Rivers Mine

Attributable headline earnings at Two Rivers Mine increased by 4% to R180 million (1H F2018: R173 million). A 3%
decrease in tonnes milled and a 5% reduction in head grade, led to PGMs produced declining by 10% to 160 971 6E
ounces (1H F2018: 178 702 6E ounces). In addition, chrome concentrate sales volumes declined by 10% to 104 555
tonnes as a result of a lower chrome yield, a direct consequence of the lower PGM grade. This, combined with a 24%
decline in the Rand chrome price from July 2018 to December 2018, resulted in chrome cash operating profit declining
by 23% to R79 million (1H F2018: R102 million).

Continued complexity in the ore body resulted in lower grades delivered to the plant. The decline in head grade is largely
attributable to geologically-induced dilution associated with high variability in the UG2 Reef on the Southern extent of the Main
Decline. This has resulted in the adaption of mining cuts to suit the highly variable split reef which results in lower grades.
There is also limited face length flexibility in obtaining the optimal blend of ore from split reef and normal reef sources at Main
Decline. An accelerated sinking programme is under execution to address the face length flexibility constraint. It is planned
to sink Main Decline and establish an additional two levels per year going forward, which will improve the mining mix blend.
Areas of thick, lower grade split reef are expected to continue affecting the overall mining grade negatively at Main Decline
for the next 12 months, resulting in overall mining grades of between 3.50 and 3.60 6E grams per tonne. Undercutting of the
thick internal waste within the split reef is also undertaken wherever practically possible.

Unit production costs on a Rand per tonne milled basis were well controlled increasing by 2% to R709 per tonne
(1H F2018: R694 per tonne). The Rand per PGM ounce, however, increased by 10% to R7 338 per 6E ounce (1H F2018:
R6 655 per 6E ounce), as a direct result of the decline in grade. There was a 16 310 tonne increase in the UG2 Run-of-
Mine stockpile to a total of 267 973 tonnes of ore as at 31 December 2018.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa Mine achieved attributable headline earnings of R173 million (1H F2018: R36 million). Tonnes milled remained
flat, but a 2% decrease in head grade resulted in PGM production decreasing by 2% to 171 704 6E ounces (1H F2018:
175 899 6E ounces). The decline in head grade was mainly due to a thinner main seam mined near challenging geological
structures and in-stope dilution caused by adverse hanging wall conditions. The above conditions are expected to improve
over the next two years as mining moves closer to the shaft barrels away from the geological structures causing dilution
and as South 2 Shaft deepens.

Unit production costs decreased by 3%, to R8 560 per 6E PGM ounce (1H F2018: R8 832 per 6E PGM ounce) and were
5% lower on a Rand per tonne basis at R1 189 per tonne (1H F2018: R1 258 per tonne).

South 2 Shaft phase 1 achieved on average 47 thousand tonnes per month for the past six months. It is anticipated that
steady state production rates of 50 thousand tonnes will be achieved in F2019.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine reported an attributable headline loss of R186 million (1H F2018: R17 million headline earnings) for the
period under review as spot nickel prices reduced from US$14 940 on 1 July 2018 to US$10 595 on 31 December
2018, resulting in a negative mark-to-market adjustment of R158 million. In the corresponding period, the nickel spot price
increased from US$9 375/t on 1 July 2017 to US$12 645/t on 31 December 2017, resulting in a positive mark-to-market
of R308 million during that period. Lower nickel sales volumes (3 532 tonnes compared to 4 178 tonnes) also contributed
to the headline loss.

The poor financial performance was intensified by lower chrome concentrate sales (160 769 tonnes compared to 198 928
tonnes) combined with a 36% decrease in the average Rand chrome price from July 2018 to December 2018.

Nkomati Mine's total tonnes milled increased by 1% to 4.12 million tonnes (1H F2018: 4.08 million tonnes). Nickel
production volumes, however, decreased to 2% to 6 624 tonnes (1H F2018: 6 733 tonnes). The main reasons for this were:

-      Pit 3 mining operations remain constrained as a result of the historical insufficient waste stripping, resulting in
       insufficient MMZ ore availability during the reporting period;

-      As a result of insufficient ore supply, higher than expected processing of Very Low Grade (VLG) MMZ stockpile
       material (approximately 0,8 million tonnes during the period) was used to supplement the shortfall of MMZ ore to
       ensure that both mills operate at maximum capacity. The VLG MMZ material had an average nickel grade of 0.18%,
       which resulted in the average mill feed grade of 0.27% nickel for the period.

The mine revaluated of design parameters for the saprolite zones of the pit's Western high wall and design changes were
implemented to improve structural stability of the soft weathered zone. This has resulted in more stable high wall conditions
and hence improved mining efficiencies and volumes were achieved during the review period.

Nkomati Mine had 23 thousand tonnes of nickel concentrate in stock as at 31 December 2018 due to shipping delays.

Nkomati Mine's on-mine unit production cost (excluding capitalised waste stripping) was 11% higher at R346/t
(1H F2018: R311/t) as a result of above inflation increase in mining costs, diesel price, maintenance costs and tyres.
C1 unit cash cost net of by-products (including capitalised waste stripping cost) was 59% higher at US$7.87/lb (1H F2018:
US$4.95/lb) of nickel produced. The increase in C1 unit cash costs was due to reduced by-product credits, increased
mining cost and lower nickel units produced. Waste stripping costs of R225 million (1H F2018: R114 million) were
capitalised during the period.

Projects

Modikwa Mine

In order to maintain the current production profile and eventually ramp-up, the operation initiated the North Shaft Deepening
Project and the South 2 Shaft Project. The current status of these projects are detailed below:

- Deepening of North Shaft - Entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 6 to Level 9 thereby establishing two
  new mining levels. The 9 Level mining development and equipping is on track to meet the revised schedule; anticipated
  handover for the ore transfer system is F2020.

- Sinking of South 2 Shaft - Scope included the establishment of a decline shaft system South of the current South
  Shaft Infrastructure. The first phase of the project is expected to enhance mining flexibility while also contributing to
  the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has been completed and is expected to take the
  production capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by F2019.

  The ARM Platinum division comprises three operating mines:

  -   Modikwa - ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities hold an
      8.5% effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Anglo American Platinum.

  -   Two Rivers - an ARM subsidiary in which ARM has a 54% shareholding and Implats 46%. ARM's shareholding in
      Two Rivers increased from 51% to 54% effective from 8 November 2017, when Two Rivers' amended mining right,
      including the mining rights transferred to it, was executed by the Department of Mineral Resources.

  -   Nkomati - a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.

ARM Coal

ARM Coal attributable headline earnings decreased by 59% to R65 million (1H F2018: R160 million). Headline earnings
were negatively impacted by re-measurement losses of R206 million as discussed in the financial results overview section.
Interest expense reduced by 45% to R141 million (1H F2018: R257 million) due to the ARM Coal debt restructuring. The
notional interest together with the re-measurement loss, are not tax deductible, resulting in a substantial increase in the tax
charge for the period under review.

Seaborne coal prices were positively impacted by an increase in demand from India and China, slightly offset by a reduction
in demand from Europe. The impact of the higher US Dollar prices was enhanced by the weakening of the average realised
Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. Realised Rand prices for export coal increased by 15% from R1 000 per tonne in 1H F2018
to R1 154 per tonne in 1H F2019.

More than 80% of the export volumes at GGV Mine were high quality coal while only approximately 38% of PCB exports
were high quality. This resulted in PCB's average received export price (US$77.69/t) being lower compared to GGV Mine
(US$87.18/t).

ARM attributable saleable tonnes produced of 2.51 million tonnes were 3% lower than the 2.59 million tonnes produced
in 1H F2018.

Goedgevonden (GGV) Mine

Average received export US Dollar prices increased by 9% compared to 1H F2018. The impact of the higher prices was
enhanced by a 6% weakening of the Rand versus the US Dollar. Export sales volumes was 13% lower compared to 1H
F2018 due to inclement weather causing port closures at Richards Bay Coal Terminal, as well as an underperformance
by Transnet Freight Rail. This resulted in an increase in coal stockpiles at GGV Mine. Attributable export revenue of R458
million in 1H F2019 was in line with 1H F2018.

An increase in local sales resulted in total attributable revenue increasing by 4.8% in 1H F2019 compared to 1H F2018.

Saleable production at GGV Mine was 9% higher than 1H F2018 due to an increase in plant feed resulting from a steady
improvement in ROM production.

On-mine unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 8.6% to R342. The increase was largely due to above
inflationary increases in diesel costs.

Cash operating profit of R246 million was 3% higher than the previous period, however, GGV Mine reported a headline
loss of R7 million (1H F2018: R35 million headline earnings) mainly due to re-measurement loss of R48 million and an
increase in tax.

Participating Coal Business (PCB)

PCB attributable cash operating profit increased by 23% to R626 million (1H F2018: R511 million). Revenue increased by
7% compared to 1H F2018 largely as a result of a 9% increase in US Dollar coal prices together with a 7% weakening of
the Rand versus the US Dollar. This was partially offset by a 6% reduction in overall sales volumes.

Unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 18% from R334 per tonne in 1H F2018 to R395 per tonne in
1H F2019. The increase in unit costs is largely due to a decline in saleable production and above inflation increases in
diesel costs. Saleable production was 9% lower compared to 1H F2018.

The PCB operation was negatively impacted by industrial action in July 2018. ROM production was further impacted by
the occurrence of sinkholes arising from old underground mined areas currently being mined at the Tweefontein Mine.
Technical feasibilities have been performed and the mine is in the process of adopting a mining technique which will
address possible instabilities in advance.

Headline earnings attributable to ARM was R72 million. (1H F2018: R125 million), and includes a fair value loss of
R152 million.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)

Harmony reported a 93% decrease in headline earnings from R990 million to R73 million for 1H F2019 mainly due to
translation loss of R180 million on US Dollar denominated debt at 31 December 2018 and lower derivative gains recognised
in 1H F2019 of R20 million (1H F2018: R337 million). Headline earnings per share were 14 cents per share compared with
224 cents per share in 1H F2018.

Revenue increased by 40% mainly due to the inclusion of the Moab Khotsong operations (R2.7 billion) and Hidden Valley's
production (R1.7 billion increase) for the full six-month period to 31 December 2018. The average gold price received
declined by 1% to R572 898/kg (1H F2018: R580 672/kg).

Gold production increased by 34% to 23 359kg (1H F2018: 17 418kg) and was significantly boosted by the acquisition of
Moab Khotsong Mine (effective 1 March 2018) and by Hidden Valley Mine, which achieved commercial levels of production
in June 2018.

Harmony's all-in sustaining unit costs increased by 6% to R528 265/kg mainly as a result of lower production at Tshepong
Mine, deferred stripping at Hidden Valley Mine and increased capital development expenditure at the Tshepong, Joel,
Doornkop and Target 1 mines.

As announced on 11 December 2018, the Wafi-Golpu Joint Venture (WGJV) signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) which affirmed the parties' intent to proceed with the Wafi-
Golpu Project, subject to finalisation of the permitting process and Harmony and Newcrest Mining Limited board approvals.
The MOU also re-affirmed the intention of the parties to complete the permitting process and achieve the grant of a Special
Mining Lease (SML) by 30 June 2019.

The Harmony investment is reflected on the ARM Statement of Financial Position at R1 882 million as at 31 December
2018 (31 December 2016: R1 444 million). Harmony's share price was R25.20 per share at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: R22.69 per share, 30 June 2018: R21.22 per share). Gains and losses are recognised in equity (other
comprehensive income) and will not be reclassified through profit or loss. Dividends from Harmony are recognised in the
ARM Income Statement on the last day of registration following dividend declaration.

Harmony's results for interim period ended 31 December 2018 can be viewed on Harmony's website at
www.harmony.co.za.

 ARM owns 14.03% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Events after the reporting date

Events after the reporting date are set out in note 20 to the financial statements. Since 31 December 2018, ARM received
a dividend of R1 500 million from Assmang.

On 6 February 2019 the Competition Commission of South Africa approved the acquisition by ARM of the Machadodorp
Works business. The acquisition includes the assets and assumption of certain liabilities relating to the business. The
purchase price amounted to R130 million which will be adjusted for cash amounts received and paid during the period
1 January 2017 to 28 February 2019. Since ARM owns 50% of Assmang, effectively 50% of the purchase price received
by Assmang is attributable to ARM. These assets will be used for research and development purposes in the fields of
alternative smelting and extraction technologies.

Outlook

US Dollar commodity prices remain well supported despite concerns about a potential slowdown in China's growth.
China's focussed legislation and environmental restrictions in addressing pollution concerns continued to drive demand
and provided price support for the high-quality bulk metals that we produce. Supply disruptions in some bulk metals are
also contributing to commodity price strength in the short-term.

In the medium to long-term, China's shift to high-quality commodities and closure of high-cost and inefficient mines appears
to be structural and together with reduced investment in expansionary capital across a number of commodities globally, is
expected to provide price support for the commodities that we produce.

We are pleased to have moved towards improved regulatory certainty in the South African mining industry as evidenced
by the finalisation of Mining Charter III. This has reduced one of ARM's top 10 risks namely ""Uncertainty regarding policy
change in South Africa"". We anticipate the same level of engagement in effecting the Implementation Guidelines to Mining
Charter III which were published in December 2018.

We have seen an increased level of business interruption due to community unrest in communities where our mines are
located. While we have dedicated resources at executive and operational level for stakeholder engagement, along with
formal communication structures with surrounding communities, we expect that there is likely to be an increase in these
interruptions, which are primarily related to service delivery, as we approach national elections in May 2019.

Mining remains a long-term capital-intensive industry and we are committed to investing in current operations to grow
the business and be well positioned to take advantage of ever-changing pricing cycles in the commodities we mine. We
continue to assess value-accretive external growth opportunities and prioritise our policy to pay dividends bi-annually in line
with our communicated capital allocation framework.

ARM's financial position remains robust, allowing ARM to take advantage of future growth opportunities and realign existing
non-performing businesses where required.

The Board has approved and declared an interim dividend of 400 cents per share (gross) in respect of the six months
ended 31 December 2018 (1H F2018: 250 cents per share). The amount to be paid is approximately R888 million.

This declaration is consistent with ARM's commitment, as a globally competitive company, to pay dividends while retaining
the ability to fund efficiency improvements and sustaining production.

      IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

      IFRS 9 is effective for ARM from 1 July 2018. ARM has opted to apply the modified approach, whereby opening retained income
      at 1 July 2018 is adjusted and the figures for F2018 were not restated.
       
      The following financial instruments were impacted by the implementation of IFRS 9:
 
      Equity investments (other than investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures)
  
      Listed investments

      ARM continues to classify the listed shares in Harmony as fair value through other comprehensive income, whereby fair value
      gains and losses are recognised in equity (other comprehensive income) and will not be reclassified through profit or loss.
 
      Unlisted investments

      Previously, unlisted investments were measured at cost. Under IFRS 9, these investments in equities should be measured at
      fair value.

      Unlisted investments subject to adjustment - Investment in Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT).
 
      This investment is held by ARM Coal which is a jointly-controlled operation of ARM and Glencore Operations South Africa
      Proprietary Limited (GOSA), and hence ARM's share of the investment is recognised in the ARM company financial statements.
      Up until 30 June 2018, this investment was carried at cost.

      For 1H F2019, the fair value of this investment was determined by calculating the present value of the future wharfage cost
      savings by being a shareholder in RBCT as opposed to the wharfage payable by non-shareholders. The cumulative fair value
      adjustment is R76 million, of which R72 million relates to prior periods (adjusted against retained earnings), and R4 million
      relates to 1H F2019. The current period's fair value adjustment is accounted for through profit or loss.
      
      This is a level 3 valuation in terms of IFRS 7 and 13. The fair value is most sensitive to the wharfage cost.

      Trade and other receivables (including loans advanced)
      
      Previously, receivables that contained provisional pricing features linked to commodity prices and exchange rates have been
      designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss because of the embedded derivative which would otherwise
      require separation. Under IFRS 9, such instruments continue to be measured on the same basis. Other receivables, including
      loans advanced, continue to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9. The impairment model for amortised cost financial
      assets under IFRS 9 requires the recognition of expected losses, rather than only incurred losses. The expected credit loss
      model had no material impact on ARM's results.
      
      The long-term loans to ARM Coal, Glencore and PCB continue to be accounted for at amortised cost.
      
      Non-current liabilities
      
      An interest free non-current liability owed by ARM Mining Consortium Ltd to Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd (Anglo American
      Platinum Ltd) was impacted by IFRS 9, resulting in a cumulative fair value adjustment of R19 million, of which R23 million relates
      to prior periods (fair value gain recorded against retained earnings), and R4 million loss recorded in statement of profit or loss.

                                                                                                                                     1H F2019

      IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
      
      IFRS 15 became applicable to ARM for the financial year commencing 1 July 2018. ARM has selected the full retrospective
      approach, requiring comparative years to be restated. The impact of IFRS 15 has been assessed based on the operating
      segments of the group.
      
      IFRS 15 replaces the risks and rewards principle that was applicable under IAS 18.
      
      Revenue under IFRS 15 is recognised under the following five step model:
      
      - Identify the contract with customers;
      - Identify the performance obligations;
      - Determine the transaction price;
      - Allocate the transaction price; and
      - Recognise revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.
      
      The impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on the segments in ARM:
      
      ARM Corporate
      
      ARM provides management services to operations within the group. ARM invoices and recognises revenue on a monthly basis
      using the actual results of the component meaning no uncertainty surrounding the transaction price. The adoption of IFRS 15
      therefore had no impact on the revenue recognition in ARM Corporate.
      
      ARM Ferrous

      The change that had the most significant impact was on sales with cost, insurance and freight (CIF)/cost and freight (CFR) Inco
      terms. Sales with CIF/CFR Inco terms result in two distinct performance obligations -namely the supply of the commodity and
      shipping of the commodity.
      
      IFRS 15 had no impact on the equity accounted earnings of Assmang. However the composition of sales has changed as
      reflected below:

      ARM Platinum
      
      The following areas are impacted:
      
      Assay estimates
      
      Commodity sales are subject to assay estimates, which means that the transaction price is variable. IFRS 15 constrains the
      estimate of variable consideration recognised such that amounts are only included in the calculation of revenue where it is highly
      probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty relating to final assay/quality is subsequently
      resolved, i.e. finalisation of the sale by the customer. The assay differences are typically not significant at approximately 1% of
      commodity sales revenue and therefore management did not change the approach followed under IAS 18. The adjustments
      to revenue arising from assay adjustments will continue to be recognised consistently as per the prior accounting treatment,
      i.e. included in revenue from contracts with customers.
      
      Provisional pricing
      
      Commodity sales are subject to provisional pricing features such as commodity prices and foreign exchange rates which are
      only finalised sometime after transfer of the commodities.
      
      On initial recognition, revenue is recognised at fair value. The revenue and related trade receivable is then re-measured at every
      subsequent month-end until the sale has been finalised. The sale is finalised at average commodity prices and exchange rate
      for the month preceding the month of invoicing.
      
      Previously, the changes in the fair value were recognised as part of revenue. These changes arise from re-measuring the
      related trade receivable to fair value at every month-end.
      
      The related trade receivables will continue to be measured at fair value under IFRS 9, which was adopted at the same time as
      IFRS 15. The resultant changes in fair value are not within the scope of IFRS 15, since they are re-measurements of a financial
      asset. Accordingly, they are not subject to the IFRS 15 variable consideration constraint. IFRS 9 requires the full change in fair
      value to be recognised.

      Since the changes in fair value relate to sales, management believes it is appropriate to continue to present such fair value
      changes as revenue (albeit not 'revenue from contracts with customers'). The revenue note disclosure disaggregates total
      revenue such that 'revenue from contracts with customers' is distinguished from these fair value adjustments.
      
      Penalties and treatment charges
      
      Adjustments, in the form of penalties and treatment charges, are made to the pricing to the extent the commodities sold do not
      meet certain specifications and as part of the terms of the various off-take agreement. As a result, the IFRS 15 constraint on
      variable consideration applies, which seeks to limit the amount of revenue recognised to guard against significant reversals in
      subsequent reporting periods.
      
      The following changes are applicable to the various ARM Platinum operations:
      
      Modikwa
      
      Chrome and moisture penalties were previously a deduction to revenue under IAS 18 and this is consistent with the requirements
      of IFRS 15, there is therefore no impact on Modikwa's revenue.
      
      Two Rivers Platinum
      
      Previously, grade, chrome and moisture penalties as well as smelting, refining and drying fees were classified as cost of sales.
      In terms of IFRS 15, the grade, chrome and moisture penalties as well as smelting, refining and drying fees are to be off-set
      against revenue.
      
      Nkomati
      
      Previously, arsenic and MGO penalties as well as transport recoveries were classified as cost of sales. In terms of IFRS 15, the
      arsenic and MGO penalties as well as transport recoveries will be debited against revenue.
      
      ARM Coal
      
      Management's assessment of domestic and export contracts against the requirements of IFRS 15 indicated that the adoption
      of IFRS 15 will have no impact.

      Group impact of IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers
      The impact on the group was as follows:
      
                                                                                                                 1H F2019   1H F 2018   F2018

      The Group does not intend early adopting any of the above amendments, standards or interpretations.
      ARM continuously evaluates the impact of these standards and amendments, the most prominent being IFRS 16 Leases. In
      summary the following are the current expectations in relation to IFRS 16.
      
      IFRS 16 - LEASES
      
      IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (i.e. for the
      financial year beginning 1 July 2019 for ARM).
      
      ARM does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
      
      IFRS 16 requirements will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the distinction
      between operating and finance leases is removed.
      
      Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The
      only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
      
      The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group's operating leases and embedded leases in service contracts.
      
      The Group has opted to adopt the modified retrospective transition approach such that the cumulative effect of transition to IFRS
      16 will be recognised in retained earnings and the comparative period will not be restated.
      
      ARM continues its assessment in determining the impact of IFRS 16. Management has appointed external advisors who are
      in the process of reviewing all potential contracts which could contain possible leases under IFRS 16. Once this review is
      completed, management would be in a position to quantify the potential impact on ARM's financial statements.
      
      Apart from IFRS 16 discussed above, the adoption of the other standards are not expected to have a significant effect on the
      Group Financial Statements.

      Nkomati Nickel Mine

      Notwithstanding the increase in the nickel price over the reporting period as at 31 December 2018, an impairment loss of the
      Nkomati Nickel Mine was recognised, largely as a result of:

      i) A decline in head grade, resulting in decreased metal output.
      ii) Inability to generate sufficient cash for operational requirements; and
      iii) An increase in production costs.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment charge amounted to R1 166 million before tax and R892 million after tax.

      The difference between the pre and post tax charge does not correspond with the South African Corporate tax rate of 28%, as
      the tax charge on the impairment was limited to the corresponding deferred tax liability available for off-set on the statement
      of financial position.  Management did not recognise a deferred tax asset as the recoverability of such an asset is uncertain in
      the foreseeable future.

      The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in terms
      of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      A pre-tax discount rate of 20.2% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and exchange
      rate assumptions.

19.   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

      The Assmang guarantee previously reported relating to the Sarawak Energy Board is now $109million. This guarantee includes an
      amount of $87million which is based in Malaysian Ringgit.
      AEL Mining Limited has instituted arbitration proceedings against Assmang, claiming an amount up to R381 million. Assmang
      is defending this matter.
      There have been no other significant changes in the contingent liabilities of the Group as disclosed since 30 June 2018
      integrated annual report.
      For a detailed disclosure on contingent liabilities, refer to ARM's integrated annual report for the year ended 30 June 2018
      available on the group's website (www.arm.co.za).

20.   EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE

      Since the period end ARM received a dividend of R1.5 billion from Assmang.
      On 6 February 2019, the Competition Commission of South Africa approved the acquisition by ARM of 100% of the Machadodorp
      Works business. The acquisition includes assets and assumption of certain liabilities relating to the business. The purchase
      price for the business amounted to R130 million. Since ARM owns 50% of Assmang, effectively R65 million of the purchase
      price received by Assmang is attributable to ARM. The purchase price will be adjusted for cash amounts received and paid
      during the period 1 January 2017 and 28 February 2019. For this reason we cannot disclose all the requirements of IFRS 3 -
      Business Combinations (refer note 2.7).
      No other significant events have occurred subsequent to the reporting date that could materially affect the reported results.

TRADING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31
DECEMBER 2018 (1H F2019)


In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.
 

ARM's headline earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2018
(1H F2019) were positively affected by an increase in average
realised US Dollar prices for most of the commodities that ARM
produces and a weaker average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange
rate. Headline earnings per share for 1H F2019 are therefore
expected to increase by between 8% and 15% to between 1 100 and
1 180 cents (1H F2018: 1 023 cents).


Basic earnings for 1H F2019 were negatively impacted by an
attributable impairment of Nkomati Mine of R892 million after tax
and are expected to reduce by between 24% and 30% to between 650
cents and 700 cents per share. Basic earnings per share for the
corresponding period (1H F2018) were 922 cents.


The financial information on which this trading statement is based
has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors
of ARM.

                                                                           
The Company's 1H F2019 financial results will be released on 1
March 2019.

CHANGE STATEMENT

Shareholders are advised that the audited 2018 Annual Financial
Statements contain the following modification to the reviewed
consolidated provisional financial statements for the year ended
30 June 2018 released on the Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) of
the JSE Limited on Friday, 7 September 2018.

Revenue in the Group statement of profit or loss has been
modified to disclose revenue from discontinued operations
separately. The revenue disclosed in the reviewed
consolidated provisional financial statements released on
SENS on 7 September 2018 included revenue from both continuing
and discontinued operations (i.e. total operations).

As required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
5, discontinued operations should be excluded from all items of
profit and loss and disclosed as a separate line.

Results from discontinued operations, as reported on 7 September
2018, have been correctly excluded from all other line items and
notes in the reviewed consolidated provisional financial statements, 
including the comparative amounts.

The revenue line disclosed in the Group statement of profit or loss
is for the purpose of compliance with IFRS. This amount

         -   is not additive in nature in the Group statement of
             profit or loss or any other statement or note; and
         -   has no impact on the Group's net profit or earnings per
             share calculations.

30 June 2018 is therefore as follows:

Salient features

-    Headline earnings increased by 51% to R4 814 million (F2017: R3 196 million), which includes a net
     fair value gain of R977 million. The net fair value gain is due to a change in the net present value
     of loan repayment cash flows as a result of restructuring the ARM coal debt. Excluding the net fair
     value gain, headline earnings are up 20% compared to F2017.

-    Headline earnings per share were 2 526 cents compared to 1 684 cents in F2017.

-    Final dividend of 750 cents declared. A maiden interim dividend of 250 cents per share was paid for
     the first half of the financial year (1H F2018). The cumulative dividend for F2018 is 1 000 cents per
     share (F2017: 650 cents per share).

-    Basic earnings were R4 562 million (F2017: R1 372 million) and include the net value gain of R977 million
     as a result of the restructuring of the ARM Coal debt. F2017 included attributable impairments of
     the Nkomati Mine and Modikwa Mine assets of R711 million and R734 million after tax and non-
     controlling interest, respectively.

-    US Dollar prices realised for most commodities were higher except for iron ore, platinum and
     chrome concentrate prices.

-    ARM and Glencore successfully concluded the restructuring of the ARM Coal debt which improves
     ARM and ARM Coal's obligations in terms of this debt.

-    The disposal of ARM and Vale's 80% interest in Lubambe Mine was completed on 22 December 2017.

Operational overview

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces headline earnings of R4 814 million for F2018 (F2017:
R3 196 million) which include a net fair value gain of R977 million as a result of the ARM Coal debt restructure.

*  F2018 includes a fair value gain of R1 210 million at ARM Coal and R233 million fair value loss at ARM Corporate resulting

** The F2017 Chrome Division headline earnings include R378 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% stake in the
   Dwarsrivier Mine.

These results have been achieved in conjunction with ARM's partners at the various operations; Anglo American
Platinum Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk
Nickel Africa (Pty) Ltd (Norilsk), Glencore Holdings South Africa (Pty) Ltd (Glencore), Vale S.A. (Vale) and
Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings (ZCCM-IH).

The provisional results for the year ended 30 June 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

ARM Ferrous headline earnings from continuing operations were 6% higher at R3 528 million compared to
R3 331 million in F2017. The division's total headline earnings were, however, 5% lower as the F2017 headline
earnings of R3 709 million included a non-recurring amount of R378 million related to the sale of ARM's effective
50% stake in Dwarsrivier Mine (which was disclosed as a discontinued operation). Headline earnings from the
manganese division were 64% higher as manganese ore sales volumes increased by 7% and average Rand
realised export manganese ore and manganese alloy prices increased by 18% and 20% respectively. Despite
achieving record sales volumes, the iron ore division's headline earnings were 24% lower at R1 672 million
(F2017: R2 187 million) mainly due to lower realised export iron ore prices.

ARM Platinum headline earnings increased by 20% to R420 million (F2017: R350 million) as Modikwa Mine
improved from a headline loss of R66 million in F2017 to headline earnings of R105 million. This was mainly due
to an improvement in the commercial terms of the Modikwa Mine purchase of concentrate agreement agreed
between ARM Mining Consortium and Anglo American Platinum for three years effective from 1 January 2017.
Two Rivers Mine headline earnings of R306 million (F2017: R325 million) were negatively affected by a decrease
in the mine's head grade as higher proportions of split reef were mined. Transfer of the Tamboti area mining right
to Two Rivers Mine has now been completed allowing access into the Tamboti area which over time will increase
mining flexibility and reduce the proportions of split reef being mined. Nkomati Mine reported an R82 million
reduction in headline earnings to R9 million as a decline in the mine's head grade (due to the milling of additional
Very Low Grade (VLG) stockpile material) resulted in lower nickel and by-product production volumes. An
amendment to the mine's concentrate offtake agreement was concluded with Metals Trade Overseas AG (MTO)
effective from 22 April 2018 which improves the terms and conditions of the offtake for the mine. Nkomati Mine
was also impacted by a lower chrome contribution as the mine's average realised US Dollar price for chrome
decreased by 50%.

All three ARM platinum operations faced grade decline in the financial year under review. A number of interventions
are being implemented to address this operational challenge. Modikwa Mine is introducing stope width control
measures particularly in the South 1 and South 2 shafts to reduce dilution and improve the grade. The mine head
grade is expected to return to normalised levels in the next financial year. At Two Rivers Mine, the levels of split
reef being mined is expected to reduce from F2020 when mining in the Tamboti area commences, improving the
mining flexibility. The Nkomati Mine grade is expected to improve from F2021 as more MMZ ore on the Western
section of the open pit is mined.

ARM Coal headline earnings were R1 485 million (F2017: R82 million). This includes an impact of R1 210 million
as a result of the restructuring of the ARM Coal debt concluded between ARM, ARM Coal, Glencore and Glencore
Operations South Africa (GOSA) as announced on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE on 25 June
2018. The impact of the restructuring on the F2018 ARM statement of comprehensive income is:

Corporate transactions

ARM Coal - ARM, ARM Coal, Glencore and GOSA successfully concluded the restructuring of ARM Coal debt
on 25 June 2018, with an effective date of 1 July 2017. Salient features of the restructuring include:

-    Debt owed by ARM Coal to GOSA will accrue interest at a rate of 0% compared to the previous rate, which
     was at prime, with effect from 1 July 2017 until 31 December 2029;
-    Final maturity date for all debt owed by ARM Coal to GOSA is extended to 31 December 2029;
-    All operating cash generated by GGV and the PCB operations, attributable to ARM and ARM Coal, shall
     be applied in repayment of the debt until the earlier of 31 December 2029 or full repayment of these loans;
-    GOSA's obligation (acting through the PCB) to repay ARM the amount of R700 million under the PCB
     shareholders loan from ARM was set off against ARM's obligation to pay GOSA (acting through the non-
     PCB) the amount of R700 million under the PCB revolving credit facility such that both loans have been fully
     and finally settled and discharged. This resulted in the PCB being indebted to the non-PCB in an amount of
     R700 million, which debt will rank pari passu to the remaining shareholder loan from ARM Coal to PCB, and;
-    All distributions to be received by ARM Coal in respect of the PCB shareholders loan, shall be utilised by
     ARM Coal in the settlement of its shareholder loans from GOSA and ARM. The payments to be received by
     GOSA and ARM, shall immediately be advanced back to ARM Coal through a shareholder's loan, on a 0%
     interest rate basis, and ARM Coal will utilise these funds to service the GGV debt.

Lubambe Mine - As reported in the 1H F2018 results, all conditions precedent for the disposal of Lubambe
Mine were completed on 22 December 2017. The purchase consideration received by ARM and Vale, directly
and indirectly, was US$97.10 million adjusted for:

-    Settlement of Lubambe Mine's general banking facility of US$26 million;
-    Payment of property transfer tax of US$10 million;
-    Payment of withholding tax of US$5 million; and
-    Reimbursement of funding provided to Lubambe Mine after 1 May 2017 of US$25 million.

The final proceeds of US$81 million were received by ARM and Vale in December 2017. Lubambe Mine, which
for F2018 reported a headline loss of R6 million, is disclosed as a discontinued operation in terms of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Two Rivers Mine - Further to the consent received by Two Rivers Mine in August 2017 to transfer the Tambot rights
to it and to have Two Rivers Mine's mining right amended accordingly, the amended mining right was executed.

This resulted in ARM's interest in Two Rivers Mine increasing from 51% to 54% from 9 November 2017.

Changes to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Reserves as disclosed in the Integrated
Annual Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2017, other than depletion due to continued mining activities
at the operations with the exception of:

-    Lubambe Mine Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves which are no longer reported by ARM after
     completion of the disposal of ARM's interest in December 2017.
-    Two Rivers Mine, where the transfer of Tamboti Platinum (Kalkfontein RE portion) was completed in November
     2017. The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves of the Kalkfontein RE portion will now be reported as
     part of Two Rivers Mine, and in terms of the agreement, ARM's attributable interest in Two Rivers Mine will
     increase from 51% to 54%.

An updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Statement will be issued in the Company's F2018 Integrated
Annual Report.

Financial commentary

Earnings

Headline earnings from continuing operations increased by 42% to R4 820 million for F2018 (F2017: R3 399 million).
This equates to headline earnings per share from continuing operations of R25.29 (F2017: R17.91 per share).
F2018 headline and basic earnings were positively impacted by a net fair value gain recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income of R977 million relating to the ARM Coal debt restructuring.

ARM's basic earnings from continuing operations for F2018 were R4 747 million (F2017: R1 431 million).
F2017 basic earnings were negatively impacted by the following special items:

-    An attributable impairment of the Nkomati Mine assets of R711 million after tax;
-    An attributable impairment of the Modikwa Mine assets of R734 million after tax and non-controlling interest; and
-    An attributable impairment loss of R373 million within the Assmang joint venture related to the sale of
     Dwarsrivier.

Additional special items are set out in note 6 to the financial statements and the reconciliation of basic earnings
to headline earnings is provided in note 7 to the financial statements.

Sales from continuing operations for the year increased by 2% to R8.35 billion (F2017: R8.16 billion).

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations, excluding
special items and income from associates and joint ventures, were R2 451 million (F2017: R922 million). This is
166% higher than F2017, largely as a result of a higher EBITDA contribution from the manganese division and
a net fair value gain recognised in ARM Coal from the debt restructuring. This was partially offset by unrealised
foreign exchange losses in the Corporate segment of R70 million (F2017: R270 million). Segmental EBITDA
margins are reflected in the graph on page 40.

Income from joint venture increased by 8% to R3 510 million (F2017: R3 265 million).

Exchange rate

The positive impact of higher realised US Dollar prices for most commodities was partially offset by the
strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar. The F2018 average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate of
R12.84/US$ was 6% stronger than the average of R13.60/US$ for F2017. For reporting purposes, the closing
exchange rate was R13.72/US$ (30 June 2017: R13.05/US$).

Cash

At 30 June 2018 cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations amounted to R3 291 million (F2017:
R1 488 million). This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang)
of R2 507 million (F2017: R3 165 million).

Cash generated from operations increased by R323 million to R1 934 million (F2017: R1 611 million) after a
R517 million increase in working capital (F2017: R274 million increase). The cash dividends received from the
Assmang joint venture amounted to R3 000 million (F2017: R2 488 million).

Cash spent on capital expenditure increased by R201 million to R1  150 million (F2017: R949 million).
Attributable capital expenditure at the Assmang joint venture increased to R1 474 million (F2017: R1 361 million).

Dividends of R1 236 million and R478 million were paid in October 2017 and April 2018, respectively
(F2017: R426 million) bringing the total dividend paid in F2018 to R1 714 million.

Debt

Total borrowings at 30 June 2018 were R2 296 million (F2017: R2 759 million). The decrease in total borrowings
is largely due to the ARM Coal debt restructuring.

There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either of the two reporting periods.

The consolidated net cash (overdrafts, short-term and long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) at
30 June 2018 amounted to R995 million (30 June 2017: R1 271 million net debt). Details of cash and borrowings
are set out in notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.

Assets

Consolidated ARM total assets of R34 billion (30 June 2017: R32 billion) include ARM's investment in Harmony of
R1 351 million (30 June 2017: R1 380 million) at a share price of R21.22 per share (30 June 2017: R21.68 per share).

Dividend

The Board declared a final dividend of 750 cents per share after the financial year-end. A maiden interim dividend
of 250 cents per share was declared and paid in the first half of the financial year, bringing the cumulative dividend
declared for F2018 is 1 000 cents per share (F2017: 650 cents per share).

Events after the reporting date

Harmony conducted a placing of new ordinary shares to qualifying investors to raise up to ZAR1.26 billion
(US$100 million) through an accelerated book-building process launched on 5 June 2018. As Harmony's strategic
black economic empowerment partner, ARM subscribed for shares necessary to maintain its shareholding of
approximately 14% post Harmony's placement of new ordinary shares. On 17 July, ARM subscribed to 11 032 623
shares at a total cost of R210.9 million (i.e. R19.12 per share) which resulted in ARM's shareholding in Harmony
being at 14.6%.

Since the year-end Assmang declared a dividend of R3 500 million. ARM's attributable portion of the dividend
is R1 750 million.

Events after the reporting date are set out in note 22 to the financial statements.

ARM Ferrous

ARM Ferrous headline earnings (including discontinued operations) of R3 528 million were 5% lower compared
to R3 709 million in F2017. This decrease was mainly due the inclusion in F2017 of a non-recurring amount of
R378 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% stake in the Dwarsrivier Mine (which was disclosed as a
discontinued operation in F2017). The F2018 ARM Ferrous headline earnings from continuing operations were
therefore 6% higher than the corresponding financial year excluding this non-recurring amount. The manganese
division headline earnings were 64% higher. Iron ore headline earnings were down 24% mainly as a result of
a 9% decrease in the average realised US Dollar export iron ore prices and the strengthening of the Rand/US
Dollar exchange rate.

Average manganese ore prices were up with the Platts Index for 44% manganese ore (CIF Tianjin) increasing
by 19% from US$5.77 per manganese tonne unit (mtu) in F2017 to US$6.88/mtu in F2018. The index for 37%
manganese ore (FOB Port Elizabeth) increased by 23% from US$4.56/mtu in F2017 to US$5.59/mtu. Prices
for manganese alloy were up 35% from US$1 151/t for F2017 to US$1 553/t for F2018. Average iron ore prices
on the other hand, as referenced by 62% iron ore fines (CIF North China), decreased marginally to US$69.27/t
(F2017: US$69.41/t).

The mines and the smelters were able to deliver into this generally improved price environment, increasing
production and sales volumes at all the operations.

Production and sales volume performance

Iron ore production volumes increased by 864 thousand tonnes (5%) to a production record of 18.58 million
tonnes in F2018 (F2017: 17.7 million tonnes). Most of the increase was due to Beeshoek Mine which delivered
730 thousand tonnes higher production as an opportunity to export 404 thousand tonnes of iron ore from
Beeshoek Mine was created through the newly established rail loop to the Saldanha Export Channel. Khumani
Mine production volumes increased by 134 thousand tonnes to 14.7 million tonnes by practising selective mining
methods and improving the in-pit blending of the feed ore. This resulted in the on-grade ratio improving from 32%
on-grade in F2017 to 35% in F2018. Khumani Mine's production of lumpy to fines ratio decreased from 57:43 in
F2017 to 55:45 in F2018 as a result of mining more ore from the King Pit. The deterioration in lumpy ratio is a
direct result of mining more ore from the King Pit which is aligned to the exploitation schedule for the total iron
ore resource at Khumani Mine.

Commensurate to the higher production, total sales volumes increased by 600 thousand tonnes (4%) to a sales
record of 17.9 million tonnes in F2018. Beeshoek Mine sales volume increased by 750 thousand tonnes while
Khumani Mine sales volumes decreased by 150 thousand tonnes. The decrease in the sales volume from Khumani
Mine is directly related to the derailments experienced on the export line to Saldanha Port. Of the 17.9 million
tonnes sold 14.3 million tonnes was exported and 3.6 million tonnes was sold locally.

At Black Rock Mine, manganese ore production volumes increased by 21% to 3.72 million tonnes (F2017:
3.07 million tonnes). 84% of the additional manganese ore produced was lumpy. The main reasons for the
improved production volumes were:

-    Benefits of the Black Rock Project - the upgrade of the Nchwaning II shaft was completed during F2017,
     which enabled the full utilisation of the shaft infrastructure during F2018; and
-    Successful execution of productivity improvements initiatives at the various shafts.

Black Rock Mine sales volume increased by 6% to 3.41 million tonnes (F2017: 3.24 million tonnes).

Cato Ridge Works high-carbon ferromanganese production volume decreased by 10 thousand tonnes (6%) to
151 thousand tonnes compared to 161 thousand tonnes in F2017. The decrease in production volumes relates
to a decision taken to reduce the amount of furnaces operating at Cato Ridge Works from four in F2017 to three
in F2018 as part of the business improvement strategy. Cato Ridge Alloys' medium-carbon ferromanganese
production volume decreased by 6% to 57 thousand tonnes in F2018 compared to 61 thousand tonnes in F2017.
The sales volumes for both high-carbon and medium-carbon ferromanganese matched the production volumes
achieved for F2018.

Sakura Works' high-carbon ferromanganese production volume increased by 63 thousand tonnes (35%) to
244 thousand tonnes in F2018 compared to 181 thousand tonnes in F2017. This increase was as a result of the
ramp-up of both furnaces during F2018, which are currently producing at higher than design capacity. Sales
volumes at Sakura Works increased by 86% to 240 thousand tonnes (F2017: 129 thousand tonnes).

Unit cost performance

Through improved operational efficiencies and higher production volumes, Khumani and Beeshoek mines' unit
production costs were managed to well below inflation and increased by only 2% and 1% respectively.

Black Rock Mine's year-on-year unit production costs increased by 16%. In F2017, the on-mine unit production
costs had reduced to R453 per tonne mainly due to the exclusion of fixed costs of R208 million from on-mine
production costs as the Nchwaning II Shaft was closed for 10 months of the financial year. In F2018 these
associated costs were included in on-mine production costs as the shaft was fully operational for the whole of
F2018. Further, there was an increase in operating costs as a result of manning new plant and infrastructure,
but not yet realising the full production volume potential, due to the Black Rock Project still being completed.

Both Khumani Mine and Black Rock Mine are currently in negotiations with the Sedibeng Water Board for the
capital user charge related to the upgrade of the Vaal Gamagara Water pipeline which supplies water to both
mines. This charge may increase unit costs at both mines going forward.

Cato Ridge Works unit production costs increased by 6% as a result of higher input cost for sinter (due to the
price improvements experienced in the index price for manganese ores) and an increase in the delivered price
of coke and anthracite reductants. The unit cost of sales for Cato Ridge increased as the sales prices of alloys
increased substantially during F2018 resulting in increased sales commissions. Sakura's unit production cost
increased by only 5% despite significant increases in raw material input costs (especially manganese ore and
reductants). This was achieved through improved efficiencies and increased production volumes.

Capital expenditure

ARM Ferrous capital expenditure (on a 100% basis) increased by 9% to R3 081 million in F2018
(F2017: R2 817 million) (on 100% basis).

Khumani Mine capital expenditure was R1 306 million (F2017: R892 million). This increase mainly related to:

-    Additional trackless mining machinery that was acquired to enable the selective mining strategy deployed
     during F2018;
-    Waste stripping at the Bruce and King pits; and
-    The replacement of mining equipment and fleet.

Beeshoek Mine capital expenditure was R474 million compared to R277 million for F2017. The increase relates to:

-    R98 million additional expenditure on waste stripping in the Village Pit in-line with the development and
     exploitation schedule of the Village Pit; and
-    R85 million additional expenditure for the replacement of trackless mining machinery and the replacement
     of crusher spares.

Black Rock Mine capital expenditure decreased by 19% to R1 240 million (F2017: R1 617 million) mainly due to
lower expenditure incurred for the Black Rock Project as most of the surface infrastructure improvements were
completed and commissioned in F2017. At the end of F2018 approximately 90% of the approved R6.7 billion
capital expenditure was committed or spent.

Capital of approximately R2.7 billion (on a 100% basis) has been approved for the modernisation and optimisation
of the Gloria Mine within the Black Rock Mine. This capital, which is expected to be spent over the next few
years, will enable the Black Rock Mine flexibility to produce different product specifications (from high to medium
grade) as the ability to deliver different specification products to customers has become a key differentiator in
the current dynamic manganese ore market. The Gloria Mine is expected to be shut for six months of F2019 as
part of this modernisation. Sales are planned to be met from inventory which has been built up in anticipation of
the shutdown. Production capacity at Gloria Mine will be increased and will bring Black Rock Mine's production
capacity to approximately 5 million tonnes per annum.

Cato Ridge Works capital expenditure was R45 million compared to R30 million in F2017. Sakura Works capital
expenditure reduced from R221 million to R34 million in F2018 mainly due to successful completion of the
project in F2018.

Logistics

Transnet performed well and all local and export sales volumes were achieved in F2018 as planned.

ARM Ferrous has signed the MECA2 (Manganese Export Capacity Allocation) Agreement with Transnet,
valid from 15 September 2015 until the later of 31 March 2023 or when the Port of Ngqura is fully operational.
Rail and port capacity is secured through the ports of Port Elizabeth and Saldanha in line with the ramp up of
Black Rock Mine. Engagements with Transnet with regards to synchronising the planned production ramp up of
Black Rock Mine beyond 2023 and the rail and port capacity provisions in the longer-term (MECA3) are ongoing.

Transnet enabled Khumani Mine to export 14.3 million tonnes of iron ore for F2018. Although port stock piles
are low due to various Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) derailments, the Ferrous division has successfully managed
to achieve planned iron ore sales volume. A junior iron ore producer and exporter was able to export more than
1 million tonnes of product using the load-out facility of Khumani Mine during the reporting period.

In collaboration with Transnet, a link to the iron ore export line to Saldanha Port has been established, from
Beeshoek Mine, to provide for additional iron ore export volume flexibility. This opportunity enabled Beeshoek
Mine to export 404 thousand tonnes of iron ore, through Saldanha, in F2018.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of two divisions: iron ore
and manganese. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum's attributable headline earnings increased by 20% to R420 million (F2017: R350 million). Concentrate
offtake agreements for both Modikwa and Nkomati mines were renegotiated with temporary improvement to
agreement terms and conditions. These impacted positively on the F2018 ARM Platinum results.

Improved US Dollar and Rand palladium, rhodium, cobalt, nickel and copper prices also contributed to this result.
Rand and US Dollar prices for platinum and chrome concentrate, however, were lower than the corresponding
period. Due to Modikwa Mine's higher palladium content, the mine's average Rand per 6E kilogram basket price
increased by 14% to R380 603 (F2017: R334 051), whereas the average basket price at Two Rivers Mine increased
by 11% to R370 755 per 6E kilogram (F2017: R333 749). The tables below set out the relevant price comparison:

An 11% increase in PGM production at Modikwa Mine was fully offset by an 11% decrease in PGM production
at both Nkomati and Two Rivers mines, resulting in ARM Platinum PGM ounces (on a 100% basis) decreasing
by 3% to 792 583 6E ounces (F2017: 815 188 6E ounces).

Nkomati Mine nickel production decreased by 16% to 13 302 tonnes (F2017: 15 875 tonnes) as a result of reduced
tonnes mined, combined with a 19% decrease in the mill head grade due to additional Very Low Grade (VLG)
stock pile material being milled.

F2018 unit production costs, on a Rand per tonne milled basis, were well controlled at all operations with Two
Rivers and Modikwa mines' unit cost being flat, while Nkomati Mine showed a 6% increase. Unit production
costs, on a Rand per PGM ounce basis were higher than inflation at 10% and 9% for Two Rivers and Modikwa
mines, respectively, due to a decline in grade at both mines. Nkomati Mine C1 unit cash costs net of by-products
(which include capitalised waste stripping costs) were 22% higher at US$5.86/lb (F2017: US$4.81/lb) of nickel
produced. The C1 unit cash costs were also negatively impacted by a grade decline which resulted in a 16%
decrease in nickel units produced.

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on a 100% basis) decreased by 10% to R1.15 billion
(F2017: R1.27 billion).

Capital expenditure at Modikwa Mine increased by 2% to R266 million (F2017: R262 million). Of the capital spent
in F2018, 33% is associated with the North Shaft Mine project and 16% with the South Shaft project, while 33%
was spent on fleet refurbishment and critical spares.

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers Mine in F2018, 19% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment.
The deepening of the Main and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised
59% of the total capital expenditure.

Nkomati Mine's F2018 capital expenditure was mainly for the replacement of the Onverwacht tailings pipeline
(R63 million), as well as the completion of the second anchored pile wall (R26 million). Following a minor
geotechnical slope failure on the Western side of the pit, remedial work was required to relocate the infrastructure
(tailings pipeline and road) (R18 million). The support and buttressing work done to stabilise the pile wall in the
Western section has been completed and is now stable. Capitalised waste stripping cost decreased by 51% as
waste mined reduced to 22 million tonnes from 27 million tonnes in F2017.

Two Rivers Mine

Attributable headline earnings at Two Rivers reduced by 6% to R306 million (F2017: R325 million). A 1% decrease
in tonnes milled and a 7% reduction in grade, led to PGMs produced declining by 11% to 348 405 6E ounces
(F2017: 390 214 6E ounces). In addition, chrome concentrate sales volumes declined by 17% to 229 642 tonnes
as a result of a lower chrome yield, a direct consequence of the lower PGM grade. This, combined with a 15%
decline in the Rand chrome price, resulted in chrome cash operating profit declining by 40% to R210 million
(F2017: R352 million).

Continued complexity in the ore body resulted in lower grades being delivered to the plant. The decline in head
grade is largely attributable to geological induced dilution associated with an increase in split reef proportion in
the ore mix mined from the southern sections of Main Decline. Currently, there is limited flexibility in blending the
ore from split reef and normal reef sources due to face length constraints at Main Decline. Areas of thick, lower
grade split reef are expected to continue affecting the overall mining grade negatively for the next 18 months,
resulting in overall mining grades being between 3.70 and 3.80 6E grams per tonne (F2017: 3.90 grams per
tonne). To mitigate the declining grade, there is a drive to increase the sinking rate at the Main Decline and mine
volumes from higher-grade panels as mining flexibility increases to enhance the ore mix. Undercutting of the
internal waste within the split reef is also being undertaken wherever practically possible.

Unit production costs on a Rand per tonne milled basis were flat at R688 per tonne (F2017: R690 per tonne).
The Rand per PGM ounce produced, however, increased by 10% to R6 822 per 6E ounce (F2017: R6 195 per
6E ounce), as a direct result of the decline in grade. There was a 9 581 tonne decrease in the UG2 Run-of-Mine
stockpile to a total of 207 171 tonnes of ore as at 30 June 2018.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa Mine achieved attributable headline earnings of R105 million (F2017: R66 million headline loss).
A 20% (413 thousand tonnes) increase in tonnes milled was partially offset by an 8% decrease in head grade,
which resulted in PGM production increasing by only 11% to 333 888 6E ounces (F2017: 301 228 6E ounces).
The decline in head grade was mainly due to increased in-stope dilution as the stoping width at South 1 Shaft
was negatively impacted by adverse geotechnical conditions in the hanging wall. Additional hanging-wall support
methods as well as drilling controls are being implemented to reduce the dilution.

Anglo American Platinum and ARM have been in on-going discussions to find a holistic solution to ensure the
sustainability of Modikwa Mine. By agreeing to temporarily improve the commercial terms of the existing purchase
of concentrate agreement, it is expected that this will improve the cash flow generation of the mine while the
turnaround and operational improvement plan is implemented. These terms are effective for concentrate deliveries
for a three-year period which commenced 1 January 2017. The financial results for the year ended 30 June 2018
include an adjustment for 18 months. The negotiations have been on-going since F2017, however the terms and
conditions only became unconditional in F2018. As such the adjustment resulted in additional revenue being
recognised and included in the Modikwa headline earnings attributable to ARM.

Unit production cost increased by 9%, to R9 197 per 6E PGM ounce (F2017: R8 463 per 6E PGM ounce) and
was flat on a Rand per tonne basis at R1 265 per tonne (F2017: R1 265 per tonne).

South 2 Shaft phase 1 has been capitalised to achieve production of 50 thousand tonnes per month. The shaft
achieved on average 31 thousand tonnes per month for the past 12 months. It is anticipated that steady state
production rates will be achieved in F2019.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine generated attributable headline earnings of R9 million (F2017: R91 million) for the period under
review. The decline was mainly due to lower nickel production volumes (13 302 tonnes versus 15 875 tonnes)
and a 53% decline in realised Rand chrome price.

The Nkomati Joint Venture partners entered into an addendum to the existing offtake agreement with Metal
Trade Overseas AG (MTO), under which the short delivery and grade penalties were relaxed for a period of two
years, effective 23 April 2018, and the tenure of the base agreement was extended to the life of the open pit mine
(which was 8.5 years as at 30 June 2018). The relaxation of penalties is to assist Nkomati while it is ramping up
to its normal production levels. This adjustment had a R21 million positive impact on the headline earnings for
two months ended 30 June 2018.

Despite chrome concentrate sales volumes increasing by 36% to 328 371 tonnes (F2017: 241 265 tonnes), the
chrome contribution to cash operating profit reduced by 42% to R235 million as a result of the lower chrome
price realised.

Nkomati's total tonnes milled increased by 7% to 8.04 million tonnes nickel units produced declining by 16% to
13 302 tonnes (F2017: 15 875 tonnes). The main reasons for this were:

-    Pit 3 mining operations remain constrained as a result of the historical insufficient waste stripping and
     geotechnical issues, resulting in insufficient MMZ ore availability during the reporting period;
-    Higher than expected processing of Very Low Grade (VLG) MMZ stockpile material (approximately 1.5 million
     tonnes during the period) to complement the shortfall of MMZ ore to ensure that both mills operate at maximum
     capacity. The VLG MMZ material had an average nickel grade of 0.18%, which resulted in the average mill
     feed grade declining by 16%; and
-    Waste stripping on the Western section of Pit 3 commenced during October 2017. Minor saprolite failures
     occurred, which resulted in the mine having to re-evaluate the design parameters for the saprolite zones of
     the pit's Western high wall and the waste stripping plan. Waste stripping of 23 million tonnes per annum is
     planned for the next two years as a result of constraints in the pit.

Nkomati Mine's on-mine unit production cost (excluding capitalised waste stripping) was 6% higher at R301 per
tonne (F2017: R284 per tonne). The reduction in waste stripping volumes resulted in unit cost per tonne milled
(including capitalised waste stripping) declining by 8% to R339 per tonne (F2017: R367 per tonne).

C1 unit cash cost net of by-products (which includes capitalised waste stripping cost) was 22% higher at
US$5.86/lb (F2017: US$4.81/lb) of nickel produced. The increase in C1 unit cash costs was due to the decrease in
nickel units produced. R304 million of waste stripping cost (F2017: R617 million) was capitalised during the period.

Projects

Modikwa Mine
In order to maintain the current production profile and ramp-up, the operation initiated the North Shaft Deepening
Project and the South 2 Shaft Project. The current status of these projects are detailed below:

-    Deepening of North Shaft - Entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 6 to Level 9 thereby establishing
     two new mining levels. The 9 Level mining development and equipping is on track to meet the revised
     schedule; anticipated handover for the ore transfer system is F2020.
-    Sinking of South 2 Shaft - Scope included the establishment of a decline shaft system south of the current
     South Shaft Infrastructure. The first phase of the project is expected to enhance mining flexibility while also
     contributing to the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has been completed and
     is expected to take the production capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by F2019. The second phase
     will follow and increase the design capacity of this shaft system to 100 000 tonnes per month by F2022.

Kalplats

ARM recorded an attributable impairment charge of R40 million after tax (F2017: nil) of Kalplats exploration assets.
This was mainly due to the expiry of the prospecting right relating to the Kalplats project and ARM Platinum not
having applied for a mining right.
The ARM Platinum division comprises:

-    Three operating mines:
     -    Modikwa - ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities
          hold an 8.5% effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Anglo American Platinum.
     -    Two Rivers - an ARM subsidiary in which ARM has a 54% shareholding and Implats 46%. The increase
          in shareholding is effective 8 November 2017, when Two Rivers' amended mining right, including the
          mining rights transferred to it, was executed by the Department of Mineral Resources.
     -    Nkomati - a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.

-    The Kalplats Project:
     -    in which ARM Platinum holds 46% and Stella Platinum holds 44%, with Anglo American holding 10%.

ARM Coal

Restructuring of ARM Coal debt

ARM and GOSA a wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore Holdings South Africa Proprietary Limited (""GHSA""),
hold 51% and 49% of the issued share capital in ARM Coal Proprietary Limited (""ARM Coal""), respectively. ARM
Coal and GOSA, own and operate the GGV Mine through an unincorporated joint venture in which ARM Coal and
GOSA hold 51% and 49% participation rights, respectively, giving ARM an effective interest of 26% in GGV Mine.

GOSA owns and operates several coal mining operations in South Africa referred to as the Participative Coal
Business (""PCB""). ARM and ARM Coal hold preference shares in GOSA which entitle them to participate in the
underlying assets and profits of the PCB. ARM and ARM Coal's interests in the PCB through these preference
shares are 10% and 20%, respectively.

The impact of the restructuring on the F2018 results is as follows:

-    A deemed interest charge, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 39: Financial Instruments
     - Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39), attributable to ARM for the year is R321 million. On the old loan
     terms, this charge would have been R501 million for F2018, resulting in a saving of R180 million. Deemed
     interest received on certain intercompany fair value adjustments, attributable to ARM, amount to R8 million.
-    A net fair value gain recognised in the statement of comprehensive income amounting to R1 210 million,
     comprising of the following:
     -    In respect of the GGV debt: R885 million;
     -    In respect of the PCB debt: R325 million.

The net present value calculations performed to arrive at the reported fair value gain, were based on the prime
interest rate, which is considered to be a market related interest rate.

The fair value gain is as a result of changes in the future repayment cash flows due to changes in the timing of
cash flows due to deferred bullet payments and interest holidays under the new loan terms. The fair value gain
is in accordance with IAS 39, which states that a modified debt is considered 'substantially different' if the net
present value of the cash flows under the new loan terms discounted at the original interest rate, differs by more
than 10% from the discounted present values of the remaining cash flows of the original debt instrument. Where
a financial liability is considered substantially different, the existing loan is derecognised and the new loan is
recognised, the net effect of the modification is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.

The outstanding loan balances will be revalued at the end of each reporting period with the resultant gains and
losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. These future gains and losses will be dependent
on changes in coal prices and Rand versus US Dollar exchange rate, all of which are expected to have an impact
on the timing by which the loans are modelled to be fully repaid.

ARM Coal operational and financial results

ARM Coal's attributable headline earnings increased to R1 485 million (F2017: R82 million) mainly due to the
debt restructuring. In addition, earnings also improved due to the average realised US Dollar export prices being
22% higher compared to F2017.

Seaborne coal prices were positively impacted by an increase in demand from India and China. The impact of the
higher prices was partially reduced by a strengthening of the average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate.
Realised Rand prices increased by 17% from R843 per tonne in F2017 to R990 per tonne in F2018.

More than 80% of the export volumes at GGV Mine were high quality (RB1) coal while only 39% of PCB
exports were RB1 quality. This resulted in PCB's average received export price being lower compared
to GGV Mine.

ARM attributable saleable tonnes produced of 4.93 million tonnes is 1.8% lower than the 5.02 million tonnes
produced in F2017.

Average received export US Dollar prices increased by 36% compared to F2017. The impact of the higher prices
was partially reduced by a 10% reduction in export sales volumes and a 6% strengthening of the Rand versus
the US Dollar. This resulted in an increase in attributable export revenue of R107 million.

Saleable production at GGV Mine was 7% lower than F2017 partially due to a rollover of low in-pit inventory levels
from F2017. The in-pit inventory levels have marginally improved during F2018. The mine remains focused on
improving the in-pit inventory levels. Production was further negatively impacted by underperformance of the
mining contractors, underperformance of the truck and shovel fleet, safety-related stoppages and labour unrest.

On-mine unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 9% to R351, mainly as a result of a decrease in
production volumes.

Attributable headline earnings increased to R852 million (F2017: R99 million headline loss). This amount was
positively impacted by a R885 million fair value gain relating to the debt restructuring.

Participative Coal Business (PCB)

The mines comprising the PCB all performed well during F2018 and achieved increases of 5% and 1% in ROM
and saleable production respectively.

PCB attributable cash operating profit increased by 6% to R1 030 million (F2017: R976 million) as a result of a
R238 million increase in revenue offset by a R184 million increase in operating costs.

The increase in revenue was largely as a result of a 1% increase in sales volumes together with a 19% increase
in US Dollar coal prices. This was partially offset by a 6% strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar.
Revenue from inland coal sales was R36 million lower than the corresponding period, due to a decrease in local
coal sales volumes.

Unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 19% from R278 per tonne in F2017 to R330 per tonne in
F2018. On-mine production costs in the corresponding period benefited from processing of stockpile ore built
up during the Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP). The Tweefontein operation has since stabilised and is
now operating at the planned unit production costs which was estimated at approximately R300 per tonne.
The 5% increase in ROM production together with the reduction in the benefits obtained from the low cost
stockpile resulted in an increase in on-mine costs of R188 million.

Headline earnings attributable to ARM was R633 million. (F2017: R181 million). This amount was positively
impacted by a R325 million fair value gain relating to the debt restructuring.

Discontinued operation: ARM Copper

ARM Copper's headline loss improved from R203 million in F2017 to R6 million in F2018. The disposal of the
only operation in ARM Copper, Lubambe Mine was completed on 22 December 2017 with the final proceeds
from the sale received in December 2017.

Harmony

Harmony reported a 42% decrease in headline earnings from R1 306 million to R763 million for F2018 mainly
due to translation loss of R669 million on US Dollar denominated debt at 30 June 2018 and lower derivative
gains recognised in F2018 of R99 million. Headline earnings per share were 171 cents per share compared with
298 cents per share in F2017.

Revenue increased by 6% mainly due to a 6% increase in gold sold (excluding capitalised gold sales from Hidden
Valley) with the inclusion of the Moab Khotsong operations from 1 March 2018. The average gold price received
in Rand terms (including the gold hedge realised) remained steady at R570 709/kg (F2017: R570 164/kg) while
in US Dollar terms, the price received increased by 12% to US$1 380/oz. The Rand gold hedges, included as
part of revenue realised gains of R1 197 million in F2018 (realised gains of R728 million in F2017).

Gold production from the South African operations increased 14% of which Moab Khotsong produced
105 900 ounces (contributing 10% of the increase in SA gold production) for the four months the operation
was included in Harmony's asset portfolio (since 1 March 2018). All-in sustaining unit cost were R508 970/kg
(US$1 231/oz), beating annual guidance of R520 000 kg and the all-in sustaining unit cost of R516 687/kg
(US$1 182/oz) reported F2017.

An updated feasibility study on Wafi Golpu was released on 19 March 2018, proposing a larger mine and
increased production profile, resulting in a 33% increase in net present value to US$2.6 billion (applying a real
discount rate of 8.5%).

ARM subscribed for Harmony shares as part an accelerated book build process. As Harmony's strategic black
economic empowerment partner ARM subscribed to approximately 11 million shares to maintain its shareholding
in Harmony at approximately 14%.

The Harmony investment is reflected on the ARM statement of financial position at R1 351 million based on the
Harmony share price at 30 June 2018 of R21.22 per share (30 June 2017: R21.68 per share). Changes in the
value of the investment in Harmony, to the extent that they represent a significant or prolonged decline below the
cost of the investment, are adjusted through the statement of profit or loss, net of tax. Gains are accounted for,
net of deferred capital gains tax, through the statement of comprehensive income. Dividends from Harmony are
recognised in the ARM statement of profit or loss on the last day of registration following dividend declaration.

Harmony's results for the year ended 30 June 2018 can be viewed on Harmony's website at
http://www.harmony.co.za. ARM owns 14.6% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Outlook

Global GDP growth appears to be recovering steadily. China remains a significant consumer of the commodities
we produce as infrastructure and consumer demand underpins demand for commodities. Quality of commodities,
especially amongst the bulk metals, has become a key differentiator as China seeks to address its pollution
challenges through improved efficiencies in heavy industries. This can be seen in the increase of premiums
associated with high-grade bulk metals which we believe represents a structural shift in these markets. ARM is
well positioned to deliver into this shift given the high quality iron ore and manganese ore produced. We continue
to invest in our business to enable us flexibility of product specifications to respond to changing customer needs.

We are also closely watching other global trends especially in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and
the potential challenges and opportunities these may create for our business. One such trend of interest has
been the advancements made in mobility, particularly clean mobility. Although an increase in electric vehicles as
a percentage of total vehicle sales creates opportunities for some of the metals in our portfolio, including nickel
and manganese ore, it negatively impacts demand for platinum group metal (which are mostly used in internal
combustion engines). We continue to research these potential impacts to ensure that we are well positioned in
the future to maximise on opportunities created by these trends but also address the challenges.

Investor confidence and sentiment towards South Africa continues to improve. The Rand versus the US Dollar
is expected to remain volatile, impacted by monetary policy direction in the United States, international trade
concerns as well as other global and domestic risks.

Our operating environment is not without significant headwinds: community unrest, geopolitical uncertainty,
regulatory risk, technology and cyber risks, and social licence risks continue to increase.

We continue to focus on those elements that are within our control. These include adhering to our commitment
to capital allocation discipline by striking a balance between maintaining our current business, investing in
expansionary and value-enhancing growth and improving on the overall shareholder returns through long-term
share price appreciation and dividend growth. To enable this, we will keep a focus on maintaining operating
costs to levels at or below inflation, maximising the cash generation from our assets, maximising profit margins
and sustaining our available flexibility through a strong financial position.

      New accounting st  ndards and amendments issued to accounting standards and interpretations which
      are relevant to ARM, but not yet effective on 30 June 2018, have not been adopted.
      
      ARM continuously evaluates the impact of these standards and amendments, the most prominent being
      IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases.
      In summary the following are the current expectations in relation to IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
      
      IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
      
      IFRS 9 becomes effective for ARM for the financial year beginning 1 July 2018.
      
      ARM will adopt IFRS 9 by adjusting opening retained income at 1 July 2018. Figures for F2018 will not
      be restated.
      
      The key changes for ARM include the following:
      
      Equity investments (other than investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures)
      
      Currently, ARM has classified the listed shares in Harmony as available-for-sale, whereby fair value
      gains and losses are recognised in equity (other comprehensive income), except upon impairment
      or disposal when such amounts previously recognised in equity are reclassified into profit or loss.
      Other equity investments have been measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for some unlisted
      investments which are carried at cost because the fair value cannot be determined reliably.
      
      Under IFRS 9, all equity investments are measured at fair value. There is a choice to designate where the
      remeasurements of particular equity investments are recognised - either equity (other comprehensive
      income) or profit or loss. ARM has designated the listed shares in Harmony to be remeasured through
      equity with no subsequent reclassification to profit or loss.
      
      Dividends received will continue to be recognised in profit or loss, unless dividends clearly represent a
      recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
      
      Currently, unlisted investments are measured at cost where the fair value cannot be reliably measured.
      Under IFRS 9, there is no possibility to use the cost method, and as such, investments in equities need
      to be measured at fair value. The impact of measuring unlisted investments at fair value instead of cost
      is still being determined.
      
      Trade and Other Receivables (including loans advanced)
      
      The majority of trade receivables contain provisional pricing features linked to commodity prices and
      exchange rates. Currently, these receivables have been designated to be measured at fair value through
      profit or loss. Under IFRS 9, such instruments would continue to be measured on the same basis.
      
      Other receivables, including loans advanced, are expected to continue to be measured at amortised
      cost under IFRS 9. The impairment model for amortised cost financial assets under IFRS 9 requires the
      recognition of expected losses, rather than only incurred losses. The impact of adopting the expected
      credit loss model is still being determined.
      
      Loans to associated entities are currently carried at cost or amortised cost - management are in the
      process of evaluating whether these now need to be carried at fair value as per IFRS 9 and if so,
      determine the fair value.
      
      IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
      
      The key issues identified, and the Group's views and perspectives, are set out below. These are based
      on the Group's current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be subject to changes as interpretations
      evolve more generally. Furthermore, the Group is considering and will continue to monitor any further
      development.
      
      IFRS 15 requires revenue from contracts with customers to be recognised when the separate performance
      obligations are satisfied, which is when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the
      customer.
      
      ARM will adopt IFRS 15 on 1 July 2018 using the fully retrospective approach, whereby opening retained
      income at 1 July 2017 will be adjusted and the figures for F2018 will be restated. The diagnostic impact
      assessment performed during the year identified gaps between IAS 18 Revenue and IFRS 15.
      
      Financial impact
      
      Performance obligations
      
      Revenue, primarily comprises commodity sales - both local and export. Currently revenue is recognised
      when the risks and rewards of ownership of the commodities have been transferred. Under IFRS 15, the
      timing of revenue recognition for sales of commodities remains the same, except with respect to export
      sales subject to Cost, Insurance and Freight ('CIF') and Cost and Freight ('CFR') International Commercial
      Terms ('Incoterms'). Under such shipping terms, the Group is required to procure and pay for freight and/
      or insurance ('shipping services') after transfer of control of the commodities. In such contracts, these
      shipping services will need to be treated as separate performance obligations under IFRS 15, and a
      portion of the total transaction price recognised as revenue over time as such services are provided.
      Although, the quantification of such differences is still in progress, at this stage it is not expected that this
      change will have a material impact on the amount of revenue recognised under IFRS 15.
      
      Assay estimates
      
      Some of the Group's commodity sales are subject to assay estimates. When considering the initial assay
      estimate, the Group has considered the requirements of IFRS 15 in relation to the constraint on estimates
      of variable consideration - that it will only include amounts in the calculation of revenue where it is
      highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty relating to final
      assay/quality is subsequently resolved, i.e., finalisation of sale by customer. The assay differences are
      not usually material to the Group, hence, no change is expected when compared to the current IAS
      18 approach. Consistent with current practice, any subsequent changes that arise due to differences
      between initial and final assay will be recognised as an adjustment to revenue from contracts with
      customers.
      
      Provisional pricing
      
      Some of the Group's commodity sales are subject to provisional pricing features such as commodity
      prices and foreign exchange rates which are only finalised sometime after transfer of the commodities.
      Currently, the changes in these variables are recognised as part of revenue. Although changes in
      these variables are not within the scope of variable consideration under IFRS 15, they will continue to
      be presented as revenue, therefore there will be no change to the amount of overall revenue, but the
      disclosure of the disaggregation of revenue will change as a result.
      
      Penalties
      
      Adjustments, in the form of penalties, are made to the pricing to the extent the commodities sold do not
      meet certain specifications. As a result, the IFRS 15 constraint on variable consideration applies, which
      seeks to limit the amount of revenue recognised to guard against significant reversals in subsequent
      reporting periods. It is not expected that this constraint will have a material impact on revenue recognised
      under IFRS 15.
      
      Management fees
      
      The Group's revenue also includes management fees which are variable, and hence are subject to the
      IFRS 15 variable consideration constraint. It is not expected that this constraint will have a material impact
      on revenue recognised under IFRS 15.
      
      Cost to acquire contracts
      
      The requirement under IFRS 15 to capitalise and amortise costs to acquire contracts is not expected to
      have a material impact on the Group.
      
      Disclosure impact
      
      IIFRS 15 requires additional detailed disclosures about the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
      The key areas for ARM include information about the nature of its performance obligations, how they are
      satisfied, the transaction price for contracts not yet satisfied and the disaggregation of revenue.
      
      At this stage, ARM expects that the majority of the additional disclosure will relate to updating its
      accounting policies and disaggregation of revenue due to provisional pricing.
      
      IFRS 16 Leases
      
      The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (i.e. for the financial
      year beginning 1 July 2019 for ARM).
      
      -    ARM has made the decision not to early adopt IFRS 16.
      -    ARM continues with the detail assessment of the potential impact of this standard on the financial
           statements.
      -    ARM must still make a decision on the transition method to be applied as well as the practical
           expedients to be used.

      (1) Anglo American Platinum and ARM have been in ongoing discussions to find a holistic solution to ensure the
          sustainability of Modikwa. On 16 July 2018, the partners agreed to temporarily amend the terms of the existing
          Sale of Concentrate agreement to improve the cash flow generation of the mine while a turnaround and operational
          improvement plan is implemented. The negotiations have been ongoing since F2017 and became unconditional
          in F2018. As a result, the financial results for the year ended 30 June 2018 include an adjustment for 18 months,
          1 January 2017 to 30 June 2018.

3.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IMPAIRMENT

3.1   Kalplats
      An impairment loss of R40 million (tax nil) was recognised at 30 June 2018 as a result of the
      prospecting right relating to the Kalplats project having expired and ARM Platinum Proprietary
      Limited has not applied for a mining right.

3.2   ARM Coal - PCB
      An impairment loss was recognised on property, plant and equipment for R19 million before tax of
      R5 million (Refer to notes 2.1 and 6). This is accounted for in the income from associate line in the
      statement of profit or loss.

3.3   ARM Ferrous
      An impairment loss was recognised on property plant and equipment for R26 million before tax of
      R7 million (Refer to notes 2.1 and 6). This is accounted for in the income from joint venture line in
      the statement of profit or loss.

3.4   Tamboti
      During the year, the mineral rights held in Tamboti Platinum Proprietary Limited was sold to
      Two Rivers. The net effect was R99 million increase in the non-controlling interest of the Group.
      This increased the ARM shareholding in Two Rivers from 51% to 54%.

3.5   Nkomati Nickel Mine
      As previously disclosed at 30 June 2017 and at 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Nkomati
      Nickel Mine cash-generating unit was recognised at 31 December 2016, largely as a result of:

      (i) a revision of the mine plan with a resultant lower metal output profile; and

      (ii) A significant decline from the prior year forecast long-term price of nickel and a further strengthening of the
          R/US$ exchange rate.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment charge amounted to R988 million before tax and
      R711 million after tax.

      The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use
      calculation performed in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      At 30 June 2018 and 2017, there were no further impairments or reversals.

3.6   Modikwa Platinum Mine
      As previously disclosed at 30 June 2017 and at 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the
      Modikwa Platinum Mine cash generating unit attributable to ARM at 31 December 2016, was
      recognised largely as a result of:

      (i) lower forecast PGM output over the short to medium term;

      (ii) higher forecast unit cost of production; and iii) a reduction in the forecast long-term platinum price
          and a further strengthening of the R/US$ exchange rate.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to R1 255 million before tax, R890 million
      after tax and R734 million after non-controlling interest and tax.

      The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use
      calculation performed in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      At 30 June 2018 and 2017 there were no further impairments or reversals.

3.7   Lubambe Copper Mine
      At 30 June 2017, there was an impairment reversal following the classification of Lubambe as an
      asset held for sale (refer to note 6 and 16.3). This was subsequently sold.

11.   ARM COAL LOAN RESTRUCTURING
      Included in other operating income and profit from associate are fair value gains
      attributable to ARM of R652 million (tax nil) and R325 million (tax nil) respectively
      relating to the recognition of the GGV and PCB loans following the successful
      conclusion of the restructuring of debt between ARM and Glencore Operations South
      Africa Proprietary Limited (GOSA) and ARM Coal Proprietary Limited.
      The fair value gain is as a result of changes in the future repayment cash flows applied
      to the net present value calculations.
      The changes emanate mainly from the timing applicable to cash flows as a result of the
      extension of the loan repayment period holidays under the new loan terms.
      The fair value gain are in accordance with International Accounting Standard 39:
      Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement, which states that a modified
      debt is considered substantially different if the net present value of the cash flows
      under the new loan terms discounted at the original interest rate, differs by more than
      10% from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original debt
      instrument. Where a financial liability is considered substantially different, the existing
      loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised, the net effect of the modification
      is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.
      The discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value was 10%.

      The fair value adjustment are as follows:
      Other operating income increase (fair value gain on loans)                                                      885          -

18.   PROVISION
      Silicosis and tuberculosis class action provision
      In November 2014, a gold mining industry working group was formed to address
      issues relating to the compensation and medical care for occupational lung
      diseases in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working group comprises
      ARM Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, Anglo American South Africa
      Limited, AngloGold Ashanti Limited Gold Fields Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited
      (collectively ""the Working Group"").

      The Working Group engaged different stakeholders including government,
      organised labour, other mining companies and legal representatives of claimants
      who have filed legal suits against the companies. These engagements have
      sought a comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues that
      are fair to past and current employees and enable companies to continue to be
      sustainable over the long term.

      As a consequence of the progress of negotiations between the Working Group
      and affected stakeholders, and the subsequent settlement offer arrangement
      reached with the claimants' legal representative, ARM has recognised a net
      present value provision of R330 million at 30 June 2018 (F2017:R330 million).

      The subsequent settlement offer reached is conditional on the process of
      ratification by the high court.

      The Working Group continues to defend the legal proceedings.

      ARM does not believe that it is liable in respect of the claims brought.

      The negotiations with the claimants' lawyers are confidential and the Working
      Group companies are accordingly not able to provide any details of the
      negotiations.

21.   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
      Assmang has issued a guarantee to the Sarawak Energy Board amounting to
      $100 million. Sponsor indemnities amounting to $45.64 million have been received by
      Assmang in respect of this guarantee. The potential exposure for Assmang is therefore

      There have been no other significant changes in the contingent liabilities of the Group
      as disclosed in the 30 June 2017 integrated annual report.

22.1  Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (""Harmony"") conducted a placing of new ordinary shares to
      qualifying investors to raise up to ZAR1.26 billion/US$100 million through an accelerated book-building
      process launched on 5 June 2018.
      As Harmony's strategic black economic empowerment partner, ARM subscribed for shares necessary to
      ensure that its 30 June 2018 shareholding of approximately 14% is maintained post Harmony's placement of
      new ordinary shares.
      On 17 July, ARM subscribed to 11 032 623 shares at a total cost of R210 million (i.e. R19.12 per share) to
      maintain its shareholding in Harmony at 14.5%.

Trading statement in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2018
(F2018)


In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE
Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading statement as
soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that
the financial results for the period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from those of the corresponding period.

Headline earnings per share for F2018 are expected to increase by between
41% and 54% to between 2 370 and 2 590 cents compared to 1 684 cents
reported for the financial year ended 30 June 2017 (F2017).

Basic earnings per share for F2018 are expected to increase by between
221% and 239% to between 2 320 and 2 450 cents (F2017: 723 cents). F2017
basic earnings included attributable impairments of the Nkomati Mine and
Modikwa Mine assets of R711 million and R734 million after tax and non-
controlling interest, respectively.

Both basic and headline earnings for F2018 were positively affected by an
increase   in   average   realised   US   Dollar   prices   for   most commodities
(partially offset by a stronger Rand/US Dollar exchange rate) and a net
group fair value gain of R977 million (or 513 cents per share) as a result
of the ARM Coal debt restructuring. This fair value gain is included in
headline earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has
neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors of ARM.

The Company’s F2018 provisional financial results will be released on
7 September 2018.

Overview

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces a 15% increase in headline earnings for the six months ended
31 December 2017 to R1 945 million (1H F2017: R1 693 million). This increase was mainly as a result of improved headline
earnings from the Manganese Division, ARM Coal, Modikwa Mine and ARM Copper.

As part of ARM's commitment to shareholder returns, ARM declared a maiden interim dividend of 250 cents per share.

ARM Ferrous headline earnings from continuing operations of R1 765 million were 26% higher (1H F2017: R1 401 million)
driven mainly by a 131% increase in headline earnings from the Manganese Division. Significant improvement in the
Manganese Division's earnings was mainly due to increased manganese ore and alloy sales volumes, proportionately
more high-grade manganese ore being sold (which resulted in higher average realised manganese ore prices) as well as
a 69% increase in manganese alloy prices.

ARM Ferrous headline earnings (including discontinued operations) of R 1 779 million in 1H F2017 included a non-recurring
amount of R378 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% stake in the Dwarsrivier Mine (which was disclosed as
a discontinued operation in 1H F2017).

ARM Platinum headline earnings increased by 26% to R226 million (1H F2017: R179 million) as Modikwa Mine improved
from a headline loss of R54 million in 1H F2017 to headline earnings of R36 million. Two Rivers Mine headline earnings
were 16% lower at R173 million (1H F2017: R205 million) mainly as a result of a decrease in PGM volumes due to a
reduction in grades at the mine. Nkomati Mine reported reduced headline earnings as a result of lower sales volumes due
to shipment delays. Chrome concentrate sales volumes at Nkomati Mine increased by 105%, however, the average US
Dollar price realised for chrome concentrate was 62% lower.

ARM Coal headline earnings were R160 million (1H F2017: R99 million). Goedgevonden (GGV) Mine contributed headline
earnings of R35 million (1H F2017: R26 million headline loss) while the PCB operations contributed headline earnings of
R125 million (1H F2017: R125 million).

ARM Copper, which is disclosed as a discontinued operation in the period under review, recorded a headline loss of
R6 million for the period (1H F2017: R72 million headline loss).

The ARM Corporate and other segment showed an improved headline loss of R200 million (1H F2017: R292 million).
The improvement is mainly made up of:

- a decrease in foreign exchange losses of R145 million on the revaluation of ARM's US Dollar loans to Lubambe Mine
  prior to and on the disposal of Lubambe Mine;
- R60 million lower bonus provision raised; and
- higher management fee income of R28 million.

The above was partly offset by a R170 million higher income tax expense recorded for 1H F2018.

The ARM Corporate and other segment includes ARM Exploration costs of R10 million (1H F2017: R12 million).

    intercompany interest accrued to ARM Company from Lubambe Mine of R130 million (1H F2017: R106 million) has been
    eliminated from both ARM Copper and Corporate and other segments.

These results have been achieved in conjunction with ARM's partners at the various operations, Anglo American Platinum
Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk Nickel Africa (Pty)
Ltd (Norilsk), Glencore South Africa (Glencore), Vale S.A. (Vale) and Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines Investment

The interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

Operating safely

ARM is committed to creating a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.

Regrettably an employee, Mr Fabian Majoro, was fatally injured when he was exposed to irrespirable atmosphere
underground at Modikwa Mine on 9 October 2017. The Board and management express their sincerest condolences to the
family, friends and colleagues of Mr Majoro. Prior to this accident, ARM's operations had been fatality-free since May 2015.

The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for 1H F2018 was 0.41 per 200 000 man-hours (1H F2017: 0.33). There were
51 Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for the six months under review compared to 37 in the corresponding period.

Safety achievements in the period under review:

- On 3 July 2017, Modikwa Mine completed 4 million fatality-free shifts.
- On 18 August 2017, Two Rivers Mine completed 4 million fatality-free shifts.
- On 18 October 2017, Beeshoek Mine recorded 16 000 fatality-free production shifts and received a certificate from the
  DMR for an outstanding safety achievement as the ""Most Consistent Surface Mine"" in the 2017 Northern Cape Mine
  Safety Competition.
- On 7 November 2017, Nkomati Mine achieved 6 million fatality-free shifts.

Safety figures and statistics in this report are presented on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations which are
managed by ARM's partner.

Corporate transactions

The disposal of Lubambe Mine was completed on 22 December 2017 when all conditions precedent were met. Lubambe
Mine is disclosed as a discontinued operation in terms of IFRS. The 1H F2017 Income Statement has, therefore, been
re-presented.

The 1H F2017 results included income from the discontinued chrome operation relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50%
interest in Dwarsrivier Mine. Machadodorp Works is the only remaining operation in Assmang's Chrome Division.

Further to the consent received by Two Rivers Mine during August 2017 (i) to transfer the Tamboti rights to it, and (ii) to
have Two Rivers Mine's mining right amended accordingly, the amended mining right was executed. This resulted in ARM's
interest in Two Rivers Mine increasing from 51% to 54% from 9 November 2017.

Restructuring loss-making operations

Lubambe Mine

The total cash proceeds, in respect of the disposal of ARM and Vale's 80% interest in Lubambe Mine was US$97.10 million
adjusted for:

- settlement of Lubambe Mine's general banking facility of US$26 million;
- payment of property transfer tax of US$10 million;
- payment of withholding tax of US$5 million; and
- reimbursement of funding provided to Lubambe Mine after 1 May 2017 of US$25 million.

The final proceeds were received by ARM and Vale in December 2017. Refer to note 12 to the financial statements for
more details.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine headline earnings were 39% lower than the corresponding period mainly as a result of reduced sales
volumes due to shipping delays. Nkomati Mine's tonnes milled increased by 14% to 4.08 million tonnes. Nickel units
produced were, however, only 2% higher as insufficient availability of high-grade MMZ ore and the processing of Very
Low Grade (VLG) MMZ stockpile material resulted in a reduction of the mine's head grade from 0.28% to 0.24%. Nickel
produced was 6 733 tonnes (1H F2017: 6 627 tonnes) while by-products PGM and copper volumes increased by 37% and
38% respectively.

As previously reported, Nkomati Mine is in a challenging period which is expected to continue until the end of F2020.
Increased waste stripping is required to increase mining flexibility and the pit requires piling work to improve slope stability.
Construction of pile wall 2 in the Western Section to improve slope stability was completed in the period under review
and the mine continues to progress with buttressing work. Waste stripping continues to be a challenge. In the period
under review waste mined was lower than planned at 11 million tonnes due to rescheduling and reallocation of equipment
between the Eastern and Western sections of the pit. Waste stripping is expected to remain challenging at an annualised
rate of approximately 23 million tonnes per annum (compared to the 27 million tonnes per annum required to ensure mining
flexibility). This is expected to impact nickel volumes to F2020.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa Mine headline earnings of R36 million represent a turnaround from the R54 million headline loss reported for
1H F2017. Modikwa Mine delivered a 16% increase in PGM volumes.

The South 2 Shaft Project is advancing well. The first phase of the project is expected to enhance mining flexibility while
also contributing to the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has been completed and is
expected to take the production capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by F2019.

ARM Coal

Negotiations with Glencore to restructure the ARM Coal debt to improve ARM's obligations in terms of these loans are
ongoing.

Changes to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Reserves as disclosed in the Integrated Annual
Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2017, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the operations
with the exception of:

- Lubambe Mine Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves which are no longer reported by ARM after completion of the
  disposal of ARM's interest in December 2017.
- Two Rivers Mine, where the transfer of Tamboti Platinum (Kalkfontein RE portion) was completed in November 2017.
  The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves of the Kalkfontein RE portion will now be reported as part of Two Rivers
  Mine, and in terms of the agreement, ARM's attributable interest in Two Rivers Mine will increase from 51% to 54%.

An updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Statement will be issued in the Company's F2018 Integrated Annual
Report.

Financial commentary

Earnings

Headline earnings for the six-month period to 31 December 2017 were R1 945 million or 15% higher than the corresponding
period's headline earnings (1H F2017: R1 693 million). This equates to headline earnings per share of 1 023 cents
(1H F2017: 893 cents).

Basic earnings for 1H F2018 were R1 753 million (1H F2017: R254 million basic loss) and were impacted by an after-tax
and non-controlling interest loss on the disposal of Lubambe Mine of R179 million. The 1H F2017 basic loss included:

- an attributable impairment of the Nkomati assets of R711 million after tax;
- an attributable impairment of the Modikwa assets of R734 million after tax and non-controlling interest; and
- an impairment loss of R422 million within the Assmang joint venture related to the sale of Dwarsrivier Mine.

The reconciliation of basic earnings to headline earnings is provided in note 8 to the financial statements. Basic earnings
per share increased from a basic loss of 134 cents to basic earnings of 922 cents.

Sales from continuing operations for the reporting period were 2% higher in 1H F2018 at R4 260 million (1H F2017: R4 176
million). Sales for ARM Ferrous increased by 12% to R6 816 million (1H F2017: R6 088 million).

The average gross profit margin increased to 19% (1H F2017: 16%). The gross profit margins achieved at each operating
division may be ascertained from the detailed segment reports provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

ARM's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations, excluding
special items and income from associates and joint ventures, were R999 million (1H F2017: R693 million). This is 44%
(R306 million) higher than 1H F2017, largely as a result of higher EBITDA contributions from ARM Platinum (R16 million),
ARM Coal (R93 million) and ARM Corporate (R230 million), respectively.

The income from joint venture (ARM Ferrous) was R1 765 million (1H F2017: R1 356 million) after special items and is 30%
higher than the corresponding period. The detailed and expanded segmental contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to
the financial statements.

Exchange rate

The 1H F2018 average Rand/US Dollar was R13.39/US$ (1H F2017: R13.98/US$). For reporting purposes, the closing
exchange rate at 31 December 2017 was R12.29/US$ (31 December 2016: R13.73/US$).

Cash

At 31 December 2017 cash and cash equivalents were R1 919 million (31 December 2016: R1 335 million) the details of
which are reflected in note 5 to the financial statements. This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at
ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R3 198 million (31 December 2016: R2 588 million).

Dividends paid to ARM shareholders in October 2017 were R1 236 million (1H F2017: R426 million).

Capital expenditure was 23% (R114 million) higher at R603 million for the period (1H F2017: R489 million). Attributable
capital expenditure at the Assmang joint venture was flat at R558 million (1H F2017: R555 million).

Debt

Gross debt at the end of the period was 38% lower than the corresponding period at R3 021 million (31 December 2016:
R4 843 million). This was mainly due to a reduction in the amount owing on the ARM Corporate facility as well as the
discontinued consolidation of the Vale/ARM joint operation loans following the disposal of Lubambe Mine. There was no
debt at ARM Ferrous at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: nil).

The decrease in gross debt coupled with the proceeds received from the disposal of investments of R741 million resulted
in a reduced net debt at 31 December 2017 of R1 102 million (31 December 2016: R3 508 million).

Assets

The consolidated ARM total assets of R32.5 billion (1H F2017: R31.7 billion) include ARM's investment in Harmony on
31 December 2017 of R1 444 million (31 December 2016: R2 006 million). Harmony's share price was R22.69 per share
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: R31.53 per share, 30 June 2017: R21.68 per share and 30 June 2016: R52.47
per share).

Events after the reporting date

Events after the reporting date are set out in note 16 to the financial statements. Since 31 December 2017, ARM received
a dividend of R2 000 million from Assmang.

ARM Ferrous

ARM Ferrous headline earnings from continuing operations were 26% higher from R1 401 million in 1H F2017 to
R1 765 million. This increase was primarily due to a 131% increase in the Manganese Division headline earnings as a
result of:

- a 10% increase in manganese ore sales volumes;
- proportionately more high-grade manganese ore being sold after the completion of the Ncwhaning II Shaft upgrade
  which resulted in a 24% increase in average realised US Dollar prices for export manganese ore;
- 17% increase in manganese alloy sales volumes as Sakura Ferroalloys Project ramped up; and
- a 69% increase in manganese alloy prices.

Headline earnings (including discontinued operations) were 1% lower at R1 765 million (1H F2017: R1 779 million) as
the 1H F2017 headline earnings included R378 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% interest in Dwarsrivier
Chrome Mine (which was disclosed as a discontinued operation in 1H F2017).

Average realised US Dollar prices for export iron ore were flat compared to 1H F2017.

*  The 1H F2017 chrome division headline earnings include R756 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% stake in the
   Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine.

Higher sales volumes across all the Ferrous commodities also contributed positively to headline earnings.

Iron ore sales volumes were 4% higher at a record 9.1 million tonnes (1H F2017: 8.8 million). Of the 9.1 million tonnes sold,
7.4 million tonnes were exported and 1.7 million tonnes were sold locally. The rail link established from Beeshoek Mine to
the Saldanha Export Channel has created additional flexibility for Beeshoek Mine to access the export market.

Manganese ore sales volumes increased by 10% from 1.4 million tonnes in 1H F2017 to 1.6 million tonnes in 1H F2018.
Of the 1.6 million tonnes sold 1.5 million tonnes were exported. Production volumes at Black Rock Mine increased by 43%
as the Nchwaning II Shaft returned to full production after being out of commission for the entire duration of 1H F2017 as
part of the shaft's refurbishment.

Total manganese alloy sales volumes increased by 17% to 162 thousand tonnes (1H F2017: 139 thousand tonnes) as
the Sakura Ferroalloys Project (Sakura) ramped up. Manganese alloy production at Sakura increased from 68 thousand
tonnes to 122 thousand tonnes as both furnaces became fully operational. Good operational management and improved
availability of furnaces also contributed positively to production volumes at this operation.

At Cato Ridge Works, alloy production increased by 2% to 68 thousand tonnes, however, sales volumes were 35% lower
at 57 thousand tonnes as spot sales from Cato Ridge Works were held back in 1H F2018 to enable the plant to deliver on
contract sales to consignment customers in the United States. Due to this, consignment stocks were high at 31 December
2017. These stocks are all committed and contracted to be sold.

Machadodorp Works is currently only recovering ferrochrome from the slag dump through the metal recovery plant and will
start to recover ferromanganese from the slag dumps.

Unit production costs at all the Ferrous operations continue to be under pressure mainly owing to increases in the costs of
labour, electricity and raw materials. Various cost saving initiatives continue to be implemented.

On-mine unit production costs at the iron ore operations were well managed. On-mine unit production costs at Khumani
Mine were kept flat at R201 per tonne compared to the corresponding period while Beeshoek Mine achieved a 5% reduction
in on-mine unit production costs.

Black Rock on-mine unit production costs increased by 23% from R434 per tonne in 1H F2017 to R534 per tonne in
1H F2018. On-mine unit production costs had reduced by 11% from R489 per tonne in 1H F2016 to R434 per tonne in
1H F2017 mainly due to the exclusion of fixed costs of R188 million from on-mine production costs. The R188 million was
not included in on-mine production costs as Nchwaning II Shaft was closed for the entire duration of 1H F2017, the on-mine
production costs therefore could not be attributed directly to production volumes due to the shaft closure.

The mine's 1H F2018 total on-mine production costs were 76% higher compared to 1H F2017 while production volumes
were 43% higher compared to the previous period.

The increase in Black Rock Mine unit cost of sales was below inflation at 5%.

At Beeshoek Mine, the capital expenditure was R182 million, mainly due to waste-rock removal from the Village Pit as well
as replacement of mining equipment. Khumani Mine's capital expenditure was R426 million, consisting mainly of waste
stripping at King Pit, infill drilling, and replacement of mining equipment and fleet.

At Black Rock Mine, capital expenditure was R540 million, consisting mainly of the Black Rock Project, fire protection,

Projects

Black Rock Project

The modernisation project at Black Rock Mine is continuing on time and within budget. Ramp up of production volumes
from the project will proceed as planned in close synchronisation with Transnet.

The new load-out facility and rail loop system have been completed and are being commissioned.

The underground silo and the Graben conveyor system at Nchwaning II Shaft is still under construction and is progressing
as planned. The underground work will take a further 24 months to complete where after an increase in production output
from Nchwaning II Shaft can be expected.

Logistics

Assmang's manganese ore export volumes are fully contracted with Transnet for F2018 and F2019 through both the Port
Elizabeth and Saldanha export channels. In terms of the long-term allocation, Assmang is in ongoing negotiations with
Transnet to synchronise the ramp up of Black Rock Mine with the medium- and longer-term (MECA2 and MECA3) Transnet
capacity process.

Transnet provided the regular service on the iron ore export supply route from the Khumani Mine to the Port of Saldanha.

Assmang continued to support a junior iron ore producer and exporter by loading rail wagons at its Khumani Mine load-out
facility.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese
and chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum's attributable headline earnings increased by 26% to R226 million (1H F2017: R179 million), mainly as a
result of a sharp rise in the Rand palladium (34%), rhodium (72%) and copper (26%) prices and improved volumes from
Modikwa Mine.

Lower PGM production at Two Rivers Mine (14%) was offset by an increase at Modikwa Mine (16%) and Nkomati
Mine (37%), resulting in ARM Platinum's PGM ounces (on a 100% basis) improving by 3% to 422 104 6E ounces
(1H F2017:407 846 6E ounces).

Nkomati Mine's nickel production increased slightly to 6 733 tonnes (1H F2016: 6 627 tonnes) as a result of higher tonnes
milled (14%) and improved recoveries at the PCMZ concentrator plant. Nickel sales were however 31% lower than the
corresponding period due to shipping delays in December 2017.

Unit production costs were well controlled at Modikwa and Nkomati mines with both mines achieving below inflation unit
cost increases. Unit production costs at Two Rivers Mine were flat on a Rand per tonne basis but increased by 14% on a
Rand per PGM ounce basis, mainly as a result of the lower PGMs produced due to grade decline.

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on a 100% basis) decreased by 10% to R644 million (1H F2017:
R718 million).

At Modikwa Mine, the North Shaft execution project recommenced in September 2017. The development team took
delivery of re-built equipment and development commenced in November 2017. This resulted in Modikwa Mine's capital
expenditure increasing by 36% to R218 million (1H F2017: R160 million).

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers Mine, 24% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment. The deepening of
the Main and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 60% of the total capital
expenditure.

Nkomati Mine's capital expenditure was mainly for the replacement of the Onverwacht Tails line (R51 million), as well as
continued construction of the second anchored pile wall (R24 million). Capitalised waste stripping costs decreased by
R250 million or 69% due to rescheduling and reallocation of equipment between the Eastern and Western sections. Waste
stripping was also negatively affected by constraints in the pit as the Western Section was being stabilised with pile wall
2 construction. The mine is continuing with buttressing work in the area. Waste stripping volumes were 11 million tonnes
in 1H F2018 and will be accelerated in the last quarter of F2018 to an annualised rate of 23 million tonnes. The mine has
re-evaluated the accelerated waste stripping plan and reduced planned waste stripping volumes to 23 million tonnes per
annum. This is expected to impact nickel volumes produced in the current financial year, F2019 and F2020.

Two Rivers Mine

Headline earnings at Two Rivers Mine reduced by 16% to R173 million (1H F2017: R205 million). A 2% decrease in
tonnes milled and an 8% reduction in grade, led to PGMs produced declining by 14% to 178 702 6E ounces (1H F2017:
207 147 6E ounces).

The decrease in tonnes milled can be ascribed to a two-day safety-related stoppage at the plant while the decline in
head grade is largely attributed to an increase in split reef proportion in the ore mix following the depletion of normal
reef in the upper levels of both the Main and North declines. There is currently limited flexibility in blending the ore from
split reef and normal reef sources due to face length constraints at Main Decline. Thick areas of split reef are expected
to continue affecting the overall mining grade negatively for the next 14 months, resulting in overall mining grades being
between 3.70 and 3.80 6E grams per tonne (1H F2017: 3.85 6E grams per tonne). To mitigate the declining grade, there
is a drive to increase mining volumes from high-grade panels to enhance the ore mix as well as undercutting the internal
waste wherever practically possible.

An attempt to scalp internal waste, both underground and on surface, by means of burden controls within the UG2
internal waste band and the 'waste scalper screen', has shown very limited improvement in grade due to the nature of
fragmentation of internal waste (i.e. finer fragmentations).

The accelerated sinking at the Main Decline into the Tamboti area is in progress after the Two Rivers Mine amended
mining right, including the Tamboti mining rights was executed by the DMR from 9 November 2017.

Chrome sales volumes decreased as a result of lower tonnes milled and lower grade. This, combined with a 27%
decline in the Rand chrome price, resulted in chrome cash operating profit declining by 53% to R102 million (1H F2017:
R218 million). Chrome concentrate sales volumes declined by 19% to 115 657 tonnes as a result of a lower chrome yield,
a direct consequence of the lower PGM grade.

Unit production costs on a Rand per tonne milled basis were flat at R694 per tonne (1H F2017: R692 per tonne). The
Rand per PGM ounce produced, however, increased by 14% to R6 655 per 6E ounce (1H F2017: R5 838 per 6E ounce),
primarily as a direct result of the decline in PGM ounces produced due to the low grade. These unit production costs
were flat compared to 2H F2017 which were R6 599 per 6E ounce. There was a 56 222 tonne decrease in the UG2
Run-of-Mine stockpile to a total of 251 663 tonnes of ore as at 31 December 2017.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa Mine achieved attributable headline earnings of R36 million (1H F2017: R54 million headline loss). A 21%
(216 thousand tonnes) increase in tonnes milled, offset by a 6% decrease in head grade, resulted in PGM production
increasing by 16% to 175 899 6E ounces (1H F2017: 151 562 6E ounces). Of the 1.24 million tonnes milled, 94 thousand
tonnes were purchased from Mototolo Platinum Mine. Modikwa Mine is working on a plan to reduce dilution and improve
the grade.

Unit production costs increased by 3%, to R8 832 per 6E PGM ounce (1H F2017: R8 559 per 6E PGM ounce) and were
lower on a Rand per tonne basis at R1 258 per tonne (1H F2017: R1 273 per tonne).

Production ramp up at South 2 Shaft has been slower than expected, however an upward trend has commenced particularly
in the last quarter of the financial year. The focus remains on ramping production up at this shaft.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine generated attributable headline earnings of R17 million (1H F2017: R28 million) for the period under review.
The decline in earnings is due to lower nickel sales volumes (4 178 tonnes vs 6 079 tonnes) and a 62% decline in the
Rand chrome price. Nkomati Mine had 11 thousand tonnes of nickel concentrate in stock as at 31 December 2017 due to
shipping delays. The shipping schedule is expected to be back on track by April 2018. The shipping logistics are managed
by Metals Trade Overseas AG.

Despite chrome concentrate sales volumes increasing by 105% to 198 928 tonnes (1H F2017: 96 821 tonnes), the chrome
contribution to cash operating profit reduced by 27% to R118 million (1H F2017: R161 million) as a result of the lower
chrome price realised.

Nkomati Mine's total tonnes milled increased by 14% to 4.08 million tonnes. Nickel units produced however, improved by
only 2% to 6 733 tonnes (1H F2017: 6 627 tonnes). The main reasons for this are:

- Pit 3 mining operations remain constrained as a result of the historical mining inefficiencies and geotechnical issues,
  resulting in insufficient MMZ ore availability during the reporting period.
- Approximately 1 million tonnes of VLG MMZ stockpile material was processed during the period to complement the
  shortfall of MMZ, ensuring that both mills are operating at maximum capacity. The VLG MMZ material, with an average
  nickel grade of 0.17%, resulted in the average mill feed grade declining by 15%.
- The VLG material and MMZ ore contained significantly more PGMs and copper than anticipated, resulting in the
  production of these metals increasing by 37% and 38%, respectively, when compared to the period. The by-product
  content of this material is being evaluated as the mine continues to process more of it.
- Waste stripping on the Western Section of the pile wall commenced on 1 October 2017. A saprolite failure occurred
  which resulted in the mine having to re-evaluate the accelerated waste stripping plan. Planned waste stripping has
  therefore reverted back to the old life-of-mine plan. Waste stripping of 23 million tonnes per annum is planned which is
  expected to impact nickel volumes from F2018 to F2020.

Nkomati Mine's on-mine unit production cost (excluding capitalised waste stripping) was 22% higher at R311 per tonne
(1H F2017: R254 per tonne). The reduction in waste stripping volumes (as discussed above) resulted in unit cost per
tonne milled (including capitalised waste stripping) declining by 5% to R339 per tonne (1H F2017: R356 per tonne). C1
unit cash cost net of by-products (which includes capitalised waste stripping cost) was 18% lower at US$4.95/lb (1H
F2017: US$6.05/lb) of nickel produced. The decrease in C1 unit cash costs was due to higher by-product credits combined
with decreased capitalised waste stripping costs. R114 million of waste stripping costs (1H F2017: R364 million) were
capitalised during the period due to lower production.

Projects

Modikwa Mine

In order to maintain the current production profile and ramp-up the operation, Modikwa Mine initiated the North Shaft
Deepening Project and the South 2 Shaft Project. The current status of these projects are detailed below:

- Deepening of North Shaft - This project entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 7 to Level 9 thereby
  establishing three new mining levels. To curtail capital expenditure, portions of this project were deferred during F2015,
  resulting in current development being delayed at Level 9. Level 7 and 8 are both fully equipped with all the required
  mining infrastructure. The chairlift installation was commissioned in February 2017.

- Sinking of South 2 Shaft - This project scope includes the establishment of a decline shaft system South of the current
  South Shaft Infrastructure. The first phase of the project is expected to enhance mining flexibility while also contributing
  to the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has been completed and is expected to take the
  production capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by F2019. The second phase will follow and increase the design
  capacity of this shaft system to 100 000 tonnes per month.

The ARM Platinum division comprises:

- Three operating mines:

  - Modikwa - ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities hold an
    8.5% effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Anglo American Platinum.

  - Two Rivers - an ARM subsidiary in which ARM has a 54% shareholding and Implats 46%. The increase in
    shareholding is effective 9 November 2017, when Two Rivers' amended mining right, including the mining rights
    transferred to it, was executed by the DMR.

  - Nkomati - a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.

- Two prospecting rights:

  - the ""Kalplats prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum holds 46% and Platinum Australia (PLA) holds 44%, with
    Anglo American holding 10%.

  - the ""Kalplats Extended Area prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum and PLA each have a 50% interest.

ARM Coal

ARM Coal's attributable headline earnings increased by 62% to R160 million (1H F2017: R99 million). This improvement
was mainly due to the average realised US Dollar export prices being 20% higher compared to 1H F2017 with the realised
price exceeding US$75 per tonne.

Seaborne coal prices were positively impacted by an increase in demand from India and China, largely due to gas supply
shortages in China over the winter months. The impact of the higher prices was partially reduced by a strengthening of
the average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. Realised Rand prices increased from R873 per tonne in 1H F2017 to
R1 000 per tonne in 1H F2018.

More than 70% of the export volumes at GGV Mine were high quality (RB1) coal while only 34% of PCB exports were RB1
quality. This resulted in PCB's average received export price being lower compared to GGV Mine.

ARM attributable saleable tonnes produced of 2.59 million tonnes were slightly higher than the 2.54 million tonnes
produced in 1H F2017.

Goedgevonden (GGV) Mine

GGV Mine's attributable cash operating profit increased by 63% from R147 million in 1H F2017 to R240 million in 1H F2018.

Average received export US Dollar prices increased by 34% compared to 1H F2017. The impact of the higher prices was
partially reduced by a 4% reduction in export sales volumes and a 4% strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar. This
resulted in an increase in attributable export revenue of R86 million.

Production volumes at GGV Mine were 9% lower than 1H F2017 partially due to a rollover of low in-pit inventory levels
from 2H F2017. The in-pit inventory levels have since improved during 1H F2018. Production was further impacted by
safety related stoppages and community protests.

On-mine unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 9% to R315, mainly as a result of a decrease in production
volumes.

Attributable headline earnings increased by R61 million, from a headline loss of R26 million in 1H F2017 to headline
earnings of R35 million in 1H F2018.

Participating Coal Business (PCB)

PCB attributable cash operating profit decreased by 5% to R511 million (1H F2017: R539 million).

An 11% increase in average received US Dollar coal prices together with a 1% increase in export coal sales volumes,
improved revenue by R146 million. This was partially offset by a 4% strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar which
negatively impacted revenue by R52 million. Revenue from inland coal sales was R31 million lower than the previous
period, mainly due to a decrease in local coal sales volumes.

Unit production costs per saleable tonne increased by 22% from R273 per tonne in 1H F2017 to R334 per tonne in
1H F2018. On-mine production costs in the previous period benefited from processing of stockpile ore built up during
the Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP). The Tweefontein operation has since stabilised and is now operating at
the planned unit production costs which was estimated at approximately R300 per tonne. The 8% increase in saleable
production together with the reduction in the benefits obtained from the low cost stockpile resulted in an increase in on-
mine costs of R142 million.

Headline earnings attributable to ARM were flat at R125 million.

Discontinued operation: ARM Copper

For the six months under review, ARM Copper's headline loss improved from R72 million in 1H F2017 to R6 million
in 1H F2018. During 1H F2018 the average realised copper price of US$6 595 per tonne was 32% higher than the
comparable period in F2017.

Lubambe Mine

Following the year of consolidation in F2017 where Lubambe Mine operated at a reduced target production level of 80 000
tonnes ore per month, development metres increased by 94% to 7 113 metres in 1H F2018 (1H F2017: 3 667 metres). The
upgrade in underground pumping capacity has enabled the mine to recommence with development in previously flooded
areas. The increased development profile enabled Lubambe Mine to increase its developed ore reserves over the duration
of the six months.

Lubambe Mine's C1 cash cost were negatively impacted by low stoping reserves and the increased ore development.
C1 unit production costs for 1H F2018 at US$2.82/lb were 27% higher than the same comparable period in F2017.

In order to preserve cash flow, capital expenditure was restricted during 1H F2018 with the majority of expenditure related
to the life of mine capital development and upgrades in underground water infrastructure.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)

Harmony reported a 49% increase in headline earnings to R990 million (1H F2017: R657 million) or 224 cents per share
(1H F2017: 150 cents per share).

Revenue for the six months under review remained relatively flat in comparison to 1H F2017 as the average gold price
received decreased by 1% to R580 672/kg (US$1 348/oz) and total gold sales increased by 2%. Forward gold sale
contracts of 3 359kg or 108 000oz, with an average price of R692 836/kg (US$1 609/oz), matured during 1H F2018. This
contributed R503 million (US$38 million) to revenue.

The hedging programmes realised gains of R771 million (US$58 million) for the December 2017 period. Management
continues to top-up these programmes when the market presents attractive opportunities to do so. The gold hedging
programme currently provides cover for approximately 19% of the expected gold production over the next two years.
A summary of all the open hedging contracts is included in the Harmony 1H F2018 results published on 13 February 2018.

Production costs decreased by R264 million or 4% compared to the corresponding period. The decrease in Rand terms
was mainly due to the capitalisation of production costs as a result of the re-investment into Hidden Valley.

Harmony's net profit for 1H F2018 was R897 million compared to R1 539 million for the comparative period which included
a gain on bargain purchase of R848 million.

Harmony completed the acquisition of the Moab Khotsong operations effective 1 March 2018 - which includes the Great
Noligwa underground mine and related infrastructure from AngloGold Ashanti Limited for a consideration of US$300 million
in cash. The Moab Khotsong acquisition is expected to increase Harmony's cash flow from year one and unlock value by
expanding the reserves and extending life-of-mine.

The Harmony investment is reflected on the ARM Statement of Financial Position at R1 444 million based on the Harmony
share price at 31 December 2017 of R22.69 per share. Changes in the value of the investment in Harmony, to the extent
that they represent a significant or prolonged decline below the cost of the investment, are adjusted through the Income
Statement, net of tax. Gains are accounted for, net of deferred capital gains tax, through the Statement of Comprehensive
Income. Dividends from Harmony are recognised in the ARM Income Statement on the last day of registration following
dividend declaration.

Harmony's results for the six months ended 31 December 2017 can be viewed on Harmony's website at http://www.harmony.co.za.

ARM owns 14.3% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Outlook

US Dollar commodity prices for most of the commodities that ARM produces remain strong into 2H F2018. In particular,
premiums for the high-quality iron ore and manganese ore appear to be underpinned by ongoing Chinese supply-side
reforms, improved efficiencies in the Chinese steel industry and increasingly stringent environmental policies. Commodity
prices are, however, expected to remain volatile.

Uncertainties into 2H F2018 include (i) the outlook for the Rand versus US Dollar exchange rate; (ii) changes in South
African mining regulations; (iii) the dynamic socio-economic environment around mines; and (iv) above-inflation unit cost
increases.

Re-engagement between government, the mining industry and other stakeholders on Mining Charter III is positive for the
South African mining industry and is contributing towards improved investor sentiment.

ARM continues to proactively manage cost pressures whilst ensuring efficient production levels to maximise profit margins.

We are also focused on the allocation of capital to ensure that a responsible balance is achieved between re-investment
into the business, shareholder returns, maintaining a robust financial position and value enhancing growth. We are pleased
to have declared a maiden interim dividend and will continue to consider interim and annual dividends taking into account
amongst things our financial position, the outlook for our operations and commodity markets, capital expenditure and
growth.

Further, ARM is committed to managing the impact of our mining activities on all stakeholders. We are committed to
investing in ways that will ensure mutual benefit to surrounding communities, Government and the environments in which
we operate.

ARM remains confident about the future of our business.

     * AIP: Annual Improvement Project
   
     The Group does not intend early adopting any of the above amendments, standards or interpretations
     ARM continuously evaluates the impact of these standards and amendments, the most prominent being IFRS 9 Financial
     Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases. In summary the following are the current
     expectations in relation to IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. (Refer next page).

     IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
     
     As previously reported, ARM has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after
     1 January 2018 (i.e. for the financial year beginning 1 July 2018 for ARM).
     
     The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the financial statements is not currently known and cannot be reliably estimated as the
     impact will be dependent on the financial instruments that ARM holds and economic conditions prevailing at that time as well as
     accounting elections and judgements which ARM make in the future.
     
     The new standard may require ARM to revise its accounting processes and internal controls related to reporting financial instruments
     and these possible changes have not yet been ascertained.
     
     ARM has embarked on the process of determining the impact that the new impairment model, on the basis of expected credit losses,
     will have on the impairment provisions. As part of this process ARM will finalise the impairment methodologies that it will apply under
     IFRS 9.
     
     Disclosure requirements and changes in presentation are expected to change the nature and extent of ARM's disclosures about its
     financial instruments, particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
     
     ARM continues with a process of identifying changes to systems and controls which may be necessary to capture the required data.
     This process is expected to be completed before 30 June 2018.
     
     IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
     
     The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (i.e. for the financial year beginning 1 July 2018
     for ARM).

     ARM has completed a diagnostic impact assessment to identify IFRS 15 gaps between existing and future requirements, as well
     as to establish implementation efforts to be compliant when the standard is implemented. The impact of IFRS 15 was completed
     by assessing the impact across three dimensions: i) scoped-in entities of the group and identified revenue streams, ii) accounting
     principles identified in IFRS 15 on income statement (revenue, EBITDA) and statement of financial position (assets and liabilities)
     items; and iii) Changes to policies and disclosures.
     
     From this, ARM has developed a detailed project plan for the implementation of IFRS 15 and in line with this plan:
     
     - has identified all significant contracts with customers, in the various entities in the Group, in line with the IFRS 15 five-step
       model;
     - has evaluated the different sale contracts in place with its customers, which vary per entity and commodity - there are various
       contracts with complex terms including consignment sales, various shipping terms and provisional pricing;
     - has engaged its various partners on their interpretation of the various contracts;
     - has evaluated practical expedients to be used;
     - has established that a fully retrospective approach will be adopted; and
     - is in the process of finalising its evaluation of the changes required to controls and Information Technology systems relating
       to revenue recognition.
     
     The new standard will have an impact on revenue recognised arising from most of the existing contracts. The critical impact identified
     thus far (amongst others) will be on:
     
     Financial impact
     
     - Split of performance obligations impacts on timing of revenue recognition;
     - Fair value adjustments of provisional pricing index are recognised in fair value adjustments rather than revenue. Judgements
       to use in estimating transaction price in exchange for sale of mining products, including the reasonableness of applying the
       constraint;
     - Possible change in amount of revenue recognised due to estimating transaction price at inception which is not reflective of
       costs incurred or forecasting on the allocation of transaction price to performance obligation - for management services; and
     - EBITDA impact due to customer contract costs and Profit or loss changes due to costs capitalisation.
     
     Disclosure impact
     
     - Provisional pricing values at year end for open contracts;
     - Additional disclosure regarding assumptions used in estimating variable consideration for transaction price, including variable
       consideration on management fees; and
     - Process of assessing recoverability of contract cost including reassessment of useful lives.
     
     Accounting policies

     - Disclosure of qualitative information on performance obligations.
     
     IFRS 16 Leases
     
     The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 (i.e. for the financial year beginning 1 July 2019 for
     ARM). Early adoption is permitted provided that IFRS 15 is adopted at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
     
     As previously reported, ARM continues with the initial assessment of the potential impact of this standard on the financial statements
     but has not yet reached a conclusion if this standard will be early adopted with the implementation of IFRS 15. The decision of the
     date of adoption is expected to be made before 30 June 2018.
     
     ARM must still make a decision on the transition method to be applied as well as the practical expedients to be used, if elected.

3.   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

3.1  Lubambe Copper Mine

     At year end 30 June 2017, there was an impairment reversal following the classification of Lubambe as an asset held for sale (refer
     note 11 and 12). There were no further impairments or impairment reversals at time of sale.

3.2  Nkomati Nickel Mine

     At 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Nkomati Nickel Mine cash generating unit was recognised, largely as a result of:
     i)  A revision of the mine plan with a resultant lower metal output profile.
     ii) Asignificant decline from the prior year forecast long-term price of nickel and a further strengthening of the R/US$ exchange
         rate.

     ARM's attributable share of the impairment charge amounted to R988 million before tax and R711 million after tax.

     The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in terms
     of International Financial Reporting Standards.

     A pre-tax discount rate of 20.72% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and exchange
     rate assumptions.

13.  PROVISION

     Silicosis and tuberculosis class action provision

     In November 2014, a gold mining industry working group was formed to address issues relating to the compensation and
     medical care for occupational lung diseases in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working group comprises ARM,
     Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, Anglo American South Africa Limited, AngloGold Ashanti Limited, Gold Fields Limited
     and Sibanye Gold Limited (collectively ""the Working Group"").

     The Working Group engaged different stakeholders including government, organised labour, other mining companies and
     legal representatives of claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies. These engagements have sought a
     comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks that are fair to past and current
     employees and enable companies to continue to be sustainable over the long-term.

     As a consequence of the progress of negotiations between the Working Group and affected stakeholders, the Company was
     in a position to reliably estimate, within an acceptable range, the Company's share of a possible settlement of the class action
     claims and related costs. ARM recorded a provision of R330 million (discounted) in the results for the year ended 30 June 2017.
     The nominal amount of the provision is R417 million. No changes has been made to this provision since June 2017.

     Notwithstanding the provision raised, the companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the claims brought and
     continue to defend the legal proceedings filed against them. They do, however, believe that they should work together to seek
     a solution to this South African mining industry legacy issue. To this end, the ruling appeal which had been set for hearing from
     19 to 23 March 2018 has been postponed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) until further notice. The
     postponement was in response to a request by the parties involved in the appeal in January 2018.

     The negotiations with the claimants' lawyers are confidential and the Working Group companies are accordingly not able to
     provide any details of the negotiations.
                                                                                                            Unaudited               Audited

TRADING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
31 DECEMBER 2017 (1H F2018)


In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

ARM?s basic earnings per share for 1H F2018 are expected to improve
to between 912 and 930 cents compared to the basic loss per share
of 134 cents reported for the comparative six months ended
31 December 2016 (1H F2017).

The basic loss reported for 1H F2017 included the following special
items:

     -    an attributable impairment of the Nkomati assets of
          R711 million after tax;
     -    an attributable impairment of the Modikwa assets of
          R734 million after tax and non-controlling interest; and
     -    an impairment loss of R422 million within the Assmang joint
          venture related to the sale of Dwarsrivier Mine.

Headline earnings for 1H F2018 have been positively affected by an
increase in average realised US Dollar commodity prices for most
                                                                               1
of the commodities that ARM produces, which was partly offset by a
stronger average realised Rand/US Dollar exchange rate.

Headline earnings per share for 1H F2018 are expected to increase
by between 10% and 16% to between 986 and 1 037 cents (1H F2017;
893 cents).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based
has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors
of ARM.

The Company?s 1H F2018 financial results will be released on
16 March 2018.

ARM operational review

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces a 204% increase in headline earnings for the financial year ended 30 June 2017
(F2017) to R3 196 million (F2016: R1 051 million). The significant increase was mainly as a result of higher US Dollar prices realised
for all the commodities in ARM's portfolio relative to the previous corresponding year. During the financial year under review the
Rand strengthened 6% against the US Dollar partially offsetting the positive impact of higher US Dollar commodity prices.

Dividend declared increased by 189% to 650 cents per share (F2016: 225 cents per share). This is the highest dividend to date
and is ARM's eleventh consecutive annual dividend.

ARM Ferrous headline earnings increased by 157% to R3 709 million as iron ore, manganese ore and manganese alloy prices
recovered. The division was able to deliver into this improved price environment realising average US Dollar prices for export
iron ore that were 45% better than F2016. The average realised US Dollar price for export manganese ore was  93% higher
than F2016.

ARM Platinum headline earnings improved by R360 million as each operation in the division improved its contribution to earnings.
There was a significant turnaround at Nkomati Mine from a headline loss of R244 million in F2016 to  headline earnings of
R91 million in the year under review. Two Rivers Mine headline earnings were up 2% to R325 million (F2016: R318 million) while
Modikwa Mine reported a reduced headline loss of R66 million (F2016: R84 million).

ARM Coal headline earnings of R82 million in F2017 are a significant turnaround from the headline loss of R297 million reported
in F2016. The improvement was mainly due to the PCB operations which contributed R181 million headline earnings to ARM
(F2016: R210 million headline loss). The Goedgevonden (GGV) Mine continued to be loss-making as operational challenges
negatively impacted on sales volumes and unit costs.

The ARM Copper headline loss was R203 million (F2016: R361 million). On 15 August 2017 ARM and Vale announced the
disposal of their 80% interest in the Lubambe Mine which is discussed in further detail below. The Lubambe Mine is classified as
a discontinuing operation for reporting purposes.

The Corporate and other headline loss was R778 million (F2016: R301 million headline earnings) and includes a provision of
R330 million for a possible settlement of the silicosis and tuberculosis class action claims and related costs.

*Following the announcement of the disposal of ARM's interest in Lubambe Mine, the operation has been classified as held
 for sale at 30 June 2017, in terms of IFRS. As such intercompany interest accrued to ARM Company from Lubambe Mine of
 R219 million (F2016: R194 million) has been eliminated from both the ARM Copper and Corporate and other segments.

These results have been  achieved in conjunction with  ARM's partners at the various operations: Anglo American Platinum
Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk Nickel Africa (Pty) Ltd
(Norilsk), Glencore  Holdings South Africa (Pty) Ltd  (Glencore), Vale S.A. (Vale) and Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines
Investment Holdings Plc (ZCCM-IH). 

The provisional results for the year ended 30 June 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.
Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

ARM continued to focus on improving its safety performance, restructuring loss-making and cash-negative operations,
maximising revenue, improving operational efficiencies and reducing unit costs, optimising capital expenditure and improving
its financial position.

Commitment to safety and health

ARM remains committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. There have been
no fatalities at any of the ARM operations since May 2015, resulting in ARM being fatality-free for the past two financial years.

In the financial year under review ARM's Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) improved by 14% from 0.32 per
200  000 man-hours in F2016 to 0.28 per 200  000 man-hours in F2017. The number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) reduced to
65 (F2016: 86) and reportable injuries reduced from 60 in F2016 to 47 in F2017.

Safety-related stoppages (i.e. Section 54 Notices) reduced to 20 from 28 in F2016. 

Safety achievements in the financial year under review:

-    ARM Ferrous achieved an LTIFR of 0.17 per 200 000 man-hours. This is a 23% improvement compared to F2016 and is the
     lowest LTIFR achieved to date by the division;
-    Beeshoek Mine completed 15 000 fatality-free production shifts in November 2016;
-    Black Rock Mine completed five million fatality free shifts on 11 October 2016 and received an award from the Department
     of Mineral Resources (DMR) as the safest underground mine in the Northern Cape region;
-    Khumani Mine achieved one million fatality free shifts at the beginning of December 2016;
-    ARM Platinum achieved an LTIFR of 0.38 compared to 0.44 in F2016. This represents a 14% improvement and is the lowest
     LTIFR achieved by ARM Platinum to date;
-    Modikwa Mine achieved four million fatality-free shifts in July 2017; and
-    Nkomati Mine achieved a full financial year without a lost time injury.

Safety figures and statistics are reported on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations.

F2016 safety statistics include Dwarsrivier Mine.

Restructuring loss-making operations

Lubambe Mine

Following announcements that the Lubambe Mine was under review, ARM announced on 15 August 2017 that an agreement for
the disposal of ARM's and Vale's 80% interest in Lubambe Mine to EMR Capital had been concluded. The interest sold includes
the equity holding in Lubambe Mine as well as loans to Lubambe Mine.

The purchase consideration for the 80% interest is US$97 million. The final amount receivable is subject to, amongst others, the
following adjustments which will be finalised on completion of the disposal:

-    Settlement of Lubambe Mine's general banking facility; and
-    Additional funding provided to Lubambe Mine by ARM and Vale between 1 May 2017 and the completion date.

Completion of the disposal is subject to the fulfilment of conditions precedent.

The buyer, EMR Capital, is a specialist resources private equity management firm with a proven investment track record spanning
over 20 years.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine contributed headline earnings of R91 million for the financial year under review. As previously reported, the mine
is entering a challenging period for the next three years which is expected to negatively impact volumes, operating and capital
costs. Waste stripping is being accelerated in order to open up ore reserves to gain increased mining flexibility while the pit
requires piling work on the Western section to improve slope stability due to saprolite slumping in the area. The Eastern section of
the pit has lower grade ore resulting in a reduction in the forecast production volumes for the next three years. Nkomati Mine has
maintained its on-mine unit production costs (excluding capitalised waste stripping) below R300 per tonne for the last six years
and has limited scope to reduce on-mine unit costs any further.

The abovementioned operational challenges coupled with a subdued short-term outlook for nickel and chrome prices are
expected to negatively impact the mine's future cash flows. The mine has considered a number of alternatives to minimise
funding requirements from partners. ARM is concerned about the outlook for nickel prices in the short-term but remains positive
on the medium- to long-term outlook. ARM is engaging our partner on the best way forward for the mine and various options are
being considered.

Modikwa Mine

The Modikwa Mine headline loss reduced by 21% to R66 million when compared to the corresponding previous financial year
(F2016: R84 million). PGMs produced at the mine increased by 3% as the head grade and plant recoveries improved. Unit cost
per PGM ounce increased below inflation at 3%. Despite these improvements Modikwa remained loss-making and is also likely
to require further funding support from the partners. 

Interventions are under way to improve the mine's profitability and cash flow generation. These include the cessation of mining
in areas that are producing at a loss. 

In the fourth quarter of the 2017 financial year Modikwa Mine reported improvement in tonnes milled, production volumes and
unit costs which positions the mine well for the coming financial year. Unit production costs for the fourth quarter were R1 174 per
tonne milled, compared to R1 265 per tonne milled reported for F2017.

The mine is continuing with the deepening of the North Shaft and sinking of the new South 2 Shaft. ARM and Anglo Platinum are
aligned to optimise the associated capital expenditure due to the low platinum price environment and are focused on returning
the operation to profitability.

ARM Coal

ARM and Glencore Operations South Africa are in discussions concerning the restructuring of the ARM Coal partner loans to
improve ARM's debt obligations in terms of these loans.

Improving operational efficiencies and reducing unit production costs
Positioning all operations below the 50 th percentile of the respective global commodity cost curve remains a key part of
ARM's strategy.

Two Rivers Mine's unit production costs on a Rand per 6E ounce increased by 10% from F2016 as production volumes decreased
owing to a reduction in head grade due to mining of split reef in the South of the mine. Undercutting of the lower grade ore and
scalping of waste rock on surface are some of the measures implemented to improve the Two Rivers Mine head grade. Two Rivers
received consent during August 2017 i) to transfer the Tamboti rights to it, and ii) to have its mining right amended accordingly.
The amended mining right will be issued to Two Rivers imminently at which point ARM's interest in Two Rivers will increase
to 54%.

Nkomati Mine achieved a decrease in on-mine unit production costs to R284 per tonne milled. C1 unit cash costs, net of
by-products, increased by 15% due to lower nickel volumes produced and increased waste stripping.

On-mine unit production costs  at GGV Mine increased by 35% as a result of lower  production volumes, low availability of
equipment and additional expenditure to increase in-pit stock levels due to waste stripping being behind schedule.

Improving the financial position
The cash dividend received from Assmang increased significantly to R2  488 million in the financial year under review. This,
along with other cash generated, enabled ARM to fully repay its corporate borrowing facility.  The consolidated net debt of
R4 235 million at 30 June 2016 reduced to net debt of R1 271 million as at 30 June 2017. The ARM Ferrous attributable cash and
cash equivalents balance at 30 June 2017 was R3 165 million (F2016: R2 399 million).

Changes to Mineral Resources and Reserves
There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Reserves as disclosed in the Integrated Annual Report
for the financial year ended 30 June 2016, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the operations with the
exception of:

-    Dwarsrivier Mine Mineral Resources and Reserves which are no longer reported by ARM after completion of the disposal
     of ARM's interest to Assore in July 2016.
-    The UG2 Mineral Reserves (Proved and Probable) at Two Rivers Mine which decreased from 43.25 million tonnes at 3.56g/t
     (6E) in 2016 to 33.25 million tonnes at 3.47g/t (6E) in 2017. The net loss in tonnage and 6E ounces is primarily due to the
     mining depletion during the Financial Year 2016/2017, undercut mining in the split reef area, a reduction in the mining height
     in some areas as a result of remodelling and the mining design changes in the faulted area on the North Decline area.

An updated Mineral Resources and Reserves Statement will be issued in the 2017 Integrated Annual Report to be published in
October 2017.

Financial commentary

Following the announcement of the disposal of ARM's and Vale's 80% interest in Lubambe Copper Mine, Lubambe Mine has
been classified as held for sale at 30 June 2017 and is disclosed as a discontinuing operation in terms of International Financial
Reporting Standards. The F2016 Income Statement has therefore been re-presented.

Completion of the disposal is subject to the fulfilment of conditions precedent.

Headline earnings from continuing operations for the financial year to 30 June 2017 of R3 399 million were 141% higher than the
prior year headline earnings (F2016: R1 412 million). This equates to headline earnings per share from continuing operations of
R17.91 (F2016: R6.63 per share).

The Board declared its eleventh consecutive annual dividend of R6.50 per share  (F2016: R2.25 per share) after the
financial year-end.

ARM's basic earnings from continuing operations for F2017  were R1 431 million (F2016: R1  199 million) and were
negatively impacted by:

-    an attributable impairment previously reported in the interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 (1H F2017)
     of the Nkomati Mine assets of R711 million after tax;
-    an attributable impairment previously reported in 1H F2017 of the Modikwa Mine assets of R734 million after tax and
     non-controlling interest; and
-    an attributable impairment loss of R373 million within the Assmang joint venture related to the sale of Dwarsrivier.

F2016 special items amounted to  a R1  616  million loss after tax and non-controlling interest, largely relating to attributable
discontinuing operation (impairment of Lubambe Copper Mine  assets of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest).
Additional special items are set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The reconciliation of basic earnings to headline earnings
is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.

Sales from continuing operations for the year were unchanged at R8.16 billion (F2016: R8.16 billion).

Most operations have achieved unit production cost increases that are either at or lower than inflation.

The positive impact of higher realised US Dollar prices for all the commodities in ARM's portfolio was partially offset by the
strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar. The F2017 average Rand/US  Dollar exchange rate of R13.60/US$ was 6%
stronger than the average of R14.51/US$ for F2016. For reporting purposes, the closing exchange rate was R13.05/US$ (30 June
2016: R14.68/US$).

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) from continuing operations, excluding special items and
income from associates and joint ventures, were R922 million (F2016: R1 415 million), which is 35% lower than F2016, largely
as a result of unrealised foreign exchange losses in the Corporate segment of R270 million (F2016: R347 million unrealised
foreign exchange gains) and the recognition of a provision of R330 million in F2017 for a possible settlement of the silicosis and
tuberculosis class action claims and related costs.

Segmental EBITDA margins are reflected in the graph on page 12.

Income from joint venture amounts to R3 265 million, which includes the negative impact of special items, and is 151% higher
than the R1 301 million reported in F2016.

Detailed segmental headline earnings contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

-    The ARM Ferrous contribution to headline earnings amounted to R3 709 million (F2016: R1  441 million). This increase
     of 157% compared to F2016  is largely due to  higher US Dollar commodity prices. The iron ore division contributed
     R2 187 million (F2016: R1 215 million), while the manganese division contributed R1 161 million (F2016: R198 million) to the
     ARM group headline earnings.
-    ARM Platinum's headline earnings contribution, which includes the results of Nkomati Mine, was R350 million (F2016:
     R10 million loss). The increased contribution is primarily due to the positive earnings contribution from Nkomati Mine of
     R91 million (F2016: R244 million headline loss).
-    ARM Coal contributed headline earnings of R82 million (F2016: R297 million headline loss) largely as a result of the headline
     earnings contribution of the PCB Coal business of R181 million (F2016: R210 million headline loss), partially offset by higher
     finance charges in GGV and PCB.
-    The ARM Copper segment result was a headline loss of R203 million (F2016: R361 million). This result includes interest
     of R56 million (F2016: R36 million) on the shareholder loan. The translation of the F2017 Income Statement to Rand was
     calculated at the F2017 average exchange rate of R13.60/US$ (F2016: R14.51/US$).
-    The ARM Strategic Services and Exploration segment costs were R28 million (F2016: R23 million).
-    The ARM Corporate, other companies and consolidation segment reflects a headline loss of R778 million for the year

     (F2016: R301 million earnings). This is largely due to unrealised foreign exchange losses on US Dollar loans made by ARM
     to Lubambe Mine, which entity's functional currency is the US Dollar, resulting from the Rand versus the US Dollar exchange
     rate strengthening from R14.68/US$ at 30 June 2016 to R13.05/US$ at 30 June 2017. The ARM Company loans to Lubambe
     Mine amounted to US$183 million at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: US$158 million). Also included in the ARM Corporate,
     other companies and consolidation segment headline loss is a provision of R330 million for the possible settlement of the
     silicosis and tuberculosis class action claims and related costs. As a consequence of the progress made by the industry
     working group on occupational lung disease (of which ARM is party) in the negotiations between the group and affected
     stakeholders, ARM is now in a position to reliably estimate within an acceptable range the Company's share of a possible
     settlement of the class action claims and related costs. The nominal amount of the provision is R417 million. Refer to
     note 14 in the financial results for further details.

At 30 June 2017 cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations amounted to R1 488 million (F2016: R1  289 million).
This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R3 165 million (F2016:
R2 399 million). 

As previously reported, the ARM BBEE Trust (""the Trust"") was restructured in April 2016 and is now consolidated into the
ARM results. As a result of this, the ARM consolidated cash and cash equivalents and borrowings include the Trust cash
and borrowings.

Total borrowings at 30 June 2017 were R2 759 million (F2016: R5 551 million). There is no debt at ARM Ferrous (F2016: nil).
The decrease in total borrowings is largely due to a reduction in the amount owing on the ARM corporate facility to nil at 30 June
2017 (30 June 2016: R1 400 million) which was achieved by applying the cash dividends received from Assmang to repay the
ARM corporate facility. Details of long- and short-term borrowings are reflected in note 8 to the financial statements.

As per the Statement of Financial Position, the consolidated net debt amounts to R1 271  million (overdrafts, short-term
and long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) and is lower in comparison to the net debt position of R4 235 million at
30 June 2016. Details of cash and borrowings are set out in notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.

Cash generated from operations increased by R386 million to R1 611 million (F2016: R1  225 million) after a R274 million
increase in working capital (F2016: R80 million increase). The cash dividends received from the Assmang joint venture amounted
to R2 488 million (F2016: R875 million).

Cash spent on capital expenditure increased by R97 million to R949 million (F2016: R852 million). Attributable capital expenditure
at the Assmang joint venture reduced to R1 361 million (F2016: R1 422 million).

Consolidated ARM total assets of R32  billion (30 June 2016: R35 billion) include the decreased mark-to-market  valuation of
ARM's investment in Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony) of R1 380 million (F2016: R3 339 million) at a share price
of R21.68 per share (30 June 2016: R52.47 per share). Changes in the value of the investment in Harmony, to the extent that they
represent a significant or prolonged decline below the cost of the investment, are adjusted through the Income Statement, net of
tax. Gains are accounted for, net of deferred capital gains tax, through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Dividends from
Harmony are recognised in the ARM Income Statement on the last day of registration following dividend declaration.

Events after the reporting date are set out in note 18 to the financial statements. Since the year-end ARM received a dividend of
R1 000 million from Assmang.

ARM Ferrous

ARM Ferrous headline earnings increased 157% to R3  709 million (F2016: R1 441 million) mainly driven by a significant
increase in the iron ore, manganese ore and manganese alloy US Dollar prices. These increases were partially offset by a 6%
strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar.

For the financial year ended 30 June 2017, the average market price for 62% iron ore fines (CIF North China) increased 37%
to US$69.41/t compared to the corresponding comparative period. Average manganese ore prices were also up with the Platts
Index for 44% manganese ore (CIF Tianjin) increasing by 102% from US$2.86 per manganese tonne unit (mtu) to US$5.77/mtu.
Global demand and prices for manganese alloy also increased during the financial year under review.

The mines were able to deliver into this improved price environment, realising average US Dollar prices that were 43% and 93%
better for exported iron ore and manganese ore, respectively.

In addition to improved realised prices, disciplined unit production cost containment and increased volumes at the iron ore and
manganese alloy operations also contributed to higher earnings.

ARM Ferrous iron ore sales volumes were up 2% to 17.3 million tonnes of which 14.1 million tonnes were sold into the export
market and 3.2 million tonnes sold locally. 

Khumani Mine production volumes increased 6% to a record 14.5 million tonnes.  The increased volumes were achieved
through  better in-pit blending of ore together with improvements in the beneficiation plant's availability, performance and
maintenance planning. Khumani Mine also completed and successfully commissioned an ultra-fines recovery circuit in March
2017, to recover an additional 250 thousand tonnes of ultra-fine iron ore product per annum. The circuit is now fully operational. 

Beeshoek Mine volumes increased marginally to 3.2 million tonnes as the mine continued to deliver as per the off-take agreement
with a South African steel producer.

Manganese ore production volumes increased by 5% to 3.07 million tonnes despite Nchwaning 2 Shaft being out of commission
for six months of the F2017 financial year as the modernisation and upgrading of Black Rock Mine continued. During this six
months, teams from Nchwaning 2 were re-deployed to Gloria Mine. The newly refurbished Nchwaning 2 Shaft was commissioned
and successfully handed over to operations in January 2017. There was also an improvement to employee engagement and
communication through the ""Black Rock Mine Operation (BRMO) connect"" project, which allowed the mine to achieve its highest
level of productivity in tonnes per employee and an all-time production record in the month of June 2017.

Manganese ore sales volumes were down by 4% to 3 million tonnes, of which 2.9 million tonnes were exported and 0.1 million
tonnes were sold into the local market.

Manganese alloy production at Cato Ridge Works was 5% more than in F2016 at 161 thousand tonnes due to improved availability
of furnaces and a reduction in the variability of the ore from Black Rock Mine. Cato Ridge Works sales volumes increased by
7% to 168 thousand tonnes. Cato Ridge Works continued to focus on improving furnace efficiencies and operational flexibility.
The fabrication of a bridle, enabling the transport of metal ladles with a slag hauler, now allows Cato Ridge Works to transfer 
molten metal to Cato Ridge Alloys from all operating furnaces, further enhancing flexibility. Input cost pressures have been 
mitigated by utilising briquettes comprising bag house dust, metal fines, carbon fines and other fine materials. These are 
agglomerated on site, thereby reducing the requirement for expensive ore by 10%. Further raw material trials are being done 
to reduce costs.

Sakura commissioned both furnaces successfully and is producing high carbon ferromanganese at levels in excess of nameplate
capacity. The alloy production is also meeting customer specifications.

Machadodorp Works is currently only recovering ferrochrome from the slag dumps through the metal recovery plant, with
approximately six months of processing remaining. Thereafter, the operation will recover ferromanganese slag for approximately
eight months.

ARM and Assore are currently evaluating possible options for the future of Machadodorp Works.

Projects:

Black Rock Project
The total capital requirement for the Black Rock Project has been re-evaluated and in line with the improved outlook for
manganese ore prices, the scope of the project has been revised from R6.0 billion to the original approved R6.7 billion. Due to
the subdued outlook in F2016 and cut-backs on capital, some of the key underground elements of the project had been delayed.
All of this work has been re-commissioned and the revised timeline indicates that some of the underground installations will lag
the original schedule. Currently, 80% of the capital has been spent or committed.

The primary focus of the project remains:

-    The modernisation of the mine to optimise resource exploitation and to maximise utilisation of production hours, production
     fleet and mining equipment;
-    The cost-efficient exploitation of the Seam 1 and Seam 2 manganese resources at the Nchwaning mining complex, targeting
     the production of high-grade manganese products;
-    The modernisation of the surface plant infrastructure to ensure the cost-efficient processing and separation of the various
     high-grade manganese products from the two seams;
-    Creating the flexibility within the underground operations at the Nchwaning shafts to ensure the mine can react more
     effectively to changes in market product requirements;
-    Creating the ability to exploit the high-grade ore within Nchwaning 1; and
-    Establishing the load-out capacity and efficiencies to meet the requirements as set by Transnet for the Ngqura port facility.

Sakura Ferroalloys Project

The Sakura project was completed within the original budget of US$328 million.

Both furnaces are at full production and their performance exceeds the design capacity for high carbon ferromanganese.
The agglomeration plant is operational and fine materials stockpiled on site are under trial in various recipes. This is expected
to further enhance profits.

Sakura is utilising the Bintulu port as well as the newly constructed Samalaju port for import and export of raw materials and final
product. The quality of Sakura's alloy has been well received in the market.

Logistics

ARM Ferrous continued to ensure execution of its medium-term manganese export capacity allocation (MECA2) from Transnet
through the ports of Saldanha and Port Elizabeth. 

Due to unforeseen challenges with the load-out facility in Port Elizabeth and other operational challenges, Transnet did not
perform as envisaged and ARM Ferrous supplemented rail by using road transport to the port of Durban to ensure that sales
volumes could be achieved. The road haulage is at a higher cost per tonne and therefore impacted costs.

Engagements are ongoing regarding the synchronisation of the ramp-up of the Black Rock Mine with the medium- and longer-term
(MECA2 and MECA3) Transnet capacity process.

Transnet enabled Khumani Mine to export 14.1 million tonnes of iron ore for F2017. A junior iron ore producer and exporter was
able to export more than 1 million tonnes during the reporting period, using the Khumani Mine load-out facility.

In collaboration with Transnet, a link to the export line to Saldanha Port has been established from Beeshoek Mine for additional
flexibility.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese and
chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum's attributable headline earnings increased to R350 million (F2016: R10 million headline loss). This increase was
mainly as a result of improved headline earnings at Nkomati Mine, which benefited from the sharp increase in chrome prices and
reported a R78 million positive mark-to-market adjustment on the realisation of the debtors at 30 June 2017 (F2016: R242 million
negative adjustment). Two Rivers Mine also benefited from higher chrome prices.

Average US Dollar commodity prices, particularly for palladium (27%) and chrome concentrate (65%), were higher than the
corresponding period. A 6% strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar resulted in platinum prices being slightly lower in
Rand terms, compared to F2016. Due to the higher palladium content at Modikwa, the average Rand per 6E kilogram basket price
increased by 6% to R334 051 (F2016: R315 748 per kilogram), whereas the average basket price at Two Rivers Mine increased

Lower PGM production at the Nkomati (21%) and Two Rivers (3%) mines, resulted in ARM Platinum's PGM ounces (on a 100%
basis)  decreasing by 4%  to 815 188 6E ounces (F2016: 851  924 6E ounces). Nkomati Mine's nickel production decreased to
15 875 tonnes (F2016: 21 592 tonnes) as a result of lower tonnes mined, combined with lower grades and lower plant recoveries.
Two Rivers Mine PGM production declined to 390 214 6E ounces (F2016: 400 722 6E ounces) due to a 4% reduction in head
grade. Included in the Two Rivers Mine PGM production are 5 992 ounces produced through toll treating at the Modikwa Mine
concentrator plant. Modikwa Mine's PGM volumes increased to 301 228 6E ounces (F2016: 293 604 6E ounces), mainly due to
improved head grade and plant recovery. 

Nkomati Mine's on-mine unit production costs (excluding capitalised waste stripping) were 4% lower at R284 per tonne
while C1 unit cash cost net of by-products were 15% higher at US$4.81/lb (F2016: US$4.18/lb) of nickel produced. The increase
in C1 unit cash costs was due to lower nickel produced combined with increased waste stripping costs.

At Two Rivers Mine the lower PGM production resulted in a 10% increase in unit production cash costs to R6 195 per 6E ounce
(F2016: R5 624 per 6E ounce).

Unit production costs per 6E ounce at Modikwa Mine increased by 3% to R8 463 per 6E ounce (F2016: R8 244 per 6E ounce) due
to restructuring initiatives implemented as well as improved PGM volumes.

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on a 100% basis) increased to R1 273 million (F2016: R1 052 million).

As previously reported, market conditions necessitated Modikwa Mine's capital projects to be reviewed to reduce
capital expenditure without adversely affecting the mine's future ability to ramp-up production. Capital expenditure reduced by
7% to R262 million (F2016: R282 million).

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers Mine, 32% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment. The deepening of the North
decline, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 57% of the total capital expenditure. 

Nkomati Mine's capital expenditure was mainly for the commencement of the construction of a second anchored pile
wall (R69 million) as well as a pit proximity movement detection system (R21 million). Capitalised waste stripping cost increased
by 76% to R617 million after being reduced in F2016 to preserve cash. This is required to open up the ore reserves and
improve mining flexibility.

Two Rivers Mine
Attributable headline earnings at Two Rivers Mine increased by 2% to R325 million (F2016: R318 million).

Tonnes milled remained flat while complexity in the ore body resulted in lower mined grades leading to a 3% decrease in PGM
ounces. The ore body South of the main shaft historically indicated a decline in grades. Lower grades have, however, been
intersected sooner than expected due to split reef. Undercutting of the lower grade ore and scalping of waste rock on surface are
some of the measures implemented to improve the Two Rivers head grade. Of the 3.5 million tonnes milled, 58 689 tonnes were
toll-treated at Modikwa as part of Two Rivers' working capital reduction initiatives. 

Two Rivers Mine chrome concentrate sales contributed R352 million (F2016: R130 million) to cash operating profit. 

Unit production costs increased by 10% to R6 195 per 6E ounce (F2016: R5 624 per 6E ounce). Two Rivers Mine remains well in
the first quartile of the global PGM cost curve. There was a 155 806 tonne decrease in the UG2 Run-of-Mine stockpile to a total
of 216 752 tonnes of ore.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa Mine's attributable headline loss reduced by 21% to a loss of R66 million (F2016: R84 million headline loss). An increase
in head  grade and concentrator recovery negated the lower milled tonnes, resulting in PGM volumes increasing by 3% to
301 228 6E ounces (F2016: 293 604 6E ounces).  

Unit production costs increased by only 3% to R8 463 per 6E PGM ounce (F2016: R8 244 per 6E PGM ounce) mainly due to
efficiency improvement initiatives at the mine.

Production ramp-up at South 2 has been slower than expected, however, an upward trend has commenced particularly in the
last quarter of the financial year. The focus will remain ramp-up of production from the South 2 Shaft. Mining in areas that are
producing at a loss is being stopped.

As reported in the 1H F2017 results, ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R734 million after tax and non-controlling
interest of Modikwa assets during the year.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati Mine generated attributable headline earnings of R91 million (F2016: R244 million headline loss) for the financial year
under review. This was mainly driven by an attributable positive mark-to-market adjustment of R78 million (F2016: R242 million
negative adjustment), resulting from increased nickel and PGM prices since the date on which the sales were recognised.

Chrome concentrate sales volumes decreased by 12% to 241 265 tonnes (F2016: 272 817 tonnes), but contributed R408 million to
cash operating profit due to a substantial increase in the realised Rand chrome prices. The decrease in chrome production was
mainly as a result of the chrome washing plant being stopped in November 2015 due to depressed market conditions at the time.
The chrome washing plant was restarted during October 2016 when market conditions improved.

Nkomati Mine's total tonnes milled decreased by 9% to 7.49 million tonnes. Nickel units produced decreased by 26% to
15 875 tonnes (F2016: 21 592 tonnes). The main reasons for this underperformance were:

ï¿½    Poor mining efficiencies in the first half of the year which resulted in lower ore supply to both the PCMZ and MMZ plants.
     Furthermore, the mining contractor was impacted by a 15-day unprotected strike and safety stoppages which negatively
     affected production. Corrective action was taken with regards to the safety stoppages with changes implemented to the shift
     arrangements and fatigue management.
ï¿½    A change in the mining sequence which was caused by insufficient waste stripping and unforeseen geotechnical challenges
     resulted in a decrease in the ore mined, reducing ore feed head grade and plant recoveries.
ï¿½    A second pile wall construction has commenced to achieve slope stability on the Western perimeter of the open pit. This
     results in mining being confined to the Eastern benches only, which are lower grade. The mining of the Western benches will
     commence in the second half of F2018, once Pile Wall 2 construction is completed

Nkomati Mine's C1 unit cash costs net of by-products increased by 15% to US$4.81/lb (F2016: US$4.18/lb) largely due to the
decrease in nickel units produced. Higher volumes of waste stripping resulted in unit production costs per tonne milled (including
capitalised waste stripping) increasing to R367 per tonne milled.

The capitalised waste stripping is included in the on-mine production cost per tonne milled (including capitalised waste stripping
costs) and the C1 cash unit cost net of by-products.

As reported in the 1H F2017 results, ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R711 million after tax of Nkomati Mine assets
during the year.

Projects

Modikwa Mine

In order to improve mining flexibility a decision was taken to deepen North Shaft and sink the new South 2 Shaft. The status of
these projects is detailed below:

-     Deepening of North Shaft - entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 7 to Level 9 thereby establishing three new
      mining levels. To curtail capital expenditure, portions of this project were deferred during F2015, resulting in development
      being delayed at Level 9. Levels 7 and 8 are both fully equipped with all the required mining infrastructure and the chairlift
      installation and construction to surface was commissioned in February 2017.
-     Sinking of South 2 Shaft - entails the establishment of an additional new decline shaft system South of the current South
      Shaft Infrastructure. The first phase of the project will enhance mining flexibility while also contributing to the overall
      production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has almost been completed and will take the production capacity
      to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by 2019, whereafter the second phase will follow and increase the design capacity of this
      shaft system to 100 000 tonnes per month.

Two Rivers Mine

The addition of the Tamboti mining right to the Two Rivers mining area will result in the deepening of the main decline.

The ARM Platinum division comprises:-

-    Three operating mines:-
     -    Modikwa - ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities hold an 8.5%
          effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Rustenburg Platinum Mines.
     -    Two Rivers - an ARM subsidiary in which ARM has a 51% shareholding and Implats 49%. Two Rivers received
          consent during August 2017 (i) to transfer the Tamboti rights to it and (ii) to have its mining right amended accordingly.
          The amended mining right will be issued to Two Rivers imminently at which point ARM's interest in Two Rivers will
          increase to 54%.
     -    Nkomati - a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.
-    The Kalplats Project:-
     -    in which ARM Platinum holds 46% and Stella Platinum holds 44%, with Anglo American holding 10%.
 
ARM Coal

ARM Coal achieved attributable headline earnings of R82 million for F2017, a R379 million improvement when compared to the
headline loss of R297 million in F2016. This increase was mainly due to a 51% increase in the average realised export coal prices
from US$41 to US$62 per tonne.

The export coal price was positively influenced by various actions taken by the Chinese government to reduce China's supply
into the market, which resulted in the US Dollar prices for API4 Thermal Coal FOB Richards Bay Coal Terminal peaking at almost
US$100 per tonne during the third quarter of the 2016 calendar year. The higher prices were partially offset by a 6% strengthening
of the Rand versus the US Dollar.  Realised Rand prices therefore increased by 40% from R601 in F2016 to R843 per tonne
in F2017.

Saleable production at GGV was slightly lower than in F2016, while additional expenditure to improve in-pit inventory levels and
saleable production, resulted in on-mine saleable production unit costs being 35% higher than in F2016 due to waste stripping
being behind schedule. The PCB operations performed well and achieved an increase of 13% in saleable production with only a
2% increase in on-mine saleable production unit cost.

Although export coal sales volumes decreased by 11%, export revenue increased by R572 million which more than doubled the
attributable operating profit from GGV and PCB to R1 211 million (F2016: R601 million).

GGV Mine

Low opening in-pit stock levels at the start of F2017, resulting from low availability of drills, the dragline and the Hitachi shovel,
continued to impact production negatively. This, together with excessive rain and breakdowns of major mining equipment during
Q3 of F2017, resulted in a decrease in production.

Attributable operating profit of R235 million was 15% or R31 million higher than F2016, mainly due to a 15% increase in export
revenue. This increase comprised a R206 million increase in revenue due to a 42% increase in realised Rand prices, partially
offset by a reduction of R114 million due to a 19% decline in volumes. Run of mine coal buy-ins and contractor costs (to assist
with overburden stripping) resulted in on-mine unit production costs being 35% higher than in F2016. Lower distribution costs and
an increase in stock levels reduced the over-expenditure on total cost of sales to R68 million. The attributable headline loss of
R99 million was 14% higher than the loss of R87 million realised in F2016. In addition to the lower volumes and higher production
unit cost, finance costs were 16% higher than in the previous year.

PCB Operations

The mines comprising the PCB all performed well during F2017 and achieved increases of 4% and 13% in ROM and saleable
production, respectively. Although total on-mine costs increased, the cost per saleable tonne produced increased by only 2%
from R273 to R278 per tonne. The Tweefontein mine continued to benefit from feeding significant volumes of ROM coal into its
plant from the raw coal stockpile, built during the construction phase of the Tweefontein Optimisation Project. The attributable
cash operating profit increased by 146% from R397 million to R976 million as a result of a 31% increase in revenue, offset by an
8% increase in cost of sales. Export revenue was R480 million higher than in F2016 emanating from a 49% increase in US Dollar
sales prices. A 9% decrease in sales volumes and a 6% strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar negatively impacted the
PCB result. PCB recorded attributable headline earnings of R181 million for F2017 compared to a headline loss of R210 million
in F2016.

Discontinuing operation: Lubambe Mine 
ARM and Vale announced on 15 August 2017 that an agreement for the disposal of their 80% indirect interest in Lubambe Mine
to EMR Capital has been concluded for a purchase consideration of US$97 million. The indirect interest sold includes the equity
holding in Lubambe Mine as well as loans to Lubambe Mine.

For the financial year under review, the ARM Copper headline loss reduced marginally from R361 million in F2016 to R203 million
in F2017. The reduction was mainly due to improved realised copper prices which was offset by lower sales volumes. The decrease
in volumes was in line with a decision taken in 2016 to reduce tonnes milled to 80  000 tonnes a month in order to minimise
cash requirements and preserve the Lubambe Mine's reserves. Total tonnes milled for the period was therefore 21% lower at
1 013 377 tonnes (F2016: 1 277 132 tonnes). 

C1 unit cash costs increased by 2% during F2017 from US2.41/lb in F2016 to US$2.45 per pound of copper produced mainly due
to the lower volumes.

During F2017 the average realised copper price of US$5 366 per tonne was 6% higher than F2016.

Lubambe Mine

F2017 was a year of consolidation for Lubambe where it operated at a reduced target production level of  80 000 tonnes ore per
month. During F2017 Lubambe made good progress in finding sustainable solutions to the technical challenges that previously
prevented the mine from ramping up production to steady state levels. The mine completed an underground water infrastructure
upgrade programme which increased its underground pumping capacity from 6 million litres per day to 20 million litres per day.
This allowed Lubambe to pump all its previously flooded ramps dry and recommence with development of the ramps.

Through a redesign of Ramp 1 and Ramp 2 the mine also found a sustainable solution to the weak geotechnical formation
located in the footwall of the South Limb in close proximity to the ore body. Lubambe commenced with development of the
updated ramps' design, and has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the revised ramp design. This is expected to
allow Lubambe to develop the South Limb resource which accounts for approximately 50% of the total reserves of the mine in a
cost effective manner.

During F2017 Lubambe achieved a total development of 6 251 metres which progressively increased over the course of the year
from a low of 413 metres in July 2016 to 938 metres  achieved in June 2017. The increased development profile has enabled
Lubambe to increase its developed ore reserves over the duration of the year. The increase in ore reserves is expected to enable
Lubambe to achieve higher ore production levels in future.

Through continued focus on quality and method improvements in long hole drilling and stoping, the mine has managed to
decrease stoping dilution from over 30% to 11% over the duration of the year. This has allowed Lubambe to gradually increase its
head grade milled in F2017 and achieve an overall improvement of 6% compared to F2016.

Various copper concentrator recovery optimisation initiatives were implemented during the period. These initiatives have resulted
in a 4% improvement in copper recoveries in F2017 compared to F2016.

During F2017 a labour restructuring programme was successfully concluded which aligned the total labour complement with the
revised lower production targets of 80 000 tonnes.

In order to preserve cash flow during F2017, capital expenditure was restricted with the majority of expenditure related to the life
of mine ramp development and upgrades in underground water infrastructure.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)

Harmony reported a net profit of R362 million in F2017 compared to a net profit of R949 million in F2016. Headline earnings
amounted to 298 cents per share (F2016: 221 cents per share). A final dividend of 35 cents per share was declared by Harmony
in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 - a 70% increase in dividends declared year-on-year.

Harmony's revenue increased by 5% to R19.3 billion mainly as a result of year-on-year production remaining  stable and the
inclusion of the realised gains on the Rand gold hedges of R728 million as part of revenue. This inclusion resulted in the average
gold price received being R570 164/kg (US$1 304/oz), compared with R544 984/kg (US$1 169/oz) in F2016, despite the rand gold
spot price being flat year-on-year.

The hedging programmes realised gains of R1 747 million  for F2017. Harmony's management continues to top-up
these programmes as and when opportunities arise to lock in attractive margins for the business.

Harmony's total gold production increased by 181 kilograms (0.5%) to 33 836 kilograms, compared to 33 655 kilograms in F2016.

Cash operating cost increased by 11% or R1.430 billion (18%) mainly due to increases in labour costs, inflationary increases in
consumables and contractors for the South African operations, as well as the inclusion of 100% of Hidden Valley's costs from
November 2016.

Overall, all-in sustaining costs increased by 10% to R516 687/kg  (US$1 182/oz), compared to R467 611/kg (US$1 003/oz) in
F2016*. Preventative maintenance was conducted at many of the South African operations in order to improve asset management
and performance,  which has resulted in a 36% reduction in engineering stoppages during F2017 and will benefit production
performance in the future.

Harmony's results for the year ended 30 June 2017 can be viewed on Harmony's website at http://www.harmony.co.za.

ARM owns 14.6% of Harmony's issued share capital.

*The all-in sustaining costs for the year ended June 2016 were restated to include capitalised stripping.

Outlook

While average realised US Dollar commodity prices for F2017 were higher than in F2016 they have generally reduced from recent
highs and remain volatile. In addition, although the  Rand/US Dollar exchange rate strengthened during F2017 there are still
divergent views on the outlook for the exchange rate.

As a result of the abovementioned volatility there remains an increased degree of forecasting risk in the mining industry. The ARM
response to this uncertainty in prices and exchange rate is to: 

-    continue addressing operations that are loss-making and require shareholder funding;
-    improve operational efficiencies; and
-    contain and reduce unit costs, at operations.

In addition, capital allocation to new projects is reviewed rigorously to ensure that funding is only applied to projects which are
expected to provide returns in excess of ARM's risk adjusted hurdle rates.

ARM remains confident in the long-term outlook for commodities and as a result of its robust Statement of Financial Position,
which is relatively ungeared, ARM continues to pursue both internal and external growth opportunities. 


Dividends

The Board has approved and declared an annual dividend of 650 cents per share (gross) in respect of the year ended 30 June

       New accounting standards and amendments issued to accounting standards and interpretations which are relevant to ARM,
       but not yet effective on 30 June 2017, have not been adopted.
   
       ARM continuously evaluates the impact of these standards and amendments, the most prominent being IFRS 9 Financial
       Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases. In summary the following are the
       current expectations in relation to IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.
     
       IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
     
       ARM has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
       2018 (i.e. for the financial year beginning 1 July 2018 for ARM). The actual impact of adopting IFRS 9 on ARM's financial
       statements is not currently known and cannot be reliably estimated as the impact will be dependent on the financial
       instruments that ARM holds and economic conditions prevailing at that time as well as accounting elections and judgements
       which ARM make in the future. The new standard may require ARM to revise its accounting processes and internal controls
       related to reporting financial instruments and these possible changes have not yet been ascertained. ARM has embarked
       on the process of determining the impact that the new impairment model, on the basis of expected credit losses, will have
       on the impairment provisions. As part of this process ARM will finalise the impairment methodologies that it will apply under
       IFRS 9. Disclosure requirements and changes in presentation are expected to change the nature and and extent of ARM's
       disclosures about its financial instruments, particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard. ARM is in the process
       of identifying changes to systems and controls which may be necessary to capture the required data.
     
       IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
     
       The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (i.e. for the financial year beginning 1 July
       2018 for ARM). ARM has developed a detailed project plan for the implementation of IFRS 15 and in line with this plan is in
       the process of:
     
        -    identifying all significant contracts with customers, in the various entities in the group, in line with the IFRS 15 five-step
             model;
        -    engaging it's various partners on their interpretation of the various contracts;
        -    evaluating practical expedients to be used;
        -    evaluating the changes required to controls, Information Technology systems and processes relating to revenue; and
        -    evaluating whether a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition will be adopted - this will be determined
             once the impact of the various contracts are ascertained.
     
        The new standard may well have an impact on revenue recognised arising from any or all of these contracts. The impact has
        not yet been ascertained but this is expected to be done in the first half of the 2018 financial year.
     
        IFRS 16 Leases
     
        The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted provided that
        IFRS 15 is adopted at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16. ARM continues with the initial assessment of the
        potential impact of this standard on ARM's financial statements but has not yet reached a conclusion if this standard will be
        early adopted with the implementation of IFRS 15. ARM must still make a decision on the transition method to be applied as
        well as the practical expedients to be used, if elected.

3       PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IMPAIRMENT
3.1     Nkomati Nickel Mine
a       At 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Nkomati Nickel Mine cash generating unit was recognised, largely as a
        result of
  
        i)    A revision of the mine plan with a resultant lower metal output profile.
        ii)  A significant decline from the prior year forecast long-term price of nickel and a further strengthening of the R/US$
             exchange rate.

        ARM's attributable share of the impairment charge amounted to R988 million before tax and R711 million after tax.
        The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in
        terms of International Financial Reporting Standards.
        A pre-tax discount rate of 20.72% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and
        exchange rate assumptions.

3.2   Modikwa Platinum Mine
      At 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Modikwa Platinum Mine cash generating unit attributable to ARM, was
      recognised largely as a result of :

      i)    Lower forecast PGM output over the short to medium term;
      ii)  Higher forecast unit cost of production; and
      iii)  A reduction in the forecast long-term platinum price and a further strengthening of the R/US$ exchange rate.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to R1 255 million before tax, R890 million after tax and R734 million
      after non-controlling interest and tax.

      The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in
      terms of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      A pre-tax discount rate of 18.72% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and
      exchange rate assumptions.

3.3   Lubambe Copper Mine
      At 31 December 2015 an impairment of Lubambe Copper Mine (included in the ARM Copper segment) assets was
      recognised largely as a result of

      i)    a decline in the forecast of the short to medium term copper price;
      ii)   a revision to the mine plan; and
      iii)  an increase in the discount rate used in the valuation of the mine.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to R1 404 million. For the impairment calculation a pre-tax discount
      rate of 24.43% and the following real copper prices were used.

      The recoverable amount to determine the impairments was calculated using a combination of a value-in-use and fair value
      less cost to sell model. At year end there was an impairment reversal following the classification of Lubambe as an asset
      held for sale (refer note 12).

11   TREASURY SHARES - RESTRUCTURING OF THE ARM BBEE TRUST                                                                  
     Following the restructuring of the ARM BBEE Trust, on 22 April 2016 the ARM
     BBEE Trust is consolidated into the ARM consolidated financial results, as
     ARM now controls the Trust for reporting purposes.
                                                                                                                  
     The consolidation of the ARM BBEE Trust results in ARM shares bought
     back by Opilac, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARM, and the remaining shares
     owned by the Trust, reducing the number of shares used in the calculation of
     headline, basic and diluted earnings per share. The number of shares in issue
     are however not affected.
                                                                                                                  
     The treasury shares are excluded, effectively from 22 April 2016, in the
     weighted average and diluted average number of shares.

    i)    The attributable equity profit realised in Assmang amounted to R5 million which includes an impairment of R373 million
          before tax (tax nil). Subsequent to 31 December 2016 a reduction of R49 million in the attributable impairment, raised at
          31 December 2016 for the disposal of the Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine, was recorded;
    ii)   Attributable contribution to headline earnings amounting to R378 million;
    iii)  Cash dividend received from Assmang amounting to R238 million and an in specie dividend of R316 million;
    iv)   Proceeds of R238 million received from Assore by ARM on the sale of its investment in Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine resulting
          in a loss amounting to R79 million before tax (tax: nil).

14   PROVISION
     Silicosis and tuberculosis class action provision

     In November 2014, a gold mining industry working group was formed to address issues relating to the compensation and
     medical care for occupational lung diseases in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The working group comprises ARM,
     Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, Anglo American South Africa Limited, AngloGold Ashanti Limited, Gold Fields
     Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited (collectively ""the Working Group"").

     The Working Group engaged different stakeholders including government, organised labour, other mining companies and
     legal representatives of claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies. These engagements have sought a
     comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks that are fair to past and current
     employees and enable companies to continue to be sustainable over the long-term.

     As a consequence of the progress of negotiations between the Working Group and affected stakeholders, the Company is
     now in a position to reliably estimate, within an acceptable range, the Company's share of a possible settlement of the class
     action claims and related costs. As a result, ARM has recorded a provision of R330 million at 30 June 2017 (discounted) in
     the results for the year ended 30 June 2017. The nominal amount of the provision is R417 million.

     The Working Group continues to defend the legal proceedings filed against them and are appealing the ruling which has
     been set for hearing from 19 to 23 March 2018. Notwithstanding the provision raised, the companies do not believe that they
     are liable in respect of the claims brought. They do, however, believe that they should work together to seek a solution to this
     South African mining industry legacy issue.

     The negotiations with the claimants' lawyers are confidential and the working group companies are accordingly not able to
     provide any details of the negotiations.

15   RELATED PARTIES
     The Company in the ordinary course of business enters into various sale, purchase, service and lease transactions with
     subsidiaries, associated companies, joint ventures and joint operations.

     Transactions between the Company, its subsidiaries and joint operations relate to fees, insurances, dividends, rentals and
     interest and are regarded as intra-Group transactions and eliminate on consolidation.

17   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
     Refer to note 14 - Provision - for an update on the previously reported contingent liability.

     Assmang has issued a guarantee to the Sarawak Energy Board amounting to $100 million. Sponsor indemnities amounting
     to $45.46 million has been received by Assmang in respect of this guarantee. The net effect for Assmang is therefore
     $54.54 million.

     ARM's 50 percent interest in Assmang would equate to R356 million ($27.27 million).

     There have been no other significant changes in the contingent liabilities of the Group as disclosed in the 30 June
     2016 integrated annual report.

18   EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE
     Two Rivers received consent during August 2017 (i) to transfer the Tamboti rights to it and (ii) to have its mining right
     amended accordingly. The amended mining right is expected to be issued to Two Rivers immanently at which point ARM's
     interest in Two Rivers will increase to 54%.

     Since the year-end ARM received a dividend of R1 billion from Assmang.

     Guarantees to Transnet Freight Rail in relation to the Coal operations amount to R36 million (ARM share) were issued (F2016: nil).

     No other significant event have occurred subsequent to the reporting date that could materially affect the reported results.

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.




ARM’s headline earnings for the financial year ended 30 June 2017
(F2017) have been positively affected by an increase in the average
US Dollar commodity prices realised for all of the commodities
which ARM produces, which was partly offset by the negative impact
of   a   stronger        average    Rand/US   Dollar    exchange    rate.   Cost
containment initiatives throughout the year have yielded positive
results,    with    most    operations    achieving     unit   production   cost
increases that are either at or lower than inflation.




A provision has been raised for a possible settlement of the
silicosis and tuberculosis class action claims and related costs
of R330 million (see further details below).




Headline earnings per share for F2017 are expected to increase by
between 229%       and    245%     compared to   the   previous    corresponding
financial year (F2016) to between 1 625 and 1 702 cents (F2016:


                                                                               1
494 cents) based on a weighted average number of shares of 189 768
000 (F2016: 212 990 000).




ARM’s F2017 basic earnings are expected to be impacted mainly by:

        attributable impairment previously reported in the interim
      results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 (1H F2017)
      of the Nkomati Mine assets of R711 million after tax;

         attributable impairment previously reported in 1H F2017
      of the Modikwa Mine assets of R734 million after tax and
      non-controlling interest; and

      an attributable partial impairment reversal of the Lubambe
      Mine assets of R144 million after non-controlling interest
      following the classification of Lubambe Mine as an operation
      held for sale.




Basic earnings per share are therefore expected to increase to a
basic earnings per share of between 695 and 745 cents (F2016: 265
cents loss).

Lubambe Mine will be classified as held for sale at 30 June 2017

Silicosis and tuberculosis class action provision

In November 2014, a gold mining industry working group was formed
to address issues relating to the compensation and medical care
for occupational lung diseases in the gold mining industry in South
Africa. The    working group   comprises ARM,   Harmony   Gold   Mining
Company Limited, Anglo American South Africa Limited, AngloGold

                                                                      2
Ashanti Limited, Gold Fields Limited and Sibanye Gold Limited
(collectively “the Working Group”).




The   Working   Group      engaged   different   stakeholders     including
government, organised labour, other mining companies and legal
representatives of claimants who have filed legal suits against
the   companies.   These    engagements   have   sought   a   comprehensive
solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal
frameworks that are fair to past and current employees and enable
companies to continue to be sustainable over the long-term.




As a consequence of the progress of negotiations between the
Working Group and affected stakeholders, the Company is now in a
position to reliably estimate, within an acceptable range, the
Company’s share of a possible settlement of the class action claims
and related costs. As a result, ARM has recorded a provision of
R330 million (discounted) in the results for the year ended 30 June
2017. The nominal amount of the provision is R417 million.




The companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of
the claims brought, and are defending these. The Working Group is
appealing the ruling, which matter has been set for hearing from
19 to 23 March 2018.       They do, however, believe that they should
work together to seek a solution to this South African mining
industry legacy issue. The negotiations with the claimants’ lawyers
are confidential and the Working Group companies are accordingly
not able to provide any details of the negotiations.




The financial information on which this trading statement is based
has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external auditors
of ARM.




                                                                          3
The Company’s F2017 provisional financial results will be released
on 7 September 2017.

Salient features

- Headline earnings increased by 234% to R1 693 million (1H F2016: R507 million). Headline earnings
  per share increased 283% to 893 cents compared to 233 cents in the corresponding period last year.

- Basic earnings were a loss of R254 million (1H F2016: R996 million loss) and were mainly impacted
  by (i) an attributable impairment of the Nkomati Nickel Mine assets of R711 million after tax and
  (ii) an attributable impairment of the Modikwa Platinum Mine assets of R734 million after tax and
  non-controlling interest.

- US$ prices for the ARM suite of commodities increased significantly during the last quarter of the
  reporting period.

- Good cost containment achieved at all mines except Goedgevonden (GGV) and Nkomati where unit
  costs increased as a result of lower production.

- Attributable segmental capital expenditure decreased by 15% to R1 159 million
  (1H F2016: R1 368 million).

- Cash dividends received from the Assmang joint venture increased to R988 million
  (1H F2016: R500 million).

- ARM's financial position continues to be robust with a net debt to equity ratio of 15.4%.

- Since the period end, ARM received a dividend of R1.5 billion from Assmang.

ARM operational review

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces much improved headline earnings of R1 693 million for the six months
ended 31 December 2016 (1H F2017). Headline earnings are 234% higher than the previous corresponding period largely
due to excellent results in the ARM Ferrous division and the Two Rivers Platinum Mine (Two Rivers).

There was an improvement in headline earnings in both the ARM Coal division and the Nkomati Nickel Mine (Nkomati) from
losses incurred in the previous period. Headline loss for ARM Copper improved from R275 million to R178 million. Modikwa
Platinum Mine (Modikwa) reported a headline loss of R54 million (1H F2016: R47 million loss).

Average Rand prices for most of the commodities which ARM produces increased in comparison to the previous
corresponding period.

Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

Improving operational efficiencies and reducing unit costs

Most operations, except Goedgevonden Coal Mine (GGV) and Nkomati, achieved unit cost increases below inflation.

The iron ore, manganese ore, PCB coal and Lubambe Copper Mine (Lubambe) operations achieved decreases in on-mine
costs per tonne. At Modikwa and Two Rivers unit costs per PGM ounce increased by 7% and 9% respectively.

Nkomati reduced on-mine unit costs by 19% to R254 per tonne milled excluding capitalised waste stripping. C1 unit cost
went up by 43% to US$6.05/lb which includes the capitalised waste stripping of R364 million.

GGV production costs increased by 34% as a result of mining high cost areas and producing lower saleable tonnes. Mining
has moved to the new pit and as a result unit costs should decrease in the coming months.

Capital expenditure

Attributable segmental capital expenditure for 1H F2017 reduced by R209 million or 15% to R1 159 million (1H F2016: R1 368 million).

A large portion of the capital expenditure relates to the Black Rock Project.

Nkomati's capitalised waste stripping cost was increased to R364 million (1H F2016: R220 million) due to limited flexibility in the pit.

Restructuring loss making operations

Lubambe continued with restructuring through downsizing of output and the reduction of related labour cost. There was an
improvement in head grade while unit costs decreased by 7% to US$2.22/lb (1H F2016: US$2.39/lb). Lubambe remains
under review and an announcement will be made when appropriate.

The ARM Coal division recorded headline earnings of R99 million (1H F2016: R129 million loss). This is a R228 million
turnaround mainly due to improved coal prices and low unit costs at PCB.

Nkomati achieved a headline profit for the period, but is entering a difficult three-year phase with declining output. Waste
stripping needs to be accelerated to open up the ore reserves and obtain more mining flexibility. The pit requires piling work
on the western section to improve the slope stability due to saprolite slumping in the area. The eastern section of the pit
has lower grade ore resulting in a forecast reduction in sales volumes over the next three years.

Modikwa reported a headline loss of R54 million (1H F2016: R47 million). The new South 2 project is ramping up production
but much slower than was originally planned due to infrastructure installations being late.

Operating safely

- ARM has been fatality free since May 2015.
- 37 Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for the financial year-to-date (F2017), compared to 44 LTIs for the corresponding period in F2016.
- 28 Reportable Injuries for the financial year-to-date, compared to 30 over the same period in F2016.
- The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for the financial year-to-date was 0.33 per 200 000 man-hours  
  (compared to 0.32 at end December 2016).

Safety achievements in the period under review:

- Black Rock Mine completed five million fatality free shifts on 11 October 2016.
- Modikwa achieved three million fatality free shifts on 26 September 2016.
- In November 2016, Beeshoek achieved 15 000 Fatality Free Production Shifts. This is for the reporting period 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016.

Safety figures and statistics in this report are presented on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations which are managed by ARM's partner.

Changes to mineral resources and reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's Mineral Resources and Reserves as disclosed in the Integrated Annual
Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2016, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the operations.
Dwarsrivier Mine Mineral Resources and Reserves will, however, no longer be reported by ARM following the completion
of the disposal of ARM's interest in Dwarsrivier mine to Assore in July 2016.

Financial commentary

Headline earnings of R1 693 million for the six-month period to 31 December 2016 were R1 186 million or 234% higher
than the prior corresponding period's headline earnings (1H F2016: R507 million). This equates to headline earnings per
share of 893 cents (1H F2016: 233 cents) based on the weighted average number of shares of 189.53 million (1H F2016: 217.55 million).

Basic earnings were a loss of R254 million (1H F2016: R996 million loss) and were mainly impacted by (i) an attributable
impairment of the Nkomati assets of R711 million after tax and (ii) an attributable impairment of the Modikwa assets of
R734 million after tax and non-controlling interest as well as (iii) an impairment loss of R422 million within the Assmang
joint venture related to the sale of Dwarsrivier. 1H F2016 basic losses were negatively impacted by special items of
R1 503 million after tax and non-controlling interests largely relating to an attributable impairment of the Lubambe assets
of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest. The reconciliation of basic earnings to headline earnings is provided in
note 9 to the financial statements. Basic loss per share improved from a basic loss of 458 cents reported in the previous
comparable period to a basic loss of 134 cents.

Sales for the reporting period were 3% higher than the corresponding period in F2016 at R4 481 million (1H F2016:
R4 332 million). Sales for ARM Ferrous increased by 34% to R6 088 million (1H F2016: R4 546 million).

The average gross profit margin increased to 15% (1H F2016: 5%). The gross profit margins achieved at each operation
may be ascertained from the detailed segment reports provided in note 2 to the financial statements as well as in the write-
ups for each operation.

The 1H F2017 average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate of R13.98/US$ is 3% weaker than the prior corresponding period
average of R13.61/US$, while US Dollar commodity prices increased for most commodities. For reporting purposes, the
closing Rand/US Dollar exchange rate was R13.73/US$ (1H F2016: R15.46/US$).

ARM's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding special items and income from
associates and joint ventures, were R673 million (1H F2016: R891 million). The reduction is largely due to unrealised
foreign exchange losses (1H F2016: unrealised foreign exchange gains) on the ARM loans to Lubambe.

The income from joint venture (ARM Ferrous) was R1 356 million after special items which is 139% higher than the
corresponding period in 1H F2016 (1H F2016: R567 million).

The detailed and expanded segmental contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements. Key features
from the segmental contribution analyses are:

- The ARM Ferrous contribution to ARM's headline earnings increased by R1 180 million to R1 779 million
  (1H F2016: R599 million), largely due to increased contributions of R545 million and R281 million from the iron ore and
  manganese (manganese ore and alloys) divisions respectively. The iron ore division's contribution was R1 023 million
  (1H F2016: R478 million), while the manganese division's contribution was R378 million (1H F2016: R97 million). This
  was primarily due to an increase in the average realised US Dollar prices for iron ore and manganese ore as well as
  11% higher iron ore sales volumes. The results of the Chrome division includes income from the chrome discontinued
  operation of R378 million relating to the sale of ARM's effective 50% stake in the Dwarsrivier chrome mine more fully
  explained in note 12 to the financial statements. The Machadodorp Works are the only remaining chrome operation in Assmang.

- The ARM Platinum segment, which includes the results of Nkomati, contributed increased headline earnings
  of R179  million (1H F2016: R9 million headline loss) mainly due to increased headline earnings at Two Rivers of
  R205 million (1H F2016: R155 million) and at Nkomati of R28 million (1H F2016: R117 million headline loss). Net
  impairment losses of R711 million and R734 million were recorded for Nkomati and Modikwa.

- The ARM Coal segment result reflected headline earnings of R99 million (1H F2016: R129 million headline loss)
  while cash operating profit was R687 million (1H F2016: R321 million). Goedgevonden Mine made a headline loss
  of R26  million (1H F2016: R24 million) while the PCB operations contributed headline earnings of R125 million
  (1H F2016: R105 million headline loss).

- ARM Copper, which largely comprises the Vale/ARM joint venture interest in Lubambe, amounted to an improved
  headline loss of R178 million for the period (1H F2016: R275 million headline loss) which includes interest on
  shareholder loans of R125 million (1H F2016: R104 million). The improvement in the loss was mainly due to the
  downsizing of production and associated costs.

- The costs for the ARM Exploration segment increased marginally to R12 million (1H F2016: R10 million).
 
- The ARM Corporate, other companies and consolidation segment contributed a headline loss of R206 million              
  (1H F2016: R331 million headline earnings). The headline loss is largely due to unrealised foreign exchange losses
  on US Dollar based loans made by ARM to Lubambe, resulting from the strengthening of the closing Rand versus the
  US Dollar exchange rate from R14.68/US$ at 30 June 2016 to R13.73/US$ at 31 December 2016. The ARM Company
  loans to Lubambe amounted to US$170 million at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: US$148 million).

At 31 December 2016 cash and cash equivalents were R1 335 million (31 December 2015: R1 444 million) the details of
which are reflected in note 5 to the financial statements. This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at
ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R2 588 million (31 December 2015: R2 036 million).

Total borrowings at the end of the period were higher at R4 843 million (31 December 2015: R4 124 million) of which
R2 347  million (31 December 2015: R2 298 million) comprises partner loans. There was no debt at ARM Ferrous at
31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: nil).

The net debt position at 31 December 2016 amounts to R3 508 million (31 December 2015: R2 680 million). The increase
was largely due to an increase in the amount owing on the ARM corporate facility of R1 025 million (31 December 2015:
R300 million) and the ARM BBEE Trust of R500 million (31 December 2015: nil) resulting from the restructuring of the
funding of the ARM BBEE Trust in April 2016.

Cash generated from operations increased to R826 million (1H F2016: R473 million), largely due to increased
sales. Dividends received from the Assmang joint venture were R988 million (1H F2016: R500 million) and R32 million
(1H F2016: nil) from the Harmony investment.

Dividends paid in October 2016 were R426 million (1H F2016: R761 million).

Cash expended on capital expenditure was 15% or R85 million lower at R489 million for the period (1H F2016: R574 million).
Attributable capital expenditure at the Assmang joint venture was 29% lower at R555 million (1H F2016: R779 million).

The consolidated ARM total assets of R31.7 billion (1H F2016: R33.5 billion) include the decreased mark-to-market
valuation of ARM's investment in Harmony of R1 333 million (1H F2016: R1 million increase) at a share price of R31.53 per
share at 31 December 2016 (1H F2016: R15.60 per share).

Since the period end ARM received a dividend of R1.5 billion from Assmang which was partly utilised to repay the
outstanding amount owing on the ARM corporate facility of R1 025 million.

ARM Ferrous

Market conditions for iron ore and manganese ore improved significantly over the six months ended 31 December 2016
and the average US Dollar prices were higher than those which prevailed in 1H F2016. Average index prices for 62%
fines iron ore delivered in China improved by 27% to approximately US$65 per metric tonne for 1H F2017. Manganese
ore showed a similar increase, with average prices for high-grade ore (44%) at US$6.02 per manganese unit, delivered in China.

In addition, sales volumes for iron ore were 11% higher than those in 1H F2016.

Improved commodity prices, increased sales volume for iron ore and operational improvements resulted in ARM Ferrous
headline earnings increasing by 197% to R1 779 million (1H F2016: R599 million). A 3% weakening in the average
Rand/US Dollar exchange rate also had a positive impact on earnings. ARM Ferrous achieved a good safety performance,
with a 35% improvement year-on-year in the LTIFR. All the Ferrous operations exceeded one million fatality free shifts, with
Black Rock achieving five million fatality free shifts during the period.

ARM Ferrous achieved solid operational performance for production and sales volumes.

The Khumani Mine (Khumani) supplies the export iron ore market, while Beeshoek Mine (Beeshoek) supplies a South
African steel producer. The village pit at Beeshoek is in the process of ramping up to full production of three million tonnes per annum.

To improve water availability, on-site boreholes at Khumani were drilled and test work is being carried out to evaluate the
feasibility thereof. If the test results are positive the necessary permitting will be applied for.

The modernisation and the upgrading of the Black Rock Mine (Black Rock) continued with the Nchwaning 2 shaft upgrade
and refurbishment successfully completed. Due to the upgrade, shaft operations were stopped in March 2016, resulting
in manganese ore production declining to 1.31 million tonnes which is 15% less than in 1H F2016. Despite this reduced
production, total manganese ore sales were down by only 4% to 1.42 million tonnes, of which 1.35 million tonnes were
exported and 70 thousand tonnes were sold into the local market.

Three of the six furnaces at Cato Ridge Works are currently producing high carbon ferromanganese, which is fed to
Cato Ridge Alloys to produce medium carbon ferromanganese. Manganese alloy sales volumes increased by 21% to
97 thousand tonnes. Global demand and prices for manganese alloy have increased during the period under review.

Sakura commissioned both furnaces successfully and the furnaces are in the ramp up phase of production. The alloy
production is meeting customer specifications.

Machadodorp Works is currently only recovering ferrochrome from the slag dump through the metal recovery plant, with
approximately six months of processing left. Thereafter, the operation will recover ferromanganese slag for approximately
eight months.

ARM and Assore are currently evaluating all possible options for the future of Machadodorp Works.

Improvement in safety and operational performance, as well as the reduction and containment of unit costs, remained the
focus of the division.

The following highlights were achieved:

Khumani Mine:

- One million fatality free shifts, which is 1.5 years without a fatality.
- The lumpy proportion of total production was improved from 54% to 57%.
- The design for an ultra-fines recovery circuit, which will recover an additional 250 thousand tonnes of ultra-fine iron ore
  product per annum, was finalised and construction commenced. Commissioning is expected towards the end of F2017.

Beeshoek Mine:

- Three million fatality free shifts and 15 000 Fatality Free Production Shifts were reached after mining for 14 years without a fatality.
- A lost time injury frequency rate of 0.15 per 200 000 man-hours was achieved. 
- Sustained production tonnage, ore quality and lumpy ratio of 60% to honour its off-take agreements.

Black Rock Mine:

- Achieved five million fatality free shifts after mining 7.5 years without a fatality.
- A decline in the lost time injury frequency rate of 56% to 0.16 per 200 000 man-hours.
- Successfully completed the upgrade and refurbishment of Nchwaning 2 shaft.

The Cato Ridge Works

- The operation continued to focus on improving flexibility and profitability.
- The fabrication of a bridle, enabling the transport of metal ladles with a slag hauler, now allows Cato Ridge Works to
  transfer molten metal to Cato Ridge Alloys.
- In order to offset these cost pressures, briquettes comprising bag house dust, metal fines, carbon fines and other fine
  materials are agglomerated on-site reducing the requirement for expensive ores by 10%.

* Dwarsrivier mine sold with effect from 1 July 2016.

Capital expenditure decreased by 29% to R1.15 billion. This included R650 million for the Black Rock project.

At Khumani, capital expenditure was R243 million, consisting mainly of waste stripping at the Bruce and King pits, infill
drilling, maximising ultra-fines recovery, vehicle proximity detection, replacement of mining equipment and the ongoing
evaluation of alternative water resources.

Capital expenditure of R124 million at Beeshoek mainly comprised the Village Pit waste removal, vehicle proximity
detection and replacement capital.

Black Rock's total capital expenditure of R786 million was largely for the Black Rock Project, for the modernisation of the
mine and improvement in unit cost of production.

Logistics

ARM Ferrous continues to ensure execution of its medium-term manganese export capacity allocation (MECA2) from
Transnet and engagements are ongoing regarding the synchronisation of the ramp-up of Black Rock with the medium and
longer-term (MECA3) Transnet capacity processes.

Transnet is providing good service on the 14 million tonnes per annum iron ore export supply route from Khumani to the
port of Saldanha.

A junior iron ore producer and exporter was able to export nearly 500 000 tonnes during the reporting period, using the
Khumani load-out facility.

Projects

Black Rock Project

The total capital requirement for the Black Rock Project has been reduced to R6.0 billion. This project's progress is on-time
and within budget.

Most of the underground development work that would have been executed by specialist contractors has been performed
by mine employees, significantly reducing the cost of the project without changing the scope. Project management
structures have also been reviewed and streamlined to ensure a cost efficient execution of the project.

The underground development and infrastructure work proceeded according to plan. The shutdown to upgrade Nchwaning
2 shaft and surface plant infrastructure was completed successfully and the Nchwaning 2 shaft was handed over for
production in early January 2017.

The primary focus of the project remains:

- The modernisation of the mine to optimise resource exploitation and to maximise utilisation of production hours,
  production fleet and mining equipment.
- The cost efficient exploitation of the Seam 1 and Seam 2 manganese resources at the Nchwaning mining complex, 
  targeting the production of high-grade manganese products.
- The modernisation of the surface plant infrastructure to ensure the cost efficient processing and separation of the
  various high-grade manganese products from the two Seams.
- Creating the flexibility within the underground operations at the Nchwaning shafts to ensure the mine can react more
  effectively to changes in market product requirements.
- Creating the ability to exploit the high-grade ore within Nchwaning 1.
- Establishing the load-out capacity and efficiencies to meet the requirements as set by Transnet for the Ngqura port facility.

Sakura Ferroalloys Project

The project cost remains within the original budget of US$328 million. Both furnaces 1 and 2 have been hot commissioned
and handed over to operations. Production levels continue to ramp-up to design capacity and high carbon ferromanganese
is being sold to customers who are satisfied with the quality of the product.

The agglomeration plant (Brex) is still in construction and planned to be completed at the end of March 2017.

Sakura is utilising the Bintulu port until the Samalaju port is completed in August 2017.

Khumani Mine - Ultra Fines Recovery Project

The design work for the Ultra Fines Recovery circuit is complete and the capital approved. The project is in the execution
phase and will be completed at the end of this financial year. This project will enable the recovery of additional iron units
from the tailings stream and will see the production of an additional 250 000 tonnes per annum of ultra-fines iron ore
product, once fully operational.

This project is on-time and within budget.

Beeshoek Village Pit

The Beeshoek Village Pit (Village Pit) capital project is progressing according to the mining schedule and is on-time and
within budget. The first iron ore, as per the approved mining schedule, was extracted successfully in April 2016. The ore
extracted conforms to the quality specifications derived from the geological drilling work which was performed to motivate
the exploitation of the Village Pit. The Village Pit projects extends the Life of Mine for Beeshoek from two years to twelve
years at a sustainable production rate of three million tonnes per annum.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese
and chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum increased attributable headline earnings to R179 million (1H F2016 R9 million headline loss). This increase
resulted from a sharp increase in chrome prices, benefiting both Two Rivers and Nkomati, a R200 million positive mark-
to-market adjustment at Nkomati on the realisation during the reporting period of the debtors at 30 June 2016, as well as
increased volumes at Two Rivers.

Due to Nkomati's PGM production declining by 45%, ARM Platinum's PGM production (on a 100% basis) decreased by 7%
to 407 846 6E ounces (1H F2016: 437 207 6E ounces). Nkomati's nickel production decreased to 6 627 tonnes (1H F2016:
11 554 tonnes) as a result of reduced tonnes mined, combined with a lower grade. Two Rivers achieved record PGM
production of 207 147 6E ounces (1H F2016: 198 063 6E ounces) and remains positioned at the bottom of the unit cost
curve. Of these ounces, 5 992 ounces were produced through toll treating at the Modikwa concentrator plant. Modikwa's
PGM volumes increased marginally to 151 562 6E ounces (1H F2016: 149 326 6E ounces).

As previously reported, market conditions necessitated Modikwa's capital projects to be reviewed to reduce capital
expenditure without adversely affecting the mine's future ability to ramp-up production. Capital expenditure reduced by
18% to R160 million (1H F2016: R195 million).

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers, 45% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment. The deepening of the Main
and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 43% of the total capital expenditure.

Nkomati's capital expenditure was mainly for the commencement of the construction of a second anchored pile wall
(R16 million). Capitalised waste stripping cost increased by 66% as waste mining volumes increased after being reduced in
December 2015 to preserve cash. This is required to open up the ore reserves and gain mining flexibility.

Two Rivers Mine

A sharp increase in chrome prices resulted in attributable headline earnings at Two Rivers increasing by 32% to
R205  million (1H F2016: R155 million). Increased tonnes milled, combined with an improved plant recovery to 88%,
resulted in PGM ounces increasing by 5%. Of the 1.75 million tonnes milled, 58 689 tonnes were toll treated at Modikwa
as part of Two Rivers' working capital reduction initiatives.

Two Rivers increased chrome concentrate sales to 142 721 tonnes, contributing R218 million (1H F2016: R80 million)
to cash operating profit (on 100% basis).

Unit costs increased by 9% to R5 838 per 6E ounce (1H F2016: R5 368 per 6E ounce). There was a 196 950 tonne
decrease in the UG2 Run-of-Mine stockpile to a total of 307 885 tonnes of ore.

ARM and Implats reached an agreement to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers from 51% to 54%. Completion of
the agreement is awaiting a Section 11 consent to transfer ownership of mining assets from ARM to Two Rivers.

Modikwa Mine

Modikwa's attributable headline loss increased by 15% to a loss of R54 million (1H F2016: R47 million headline loss).
A 2% increase in headgrade, offset by a 1% decrease in milled tonnes, resulted in PGM production increasing by 1% to
151 562 6E ounces (1H F2016: 149 326 6E ounces). Unit costs increased by 7% to R8 559 per 6E PGM ounce (1H F2016:
R7 970 per 6E PGM ounce).

This mine continues to make a loss due to a slower ramp-up of production at South 2 shaft. Management expect production
to increase over the next year with increased output at South 2 shaft.

ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R734 million after tax and non-conrolling interest (1H F2016: nil) of Modikwa
assets.

Nkomati Mine

Nkomati generated attributable headline earnings of R28 million (1H F2016: R117 million headline loss) for the period under
review. This was mainly driven by a positive mark-to-market adjustment of R200 million, stemming from the increased
nickel price since the date at which the relevant sales were recognised. A major cost reduction (mainly due to reduced
mining volumes) in unit cost per tonne milled also contributed to this result.

Chrome concentrate sales decreased by 50% to 96 821 tonnes (1H F2016: 195 583 tonnes), but still contributed R161 million
to cash operating profit. The decrease in chrome production was mainly as a result of the chrome washing plant being
stopped in November 2015 due to depressed market conditions, and a lower than expected mass pull on the PCMZ plant.
Due to the recent improvement in the chrome price, the chrome washing plant was restarted during October 2016.

Nkomati's total tonnes milled decreased by 15% to 3.58 million tonnes. Nickel units produced decreased significantly by
43% to 6 627 tonnes (1H F2016: 11 554 tonnes). The main reasons for this underperformance are:

- Poor mining efficiencies resulted in lower ore supply to both the PCMZ and MMZ plants. The mining contractor was 
  affected by an unprotected strike which lasted 15 days, having a negative impact on production. The mining contactor
  performance was also negatively affected by safety stoppages which resulted in a total of six production shifts lost.
- A change in the mining sequence which was caused by insufficient waste stripping during the last 12 months resulted
  in a decrease in the plant feed head grade and plant recoveries.
- A second large pile wall needs to be constructed for slope stability protection. This results in mining being confined to
  the eastern benches only, which has a lower grade.

Nkomati's C1 unit cash costs net of by-products increased by 37% to US$6.05/lb (1H F2016: US$4.40/lb) largely due to
the decrease in nickel units produced. Low mining volumes and an increase in capitalised waste stripping costs resulted in
unit cost per tonne milled decreasing by 19% to R254 per tonne (1H F2016: R313 per tonne).

The R364 million capitalised waste stripping is excluded from the unit cost per tonne milled and included in the C1 cash
unit cost net of by-products.

ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R711 million after tax (1H F2016: R83 million) of Nkomati assets.

Projects

Modikwa Mine

In order to improve mining flexibility a decision was taken to deepen North Shaft and sink the new South 2 Shaft. The
current status of these projects are detailed below:

- Deepening of North Shaft - This project entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 6 to Level 9 thereby
  establishing three new mining levels. To curtail capital expenditure portions of this project were deferred during F2016,
  resulting in current development being delayed at Level 9. Level 7 and 8 are both fully equipped with all the required
  mining infrastructure and the chairlift installation and construction to surface was commissioned in February 2017.

- Sinking of South 2 Shaft - This project entails the establishment of an additional new decline shaft system South of
  the current South Shaft Infrastructure. The first phase of the project will enhance mining flexibility while also contributing
  to the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project has been completed and will take the production
  capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month by 2019. The second phase will follow and increase to the design capacity
  of this shaft system to 100 000 tonnes per month.

The ARM Platinum division comprises:

- Three operating mines: 

  - Modikwa - ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities hold an
    8.5% effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Anglo American Platinum.
  - Two Rivers - an incorporated joint venture with Implats, with ARM holding 51% and Implats 49%. ARM and
    Implats have reached agreement to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers by 3% from 51% from 54% on
    incorporation of the Tamboti property into Two Rivers once the Section 11 is approved.
  - Nkomati - a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.

- Two prospecting rights:

  - the ""Kalplats prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum holds 46% and Platinum Australia (PLA) holds 44%, with
    Anglo American holding 10%.
  - the ""Kalplats Extended Area prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum and PLA each have a 50% interest.

ARM Coal

ARM Coal achieved attributable headline earnings of R99 million for 1H F2017, a R228 million improvement over the
headline loss of R129 million recorded in 1H F2016. This significant improvement was mainly due to average realised
US Dollar export prices being 43% higher than in 1H F2016 with the price exceeding $65 per tonne for Q2 F2017.

Export coal prices were influenced by the Chinese government who reduced working days for coal mines to 276 days per
annum, effective 1 May 2016. This action reduced coal supply and saw the USD API4 (6000NAR export thermal coal price
ex RBCT) peak at almost US$100 per tonne during the reporting period. The higher prices, aided by a 3% weakening of the
Rand/US Dollar exchange rate, resulted in realised Rand prices increasing from R593 per tonne in 1H F2016 to R839 per
tonne in 1H F2017.

ARM Coal export coal sales volumes were 7% lower than the comparable period as Transnet Freight Rail's (TFR) annual
maintenance shutdown, which lasted for 14 days, occurred during July 2016 to coincide with the Indian monsoon rain
season. Previously, it was done during the first half of the calendar year. Saleable production at GGV improved by 8%
compared to 1H F2016 but additional expenditure to improve in-pit inventory levels and saleable production, resulted in
unit production costs, excluding capitalised stripping costs, to be 34% higher than in 1H F2016. The PCB operations on
the other hand achieved an increase of 17% in saleable production and a 7% reduction in on-mine unit production costs.

Goedgevonden Mine

Production at GGV for 1H F2017 was 8% higher than the previous reporting period, however, on-mine unit cost of
production increased by 34%. The mine was impacted by low opening in-pit stock levels at the start of F2017 which
emanated from mining in a constrained pit as well as low availability of drills, dragline and the Hitachi shovel during F2016.
ROM coal purchases to fill the plant, and contractors brought in to assist with overburden stripping, resulted in on-mine
production costs, excluding capitalised costs, being 29% higher than in 1H F2016. The dragline has commenced mining in
a new pit with adequate pit length and as a result, in-pit stocks have increased during the last quarter, which resulted in a
steady improvement in production levels during this period.

Participating Coal Business (PCB)

The PCB business experienced an exceptionally good six months with saleable production increasing by 17% from 6.78  mtpa to 
almost 8 mtpa. Although total on-mine costs increase by 8.7%, the cost per saleable tonne produced decreased by 7%, aided by 
significant volumes of ROM coal being fed into the plant from the stockpile that was built during the construction phase of 
the Tweefontein Optimisation Project. The attributable cash operating profit increased from R195 million to R539 million as 
a result of a 40% increase in revenue offset by a 6% increase in cost of sales. Although export sales volumes decreased by 5%, 
export revenue was R383 million higher than 1H F2016 due to a 43% increase in average US Dollar sales prices and a weakening 
of the Rand/Dollar exchange rate. PCB achieved attributable headline earnings of R125 million for 1H F2017 (1H F2016: 
R105 million headline loss).

Projects:

Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP)

TOP comprises of opencast operations which include the mining of some pillars in the old underground operations and the
construction of the new and more efficient Coal Handling and Processing Plant.

As at 31 December 2016, 99% of the total project cost had been committed and spent. The project is now in full production
and only some minor infrastructure items still have to be completed. A saving of R681 million occurred and anticipate final
project cost of R7.5 billion.

ARM's economic interest in PCB is 20.2%. PCB consists of two large mining complexes situated in Mpumalanga. ARM has
a 26% effective interest in the Goedgevonden Mine situated near Ogies in Mpumalanga.

Attributable refers to 20.2% of PCB whilst total refers to 100%.

ARM Copper

The mine performed well during a very difficult period by downsizing production and associated personnel. The C1 cash
unit cost of production decreased by 7% during 1H F2017, to US$2.22/lb of copper produced (1H F2016: US$2.39/lb). The
largest contributors to the unit cost savings were a reduction in labour cost due to a 66% reduction in expatriate labour, a
reduction in stoping dilution obtained through an improvement in the mining stoping method, and a 4% increase in plant
recoveries obtained through plant optimisation initiatives.

During the period under review, the average realised copper price of US$5 004 per tonne was 1% lower than the
corresponding period in F2016. In November and December 2016, the copper price substantially increased and the
average price for December 2016 was US$5 666 per tonne (US$2.57/lb).

The improvement initiatives and cost reduction measures implemented at Lubambe decreased the headline loss from
R275 million in 1H F2016 to R178 million in 1H F2017.

Lubambe Copper Mine

1H F2017 represents the first reporting period in which Lubambe operated in accordance with the reduced production
target of 80 000 tonnes of ore per month. The reduced target was implemented in March 2016 to curtail operating losses,
save cash and preserve the orebody whilst implementing a strategy to upgrade the underground dewatering infrastructure.
Notwithstanding these challenges, Lubambe milled 545 162 tonnes and achieved the target for the first phase of the
dewatering strategy with a 30% reduction on capital costs compared to 1H F2016. A 5% improvement in the head grade
combined with a 4% increase in the concentrator plant recovery, resulted in copper production of 9 644 tonnes which is a
9% improvement in copper produced.

During 1H F2017, more than 300% increase in underground pumping capacity was obtained through the successful
upgrade of the underground pumping infrastructure. The upgrades enabled Lubambe to dewater all declines that were
previously flooded for a period of 10 months. Following the dewatering, substantial progress was made in the development
of the declines. During November and December 2016, decline development advance was well in excess of requirements
for sustainable production. This achievement will enable Lubambe to obtain access to new ore development areas at a
faster rate, which will enhance the ability to ramp-up mining production.

During the period under review a labour restructuring programme was successfully concluded which aligned the total
labour complement with the revised lower production rate of 80 000 tonnes per month.

Ongoing capital expenditure was curtailed to preserve cash with the majority of expenditure being incurred for mine ramp development.

The Lubambe Extension Project

The Lubambe Extension Project has been put on hold until an opportune time when conditions are suitable for additional investment.

This high-grade area remains an integral part of the future development of the Lubambe ore body.

ARM owns 100% of ARM Copper. ARM Copper owns 50% of the Vale/ARM joint venture. The effective interest of ARM in
the Lubambe Copper Mine is 40% as ZCCM-IH has a 20% shareholding.

ARM Strategic Services and Exploration

The Strategic Services and Exploration division undertakes information technology, technical support, strategic support,
project development, exploration and new business opportunity evaluations.

Costs for the ARM Strategic Services and Exploration division were R12 million (1H F2016: R10 million).

Projects

The Projects Development team works closely with the operating divisions to manage major capital projects.

The Black Rock Mine efficiency and modernisation project in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa has progressed
within budget and timing. The refurbishments on the Nchwaning 2 Shaft have been completed and the shaft is now
operational, ramping up to full planned production. All other mine development is proceeding as per project schedule.

The Sakura Ferroalloys Smelter project at Bintulu, Sarawak State, Malaysia has been completed and both furnaces are
fully commissioned and operational producing high carbon Ferromanganese alloys.

Exploration and New Business

ARM has established a focussed team to identify new mineral business opportunities for sustainable and responsible
development. New growth will come from expanding existing operations where possible, as well as through new minerals
commodity opportunities in emerging regions. The unit undertakes business intelligence, studies and evaluations for
acquisitions and mergers.

ARM pursues new mineral investment opportunities through a ""commodity driven strategy"", based on commodities within
ARM's current portfolio, such as PGM's, copper, nickel, iron, manganese and coal, and their various by-products. The
commodity suite is aligned to its existing portfolio of products and will leverage ARM's competencies to ensure the best
future growth potential for ARM.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)

Harmony reported headline earnings of R657 million for the six months ended 31 December 2016. Headline earnings per
share amounted to 150 cents compared to 324 cents per share reported for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (2H F2016).
The 1H F2017 headline earnings per share represent a significant turnaround to the headline loss of 103 cents re ported in the
previous comparable six months.

Revenue, including the gold hedge, increased by 3% to R9.9 billion compared to 2H F2016 mainly as a result of a 6% increase
in gold sold to 16 923 kg. The 1H F2017 US Dollar gold price received was 7% higher relative to 2H F2016 but was 3% lower
on a Rand basis owing to a 9% strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar.

Harmony's production profit decreased to R2.5 billion from R3.1 billion in 2H F2016 after accounting for an increase in cash
operating costs. All-in sustaining unit costs increased below inflation (by 4%) to R510 506/kg in 1H F2017 compared to
R492 898/kg in 2H F2016.

Positive operational cash flow generation in the past 12 months enabled Harmony to pay a final dividend of R218 million in
September 2016 for F2016, and reduce net debt from R1.1 billion at the end of 30 June 2016 to R289 million at the end of
31 December 2016. Harmony declared an interim dividend of 50 cents per share for 1H F2017.

The ARM Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2016 reflects a mark-to-market investment in Harmony of
R2.0 billion at a share price of R31.53 per share (1H F2016: R15.60 per share). Changes in the value of the investment in
Harmony, to the extent that they represent a significant or prolonged decline below the cost of the investment, are adjusted
through the Income Statement, net of tax. Gains above the cost are accounted for, net of deferred capital gains tax, through the
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Dividends are recognised in the ARM Income Statement on the last day of registration
following dividend declaration.

Harmony's results for the six months ended 31 December 2016 can be viewed on Harmony's website at http://www.harmony.co.za.

ARM owns 14.6% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Outlook

The mining industry has benefitted from increased US Dollar commodity prices particularly in bulk commodities. The
increase in prices can be attributed to a number of factors including (i) the stabilisation of global commodity supply, (ii) the
outcome of the US presidential elections and (iii) decreasing commodity inventory levels. The price increases particularly
in the latter part of the period under review, have in many instances been quite marked indicating that the previously
depressed prices were not sustainable. The recent strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar has to some extent
partly offset the US dollar price gains.

Looking forward it is estimated that US Dollar commodity prices could come off recent highs and settle at lower levels
while the Rand could remain relatively strong. As a result, ARM continues to focus on areas within its control such as cost
containment, prudency of capital expenditure, capital allocation and the detailed review of unprofitable operations.

Since the period end ARM has repaid the ARM corporate facility borrowings partly utilising the dividend received from
Assmang of R1.5 billion. ARM continues to investigate a number of growth opportunities including organic growth projects,
research and development projects and merger and acquisition transactions.

3.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
3.1   Nkomati Nickel Mine
      At 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Nkomati Nickel Mine cash generating unit was recognised, largely as a result of:

       (i)  A revision of the mine plan with a resultant lower metal output profile.
       (ii) A significant decline from the prior year forecast long-term price of nickel and a further strengthening of the Rand/US$
            exchange rate.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment charge amounted to R988 million before tax and R711 million after tax.

      The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in terms
      of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      A pre-tax discount rate of 20.72% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and exchange
      rate assumptions.

3.2   Modikwa Platinum Mine
      At 31 December 2016, an impairment loss of the Modikwa Platinum Mine cash generating unit attributable to ARM, was
      recognised largely as a result of:

      (i)   Lower forecast PGM output over the short- to medium-term;
      (ii)  Higher forecast unit cost of production;
      (iii) A reduction in the forecast long-term platinum price and a further strengthening of the Rand/US$ exchange rate.

      ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to R1 255 million before tax, R890 million after tax and R734 million after
      non-controlling interest and tax.

      The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit was determined based on the value-in-use calculation performed in terms
      of International Financial Reporting Standards.

      A pre-tax discount rate of 18.72% was used for the impairment calculation together with the following metal prices and exchange

Trading statement in respect of the six month period ended 31 December 2016

African Rainbow Minerals Limited
(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)

(“ARM” or the “Company”)


Trading statement in respect of the six month period ended
31 December 2016

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited (the JSE), a listed company is required to publish a
trading statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable
degree of certainty exists that the financial results for the
period to be reported on next will differ by at least 20% from
those of the previous corresponding period.



ARM’s headline earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2016
(1H F2017) were positively impacted by an increase in average US
Dollar commodity prices for most of the commodities which ARM
produces in comparison to the average US Dollar prices achieved
during the previous corresponding period ended 31 December 2015
(1H F2016). Most operations, except Goedgevonden Coal Mine (GGV)
and Nkomati Nickel Mine (Nkomati), achieved unit cost increases
below inflation. Sales volumes for Nkomati were lower than those
in 1H F2016 as a result of production challenges at the
operation.



Accordingly, ARM announces that headline earnings per share for
1H F2017 are expected to increase by between 272% and 288%
compared to 1H F2016 to between 867 cents and 903 cents based on
weighted average number of shares in issue of 189 529 000 (1H
F2016: 217 550 000). The decrease in the weighted average number
of shares in issue at 31 December 2016 in comparison to 31
December 2015, results from the restructuring of the ARM Broad-
Based Economic Empowerment Trust as more fully explained in the
announcement issued by ARM on the Stock Exchange News Service of
the JSE on 19 August 2016.



Headline earnings reported for 1H F2016 were R507 million, while
headline earnings per share were 233 cents.
ARM’s 1H F2017 basic earnings were negatively impacted mainly by
(i) an attributable impairment of the Nkomati assets of R711
million after tax, (ii) an attributable impairment of the Modikwa
Platinum Mine assets of R734 million after tax and non-
controlling interest and (iii) an attributable impairment loss on
investment of R422 million within the Assmang Joint Venture
related to the sale of Dwarsrivier. The basic loss per share for
1H F2017 is expected to improve by between 69% and 75% to a basic
loss per share of between 115 cents and 140 cents.



The basic loss reported for 1H F2016 was R996 million, while the
basic loss per share was 458 cents.



The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external
auditors of ARM.



The Company’s 1H F2017 interim financial results will be released
on 16 March 2017.

Salient features
-    headline earnings decreased by 40% to R1 051 million (F2015: R1 744 million). Headline
     earnings per share were 494 cents compared to 803 cents in the previous corresponding
     financial year.
-    ARM declares a tenth annual consecutive dividend of 225 cents per share (F2015: 350 cents per share).
-    Basic earnings were a loss of R565 million (F2015: R104 million basic earnings) and were
     impacted mainly by an attributable impairment of R1 404 million of the Lubambe Copper
     Mine assets as recorded in the first half of the financial year under review.
-    As part of the review of Lubambe Mine, all options are currently being considered to
     maximise value for ARM.
-    All operations implemented cost reduction initiatives which have yielded excellent results.
     The iron ore, manganese ore, Modikwa, Nkomati, Lubambe and PCB operations all achieved
     decreases in unit production costs while Two Rivers Mine achieved a below-inflation
     increase in unit production costs.
-    Record sales volumes of 17 million tonnes were achieved in iron ore and the manganese
     ore, platinum, nickel and PCB operations increased sales volumes.
-    Attributable segmental capital expenditure reduced by R974 million to R2 352 million
     (F2015: R3 326 million).
-    ARM and Impala Platinum Holdings Limited reached an agreement to increase ARM's
     shareholding in Two Rivers Mine from 51% to 54%. Completion of the agreement is awaiting
     a Section 11 consent to transfer ownership of mining assets from ARM to Two Rivers.
-    ARM completed the disposal of its 50% indirect interest in Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine after
     the year-end and received R450 million as the purchase consideration.
-    Restructuring of the ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment (BBEE) Trust (the Trust),
     resulting in a more permanent and sustainable funding solution for the Trust, was completed on
     22 April 2016. ARM's guarantees of R850 million in favour of the Trust were cancelled.

ARM operational review
The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces headline earnings of R1 051 million for the financial year
ended 30 June 2016 (F2016). These headline earnings are 40% lower than the previous corresponding financial year ended
30 June 2015 (F2015).

All of the ARM Ferrous divisions delivered positive headline earnings. In ARM Platinum, Two Rivers Mine contributed
R318 million to headline earnings while the Modikwa and Nkomati mines recorded headline losses of R84 million and
R244 million respectively. The decrease in the Nkomati Mine headline earnings was mainly as a result of a 39% decline
in the average US Dollar realised price (22% decline in Rand terms) for nickel. Despite attributable cash operating profit
of R601 million, ARM Coal incurred a headline loss of R297 million due to lower realised US Dollar export coal prices,
a decline in sales volumes and an increase in unit production costs at Goedgevonden (GGV) Mine together with higher
interest charges. The ARM Copper headline loss increased by 29% to R555 million mainly due to lower US Dollar copper
prices and a weaker average Rand versus US Dollar exchange rate at which the results were translated.

The provisional results for the year ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

Global commodity markets continue to be challenging as evidenced by low commodity prices which have persisted over the
past couple of years. In recent months US Dollar prices for most commodities have been increasing, the benefit of which
has been offset by the strengthening of the Rand versus the US Dollar. The recovery in commodity prices is expected to
be relatively slow.

In the financial year under review US Dollar prices for all the commodities in ARM's portfolio were lower than the previous
financial year. Realised US Dollar export iron ore prices were 23% lower while realised US Dollar prices for export manganese
ore decreased by 31%. PGM prices were also lower with US Dollar platinum, palladium and rhodium prices down by 23%,
28% and 40% respectively. US Dollar nickel prices were 39% lower than F2015 while US Dollar export coal prices decreased
by 25%. The 27% weakening of the Rand versus the US Dollar only partially offset the decline in US Dollar prices.

ARM continues to respond proactively to the low commodity price environment by focusing on the areas within
management's control. These include improving operational efficiencies and reducing unit costs, prudently deferring or
reducing capital expenditure without negatively impacting the long-term value of operations, optimising working capital and
restructuring loss making operations.

Volumes were higher at most operations with increases as follows:
-   Iron ore sales volumes were 5% higher to a record level of 17.0 million tonnes;
-   Manganese ore sales volumes (excluding intra-group sales) increased by 13% to 3.1 million tonnes;
-   Dwarsrivier chrome ore sales volumes increased by 7% to 1.1 million tonnes;
-   PGM production volumes (including Nkomati Mine) were 10% higher to 851 924 6E PGM ounces; and
-   PCB export coal sales increased by 38% to 14.8 million tonnes.

Nickel sales volumes increased marginally to 21 592 tonnes while manganese alloy sales were reduced as a result of
poor market conditions. Export coal sales volumes at GGV Mine were negatively affected by a 22% decrease in the mine's
saleable production volumes mainly due to mining entering a localised geological mineralisation discontinuity and pinching
area. The mine was also negatively affected by wage-related industrial action, delays in environmental approvals for the
lower strip ratio pit and longer than planned downtime on equipment.

Improving operational efficiencies and reducing unit costs
ARM's operations have all implemented cost-cutting initiatives which have yielded positive results in the financial year
under review. All operations, except GGV Mine and the manganese alloys operations, achieved either decreases in unit
production costs or increases below the inflation rate.

The iron ore, manganese ore, PCB and Lubambe operations achieved decreases in on-mine unit production costs per
tonne while Nkomati and Modikwa mines held on-mine unit production costs per tonne flat for the year. On a C1 unit cash
cost net of by-products basis Nkomati Mine achieved a 14% reduction while Modikwa Mine unit costs per PGM ounce
were 3% lower. Two Rivers Mine unit production costs per PGM ounce increased by only 5% while unit production costs
at the manganese alloys operations were 9% higher as production volumes were strategically reduced in line with adverse
conditions in the manganese alloy market.

GGV Mine unit production costs increased above inflation by 27% as a result of a 22% decrease in saleable production
volumes as mentioned above.

Prudently deferring or reducing capital expenditure
Capital expenditure across all operations continues to be reviewed with the aim of reducing or deferring capital expenditure.
Due consideration is given to ensure that capital expenditure deferrals or reductions do not adversely affect operations or
negatively impact value in the long term.

Attributable segmental capital expenditure for F2016 reduced by R974 million or 29% to R2 352 million (F2015:
R3 326 million). The largest single component of this expenditure was attributable to the Black Rock Project which will
modernise the manganese ore operations optimising the exploitation of the higher grade Seam 1 and Seam 2 manganese
resources in the Nchwaning mining complex and ensure greater efficiency in mining, processing and loading. The project will
also create flexibility to ensure that the Black Rock Mine can effectively respond to changes in market product requirements.

Restructuring loss making operations
The Lubambe Mine continued to experience a number of operational challenges which, coupled with the decline in
US Dollar copper prices, has led to the mine recording headline losses and requiring continuing cash support from the
partners in the current financial year. As part of the F2016 interim results announcement in March 2016, ARM indicated
that the Lubambe Mine was being placed under review. As part of this review all options are currently being considered to
maximise value for ARM. Merchant bankers have been appointed in this regard and an announcement will be made when
appropriate.

The ARM Coal Division recorded a headline loss despite the GGV and PCB operations delivering attributable cash
operating profit of R204 million and R397 million respectively. Interest payable on the loans in ARM Coal continues
to put pressure on the ARM Coal headline earnings with attributable interest paid in the financial year under review of
R491 million (F2015: R413 million) for the division.

The Nkomati Mine headline loss was mainly due to the significant decline in US Dollar nickel prices. The mine implemented
a number of restructuring initiatives to reduce production costs and minimise cash requirements from the partners. These
include:
-   Placing the high-cost underground mine on care and maintenance;
-   Reducing the labour complement by 300 employees; and
-   Deferring waste stripping to a minimum without impacting the annualised tonnage milled.

The Modikwa Mine encountered delays in infrastructure and construction work at the South 2 Decline. We are confident
that once completed this decline will ramp up production.

Operating safely
ARM is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. There were no fatalities
in the financial year under review and ARM achieved its lowest Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of 0.32 per
200 000 man-hours (F2015: 0.35 per 200 000 man-hours). Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) for F2016 reduced to 86 from 
103 in F2015.

Safety achievements in the period under review:
-    ARM Ferrous achieved its lowest LTIFR at 0.22 per 200 000 man-hours;
-    Nkomati Mine completed 5 million fatality-free shifts in January 2016;
-    Black Rock Mine completed 4 million fatality-free shifts in September 2015;
-    Two Rivers, Beeshoek, Dwarsrivier and Lubambe mines each completed 3 million fatality-free shifts during the financial year;
-    Modikwa Mine completed 2 million fatality-free shifts in November 2015;
-    Cato Ridge works completed 2 million fatality-free shifts in February 2016; and
-    Beeshoek Mine completed 14 000 fatality-free production shifts on 22 December 2015, an achievement that took
     13 years to complete.

Safety figures and statistics are reported on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations.

Changes to mineral resources and reserves
There has been no material change to ARM's mineral resources and reserves as disclosed in the Integrated Annual Report
for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the operations.

Financial commentary
Headline earnings for the year to 30 June 2016 of R1 051 million were 40% less than the prior year headline earnings
(F2015: R1 744 million). This equates to headline earnings of R4.94 per share (F2015: R8.03 per share).

The Board declared its tenth consecutive annual dividend of R2.25 per share (F2015: R3.50 per share) after the financial
year-end.

ARM's basic earnings for F2016 were a loss of R565 million (F2015: R104 million basic earnings) and were negatively
impacted by special items of R1 616 million after tax and non-controlling interest (F2015: R1 640 million loss after tax
and non-controlling interest). The special items largely comprise an attributable impairment of the Lubambe Copper Mine
assets of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest, as reflected in the 31 December 2015 interim results. Additional
special items are set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The reconciliation of basic earnings to headline earnings is
provided in note 5 to the financial statements.

Sales for the year decreased by 6% to R8.75 billion (F2015: R9.26 billion). Sales for the Assmang joint venture were almost
unchanged at R10.33 billion (F2015: R10.56 billion) for the year.

The segmental EBITDA margins shown in the graph on page 37 show a decrease in F2016 when compared to F2015 with
the notable exception of iron ore where margins were maintained at 37%.

Cost reduction and containment efforts have been successful at most operations with unit production cost increases being
held to inflation or lower. The gross profit margins achieved at each operation may be ascertained from the detailed
segment reports provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

Earnings were positively impacted by the weakening of the Rand against the US Dollar. The F2016 average Rand/US
Dollar exchange rate of R14.51/US$ was 27% weaker than the average of R11.45/US$ for F2015. For reporting purposes,
the closing exchange rate was R14.68/US$.

Realised US Dollar commodity prices for all of ARM's commodities were lower than in F2015.

ARM's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) excluding special items and income from
associates and joint ventures were R1 185 million (F2015: R2 087 million), which is 43% lower than that achieved in F2015.

The income from joint venture amounts to R1 301 million, which includes the negative impact of special items, and is
essentially flat compared to last year (F2015: R1 289 million). The expanded segmental analysis for ARM Ferrous is shown
in note 2 to the financial statements.

The detailed segmental contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.
-  The ARM Ferrous contribution to ARM's headline earnings amounted to R1 441 million (F2015: R1 588 million). This
   is a decrease of 9% compared to the F2015 result and is largely due to a R91 million lower contribution from the
   manganese division. The iron ore division achieved a very good result and contributed R1 215 million to headline
   earnings (F2015: R1 248 million).
   The results for the Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine have been reflected as ""Income from discontinued operations"" in the ARM
   Ferrous segmental information as the sale transaction was only concluded in July 2016. The Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine
   assets have been disclosed as assets held for sale in the ARM Ferrous segment analysis.
-  The ARM Platinum contribution, which includes the results of Nkomati Mine, was a loss of R10 million and represents
   a large decrease from the R405 million positive contribution for F2015. The decreased contribution is mainly due to a
   R394 million lower contribution from Nkomati Mine. The Two Rivers Mine maintained a strong positive contribution to
   headline earnings of R318 million (F2015: R319 million) which is an excellent result.
-  ARM Coal reported an increased headline loss of R297 million (F2015: R93 million) largely as a result of higher finance
   charges in GGV and PCB and a lower cash operating profit at GGV Mine of R204 million (F2015: R418 million).
-  The ARM Copper result, excluding the impairment charge of R1 404 million which was accounted for in the
   31 December 2015 interim results, was a headline loss of R555 million (F2015: R430 million headline loss). This result
   includes interest on shareholders' loans of R230 million (F2015: R159 million). The translation of the F2016 Income
   Statement to Rand was calculated at the F2016 average exchange rate of R14.51/US$ (F2015: R11.45/US$).
-  The ARM Exploration costs reduced to R23 million (F2015: R50 million) as no further costs were incurred on the
   Rovuma Project.
-  The ARM Corporate, other companies and consolidation segment shows a positive contribution to headline earnings of
   R495 million for the year (F2015: R324 million). The higher contribution is largely due to increased unrealised foreign
   exchange gains on loans made by ARM to Lubambe, which entity's functional currency is US Dollar, resulting from the
   Rand versus the US Dollar exchange rate weakening from R12.16/US$ at 30 June 2015 to R14.68/US$ at 30 June
   2016. The ARM Company loans to Lubambe amounted to US$158 million at 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: US$133
   million).

The ARM BBEE Trust (""the Trust"") was restructured in April 2016. The restructuring comprised the following main elements:
1. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ARM bought 12.7 million ARM shares from the Trust for a consideration of R651 million.
2. ARM advanced a loan to the Trust of approximately R800 million.
3. Harmony advanced a loan of R200 million to the Trust.
4. The total of the abovementioned funds received by the Trust were used by the Trust to significantly reduce and
   refinance its bank loan. The bank loan to the Trust remaining after the refinance amounted to R300 million.

The consolidated results of ARM are mainly impacted by the restructuring of the Trust as follows:
-  With effect from 22 April 2016 the Trust is consolidated into the ARM results.
-  The number of shares to be used in any ARM ""per share"" calculations will exclude the 12 717 328 ARM shares owned
   by the wholly-owned ARM subsidiary and the 15 897 412 ARM shares owned by the Trust. As this change was effective
   from 22 April 2016 it only proportionately impacts the F2016 weighted and diluted average number of shares in issue.
-  The Nedbank and Harmony loans to the Trust are included in the ARM consolidated long-term borrowings.
-  The interest charged on the Nedbank and Harmony loans to the Trust are included in the interest paid charge in the
   ARM consolidated income statement.
-  The guarantees from ARM to Nedbank were cancelled upon the implementation of the restructuring and are therefore
   no longer reflected as contingent liabilities.

The ARM consolidated cash and cash equivalents and borrowings have changed significantly as a result of the
abovementioned restructuring of the Trust. At 30 June 2016 cash and cash equivalents amounted to R1 316 million
(F2015: R2 257 million). This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of
R2 399 million (F2015: R2 471 million).

Total borrowings at 30 June 2016 were R5 551 million (F2015: R3 882 million). There is no debt at ARM Ferrous
(F2015: Rnil). The increase in debt is largely due to the increase in the amount owing on the ARM corporate facility of
R1 400 million at 30 June 2016 (F2015: Rnil) and the inclusion of the Nedbank and Harmony loans to the ARM BBEE Trust
of R501 million (F2015: not applicable). The ARM corporate facility was utilised to advance the interest-bearing loan to the
Trust. Details of long and short-term borrowings are reflected in note 8 to the financial statements.

As per the statement of Financial Position, the consolidated net debt amounts to R4 235 million (overdrafts, short-term and
long-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) and is higher in comparison to the net debt position of R1 625 million
at 30 June 2015. Details of cash and borrowings are set out in notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.

As announced on 29 July 2016 the proceeds from the sale of ARM's effective indirect 50% interest in the Dwarsrivier
Chrome Mine of R450 million were received by ARM after the year-end.

Cash generated from operations decreased by R1 283 million to R1 225 million and includes an R80 million increase
in working capital (F2015: decreased working capital of R163 million). The dividends received from the Assmang joint
venture amounted to R875 million (F2015: R1.50 billion). Since the year-end ARM received a dividend of R750 million
from Assmang.

Cash spent on capital expenditure reduced by R424 million to R852 million (F2015: R1 276 million). Attributable capital
expenditure at the Assmang joint venture reduced to R1 422 million (F2015: R1 830 million).

The consolidated ARM total assets of R35.1 billion (F2015: R35.3 billion) include the increased marked-to-market
valuation of ARM's investment in Harmony of R3 339 million (F2015: R992 million) at a share price of R52.47 per share
F2015: R15.59 per share). Changes in the value of the investment in Harmony, to the extent that they represent a significant
or prolonged decline below the cost of the investment, are adjusted through the Income Statement, net of tax. Gains are
accounted for, net of deferred capital gains tax, through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Dividends from Harmony
are recognised in the ARM Income Statement on the last day of registration following dividend declaration.

Events after the reporting date are set out in note 15 to the financial statements.

ARM Ferrous
ARM Ferrous headline earnings were 9% lower at R1 441 million compared to R1 588 million in F2015. The lower earnings
were mainly as a result of a 23% decline in US Dollar export iron ore prices and a 31% decrease in export manganese ore
prices which were largely offset by the weakening of the Rand versus the US Dollar, unit cost reductions and higher iron
ore sales volumes.

ARM Ferrous achieved record iron ore sales volumes of 17.0 million tonnes of which 14.1 million tonnes were sold in the
export market and 2.9 million tonnes were sold locally. Iron ore production volumes were up 4% to 16.7 million tonnes.

The Khumani Mine continued to supply the export market while Beeshoek Mine secured a 3 million tonne per annum
off-take agreement with a South African steel producer for three years until December 2018. Beeshoek Mine's smaller
customers exited the market due to a decline in local steel prices and are expected to remain out of the market for the
foreseeable future. The overall implication is that Beeshoek Mine had to revise its annual saleable production profile down
from 4 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes per annum. Part of this reduction included rescheduling the exploitation rate of the
Village Pit and a review of Beeshoek Mine's labour complement. This work was completed in early F2016 and a sustainable
mine plan has been completed for Beeshoek Mine.

The manganese ore operations were able to increase sales volumes despite ongoing work on the modernisation of the
Black Rock Mine. Sales volumes increased by 13% to 3.1 million tonnes of which 3.0 million tonnes were exported and
0.1 million tonnes sold locally. Manganese ore production volumes were 5% lower at 2.9 million tonnes.

Machadodorp Works is only recovering ferrochrome from the historical slag dump through the metal recovery plant which
has approximately 12 months left. Thereafter, the operation will recover ferromanganese slag through the metal recovery
plant for approximately eight months. ARM and Assore are in the process of evaluating all available options for the future
of Machadodorp Works.

At the Cato Ridge ferromanganese operation only three of the six furnaces are currently operating.

A total impairment of R146 million after tax (on an attributable basis) was recorded at Cato Ridge and Machadodorp Works.

Manganese alloy sales volumes were 22% lower due to an oversupply in the global ferromanganese market.

Unit cost control continues to be a key focus at all the ARM Ferrous operations.

Khumani Mine successfully completed several safety, operational efficiency and unit cost improvement initiatives during
F2016. These initiatives yielded the following results:
-   Lowering of the LTIFR by 42% to 0.17 per 200 000 man-hours;
-   Increasing the off-grade plant yield from 62% to 66%;
-   Improving the lumpy yield produced from 53% to 54%;
-   Increasing iron ore production by 7% to 13.6 million tonnes (F2015: 12.7 million tonnes);
-   Reducing on-mine unit production costs by 12% to R194.10 per tonne (F2015: R221.12 per tonne);
-   Reducing unit cost of sales by 4% to R497.90 per tonne (F2015: R516.80 per tonne);
-   Decreasing capital expenditure by R250 million. The decrease was mainly as a result of reviewing the waste stripping
    ratio of the mine without compromising its long-term sustainability; and
-   Establishing on-site boreholes to reduce the dependence on water supply from the Sedibeng Water Board.

Black Rock Mine's safety, operational efficiency and unit cost improvement initiatives yielded the following good results:
-   Lowering the LTIFR to 0.35 per 200 000 man-hours;
-   Decreasing on-mine unit production costs by 6% to R449.49 per tonne (F2015: R475.74 per tonne);
-   Reducing the permanent workforce by 435 employees; resulting in an annualised cost saving of approximately R197 million;
-   Substantial productivity improvement (measured in tonnes produced per day) on all shaft complexes; and
-   Increasing high-grade ore production.

ARM Ferrous capital expenditure (on 100% basis) was approximately R1.0 billion lower at R3.0 billion. This expenditure
included R1.7 billion spent on the Black Rock Project.

Khumani Mine capital expenditure mainly comprised waste stripping at Bruce and King, infill drilling required to enhance the
geological block models of the various mineable pits, the purchase of replacement mining equipment and the establishment
of alternative water resources on the mine.

Beeshoek Mine capital expenditure mainly comprised the Village Pit exploitation, vehicle proximity detection and
replacement capital.

The Black Rock Project (which is discussed in more detail below) represents the majority of the Ferrous Division's capital
expenditure for F2016. Other capital expenditure items at Black Rock Mine included underground mining equipment, water
storage dams, ongoing replacement of mining equipment and various risk mitigating projects.

Dwarsrivier Mine's capital expenditure mainly comprised equipping the North Shaft underground development and the
installation of new equipment in the beneficiation plant.

Logistics
An agreement was reached with Transnet regarding the manganese ore export capacity as per the interim Manganese
Export Capacity Allocation (MECA2) process. Synchronisation of the ramp-up of the Black Rock Mine with the longer term
(MECA3) process is ongoing.

ARM Ferrous continues to experience good service levels on its 14 million tonnes per annum iron ore export supply route
from Transnet.

Projects
Black Rock Project
The capital requirement for the Black Rock Project was reduced from R6.7 billion to R6.0 billion. 80% of this revised project
budget has been committed to date and 56% of the project capital has been paid out to service providers, contractors and
suppliers. The project is approximately 68% complete and good progress has been made with the construction of additional
surface infrastructure. The shutdown to upgrade Nchwaning II Shaft is progressing well and all indications are that the
planned shutdown is on schedule.

Sinking of the ventilation shaft at Gloria Mine was successfully completed in time and on budget while the equipping of the
vent shaft is in progress.

The primary focus of the project remains:
-   The modernisation of the mine to optimise resource exploitation and to maximise utilisation of production hours,
    production fleet and mining equipment;
-   The cost-efficient exploitation of Seam 1 and Seam 2 manganese resources at the Nchwaning mining complex,
    targeting the production of high-grade manganese products;
-   The modernisation of the surface plant infrastructure to ensure the cost-efficient processing and separation of the
    various high-grade manganese products from the two Seams;
-   Creating the flexibility within the underground operations at the Nchwaning Shafts to ensure that the mine can more
    effectively react to changes in market product requirements;
-   Creating the ability to exploit the high-grade ore within Nchwaning I; and
-   Establishing the load-out capacity and efficiency required to meet the requirements as set by Transnet for the Nqura
    Port facility.

Beeshoek Village Pit
The Beeshoek Village Pit Project is progressing on schedule and within budget. The first iron ore was extracted successfully
from the pit in April 2016. The initial ore extracted conforms to the quality specifications derived from the geological drilling
work which was completed as part of the motivation for the exploitation of the Village Pit. The Village Pit Project extends the
life-of-mine for Beeshoek Mine from two years to 12 years at a sustainable production rate of 3 million tonnes per annum.

The mining schedules for Village Pit are continuously under review to align the mining programme to the production output of
3 million tonnes per annum planned for Beeshoek Mine, and also to ensure that the Village Pit is exploited as cost-
effectively as possible by minimising waste stripping rates whilst ensuring that the product qualities can be sustained.
Work done during F2016 resulted in the stripping ratio for Beeshoek Mine being reduced from 4.8:1 to 3.1:1. This enables
Beeshoek Mine to successfully compete in a low price environment.

Sakura Ferroalloys Project
The project in Malaysia has progressed well with the first furnace being handed over to operations in April 2016. The
first sale of alloy took place in June 2016. The construction of the second furnace has been completed and handed over
to operations who are preparing to hot commission during September 2016. Production from this unit is expected in
September 2016.

The project remains within the original budget of US$328 million.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese
and chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum
The ARM Platinum mines achieved improved operational performance delivering increased production volumes and good
unit production cost control.

PGM production (on a 100% basis, including Nkomati) increased by 10% to 851 924 6E ounces (F2015: 776 996 6E ounces).
Nkomati Mine's nickel production increased marginally to 21 592 tonnes (F2015: 21 298 tonnes) as a result of increased
milling volumes. Two Rivers Mine achieved record PGM production of 400 722 6E ounces (F2015: 372 592 6E ounces) and
remains positioned at the bottom of the cost curve. The mine also achieved an 18% increase in chrome concentrate sales.
Modikwa Mine's PGM volumes increased by 13% to 293 604 6E ounces (F2015: 260 037 6E ounces).

The low PGM and nickel prices negatively impacted all the ARM Platinum operations. Two Rivers Mine maintained their
positive headline earnings while headline losses were recorded at both the Modikwa and Nkomati mines, resulting in an
attributable headline loss of R10 million for the division (F2015: headline earnings of R405 million).

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on 100% basis) reduced by 34% to R1 052 million (F2015: R1 589 million).

As previously reported, market conditions necessitated Modikwa Mine's capital projects to be reviewed to reduce capital
expenditure without adversely affecting the mine's future ability to ramp-up production. During F2016, the following actions
were implemented:
-   Deferral of capital expenditure at North Shaft 9 level;
-   Restructuring of the South 1 and South 2 shafts to enable operational synergies and cost savings; and
-   Continuation of the capital project at South 2 Phase 1 to improve mining flexibility – stoping commenced in June 2015.

The above steps have reduced capital expenditure at Modikwa by 56% to R282 million (F2015: R646 million) during the
period under review.

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers Mine, 32% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment. The deepening of
the Main and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 46% of the total capital
expenditure.

Nkomati Mine's major capital expenditure items included a new cleaner bank for the MMZ Plant, the installation of an
anchored pile wall as well as the installation of a slope stability radar system. Due to the sharp decline in base metal prices,
capital spending at Nkomati was reduced substantially in the latter part of the reporting period and included a reduction in
waste stripping for a period of three months.

Two Rivers Mine
Attributable headline earnings at Two Rivers Mine remained flat. Tonnes milled increased by 4% while the head grade
increased by 2%, resulting in PGM ounces increasing by 8%. Of the 3.51 million tonnes milled, 81 623 tonnes were toll
treated at Modikwa as part of Two Rivers' working capital reduction initiatives.

Unit costs increased by 5% to R5 624 per 6E ounce (F2015: R5 365 per 6E ounce) mainly as a result of an 11% increase in
electricity cost. There was a 187 763 tonne decrease in the UG2 Run of Mine stockpile to a total of 372 558 tonnes of ore.

Two Rivers Mine increased chrome concentrate sales by 18% to 283 765 tonnes, contributing R130 million (F2015: R148 million)
to cash operating profit (on 100% basis).

ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers reduced from 55% to 51% on 6 February 2015. ARM and Implats subsequently reached
an agreement to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers Mine from 51% to 54%. Completion of the agreement is
awaiting a Section 11 consent to transfer ownership of mining assets from ARM to Two Rivers.

Modikwa Mine's attributable headline loss for the period was R84 million (F2015: R64 million headline loss) mainly due to
a 6% drop in the Rand basket price and R23 million of restructuring costs.

A 10% increase in milled tonnes, combined with a 2% increase in head grade, resulted in PGM production increasing
by 13% to 293 604 6E ounces (F2015: 260 037 6E ounces). Consequently, unit costs decreased by 3% to R8 244

Nkomati Mine
A 22% decline in the average Rand nickel price was largely responsible for the decline in contribution to an attributable
headline loss of R244 million (F2015: R150 million headline earnings) for the period under review. Attributable earnings
were also negatively affected by R41 million of restructuring costs, and a 13% increase in off-mine costs directly related to
the weakening in the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate.

Chrome concentrate sales decreased by 28% to 272 817 tonnes (F2015: 376 832 tonnes), but still contributed R120 million
to cash operating profit. The decrease in chrome production was as a result of the chrome washing plant being stopped in
November 2015 due to the decline in chrome prices.

Nkomati Mine's total tonnes milled increased by 3% to 8.24 million tonnes. Nickel units produced increased by 1% to
21 592 tonnes (F2015: 21 298 tonnes).

Nkomati Mine's C1 unit cash costs net of by-products decreased by 14% to US$4.18/lb (F2015: US$4.85/lb) as a result of
the weakening of the R/US$ exchange rate and increased by-product credits. Unit cost per tonne milled was maintained at
R295 per tonne (F2015: R296 per tonne).

The Nkomati Mine has maintained on-mine unit production costs per tonne in the range of R285 to R310 per tonne in
nominal terms for the past six years which is an excellent achievement.

In 1H F2016 ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R83 million after tax (F2015: nil) for the underground assets at
the Nkomati Mine.

Projects
Modikwa Mine
Due to a lack of mining flexibility a decision was taken to deepen North Shaft and sink the new South 2 Shaft. The current
status of these projects are detailed below:
-   Deepening of North Shaft – This project entails the deepening of North Shaft from Level 6 to Level 9 thereby
    establishing three new mining levels. To curtail capital expenditure, portions of this project were deferred during F2016,
    resulting in current development being delayed at Level 9. Levels 7 and 8 are both fully equipped with all the required
    mining infrastructure, and the chairlift installation to surface will be completed by September 2016.
-   Sinking of South 2 Shaft – This project entails the establishment of an additional new decline shaft system south of
    the current South Shaft infrastructure. The first phase of the project will enhance mining flexibility while also contributing
    to the overall production build-up of the mine. Phase one of the project will be completed in September 2016 and it will
    take the production capacity to 50 000 tonnes of ore per month. The second phase will follow and increase the design
    capacity of this shaft system to 100 000 tonnes per month.

The ARM Platinum division comprises:
-   Three operating mines:
    -  Modikwa – ARM Mining Consortium has an effective 41.5% interest in Modikwa where local communities hold an
       8.5% effective interest. The remaining 50% is held by Anglo American Platinum.
    -  Two Rivers – an ARM subsidiary in which ARM has a 51% shareholding and Implats 49%. ARM and Implats have
       reached agreement to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers by 3% from 51% to 54%. Completion of the
       agreement is awaiting a Section 11 consent to transfer ownership of mining assets from ARM to Two Rivers.
    -  Nkomati – a 50:50 partnership between ARM and Norilsk Nickel Africa.
 
-   Two prospecting rights:
    -  The ""Kalplats prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum holds 46% and Platinum Australia (PLA) holds 44%, with
       Anglo American holding 10%.
    -  The ""Kalplats Extended Area prospecting right"" in which ARM Platinum and PLA each have a 50% interest.

ARM Coal
ARM Coal's attributable headline loss increased by R204 million to R297 million mainly as a result of a decline in export
coal prices, higher interest paid and an increase in the amortisation charge.The export coal market remained in oversupply
in the last 12 months resulting in US Dollar export coal prices declining by 25%. This decline was more pronounced in the
second half of the financial year with average realised prices declining to US$38.44/t (1H F2016: US$43.54/t) for GGV Mine
and US$38.64/t (1H F2016: US$44.68/t) for PCB. The 27% weakening of the Rand versus the US Dollar was not enough
to offset the decline in US Dollar prices resulting in Rand export coal prices declining 5% in F2016.

ARM Coal export coal sales volumes were 17% higher mainly driven by increased volumes from the PCB operations as
the Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP) ramped up. GGV Mine export sales volumes and unit production costs were
negatively affected by a 22% decrease in saleable production volumes which was mainly as a result of mining in a lower
grade area and equipment availability. GGV Mine export sales were 24% lower while unit production costs increased by
27%. The PCB operations achieved an 18% reduction in on-mine unit production costs per saleable tonne.

GGV Mine
GGV Mine's saleable production decreased by 22% compared to F2015. In the first half of F2016 the mine's operational
performance was negatively impacted by production entering localised geological mineralisation discontinuity and pinching
mining area (the Pre-Karoo area) together with a 10-day wage related strike. Production was further hampered by a delay
in the issuance of the amended Environment Management Programme (EMP) by the Department of Minerals Resources
(DMR) which postponed mining in a low stripping ratio pit by four months. During this period mining was concentrated in
higher strip ratio pits.

In addition, the planned annual dragline maintenance over-ran by seven days during which time the Hitachi EX5500
overburden stripping shovel was also down for three weeks due to a major crack on the digging stick. Availability of the
larger spare parts for this machine is limited as this is the only machine in the country.

The impact of the delays in the new pit start-up and downtime in the overburden stripping machines impacted coal exposure
which in turn resulted in lower run-of-mine, a reduction in saleable production and lower sales volumes, particularly export
sales volumes.

On-mine costs per saleable tonne were 27% higher at R239 per tonne as a result of the lower production volumes.

Attributable cash operating profit of R204 million was 51% lower than F2015 mainly as a result of a 24% decline in export
sales volumes, combined with a 5% reduction in Rand prices. The lower prices and sales volumes were partly offset by the
weaker Rand and higher Eskom sales prices.

The lower cash operating profit, increased finance costs of R183 million and higher amortisation charge of R128 million
resulted in GGV recording an attributable headline loss of R87 million compared to headline earnings of R93 million for
F2015.

Participating Coal Business (PCB)
The mines comprising PCB reflected a 7% increase in saleable production for the year aided by the commissioning of the
Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP). The attributable cash operating profit increased by 21% to R397 million mainly as
a result of higher export sales volumes.

Export revenue was R1.02 billion higher than F2015 due to higher sales volumes (R514 million) and the weaker Rand
(R502 million) but a 24% decline in US Dollar export prices impacted profits negatively by R582 million. Despite the
increase in production volumes, total on-mine costs decreased by R111 million which, together with the increase in
production, resulted in on-mine unit costs decreasing by 18% to R273 per tonne.

A 38% increase in export sales volumes resulted in a decrease in stock values of R208 million and an increase of
R184 million in distribution costs. The amortisation charge increased by 17% due to the commissioning of the TOP project.

PCB recorded an attributable headline loss of R210 million (F2015: R186 million).

Projects
Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP)
TOP comprises of opencast operations which include the mining of some pillars in the old underground operations and the
construction of the new and more efficient Coal Handling and Processing Plant.

As at 30 June 2016, 99% of the total project costs had been committed and spent. The project is in full production ramp-up
with only some minor infrastructure items to be completed. A saving of R681 million against budget was realised.

ARM's economic interest in PCB is 20.2%. PCB consists of two large mining complexes situated in Mpumalanga. ARM
has a 26% effective interest in the GGV Mine situated near Ogies in Mpumalanga.

Attributable refers to 20.2% of PCB whilst total refers to 100%.

ARM Copper
The ARM Copper headline loss increased by 29% to R555 million mainly owing to a 20% reduction in the average realised
copper price from US$6 349 per tonne in F2015 to US$5 048 per tonne in F2016.

Production volumes at the Lubambe Mine reduced by 19% to approximately 21 000 tonnes copper as part of the revised
mining plan to 80 000 tonnes per month. Despite the decline in production volumes Lubambe Mine achieved a 14%
decrease in C1 unit cash costs to US$2.41/lb of copper produced (F2015: US$2.80/lb). Notably, during the last four months
of F2016, after the reduction of targeted tonnage was implemented, the C1 unit cash cost reduced to an average of
US$2.27/lb of copper produced.

After a number of changes in the mineral royalty tax during 2015, the Government of the Republic of Zambia amended the
mineral royalty tax in 2H F2016, to operate on a sliding scale from 4% to 8% as a function of the copper price.

In 1H F2016 ARM recorded an attributable impairment of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest (F2015: R784 million)
for the Lubambe Mine assets.

The Lubambe Copper Mine
During 2H F2016, a number of production scenarios were evaluated with the objective of minimising cash funding
requirements during the severely depressed copper market. Following the review process, it was agreed to reduce target
production to 80 000 tonnes milled per month, effective from 1 March 2016.

The 80 000 tonnes per month plan minimises cash funding requirements whilst preserving the mine through the creation
and build-up of mineable reserves in the high grade, long-life portion of the mine. In support of the reduced production plan
the following additional cost reduction measures were implemented:
-   Effective 1 March 2016, expatriate labour was reduced by 66% from 47 to 16;
-   Electricity costs were reduced with the shutdown of No 2 Shaft and the VS2C ventilation fan. This has allowed Lubambe
    Mine to reduce maximum demand and reduce the requirement for more expensive imported electrical power;
-   Mining vehicles not required to support the 80 000 tonne per month plan, have been parked; and
-   Suppliers were engaged to reduce costs of consumables and spares.

The implementation of the aforementioned cost saving initiatives resulted in an improvement in C1 cash cost from $2.47/lb
(year-to-date up to February 2016) to $2.27/lb average for March to June 2016.

The reduced production plan was achieved without compromising the ore grade, and provided an opportunity for the mine
to successfully complete the transition from contractor to owner operator. Operating costs have reduced accordingly. Milled
head grade during the last four months was 2.06% total copper, which is above the revised plan and indications are that
this improvement is sustainable.

Various mining and processing improvement initiatives, which commenced during F2015, resulted in an enhanced copper
head grade and marginally better copper concentrator recoveries. These improvements were especially pronounced in the
second half of the financial year which bodes well for the 2017 financial year.

Ore development was in line with revised targets while waste development was negatively impacted by greater than
anticipated ground water inflows into underground workings. A substantial upgrade of the underground pumping
infrastructure is underway and will increase pumping capacity from 6 000 m3/day to 20 000 m3/day. Subsequently, an
additional upgrade, will increase pumping capacity to 40 000 m3 per day. The implementation of this water infrastructure
upgrade is currently on schedule and the first incremental benefits will be realised during the 1H F2017.

During F2017, the mine will operate at the revised target of 80 000 tonnes per month, with the focus being on improving
mining and cost efficiencies. This will be achieved through increased productivity and lower ore dilution through the
implementation of revised development and stoping techniques.

Enhancements to stope methodology, mine design and extraction optimisation, which commenced in F2015, have been
successfully implemented with a subsequent increase in copper head grade and cost reductions. Further improvements
are anticipated as the new mining methods are refined.

Future mine production is dependent on the ability to maintain a sustainable vertical deepening of the ramps, preventing
net depletion of mining reserves. The ability to deepen the ramps at the required rate is currently impacted by the greater
than anticipated influx of ground water into the ramps.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)
Harmony reported a net profit of R949 million for F2016 compared to a net loss of R4.5 billion in F2015. Headline earnings
amounted to 221 cents per share compared to a headline loss of 189 cents per share for F2015.

In the financial year under review Harmony's realised average Rand gold price increased by 21% to R544 984/kg
(R449 570/kg in F2015) due to a 27% weakening of the Rand against the US Dollar which offset the 4% decrease in the
average gold price received to US$1 169/oz.

Overall unit cost increases were lower than inflation, with all-in sustaining cost (AISC) for operations increasing by only
3% to R467 526/kg compared to R453 044/kg in F2015. In US Dollar terms the AISC decreased by 19% to US$1 003/oz
compared to US$1 231/oz in F2015.

Having turned around the previous year's headline loss to headline earnings, Harmony reduced its net debt by 54% to
R1.08 billion and declared a dividend of 50 cents per share after ARM's year-end. The gold and currency hedge put in
place by Harmony secures the margins at some of the company's higher-cost operations, creates certainty for a portion of
its future cash flows and enables Harmony to further reduce its debt and strengthen its financial position. Harmony remains
well positioned to continue benefiting from the improved Rand gold price.

Harmony's results for the year ended 30 June 2016 can be viewed on Harmony's website at www.harmony.co.za.

ARM owns 14.6% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Outlook
The past year has seen a good response by ARM's operations to the current low commodity price environment, specifically
in the areas of cost containment and prudent planning of capital expenditure.

Mining companies globally have responded to the prevailing market supply/demand dynamics by reviewing and in many
instances reducing supply of commodities. This response has not been as evident from mines operating in countries where
a weak currency has to some extent protected revenue and US Dollar unit costs. These supply-side responses appear to
have resulted in the apparent bottoming in US Dollar commodity prices.

It is evident that some of the biggest impacts on commodity prices result from global macro-economic events such as
""Brexit"" and policy decisions especially in the US, China and in the Eurozone. ARM and other mining companies respond
by means of a greater focus being applied to ensure that the controllable areas in mining such as costs, volumes, capital
expenditure and working capital are well managed.

ARM is focused on (i) positioning its operations to remain or to move below the 50th percentile of the global unit cost curve,
(ii) addressing mining production to ensure that technical and processing efficiencies are optimised, (iii) placing under
review those operations which do not have the ability to operate profitably in the next three years and (iv) considering future
growth opportunities both by way of mergers and acquisitions as well as by organic growth.

ARM remains confident about the long-term future of the mining industry.

3   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IMPAIRMENT
3.1 At 31 December 2015 an impairment of Lubambe Copper Mine assets (included in the ARM Copper Segment) was recognised
    largely as a result of (i) a decline in the forecast of the short to medium term copper price (ii) a revision to the mine plan and
    (iii) an increase in the discount rate used in the valuation of the mine. ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to
    R1 404 million (F2015: R784 million). For the impairment calculation a pre-tax discount rate of 24.43% (F2015 : 18.9% ) and
    the following real copper prices were used.

11   RESTRUCTURING OF THE ARM BBEE TRUST
     Following the restructuring of the ARM BBEE Trust, the ARM BBEE Trust is
     consolidated into the ARM consolidated financial results, as ARM now controls the Trust
     for reporting purposes. The consolidation of the ARM BBEE Trust results in ARM shares
     bought back by Opilac, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARM, and the remaining shares
     owned by the Trust, reducing the number of shares used in the calculation of headline,
     basic and diluted earnings per share. The number of shares in issue are however
     not affected. The treasury shares are excluded, effectively from 22 April 2016, in the
     weighted average and diluted average number of shares.

     The carrying value of the treasury shares are as follows:
     12 717 328 shares bought from the ARM BBEE Trust by Opilac Proprietary Limited                     651         –

14   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
     On 13 May 2016, the Johannesburg High Court ordered the certification of a silicosis class and tuberculosis (TB) class, which
     are to proceed as a single class against mining companies acted in the application. The companies requested leave to appeal
     to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which was granted on 24 June 2016. ARM submitted its notice of appeal in respect of the
     transmissibility of the general damages order in July 2016.

     Due to the limited information available on the above claim and potential other claims, and the uncertainty of the matter, no costs
     estimation can as yet be made for the possible obligation.

     The guarantees in favour of the ARM BBEE Trust have been cancelled after the restructuring of the Trust that was concluded
     and announced on 22 April 2016.
     
     There have been no other significant changes in the contingent liabilities of the Group as disclosed in the 30 June 2015
     integrated annual report.

15   EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE
     The Dwarsrivier transaction was concluded after year-end – refer announcement on 29 July 2016.
     No other significant events have occurred subsequent to the reporting date that could materially affect the reported results.

Trading statement in respect of the year ended 30 June 2016

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.



ARM’s headline earnings for the financial year ended 30 June 2016
(F2016) were negatively affected by a decline in the average US
Dollar commodity prices realised for all the commodities which
ARM produces, partly offset by the positive impact of a weaker
average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. Cost control initiatives
resulted in unit production costs at most operations being well
contained and in some instances being reduced in comparison to
the previous corresponding period (F2015).



The restructuring of the ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment
Trust (the Trust) was completed on 22 April 2016. As part of this
restructuring, the Trust (which previously owned 28.6 million ARM
shares) sold 12.7 million ARM shares to a wholly-owned subsidiary
of ARM. Following completion of this transaction, the number of
shares used in any calculation of “per share” information will
exclude both the ARM shares held by the wholly-owned subsidiary
and those owned by the Trust. As this change was effective from
22 April 2016 it only proportionately impacts F2016 weighted
average number of shares in issue. The weighted average number of
shares in issue at 30 June 2016 used in the calculation of per
share information included in this trading statement is therefore
212 990 000 shares (F2015: 217 232 000 shares).



Accordingly, ARM announces that headline earnings per share for
F2016 are expected to decrease by between 36% and 41% compared to
F2015 to between 475 cents and 510 cents (F2015: 803 cents).
ARM’s F2016 basic earnings were largely impacted by an
attributable impairment of the Lubambe Copper Mine assets of
R1 404 million after non-controlling interest as reported in the
results for the six months ended 31 December 2015. Basic earnings
per share are therefore expected to decline to a basic loss per
share of between 255 cents and 275 cents (F2015: 48 cents
profit).



The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external
auditors of ARM.



The Company’s F2016 provisional     financial   results   will   be
released on 8 September 2016.

Salient features

-  Headline earnings decreased by 51% to R507 million (1H F2015: R1 026 million). Headline earnings
   per share were 233 cents compared to 473 cents in the corresponding period.
-  Basic earnings were a loss of R996 million (1H F2015: R801 million basic earnings) and were
   impacted mainly by a R1 404 million attributable impairment of the Lubambe Copper Mine assets.
-  Good cost reduction initiatives implemented at all operations resulted in on-mine unit costs at most
   operations increasing below the inflation rate.
-  Capital expenditure reduced by 27% to R589 million (1H F2015: R810 million) while attributable
   capital expenditure at ARM Ferrous was R779 million (1H F2015: R802 million).
-  ARM's financial position remains robust despite the commodity market downturn.
-  The Lubambe Copper Mine plan is under review to reduce cash funding requirements and preserve
   its resource value.
-  The Modikwa Platinum Mine recovery plan implemented at the end of F2015 is yielding
   positive results.

   Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur by 31 March 2016.
-  ARM and Impala Platinum have agreed to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers Mine from
   51% to 54% upon the incorporation of the Tamboti rights into Two Rivers Mine.
-  ARM is in the process of seeking shareholder approval to restructure the ARM BBEE Trust to ensure
   a permanent and sustainable funding solution for the Trust.

ARM operational review

The ARM Board of Directors (the Board) announces headline earnings of R507 million for the six months ended
31 December 2015 (1H F2016). Headline earnings are 51% lower than the previous corresponding period largely owing to
significant declines in US Dollar commodity prices for all commodities in ARM's portfolio, partly offset by the average Rand/
US Dollar exchange rate weakening by 24%.

These results have been achieved in conjunction with ARM's partners at the various operations, Anglo American 
Platinum Limited (Anglo Platinum), Assore Limited (Assore), Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats), Norilsk 
Nickel Africa (Pty) Ltd (Norilsk), Glencore Operations South Africa Proprietary Limited (Glencore), Vale S.A. 
(Vale) and Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings (ZCCM-IH).

The interim results for the six months ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the disclosures are in accordance with IAS 34: Interim Financial Reporting.

Rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies on the tabulations.

ARM has responded proactively to the commodity price downturn and has implemented operating and capital cost reduction
initiatives at all its operations. With commodity prices expected to remain low for longer, ARM continued to focus on
improving operational efficiencies, reducing costs, deferring or curtailing capital expenditure and optimising working 
capital to improve profitability and cash generation. Capital expenditure reductions and deferrals have been made 
judiciously to ensure that the long-term value of operations is not negatively impacted.

Average realised US Dollar prices for export iron ore declined by 34% compared to 1H F2015 as concerns about continuing
increases to supply and lower than expected steel demand, especially in China, negatively impacted the seaborne iron ore
market. Manganese ore prices were lower due to similar supply and demand concerns. Average realised US Dollar prices
for high-grade and low-grade manganese ore decreased by 32% and 30% respectively. Nickel prices fell during the last
quarter resulting in the average price being 43% lower than the corresponding period. Platinum and palladium prices were
29% and 26% lower respectively. The 24% weakening of the average Rand versus US Dollar exchange rate partly offset
the decline in US Dollar prices, however, Rand prices for all commodities in ARM's portfolio of commodities were lower
compared to the previous corresponding six months.

Improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs

All operations continue to implement efficiency improvements and cost reduction initiatives which are yielding good results.

Khumani Mine delivered an impressive 19% decrease to on-mine unit production costs in the period under review and
is on track to achieve its targeted 15% reduction to on-mine unit production costs for the financial year. On-mine unit
production costs at the manganese ore operations increased by 4%, well below inflation compared to a 19% increase
in the corresponding period last year. This improved cost performance was as a result of ongoing modernisation of the
manganese ore operations together with a reduction in the labour force. Further costs savings are expected to be achieved
through procurement and labour efficiencies.

Unit production costs at the manganese alloys operations increased above inflation as production volumes were
strategically reduced. Manganese alloy production at Machadodorp Works has ceased while only three of the six furnaces
are operating at Cato Ridge Works.

The platinum mines also delivered good operational performance with unit production costs per tonne at Modikwa Mine
increasing by only 1% while at Two Rivers Mine increases were below inflation at 5%. Nkomati unit production costs
per tonne were 8% higher, however, the mine's C1 unit cash costs net of by-products decreased by 12% relative to the
corresponding period last year.

Deferring and curtailing capital expenditure

Plans to curtail capital costs have resulted in capital expenditure for 1H F2016 being reduced by 15% to R1 368 million
(1H F2015: R1 612 million) on a segmental basis. A large portion of the capital expenditure related to the Black Rock
Project. Details of the project's development are provided under the ARM Ferrous section of this report.


Ongoing review of operational plans

Generally, all ARM operational plans are revisited on an ongoing basis, however, there is currently higher level of scrutiny
of operational plans in response to the prevailing low commodity price environment. The ongoing reviews are also to
ensure that ARM continues to meet its strategic objective to have all operations positioned below the 50th percentile of
each commodity's global cost curve. Global commodity cost curves are undergoing notable changes mainly as a result of
increases in low cost supply, lower oil prices and changes in the currencies of commodity producing economies.

The Modikwa Mine plan was revised in F2015 to include (i) maintaining mining volumes at North 1 Shaft to 110 000 tonnes
per month and (ii) depleting mineable stopes at South 1 Shaft and ramping up South 2 Shaft to 90 000 tonnes per month
thereby integrating South 1 and South 2 shafts with a view to phase out South 1 Shaft. Restructuring of South 1 and
South 2 shafts has already begun in the period under review to enable operational synergies and cost savings. A process
is also already under way to right size the Modikwa workforce.

The Lubambe Mine is under review to reduce the funding requirements from shareholders and to preserve the value of its
substantial ore resources which include the Lubambe Extension Area.

Operating safely

ARM is committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The Company's
Lost Time Injuries (LTI) reduced from 58 in 1H F2015 to 44 in the period under review while the Lost Time Injury Frequency
Rate (LTIFR) for 1H F2016 improved to 0.32 per 200 000 man-hours (1H F2015: 0.40).

Safety achievements in the period under review:
-  Beeshoek Mine and Dwarsrivier Mine each completed three million fatality-free shifts.
-  Beeshoek Mine completed 13.5 years fatality-free.
-  Black Rock Mine completed four million fatality-free shifts.
-  Machadodorp Works completed 27 months without a lost-time injury.
-  Modikwa Mine achieved two million fatality-free shifts on 27 November 2015.
-  Lubambe Mine achieved three million fatality-free shifts in November 2015.

Safety figures and statistics in this report are presented on a 100% basis and exclude the ARM Coal operations.

ARM to increase shareholding in Two Rivers Mine

ARM and Implats have agreed to increase ARM's shareholding in Two Rivers from 51% to 54% on incorporation of the
Tamboti Platinum (Pty) Ltd (Tamboti) rights into the Two Rivers mining area. Based on previous drilling results available the
Tamboti rights, located adjacent to Two Rivers Mine, will add approximately 6.73 million ounces to the Two Rivers resource.

Proposed restructuring of ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment Trust (ARM BBEE Trust or the Trust)

On 15 February 2016 ARM announced the proposed restructuring of the ARM BBEE Trust.

During 2015, ARM provided support to the ARM BBEE Trust in the form of guarantees to support the financial covenants
of the Nedbank Limited (Nedbank) loan. This was required given the fall in the ARM share price following a decline in
commodity prices and the overall negative sentiment towards the mining sector. Guarantees provided by ARM amounted
to R700 million which were disclosed in ARM's annual financial statements and integrated annual report for the year ended
30 June 2015 under contingent liabilities. Post 30 June 2015, the financial covenants of the Nedbank loan came under
pressure once again and required that these guarantees be increased to R850 million. Harmony provides R150 million in
guarantees to Nedbank in a similar manner.

The ARM BBEE Trust forms an integral part of the empowerment obligations of ARM. The current court process to determine
the legal status of the ""once empowered, always empowered"" principle also made it necessary that ARM minimises its legal
and financial exposure should this principle not be upheld by the court. The ARM Board, however, took a decision not to
provide any further guarantees to the Trust, but rather to restructure the shareholding and related funding of the Trust to
provide a permanent and sustainable solution.

To facilitate the unwinding of the current funding structure, ARM has entered into a repurchase agreement with the ARM
BBEE Trust in terms of which, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARM (Subco) will acquire approximately 12.7 million ARM
shares held by the Trust (or 5.8% of current issued ARM shares) at a price of R51.19 per share, being the 30-day volume
weighted average price of the ARM share on 10 February 2016, the last day before the agreement was reached on the
transaction structure (Specific Repurchase).

Furthermore, to implement a more permanent funding structure, the ARM BBEE Trust bank debt will be refinanced as
part of one combined transaction through a combination of the proceeds from the Specific Repurchase, a non-recourse
R300 million senior secured loan from Nedbank, a Harmony subordinated unsecured loan of R200 million and an ARM
subordinated unsecured loan of approximately R800 million.

The Board believes that the Specific Repurchase and the ARM BBEE Trust Loan Refinancing is the best possible solution
in the current environment for the following reasons:
-  Achieves a permanent and sustainable funding solution for the Trust;
-  Retains ARM's black economic empowerment shareholding above 50%; and
-  Limits stress to the ARM financial position and removes the existing guarantees.

Changes to mineral resources and reserves

There has been no material change to ARM's mineral resources and reserves as disclosed in the Integrated Annual Report
for the financial year ended 30 June 2015, other than depletion due to continued mining activities at the operations.

Financial commentary

Headline earnings for the six-month period to 31 December 2015 were R507 million or 51% lower than the corresponding
prior period's headline earnings (1H F2015: R1 026 million). This equates to headline earnings per share of 233 cents per
share (1H F2015: 473 cents per share).

At a basic earnings level a loss of R996 million was incurred for 1H F2016 (1H F2015: R801 million basic earnings).
Basic earnings were negatively impacted by special items of R1 503 million after tax and non-controlling interests
(1H F2015: R225 million loss after tax). The special items largely relate to an attributable impairment of the Lubambe
Copper Mine assets of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest and an impairment of the underground assets at
Nkomati Mine of R83 million after tax. The reconciliation of basic earnings to headline earnings is provided in note 9 to the
financial statements. Basic earnings per share reduced from 369 cents per share to a basic loss of 458 cents per share.

Sales for the reporting period were 10% lower than the corresponding period last year at R4 332 million (1H F2015:
R4 829 million). Sales for ARM Ferrous decreased by 12% to R4 546 million (1H F2015: R5 167 million).

The average gross profit margin decreased to 5% (1H F2015: 17%). The gross profit margins achieved at each operation
may be ascertained from the detailed segment reports provided in note 2 to the financial statements as well as in the write-
ups for each operation.

The 1H F2016 average Rand/US Dollar of R13.61/US$ is 24% weaker than the corresponding period average of R10.99/US$. 
This significant weakening of the exchange rate partly offset the fall in US Dollar commodity prices at all operations 
except for Lubambe which has a US Dollar functional currency. For reporting purposes the closing exchange rate was 
R15.46/US$ (1H F2015: R11.57/US$).

ARM's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding special items and income from
associates and joint ventures, were R891 million (1H F2015: R1 130 million).

The income from joint venture (ARM Ferrous) was R567 million after special items and is 32% lower than the corresponding
period last year (1H F2015: R830 million). The expanded segmental analysis for ARM Ferrous is included in note 2 to the
financial statements.

The detailed segmental contribution analysis is provided in note 2 to the financial statements.

Key features from the segmental contribution analyses are:
-    The ARM Ferrous contribution to ARM's headline earnings declined to R599 million (1H F2015: R833 million) largely
     due to a 59% decrease in the manganese (manganese ore and alloys) division contribution from R236 million to
     R97 million. All ARM Ferrous divisions contributed positively to headline earnings. The iron ore division contribution
     was R478 million (1H F2015: R591 million) despite the 33% fall in the average US Dollar prices for iron ore due to
     excellent cost reduction initiatives and the weaker Rand/US$ exchange rate. Sales volumes for iron ore were 6%
     higher at 7.9 million tonnes.
-    The ARM Platinum segment contribution, which includes the results of Nkomati, was a headline loss of R9 million
     (1H F2015: R277 million headline earnings). The decreased contribution is mainly due to a headline loss at Nkomati
     of R117 million (1H F2015: R101 million contribution) as a result of a significant fall in US Dollar nickel prices during
     the last quarter of the reporting period. The Two Rivers contribution remained positive at R155 million (1H F2015:
     R176 million). Unit cash costs increases were contained and capital expenditure was reduced at ARM Platinum.
-    The ARM Coal segment result reflected a headline loss of R129 million (1H F2015: R10 million headline loss) while cash
     operating profit was R321 million. Goedgevonden Mine made a headline loss of R24 million (1H F2015: R58 million
     headline earnings) while the PCB operations headline loss increased to R105 million (1H F2015: R68 million headline loss).
-    ARM Copper, which largely comprises the Vale/ARM joint venture interest in the Lubambe Mine, amounted to
     a headline loss of R275 million for the period (1H F2015: R233 million headline loss) which includes interest on
     shareholder loans of R104 million (1H F2015: R73 million). The increased loss is largely due to the 20% fall in
     US Dollar copper prices and the weaker average Rand versus US Dollar exchange rate at which the results are
     translated for consolidation purposes.
-    The costs for the ARM Exploration segment reduced to R10 million (1H F2015: R40 million) as no further costs were
     incurred on the Rovuma project.
-    The ARM Corporate, other companies and consolidation segment shows a positive contribution to headline earnings
     of R331 million (1H F2015: R199 million). The higher contribution is largely due to foreign exchange gains on loans
     made by ARM to Lubambe, resulting from the weakening of the Rand versus the US Dollar exchange rate from
     R12.16/US$ at 30 June 2015 to R15.46/US$ at 31 December 2015. The ARM Company loans to Lubambe amounted
     to US$148 million at 31 December 2015 (30 June 2015: US$133 million).

At 31 December 2015 cash and cash equivalents were R1 444 million (1H F2015: R1 976 million) the details of which
are reflected in note 5 to the financial statements. This excludes the attributable cash and cash equivalents held at
ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R2 036 million (1H F2015: R2 473 million).

Gross debt at the end of the period was slightly higher at R4 124 million (1H F2015: R3 920 million) of which R2 298 million
(1H F2015: R2 027 million) comprises partner loans. There is no debt at ARM Ferrous (1H F2015: nil).

The net debt position at 31 December 2015 amounts to R2 680 million (1H F2015: R1 944 million). The increase was
largely due to:
i.   increased borrowings at the Vale/ARM joint operation;
ii.  lower cash at Nkomati Mine; and
iii. increased borrowings at ARM corporate.

Cash generated from operations reduced to R473 million (1H F2015: R1 485 million) largely due to an increase in working
capital requirements of R256 million (1H F2015: R178 million decrease). The working capital utilisation arises mainly

Iron ore sales volumes, on a 100% basis, increased by 6% to 7.9 million tonnes of which 6.5 million tonnes was sold to the
export market and 1.4 million to the local market. Beeshoek Mine concluded a three-year contract to supply 3 million tonnes
of iron ore per annum to Arcelor Mittal South Africa.

Manganese ore production volumes were 3% higher at 1 530 million tonnes while sales volumes were 1 471 million tonnes
compared to 1 422 million tonnes in 1H F2015. Export sales volumes comprised 1 433 million tonnes of the total sales while
38 thousand tonnes of the manganese ore was sold locally.

Manganese alloy sales and production volumes were negatively affected by the strategic decision to close down
uneconomical furnaces at both Machadodorp and Cato Ridge Works. In comparison to the same period last year an
additional two furnaces have been shut down. The only production remaining at the Machadodorp Works is the recovery of
ferrochrome from the slag dump through the Metal Recovery Plant, which has approximately 18 months left. At Cato Ridge
Works, only three of the six furnaces are currently producing high carbon and medium carbon ferromanganese.

ARM and Assore continue to evaluate the future of Machadodorp Works.

Chrome ore produced at Dwarsrivier Mine was 4% higher. Chrome ore sales volumes increased by 14% to 545 000 tonnes.

Successful implementation of various cost reduction initiatives, together with lower stripping ratio and improved production
efficiencies, resulted in Khumani Mine achieving a 19% reduction in on-mine unit production costs. On-mine unit production
costs reduced from R231.90 per tonne to R187.50 per tonne.

The efficiency improvement initiatives implemented also yielded the following results:
-  Optimised the value of the saleable ore by increasing lumpy ore yield and recovery from the mining pits. The lumpy
   yield improved from 50% to 52%.
-  Increased off-grade plant yield from 60% to 63%.
-  Optimised the life-of-mine pit designs, thus reducing the stripping ratio from 2.6 to 1.9 over the life of the mine.

Khumani Mine remains on track to achieve its stated target of a 15% reduction in on-mine unit production costs for the
2016 financial year.

Lower production volumes and increased stripping ratio at Beeshoek Mine resulted in a 22% increase to on-mine unit
production costs. The mining schedule for Beeshoek Village Pit is continuously being reviewed to minimise waste stripping
and right size its labour complement. A concerted effort is being made to significantly reduce its replacement capital.

On-mine unit production costs at the manganese operations increased by 4% in 1H F2016. A number of cost saving
and efficiency initiatives were launched at the mine. Through re-deployment and various other initiatives, the operation's
labour force was reduced by 750 people. The impact of these cost-saving and efficiency parameters is expected to flow
through in the costs of the mine in the second half of the 2016 financial year with cost savings of 10% being targeted for
the second half. Annualised cost savings of R47 million are expected to be realised by the end of the financial year through
procurement efficiencies and a further annualised cost saving of R235 million is expected through an improvement in
labour efficiency.

ARM Ferrous' capital expenditure (on 100% basis) was R1.63 billion (1H F2015: R1.69 billion). This capital expenditure
includes R936 million which was spent on the Black Rock Project.

Beeshoek Mine's capital expenditure for the first six months of F2016 mainly comprised of the Village Pit waste stripping,
new load and haul equipment and the last phase of the relocation of the Village infrastructure. This project will increase
the life-of-mine from 2 to 10 years and will enable Beeshoek Mine to supply the product qualities to Arcelor Mittal South
Africa, as contracted.

Khumani Mine's capital expenditure mainly related to waste stripping, infill drilling, the purchase of mining equipment and
water infrastructure.

The Black Rock Project, currently in progress, represented the majority of the division's capital expenditure. Other capital
items at Black Rock included underground mining equipment, water storage dams and various risk mitigating projects.

Dwarsrivier Mine's capital expenditure mainly comprised of equipping the North Shaft underground development and the
installation of new equipment in the beneficiation plant.

ARM Ferrous management team continues to critically review all capital expenditure programmes and is implementing a
number of value-adding efficiency and cost-saving initiatives in response to the current challenges facing the global mining
industry.

Logistics

An agreement was reached with Transnet regarding the manganese ore export capacity as per the mine plan. All
manganese ore export volumes are now transported by rail, either to Saldanha or Port Elizabeth port. No manganese ore
volumes are transported by road.

ARM Ferrous continues to experience good service levels on its 14 million tonnes per annum iron ore export supply route
from Transnet.

Projects

Beeshoek Village Pit

The Village Pit capital project is progressing according to schedule and within budget. The waste stripping program will see
the first ore being produced from Village Pit in April 2016. The Village Pit projects extend the life-of-mine for Beeshoek from
2 to 10 years at a sustainable production rate of 3 million tonnes per annum.

An ore supply agreement to Arcelor Mittal South Africa has been secured for the next three years to the end of December
2018, which supports the development of the Village Pit.

The mining schedules for Village Pit are currently under review to align the mining programme to the production output of
3 million tonnes per annum planned for Beeshoek Mine, but also to ensure that the Village Pit is exploited effectively and
that waste stripping rates are minimised and product qualities are sustained.

The overall capital required for the project is reviewed on a continuous basis to ensure that the project objectives and
activities are continuously calibrated with the changes and challenges experienced within the iron ore market.

Black Rock Project

The objectives and capital schedule of the Black Rock Project is reviewed continuously to ensure that the project is aligned
with the challenges experienced within the manganese ore market, i.e. the low manganese ore price environment, as well
as the current over-supply of ore, experienced mainly as producers oversupplied carbonate ore into the market.

As a result of the review process the capital requirement for the Black Rock Project has been reduced from R6.7 billion to
R6.0 billion. Most of the underground development work that would have been executed by specialist contractors will now
be executed by Black Rock Mine, thus reducing the cost of this development and deferring the capital expenditure over a
three-year period. The management structures for the project have also been reviewed and streamlined to ensure the cost
efficient execution of the project. A portion of the scope of the project originally planned and scheduled has been deferred,
as part of the continuous review, which resulted in the deferment of approximately R100 million for the next 12 months.

The project is approximately 64% complete and good progress has been made with the construction of additional surface
infrastructure. The underground development and infrastructure, as well as the sinking of a new ventilation shaft is
proceeding according to plan. The preparation work for the shutdown to upgrade Nchwaning 2 shaft is progressing well and
all indications are that the planned shutdown, of four months, will proceed as planned. There will be sufficient stockpiles to
maintain sales volumes during the shutdown.

Primary focus of the project remains:
-    Modernisation of the mine to optimise resource exploitation and to maximise utilisation of production hours, production
     fleet and mining equipment.
-    Cost efficient exploitation of Seam 1 and Seam 2 manganese resources at the Nchwaning mining complex, targeting
     the production of high-grade manganese products.
-    Modernisation of the surface plant infrastructure to ensure the cost efficient processing and separation of the various
     high-grade manganese products from the two Seams.
-    Creating flexibility within the underground operations at the Nchwaning Shafts to ensure that the mine can effectively
     react to changes in market product requirements.
-    Creating the ability to exploit the high-grade ore within Nchwaning 1.
-    Establishment of the load-out capacity and efficiency required to meet the requirements as set by Transnet for the
     Nqura port facility.

Sakura Ferroalloys Project

Construction of the Sakura furnace complex in Eastern Malaysia is progressing well and cold commissioning activities are
underway on the raw material handling and furnace sub-systems. Operational teams are preparing for hot commissioning
activities across the plant. All raw materials have been delivered to site for first production. It is anticipated that both
furnaces will reach full production as planned, in the last quarter of the current calendar year. The project remains within
budget in USD terms.

Sakura is currently utilising the Bintulu port until the Samalaju port is completed.

The ARM Ferrous operations, held through its 50% investment in Assmang, consist of three divisions: iron ore, manganese and
chrome. Assore Limited, ARM's partner in Assmang, owns the remaining 50%.

ARM Platinum

ARM Platinum achieved good operational performance, delivering increased production combined with exceptional cost
control, at all three operations.

The significant downturn in world metal markets during the six months under review had a substantial, negative financial
impact. While Two Rivers Mine generated a profit, losses were recorded by both Modikwa and Nkomati mines. The sharp
decline in US Dollar commodity prices during the reporting period resulted in an attributable headline loss for ARM Platinum
of R9 million (1H F2015: R277 million headline earnings).

US Dollar prices were significantly lower than the corresponding period but a 24% weakening of the Rand against the
US Dollar provided some cushioning, resulting in the average Rand basket prices for Modikwa and Two Rivers decreasing
by approximately 11% to R301 574/kg (1H F2015: R340 452/kg) and by 12% to R303 612/kg (1H F2015: R346 072/kg)

Capital expenditure at ARM Platinum operations (on 100% basis) was R703 million (R442 million attributable).

As previously reported, market conditions necessitated Modikwa's capital projects to be reviewed with the view to reduce
capital expenditure without adversely affecting the mine's future ability to ramp-up production. During F2015, the following
actions were implemented:
-  Deferral of capital expenditure at North Shaft;
-  Restructuring of the South 1 and South 2 shafts to enable operational synergies and cost savings; and
-  Continuation of the capital project at South 2 to improve mining flexibility – stoping commenced in June 2015 and
   project completion is expected in May 2016.

The above steps have reduced capital spending at Modikwa by 53% to R195 million (1H F2015: R418 million) during the
period under review.

Of the capital spent at Two Rivers, 45% is associated with fleet replacement and refurbishment. The deepening of the Main
and North declines, together with its electrical and mechanical installations, comprised 42% of the total capital expenditure.

Nkomati Mine's major capital expenditure items include a new cleaner bank for the MMZ plant (R58 million), and the
installation of an anchored pile wall (R15 million). Due to the sharp decline in base metal prices, capital spending at
Nkomati has been reduced substantially in the latter part of the reporting period while a revised production profile (reduced
waste stripping) was implemented at the same time (refer to Nkomati section below).

Modikwa Mine

Implementation of a recovery plan at Modikwa Mine, which focuses on operational and labour efficiencies, enforcing
discipline and increasing availability of face length, all of which will enhance mining flexibility, commenced at the end
of F2015. The recovery plan has started showing results, with Modikwa delivering an 8% increase in PGM ounces
when compared with the previous reporting period. Modikwa Mine's attributable headline loss for the period is R47 million
(1H F2015: break-even), a direct result of an 11% decline in the average Rand basket price as well as the provision of an
amount of R22 million for restructuring costs.

A 6% increase in milled tonnes, combined with a 1% increase in head grade, resulted in PGM production increasing by 8%
to 149 326 6E ounces (1H F2015: 138 482 6E ounces). Consequently, unit costs decreased by 1% to R7 970 per 6E PGM
ounce (1H F2015: R8 029 per 6E PGM ounce).

To mitigate the effect of the unfavourable market conditions and ensure the long-term viability of Modikwa, the mine has
initiated Voluntary Separation as well as a Section 189 process, which will result in a reduction in labour.

Two Rivers Mine

Headline earnings attributable to ARM decreased by 12%, of which 6% can be ascribed to the reduction in ARM's
shareholding in Two Rivers (which fell from 55% to 51% on 6 February 2015) and 6% is a direct result of lower commodity
prices. Tonnes milled was 1% higher while the head grade increased by 3%, resulting in PGMs increasing by 6% to
198 063 6E ounces.

Cost control measures resulted in unit costs remaining flat at R5 368 per 6E ounce (1H F2015: R5 376 per 6E ounce).
There was an approximate 21 000 tonne increase in the UG2 Run of Mine stockpile to a total of 504 835 tonnes of ore
(1H F2015: 483 411 tonnes). Two Rivers has entered into a toll treatment agreement with Modikwa to process some of
its stockpile material, thereby enhancing its working capital.

Two Rivers Mine increased chrome concentrate sales by 27% to 140 870 tonnes, contributing R80 million (1H F2015:
R61 million) to cash operating profit (on 100% basis).

Nkomati Mine

A 30% decline in the average Rand nickel price resulted in an attributable headline loss of R117 million (1H F2015:
R101 million headline earnings) for the period under review. Chrome concentrate sales increased by 4% to 195 583 tonnes
(1H F2015: 188 079 tonnes), contributing R130 million to cash operating profit (1H F2015: R117 million).

Nkomati Mine's tonnes milled increased by 7% to 4.19 million tonnes. This, combined with a 7% increase in the average
head grade, resulted in nickel units produced increasing by 9% to 11 554 tonnes (1H F2015: 10 587 tonnes), while copper
production increased by 14% and PGM production by 26%.

Nkomati Mine's C1 unit cash costs net of by-products decreased by 12% to US$4.40/lb (1H F2015: US$5.00/lb) as a result
of higher volumes produced, the weakening of the R/US$ exchange rate and increased by-product credits. Unit cost per
tonne milled increased 8% to R313 per tonne (1H F2015: R291 per tonne).

The 8% increase in unit cost per tonne milled is mainly due to the new mining contractor ramping up tonnes mined from
11.4 million tonnes in 1H F2015 to 15.3 million tonnes in 1H F2016.

During December 2015, a restructuring and cash preservation plan was implemented by introducing the following measures:
-   Stop all mining in the loss making underground operation;
-   Cut-back on waste stripping for a period of four months, resulting in a maximum of 1.5 million tonnes mined per month.
    The reduction in waste stripping will not affect the milling profile;
-   Initiation of Voluntary Separation and a Section 189 process to reduce the labour force;   
-   Termination of all incentive schemes;
-   Termination of the services of all non-core contractors; and    
-   Cease all non-core operating costs and capital expenditure.

ARM Coal

The continued oversupply of the seaborne thermal coal resulted in US Dollar coal prices declining by 24% compared
to 1H F2015 and, although the Rand weakened by 24% in the period under review in comparison to the average for
1H F2015, the Rand price realised for export coal was 7% lower than in 1H F2015. The cash operating profit for 1H F2016
was R77 million lower than 1H F2015, mainly due to the decline in revenue.

Overall cost of sales was in line with 1H F2015 but cost control at all operations yielded a commendable reduction in
operational costs and a 2% reduction in on-mine unit costs. The headline loss of R129 million for the six months was
R119 million higher than the previous corresponding period, mainly due to the decline in the operating profit, higher interest
and an increase in the amortisation charge.

ARM Coal cash operating profit was R321 million for the reporting period (1H F2015: R398 million).

Goedgevonden Mine

The saleable production is 24% lower than the first six months of the previous financial year due to mining entering a
localised, geological, mineralisation discontinuity and thinning of coal seams (Pre-Karoo area) which was necessary to
mine through in order to maintain the strip mining continuation. The Pre-Karoo area impacted both the coal quantity per
area as well as the quality thus impacting the yield. Mining through this area is completed and it is the only Pre-Karoo
occurrence that has been identified on the reserves. A 10-day wage negotiation related strike that affected major coal
producers also contributed to the decline in production.

The attributable cash operating profit of R126 million was R90 million lower than 1H F2015 resulting mainly from a decline
of 33% in export sales volumes and 26% reduction in US Dollar prices. These lower prices and sales volumes resulted
in a decrease of R276 million in revenue which was, to some extent, offset by the weaker Rand, and higher Eskom sales
volumes and prices.

Cost of sales was R43 million lower than 1H F2015, mainly due to savings in on-mine costs and distribution costs. Although
on-mine costs were R30 million lower than the previous reporting period, on-mine costs per saleable tonne was 14% higher
as a result of the decrease in production volumes. The lower operating profit and increase in finance costs resulted in
Goedgevonden Mine reflecting a headline loss of R24 million for 1H F2016 compared to headline earnings of R58 million
for 1H F2015.

Participating Coal Business (PCB)

The mines comprising the PCB business reflected a 6% increase in saleable production for the half year aided by the
commissioning of the Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP).

The attributable cash operating profit increased from R182 million to R195 million as a result of a 9% increase in revenue
offset by a 6% increase in cost of sales. Export revenue was R341 million higher due to higher sales volumes and the
weaker Rand. A 23% decline in export prices, however, impacted negatively on profit by R254 million.

Even with an increase in production volumes total on-mine costs, in absolute terms, decreased by R37 million. On-mine
unit costs per saleable tonne decreased by 14% from R341 to R293 per tonne.

Total distribution costs were higher than 1H F2015 due to an increase of 17% in export volumes and the amortisation
charge increased by 26% resulting mainly from the commissioning of the TOP Project. PCB recorded a headline loss of
R105 million for 1H F2016 which is R37 million higher than the headline loss in 1H F2015 due to an increase in finance
costs and amortisation.

The TOP Project is fully commissioned and the conversion from predominantly underground mining to opencast mining is
completed. The conversion has resulted in a reduction in a on-mine production costs per tonne to R293.20 per tonne, 14%
lower than the previous corresponding period.

Projects

Tweefontein Optimisation Project (TOP)

The project has been commissioned and the production ramp up is in line with the plan. Operations are expected to reach
the steady state production rate by the end of this financial year.

Construction progress is at 97% with only minor, non-production areas which include the diversion of the provisional road
still having to be completed. The project still has cost savings of R600 million.

ARM's economic interest in PCB is 20.2%. PCB consists of two large mining complexes situated in Mpumalanga. ARM has a 26%
effective interest in the Goedgevonden Mine situated near Ogies in Mpumalanga.

Attributable refers to 20.2% of PCB whilst total refers to 100%.

ARM Copper

ARM Copper's attributable operating loss increased by 13% to R 234 million mainly as a result of the continued decline in
the copper price coupled with lower copper production volumes. Production volumes at the mine were negatively impacted
by power shortages in Zambia and wage related industrial action.

The average copper price dropped by 25% from US$6 807 per tonne in 1H F2015 to US$5 081 per tonne in 1H F2016.
Post the reporting period, the price deteriorated further to a low of US$4 400/tonne in January 2016. The decline in the
copper price contributed a revenue reduction of US$20.2 million compared to the previous comparable period. Seven
production days were lost during July 2015 following a wage-related strike while electrical power supply disruption resulted
in 10 days of production being lost during the reporting period.

The improvement in head grade and plant recoveries, which commenced in the last quarter of F2015, have continued.
The improvement in head grade is mostly due to a reduction in stoping and development dilution brought about by technical
mining changes implemented during the last year.

Despite lower volumes, the mine managed to reduce C1 unit production costs by 23% to US$2.39/lb (1H F2015: US$3.10/lb)
following the closure of the vertical shaft and mining being focussed only on the East Limb area together with the
implementation of efficiency improvement measures.

ARM Copper headline loss increased to R275 million from R233 in 1H F2015.

The outlook for the copper price in the short to medium term has also declined substantially in the last six months.
The indications are that low prices are expected to persist for longer than was initially projected. As a result of the reduction
in copper prices, a reduction in planned copper production volumes and the application of higher discount rates in the
valuation of the Lubambe Mine the evaluation of the carrying value of assets at Lubambe Mine resulted in an attributable
impairment provision of R1 404 million after non-controlling interest.

Lubambe Copper Mine

The decision taken in the last quarter of F2015 to stop mining of the South Limb and to only mine the East Limb has had a
positive impact on the mine in view of the increased head grade and recoveries despite the reduction on the tonnes milled.
The tonnes milled was reduced by 17% to 715 007 tonnes but the contained copper produced was only reduced by 4%.
This is due to a 9% increase in copper head grade and a 1% improvement in copper concentrator recoveries.

The adaptation to the mining method implemented during 2H F2015 is delivering favourable results with improvements
in mining dilution contributing to the 9% increase in copper head grade. The revised mining method enables better
development placement within the orebody and also facilitates parallel drilling which enables improved extraction, reduced
dilution and lower drilling and explosives costs.

Improvements in production costs have been progressing month by month and give a positive indication that long-
term sustainable unit production costs could be achieved. Overall, cash costs per tonne milled has reduced by 14% from
US$100/tonne milled in 1H F2015 to US$86/tonne milled in 1H F2016. This improvement, combined with the increase in
head grade, culminated in the 23% reduction in C1 unit cost from US$3.10/lb to US$2.39/lb.

Notwithstanding the progress made in the reduction of costs, the effect of the sustained lower copper prices has
necessitated further production curtailment. The mine is under review to minimise cash requirements and preserve the
value of its resources.

Lubambe Extension Project

The hydrogeological hole drilled has been put on hold until an opportune time when the copper price has recovered.

ARM owns 100% of ARM Copper. ARM Copper owns 50% of the Vale/ARM joint venture. The effective interest of ARM in
the Lubambe Copper Mine is 40% as ZCCM-IH has a 20% shareholding.

ARM Strategic Services and Exploration

The Strategic Services and Exploration division undertakes information technology, technical support, strategic support,
project development, exploration and new business opportunity evaluations.

Costs for the ARM Strategic Services & Exploration division were reduced by 75% to R10 million (1H F2015: R40 million).

Projects

The Projects Development team works closely with the operating divisions to manage major capital projects. Projects
currently under development include the Black Rock Mine efficiency and modernisation project. The project is on schedule
and there are no major concerns.

The other major project underway is the Sakura Ferroalloys Project. The project is post-peak construction and cold
commissioning has started.

Exploration and New Business

ARM has established a focused team to identify new mineral business opportunities for sustainable and value enhancing
development. The team also continues to assess a number of acquisition opportunities in this regard.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (Harmony)

Harmony's headline loss for the six months ended 31 December 2015 reduced by 41% to R449 million (1H F2015: R763 million).
In the second quarter of the 2016 financial year Harmony reported a headline profit of R74 million.

Harmony's revenue increased by 10% quarter on quarter as a result of the 3% increase in gold volumes sold to 8 999kg and
a 7% increase in the average gold price received at R507 490/kg in the December 2015 quarter.

The company's production costs decreased by 5% to R3.28 billion in the December 2015 quarter. The decrease is mainly
a result of the decrease in electricity costs of R189 million due to the higher, winter electricity price tariffs included in the
September 2015 quarter.

In the December 2015 quarter, Harmony repaid R1.12 billion of its debt. Repayments consisted of US$50 million on Harmony's
US$250 million Revolving Credit Facility and R400 million on the company's R1.3 billion facility.

On 15 February 2016, Harmony announced the results of the Golpu Stage 1 Feasibility and Stage 2 Prefeasibility studies and
declared updated Resources and Reserves for the Golpu project. Harmony, who owns 50% of the asset, described the Golpu
porphyry as a world-class resource due to its size, high grades, long-life and low operating costs. The design of the mine is
expected to allow optionality and flexibility to scale the operation up with a relatively low capital investment in response to
increasing commodity prices.

The Stage 1 project capital, on a 100% basis, is estimated at US$2.6bn, yielding an internal rate of return of 16%. Harmony
is continuing to engage with key stakeholders, including the PNG national government, the Morobe provincial government,
landowners and community representatives in order to ensure clear alignment on the project objectives with affected
stakeholders.

The ARM Statement of Financial Position, as at 31 December 2015, reflects a mark-to-market investment in Harmony of
R993 million (1H F2015: R1 375 million) at a share price of R15.60 per share (1H F2015: R21.61 per share). Changes in the
value of the investment in Harmony, to the extent that they represent a significant or prolonged decline below the cost of the
investment, are adjusted through the Income Statement, net of tax. Gains above the cost are accounted for, net of deferred
capital gains tax, through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Dividends are recognised in the ARM Income Statement
on the last day of registration following dividend declaration.

Harmony's results for the six months ended 31 December 2015 can be viewed on Harmony's website at www.harmony.co.za.

ARM owns 14.6% of Harmony's issued share capital.

Outlook

The significant fall in US Dollar commodity prices continued during the reporting period as producers took longer than
anticipated to remove high-cost production across most commodities. Since the end of the reporting period there have,
however, been increasing indications of further cuts to mining production and closures of operations globally.

For the short to medium term, notwithstanding that commodity prices appear to be stabilising at current levels, ARM is
guiding its operations to continue with cost cutting initiatives, technical innovation and capital expenditure reviews to ensure
that operational profits and cash flows are optimised and that where shareholder funding is required, this is minimised.

ARM is critically reviewing non-performing operations and assessing whether these have potential to achieve improved
results in the future, especially those operations which are positioned above the 50th percentile of the global cost curve.

With relatively low gearing and an attractive long-life asset portfolio, ARM is well positioned to continue assessing
opportunities to grow.

ARM invests into mines for the long term and has long-life mines. ARM is positive about a future recovery in commodity
prices and therefore believes that all steps taken now to improve productivity, unit costs and profitability will position the
company well into the future.

3.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
      At 31 December 2015 an impairment of Lubambe Copper Mine assets was recognised largely as a result of (i) a decline in the
      forecast of the short to medium term copper price (ii) a revision to the mine plan and (iii) an increase in the discount rate used in
      the valuation of the mine. ARM's attributable share of the impairment amounted to R1 404 million. For the impairment calculation
      a pre-tax discounted rate of 24.43% and the following real term copper prices were used.

Updated trading statement in respect of the six months ended
31 December 2015


Shareholders are referred to the trading statement released
on the Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on 11
December 2015 whereby shareholders were advised that
headline earnings and basic earnings to be reported on for
the six months ended 31 December 2015 (1H F2016) would be at
least 20% lower than those of the previous corresponding
period.

The Company and its directors are satisfied that a
reasonable   degree   of   certainty   exists   to   provide
shareholders with an update of the likely range by which the
Company’s headline earnings per share and basic earnings per
share are expected to decrease.

ARM’s 1H F2016 headline earnings were negatively affected by
a decline in US Dollar commodity prices for all the
commodities which ARM produces. The lower US Dollar prices
were partly offset by a weaker average Rand/US Dollar
exchange rate. Most of ARM’s operations delivered good unit
cost control.

Accordingly, ARM announces that headline earnings per share
for 1H F2016 are expected to decrease by between 50% and 53%
to between 222 cents and 238 cents (1H F2015: 473 cents).

ARM’s 1H F2016 basic earnings were largely impacted by the
following special item:
    -   An impairment of assets at the Lubambe Copper Mine
        mainly as a result of a revision to (i) the short to
        medium term copper price outlook, (ii) the mining
        plan and (iii) the discount rate used in the
        valuation.

Basic earnings per share are therefore expected to decline
by between 219% and 242% to a basic loss per share of
between 440 cents and 525 cents (1H F2015: 369 cents
profit).

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the
external auditors of ARM.
The Company’s 1H F2016 results will be released on 11 March
2016.

Proposed restructuring of the ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment Trust,15 Feb 2016,"ARI 201602150003A
Proposed restructuring of the ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment Trust

PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING OF THE ARM BROAD-BASED ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
TRUST

1. INTRODUCTION

    The ARM Broad-Based Economic Empowerment Trust (""ARM BBEE Trust"" or the ""Trust"")
    acquired 28 614 740 ARM ordinary shares (""ARM Shares"") from Harmony Gold Mining Company
    Limited (""Harmony"") in April 2005. The acquisition was funded by a bank loan by Nedbank to the
    ARM BBEE Trust (“the Nedbank loan”) without recourse to ARM until 2015 (the ""BEE
    Transaction"").

    The ARM BBEE Trust forms an integral part of the empowerment obligations of ARM. The current
    court process to determine the legal status of the “once empowered, always empowered”
    principle also makes it necessary that ARM minimises its legal and financial exposure should this
    principle not be upheld by the court.

    During 2015, ARM provided support to the ARM BBEE Trust in the form of guarantees to support
    the financial covenants of the Nedbank loan. This was required given the fall in the ARM share
    price following a decline in commodity prices and the overall negative sentiment towards the
    mining sector. Guarantees provided by ARM amounted to R700 million which were disclosed in
    ARM’s annual financial statements and integrated annual report for the year ended 30 June 2015
    under contingent liabilities.

    Post 30 June 2015, the financial covenants of the Nedbank loan came under pressure once again
    and required that these guarantees be increased to R850 million. Harmony provides R150 million
    in guarantees to Nedbank in a similar manner. The board of directors of ARM (""Board"") has taken
    a decision not to provide any further guarantees to the ARM BBEE Trust, but rather to restructure
    the shareholding of the Trust in ARM and related funding of the ARM BBEE Trust to provide a
    more sustainable solution.

    To facilitate the unwinding of the current funding structure relating to the BEE Transaction, ARM
    will enter into a repurchase agreement with the ARM BBEE Trust in terms of which, a wholly-
    owned subsidiary of ARM (""Subco"") will acquire 12 717 328 ARM Shares held by the ARM BBEE
    Trust (or 5.8% of current issued ARM Shares) at a price of R51.19 per ARM Share, being the 30-
    day volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") of the ARM Share on 10 February 2016, the last
    day before the agreement was reached on the transaction structure (""Specific Repurchase"").

    Furthermore, to implement a more permanent funding structure, the ARM BBEE Trust bank debt
    will be refinanced as part of one combined transaction through a combination of the proceeds
    from the Specific Repurchase, a non-recourse R300 million senior secured loan from Nedbank
    Limited (""Nedbank""), a Harmony sub-ordinated unsecured loan of R200 million and an ARM sub-
    ordinated unsecured loan of approximately R800 million (""ARM BBEE Trust Loan Refinancing"")
    (collectively, the “Transaction”). The Specific Repurchase from the ARM BBEE Trust will be
    classified as a related party transaction in terms of section 10 of the Listings Requirements of the
    JSE Limited (the ""Listings Requirements"") and so requires approval by ARM shareholders and is
    also subject to the conditions precedent referred to in paragraph 8 below.

2. RATIONALE

  The ARM BBEE Trust forms an integral part of the empowerment credentials of ARM. Whilst the
  share price of ARM has now recovered to approximately R68.00 since a low of R34.81 on 18
  January 2016 the recent market volatility has shown the instability of the current funding structure
  and the potential flow through to ARM, both in terms of financial loss and risk to its BEE status.

  Whilst the bank loan is fully covered by the value of the ARM Shares and neither ARM nor
  Harmony has suffered any loss, the value of the shares held by the ARM BBEE Trust remains
  well below the loan covenant. Given the size of the bank loan, the roll up of the interest less
  dividends received is likely to result in the bank loan balance continuing to increase and thus
  continue to put pressure on the ARM BBEE Trust's financial position going forward.

  As a consequence, the current ARM BBEE Trust funding structure is untenable and the Board
  has decided not to continue to provide any further guarantees to the ARM BBEE Trust but rather
  to restructure the shareholding by the Trust in ARM and related funding of the ARM BBEE Trust
  to provide a more permanent and sustainable solution to the benefit of shareholders.

  The Board believes that the Specific Repurchase and the ARM BBEE Trust Loan Refinancing is
  the best possible solution in the current environment for the following reasons:

      •       achieves a more permanent and sustainable solution;
      •       retains ARM's black economic empowerment shareholding above 50%;
      •       demonstrates value to all ARM shareholders; and
      •       limits stress to the ARM financial position and removes the existing guarantees.


3. TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC REPURCHASE

  Subject to certain conditions precedent and receipt of shareholder approval, Subco intends to
  acquire approximately 12.7 million ARM shares (or 5.8% of the current issued ARM Shares at a
  price of R51.19 per share, being the 30-day VWAP of the ARM Shares on 10 February 2016, the
  day immediately preceding the date on which the price of the Specific Repurchase was agreed.

  Post the Specific Repurchase, Subco, will hold the 12 717 328 ARM Shares as treasury shares.

  The Specific Repurchase will be funded by cash (including the proceeds of the sale of ARM’s
  50% effective interest in the Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine).


4. TERMS OF THE ARM BBEE TRUST LOAN REFINANCING

  The ARM BBEE Trust's outstanding bank debt at 31 December 2015 was R1,883 million. It is
  estimated that the Nedbank loan balance on the estimated closing date in April 2016 will be
  R1,951 million. Any difference to that estimate will result in the refinancing amount changing,
  which differential will be adjusted in the amount of the ARM loan. The proceeds from the Specific
  Repurchase will be utilised by the ARM BBEE Trust to pay down R651 million of the outstanding
  loan. The remaining R1,300 million will be refinanced as follows:

  •   Nedbank: R300 million;
  •   Harmony: R200 million; and
  •   ARM: R800 million (subject to adjustments for accrued interest)

  The Nedbank loan is senior, secured against the remaining shares held by ARM Broad-Based
  Economic Empowerment Trust with no recourse to ARM. The interest rate is market related with
  limited covenants.
   Key terms of the ARM loan to the ARM BBEE Trust are as follows:
   ARM loan

   Amount                                   R800 million (subject to adjustments for accrued interest)

                                            additional three years on terms to be agreed at that time
                                                   1          2

   Notes:
   1. Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate
   2. Basis points

   The Harmony R200 million loan has the same terms as the ARM loan.

   The existing ARM guarantees of R850 million will be removed on implementation of the ARM
   BBEE Trust Loan Refinancing.



5. IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF ARM

  Notes:
  1. The ""Before the Transaction"" column (A) represents the audited EPS, HEPS, NAV, NTAV as reported in respect of
      the year ended 30 June 2015.
  2. The ""After the Transaction"" column (B) includes the consolidated EPS, HEPS, NAV per share and NTAV per share of
      ARM including the ARM BBEE Trust after accounting for the implications of the implementation of the Transaction as
      outlined above.
  3. The ""After the transaction"" column (B) includes the EPS and HEPS as calculated on the assumption that the
      Transaction was effective 1 July 2014. The NAV per share and NTAV per share are calculated on the assumption
      that the Transaction was effective 30 June 2015.
  4. The ARM BBEE Trust will be consolidated into the ARM consolidated financial results, as ARM will control the Trust
      for reporting purposes.
  5. Cash used to purchase the ARM Shares from the ARM BBEE Trust is assumed to have been funded from cash
      resources resulting in reduced interest income impacting HEPS and EPS and is of a continuing nature.
  6. The loan from ARM to the ARM BBEE Trust is assumed to have been funded from current corporate facilities
      resulting in an additional interest expense for HEPS and EPS purposes and is of a continuing nature.
  7. As a result of the ARM BBEE Trust being consolidated, additional borrowings of R300 million and R200 million from
      Nedbank and Harmony respectively, including the interest on these borrowings, will be included in the consolidated
      financial results of ARM and is of a continuing nature.
  8. The ARM Shares bought back and the shares remaining in the ARM BBEE Trust will reduce the number of shares
      used in the calculation of HEPS, EPS, NAV per share and NTAV per share by 28 614 740.
  9. The guarantees from ARM to Nedbank will no longer exist and will no longer be reflected as contingent liabilities.
  10. Interest paid by the ARM BBEE Trust is non-deductible for income tax purposes impacting HEPS and EPS and is of
      a continuing nature.
  11. Once-off costs associated with the Transaction are estimated to be approximately R20 million.


6. RELATED PARTY CONSIDERATIONS

  The ARM BBEE Trust is a material shareholder of ARM, and is therefore considered a related
  party under paragraph 10.1(b)(i) of the JSE Listings Requirements.

  In terms of paragraph 5.69(b) of the Listings Requirements, a special resolution must be passed
  by ARM shareholders in order to implement the Specific Repurchase. The votes of the ARM
  BBEE Trust and its associates will be taken into account in determining whether a quorum of
  ARM shareholders is present at the general meeting, but their votes will not be taken into account
  in determining the results of the voting at the general meeting.

7. IRREVOCABLE UNDERTAKINGS

  ARM has received from certain ARM shareholders irrevocable undertakings, indications of
  support or commitments to recommend to their clients to vote ARM Shares held by them as at the
  date of the general meeting, either as principal or on behalf of clients, in favour of the resolutions
  to be proposed at the general meeting. Details of the current shareholdings of these parties are

Trading statement in respect of the six months ended 31
December 2015

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the
JSE Limited, a listed company is required to publish a trading
statement as soon as it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of
certainty exists that the financial results for the period to be
reported on next will differ by at least 20% from those of the
previous corresponding period.

ARM’s headline earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2015
are currently anticipated to be at least 20% (R205 million) less
than those for the same period in the previous financial year.

Headline earnings per share are anticipated to be at least 20%
(95 cents) less than those for the same period in the previous
financial year.

Headline earnings reported for the six months ended 31 December
2014 were R1 026 million, while headline earnings per share were
473 cents.

The decrease in headline earnings is mainly due to the fall in US
Dollar commodity prices in comparison to those achieved in the
previous period. The lower US Dollar prices are partially offset
by the weaker exchange rate during the period.

ARM’s basic earnings for the six months ended 31 December 2015
are currently anticipated to be at least 20% (R160 million) less
than those for the same period in the previous financial year.
Basic earnings per share are anticipated to be at least 20% (74
cents) less than   those   for   the   same   period   in   the   previous
financial year.



Basic earnings reported for the six months ended 31 December 2014
were R801 million, while basic earnings per share were 369 cents.



ARM’s basic earnings are expected to be negatively impacted by an
unrealized mark-to-market loss on its Harmony Gold Mining Company
Limited (“Harmony”) investment due to the fall in the Harmony
share price below the previously reported level of R15.59 per
share, below which further mark-to-market adjustments through the
income statement would be required.

Shareholders are advised that a further trading statement will be
issued as soon as there is a reasonable degree of certainty as to
the likely range within 20%, by which the Company’s headline
earnings per share and basic earnings per share are expected to
decrease.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has neither been reviewed nor reported on by the external
auditors of ARM.

The Company’s interim results will be released in March 2016.
