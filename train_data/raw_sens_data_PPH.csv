REVIEWED ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


Pepkor achieves substantial market share gains during the COVID-19 pandemic

The Pepkor group achieved an exceptional performance during a challenging year as COVID-19
and the resultant lockdown protocols exacerbated an already weak consumer retail market.
Despite having lost approximately R5.0 billion in revenue through COVID-19 trading restrictions,
the group managed to achieve positive revenue growth for the year which is an outstanding result.

The group’s defensive discount and value positioning has been an advantage during the tough
economic conditions. Consumer focus on less discretionary and more affordable products and
services resulted in substantial market share gains. Pepkor’s strong corporate culture and
execution ability ensured a swift response to the COVID-19 crisis with stores and the supply chain
reacting very quickly to the challenging environment. The group’s expansive store footprint
appealed to customers who chose to shop in more convenient locations closer to home.

The group adopted IFRS 16 – Leases during the current year, using a modified retrospective
approach with no restatement of prior period reported results. This had a material impact on the
group’s statutory results for the current period. To form a meaningful assessment of group
performance, shareholders and noteholders are referred to Pepkor’s full results announcement,
available on the Pepkor website at www.pepkor.co.za.


Group highlights for the year

-    Revenue from continuing operations increased by 3.6% to R63.7 billion
-    Market share growth of 240 basis points in clothing, footwear and homeware products
     as reported by the Retailers’ Liaison Committee
-    Cash generated of R9.2 billion (excluding IFRS 16)
-    Net debt reduced by R6.9 billion (excluding IFRS 16)
-    230 new stores opened

Earnings were impacted by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of R4.8 billion (as
announced on 6 November 2020). The impairment is a result of the impact of COVID-19 and
constrained future growth expectations in PEP Africa, Speciality, Tekkie Town and the JD Group,
in addition to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital.

As communicated during the group’s interim results published on 27 May 2020, no dividend is
declared for the year ended 30 September 2020 (20.9 cents in the prior year), based on
heightened levels of prudence applied by the board and the focus on liquidity preservation and
allocation of resources.


Performance and outlook

Pepkor’s sales performance since the relaxation of lockdown measures has been excellent and
has underscored the strength of its business model and market positioning. The group has gained
significant market share in the period since May 2020. The strong sales momentum continued
into the months of October and November 2020 with double-digit like-for-like sales growth
reported in PEP, Ackermans, Speciality and the JD Group. Providing the South African consumer
with affordable products has become even more important in the current environment and the
group is ideally positioned to execute on this.

While the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact in the near to medium
term remains uncertain, there is an expectation that the toughest times for the economy and
customers are still to come as unemployment increases and special grants and other benefits are
reduced. Our view on the future remains cautious and conservative.
Cash generation has been excellent and the balance sheet has been significantly strengthened
which provides security and the ability to capitalise on potential opportunities that may arise in the
market. Significant progress was made in restructuring and consolidating the group’s portfolio of
operations to enhance efficiency and profitability levels.

Pepkor is well positioned to continue gaining market share in a future constrained retail
environment. The group will continue to entrench its discount and value positioning through
providing affordable products to the consumer as it stands to benefit from consumers in search
of value.

The resolve, resilience and loyalty shown by the group’s employees and customers during one of
the most challenging periods in history is most encouraging. The strong and healthy corporate
cultures of the group and its retail brands have helped sustain the business during this trying time
and resulted in a commendable, market-leading performance for the year. The support and
understanding from our loyal, long-standing suppliers and business partners have been
invaluable, and similarly we value the support from our investors.

The group’s operations are prepared for changes in consumer behaviour with accelerated
progress in e-commerce and fintech capability, supplemented by its convenient and accessible
retail store footprint. The group continues to identify opportunities for store expansion driven
mainly by PEP and Ackermans, in addition to the development of new retail formats. In terms of
new markets, exciting opportunities exist in the adult wear market, while the group will also
consider other expansion opportunities.

CHAIRMAN OF PEPKOR

In accordance with paragraph 3.59(c) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, the board
of directors of the Company (“the Board”) wishes to advise shareholders that the current
Chairman of Pepkor, Mr. Jayendra Naidoo, who has been in office since August 2017, has
advised the Board that he will not make himself available for re-election as Chairman when
his term ends on 30 November 2020.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leon Lourens, said “Jayendra has led the Board
since the Company's listing in 2017 and has played a central role in enabling the Company
to navigate a challenging period, commencing with listing in 2017, managing the implications
for Pepkor arising from the Steinhoff crisis, and lately managing the prolonged impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has emerged in a much stronger position and the Board
thanks Jayendra for his service and wise leadership during his tenure as Chairman. We look
forward to his continued contribution as a non-executive director of the Board.”

Mr. Naidoo commented that “Given the positive progress and stability of Pepkor, and other
considerations, amongst others, the current state of litigation involving Pepkor’s major
shareholder and a company related to myself, I believe it is appropriate for the next term of
three years that the Company is led by an independent Chairman.”

A process is underway for the Board to appoint a new Chairman. Shareholders will be kept
advised of developments.

Voluntary Trading Update And Updated Trading Statement For The Year Ended 30 September 2020,6 Nov 2020,"Voluntary Trading Update And Updated Trading Statement For The Year Ended 30 September 2020

VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE AND UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR
ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020



VOLUNTARY TRADING UPDATE

The aim of this voluntary trading update is to provide shareholders and noteholders with an
appreciation of the performance of the group and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
group and its operations. This trading update covers the financial year ended 30 September 2020
(“FY20”) and follows the previous trading update published on 24 July 2020 which covered the
nine months ended 30 June 2020 (“Nine-month Trading Update”).

Trading conditions since the relaxation of national lockdown measures have favoured Pepkor’s
defensive discount and value positioning. This resulted in the exceptional outcome of achieving
revenue growth in FY20 compared to the prior year.

The group’s focus on less discretionary and more affordable products and services has resulted
in substantial market share gains. Pepkor’s retail brands benefited from consumers seeking value
while its expansive store footprint appealed to customers choosing to shop in more convenient
locations closer to their homes.

Group revenue including discontinued operations increased by 1.9% to R70.9 billion compared
to R69.6 billion in the prior financial year ended 30 September 2019 (“FY19”). Revenue from
continuing operations increased by 3.6% to R63.7 billion (FY19: R61.5 billion).

The trade restrictions imposed in terms of the national lockdown prevented retail stores from
trading and revenue of approximately R5.0 billion was lost during the five-week level-5 lockdown
period. Further trading restrictions resulted in the group not being able to trade in its full
merchandise range until June 2020.

Discontinued operations

As per the 4 August 2020 SENS announcement, the group’s portfolio strategy to focus on its core
business resulted in the decision to dispose of The Building Company. Pepkor’s Building materials
reporting segment, in its entirety, will therefore be classified as discontinued operations in the
group’s FY20 financial results. The Building Company contributed c.10% to FY20 group revenue
(including revenue from discontinued operations).

Discontinued operations further include Pep Africa’s operations in Zimbabwe following the
decision in FY19 to exit the country. The exit from Zimbabwe was concluded on
30 September 2020.

Clothing and general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported an increase in revenue of 1.4% for the
year to R45.6 billion. This includes revenue growth of 12.1% during the fourth quarter, recovering
from a 15.9% decline reported during the third quarter.

Pep and Ackermans in aggregate, reported an increase in sales of 2.6% with a decrease in like-
for-like sales of 0.5% for FY20. Retail space expanded by 2.5% year-on-year as new store
openings slowed during the second half of the year. Pep and Ackermans opened 145 new stores
during the year.

Lower credit sales in Ackermans resulted in a reduction in the credit sales contribution to 17%
from 19% in FY19. Notwithstanding good collections, provision levels on the Tenacity credit book
were increased to 22% from 17% in FY19.

In Pep Africa’s continuing operations, constant currency sales declined by 7.0%, while like-for-
like sales decreased by 9.6%. Weakening currencies resulted in a decrease of 16.2% in sales at
actual rates.

The Speciality business reported a decrease in sales of 3.6% with like-for-like sales decreasing
by 4.6% for the year.

Furniture, appliances and electronics

The furniture, appliance and electronics segment reported revenue growth of 1.4% to R9.5 billion
for the year. Merchandise sales for the year decreased by 0.4% with a decrease in like-for-like
sales of 1.6%.

Curtailed credit granting and good post-lockdown collections resulted in a reduction in the gross
Connect credit book from R1.8 billion at 31 March 2020 to R1.6 billion at 30 September 2020.
Total credit sales contribution reduced from 19% in FY19 to 13%, most notably in the furniture
division where the credit sales mix reduced to 20% (FY19: 27%). Credit book provision levels
were increased to 42% compared to 33% in FY19.

* As reported in the Nine-month Trading Update

The FLASH business achieved strong growth during the fourth quarter. Virtual turnover in the
informal trader business increased by 25.7% for the year.

Collections on the Capfin credit book exceeded expectations and conservative credit granting
resulted in the gross Capfin credit book reducing to R1.9 billion at 30 September 2020 from
R2.6 billion at 31 March 2020. The credit book provision level was increased to 26% from 15% in
the prior year.

* As reported in the Nine-month Trading Update


Balance sheet and liquidity

The trading performance resulted in lower inventory levels and very strong cash generation. This,
in addition to the accelerated bookbuild completed in June 2020 which raised R1.9 billion, enabled
the group to reduce net debt from R14.1 billion at 31 March 2020 to c.R7.0 billion at
30 September 2020 (excluding the adoption of IFRS 16).

Substantial progress was therefore made to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the Pepkor
balance sheet.


UPDATED TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements, a listed company is required to publish a
trading statement once it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that its results
will differ by at least 20% compared to FY19.

Pepkor published an initial Trading Statement on SENS on 15 October 2020 advising
shareholders and noteholders that a reasonable degree of certainty existed that Pepkor’s FY20
earning per share (“EPS”) and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) results would decrease by
at least 20% compared to the previous corresponding period. Pepkor is now able to provide an
updated trading statement.

The following aspects will impact Pepkor’s FY20 results and have been communicated as part of
previous results announcements and/or trading updates:

    1. Adoption of IFRS 16: Leases

The group adopted IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) on 1 October 2019 using a modified retrospective
approach with no restatement of the FY19 reported results. The adoption of IFRS 16 will have a
negative impact on Pepkor’s results.

    2. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted performance of the group in many areas, most notably
through lost sales and increased credit book provision levels. The uncertainty surrounding the
longer term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the group’s forecasting ability.
Pepkor has therefore applied a conservative approach in areas such as capital allocation and
expenditure.

The conservative outlook further contributed to the impairment of carrying values of goodwill and
intangible assets. Following the completion of impairment assessments an impairment of
R4.8 billion will be recognised in FY20 and is allocated to the respective operations as indicated
in the table below.

The impairment is a result of constrained future growth expectations in Pep Africa, Speciality,

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2020 AND LIQUIDITY
UPDATE

Trading statement

In terms of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements (the “Requirements”), a listed company
is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it becomes aware that a reasonable degree
of certainty exists that the financial results for the financial period to be reported on next will differ
by at least 20% from the financial results for the previous corresponding period.

As reported in the Group’s interim results published on the JSE Stock Exchange News Service
(“SENS”) on 27 May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a negative impact on the
Group’s performance and results for the year ending 30 September 2020. The unprecedented
circumstances and volatile trading environment continue to impact the Group’s forecasting ability.

Pepkor hereby advises shareholders and noteholders that a reasonable degree of certainty exists
that its earnings per share (“EPS”) and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the year ending
30 September 2020 will decrease by at least 20%.

    -   EPS is expected to decrease by at least 12.5 cents per share (20%) when compared to
        the EPS of 62.6 cents reported for the year ended 30 September 2019 (the “Previous
        Period”); and

    -   HEPS is expected to decrease by at least 19.4 cents per share (20%) when compared to
        the HEPS of 96.8 cents reported for the Previous Period.

The decrease in EPS and HEPS can be attributed to the following factors:

    1. The Group implemented IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16) on 1 October 2019 using a modified
       retrospective approach with no restatement of prior period reported results; and
                                                                                                        
    2. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the performance in many areas of
       the Group, most notably through lost sales and increased provision levels on credit books.
       This has contributed to the likely impairment of carrying values of goodwill and intangible
       assets.

Further guidance as to the range by which the EPS and HEPS are likely to decrease will be
provided once the required degree of certainty in terms of the Requirements has been
established.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based, has not been reviewed or
reported on by the Company's external auditors.


Liquidity update

As stated in the Trading Update published on SENS on 24 July 2020, the Group’s liquidity
benefited from strong trading since the relaxation of lockdown measures, pro-active expense
management, conservative credit granting, better-than-expected credit book collections and the
successful completion of an accelerated bookbuild which raised R1.9 billion.

This allowed early settlement of the R1.5 billion bridge term loan facility which was due for
repayment in August 2020 and early settlement of R4.0 billion of the total R6.0 billion preference
share funding due to mature in May 2022. The Group has made significant progress in its ambition
to degear the balance sheet and there is therefore no risk of debt covenants being breached at
30 September 2020.

The process to refinance R5.0 billion in debt due for repayment in May 2021 was successfully
concluded and implemented on 30 September 2020, and the debt is now repayable in September
2023. In addition, the R1.0 billion bridge revolving credit facility originally due to expire in
November 2021, has been extended to September 2023.

As part of the same process, debt covenants were amended to create sufficient headroom and
enhanced flexibility going forward.

VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE BUILDING COMPANY
PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“TBC”)

1. INTRODUCTION
    Pepkor shareholders are hereby advised that the Company has entered into a sale and purchase
    agreement with Cashbuild Limited (“Cashbuild”), for the disposal of the entire issued share capital of
    Pepkor’s wholly owned subsidiary, TBC, subject to the conditions precedent set out in paragraph 3.2
    below (“the Proposed Transaction”). Shareholders are referred to the earlier announcement made
    today by Cashbuild.

2. RATIONALE
    The Proposed Transaction will enable Pepkor to streamline its portfolio of businesses and focus on its
    core business of discount and value retail.
    Following a prolonged period of corporate activity that included various acquisitions, TBC has done well
    to restructure and consolidate the business. It has made significant progress in defining its value
    proposition, establishing a strong corporate culture, clarifying strategy and prioritising a central
    procurement strategy.
    With an attractive portfolio of established and well-known brands, the Proposed Transaction will ensure
    that, as part of Cashbuild, TBC will be strategically better placed for future growth.
    It is envisaged that Pepkor will use the net disposal proceeds to further reduce debt in line with the
    Group’s ambition to reduce its gearing levels to enhance the flexibility of its capital structure.

3. TERMS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    3.1 Purchase price
        The total consideration payable by Cashbuild on closing of the Proposed Transaction will be
        R1,074,700,000 (the “Purchase Consideration”) subject to:

        - an escalation rate of 5.5% per annum from 1 January 2021 until the Proposed Transaction
          closing date; and
        - the sum of the Purchase Consideration and the total escalation not exceeding
          R1,119,700,000.

    3.2 Conditions precedent
        The implementation of the Proposed Transaction is, subject to the fulfillment of, inter alia, the
        following principal conditions precedent:

        -   Regulatory approvals, including Competition Authorities, being obtained; and
        -   Cashbuild’s debt financing agreements being duly executed and becoming unconditional.

4. CATEGORISATION OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
    The Proposed Transaction is uncategorised in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and this
    announcement has been voluntarily disclosed by the Company.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

The Pepkor group’s revenue for the nine months ended 30 June 2020 (“nine-month period”) decreased by
1.5% to R52.3 billion. This compares to revenue growth of 6.5% achieved for the six months ended
31 March 2020 and therefore highlights the negative impact of COVID-19 and the national lockdown during
the third quarter where group revenue reduced by 17.2%.

It is estimated that the national lockdown period during April 2020 resulted in lost revenue of approximately
R5.0 billion for the group. Very strong trade was achieved during May and June 2020 as lockdown
measures eased and can be attributed to pent-up demand, social grant payments as well as the value
propositions and market positioning of the group’s brands.

Continuing operations

Clothing and general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported a decrease in revenue of 1.7% for the nine-month
period, negatively impacted by a decrease in revenue of 15.9% during the third quarter.

Sales levels for Pep and Ackermans were very positive during May and June 2020 after stores reopened.
Trading proved resilient due to their defensive discount and value market positioning as consumers
prioritise apparel spending in areas such as babies’ and children’s clothing with focus on basic and
replenishment products. The national lockdown regulations impacted the reopening of schools which
resulted in weak back-to-school trading.

For the nine-month period the Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate, reported a decrease in sales of
0.4% with a decrease in like-for-like sales of 3.5%. Retail space expanded by 3.1% year-on-year with 22
new store openings during the third quarter.

The performance of Pep Africa, which contributes less than 3% to group revenue, was impacted by
lockdowns and adverse macroeconomic conditions across most countries of operation. For the nine-month
period constant currency sales declined by 11.5%, while like-for-like sales decreased by 14.0%. Sales at
actual rates decreased by 19.8%.
                                                                                                          
The Speciality business which focuses on discretionary products such as footwear and adult apparel,
performed well during May and June 2020 with positive like-for-like sales growth of 6.3% and 11.2%
respectively. For the nine-month period sales decreased by 7.4% with like-for-like sales reducing by 9.8%.

1) As reported in the trading update published on 23 June 2020 on the JSE Limited Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”), following the reopening of stores, like-for-like sales for the last four trading weeks of May
2020 increased by 40.3% in Pep and Ackermans in aggregate and by 27.5% in Speciality.
Note that Pep Africa is excluded from the table above.

Furniture, appliances and electronics

The JD Group reported a decline in revenue of 6.0% for the nine-month period which includes a decrease
of 21.8% during the third quarter. Sales for the nine-month period decreased by 7.6% with a decrease in
like-for-like sales of 9.5%.

The consumer electronics and appliances division (Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corp) resumed online
trading during May 2020 on a limited product range in line with lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations
were lifted from June 2020 and trading in this division has been very strong, benefiting from the group’s
investment in online retail capabilities and strong consumer demand which was fueled by technology
upgrades, work/school-from-home and online purchase trends.

The furniture division’s retail brands were only allowed to resume trading from June 2020 but have also
shown strong trading momentum since then.

Credit granting criteria were tightened and the respective credit sales contributions in the furniture- and
consumer electronics and appliances divisions reduced to 22% and 6% respectively compared to 28% and
7% contributions reported for the prior nine-month period.

The Building Company reported a decline in sales of 17.2% for the nine-month period. During the third
quarter sales reduced by 41.9% and like-for-like sales decreased by 41.6%. Lockdown regulations severely
constrained trading during April and May 2020 where the business was only permitted to trade on a very
limited product range. The business was permitted to trade on its full product range since June 2020 in line
with the reopening of the construction industry and has since seen a positive trajectory in trading
momentum.

The FLASH business with its penetration into the informal market operated throughout the lockdown period
and reported strong virtual turnover growth of 28.8% for the quarter.

Significantly curtailed credit granting characterised the quarter as the group reduced its exposure to
unsecured lending through the Capfin business. Collections have been above expectation to date while a
consolidation process is underway to reduce Capfin’s operating cost structure and support profitability going
forward.

Liquidity update

Strong trading, pro-active expense management, conservative credit granting and positive credit book
collections have benefited group liquidity and seasonal funding facilities secured as a contingency during
the lockdown period were not utilised. The group settled its R521 million bridge term loan facility earlier
than anticipated.

As announced on 24 June 2020, Pepkor successfully completed an accelerated bookbuild which raised
R1.9 billion. The book was oversubscribed by 5.3 times, indicating strong demand from more than 60 local
and international investors. The group issued 172.5 million new Pepkor shares at R11.00 per share which
reflected a discount of 6.2% to the 30-day volume weighted average price. The proceeds will be used to
reduce debt in line with the group’s ambition to reduce its gearing levels.
                                                                                                           
Processes to amend debt covenants and extend the group’s debt repayment profile are progressing well
as the group continues to improve liquidity and reduce debt levels to enhance the flexibility of its capital
structure.

Outlook

Strong trading momentum continued into July 2020. It is uncertain how long these levels of performance
are possible as the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and employment unfolds. The group is expecting
a constrained retail environment over the next 18 months.

The group will continue to focus on its aggressive growth in market share as consumers are forced to
reduce and reprioritise spending. It will capitalise on its defensive discount and value positioning as its retail
brands continue to execute compelling customer value propositions and focus on providing affordable value
to customers. Pepkor’s expansive retail footprint is also proving to be highly accessible to customers who
are choosing to shop closer to home.

Pepkor continues to make a positive difference in the lives of our customers and the communities in which
we operate by providing convenient access to everyday products and services at affordable prices.

Pro forma constant currency disclosure

The Pepkor group discloses unaudited constant currency information to indicate Pep Africa’s performance
in terms of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. To present this information,

RESULTS OF ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING OF PEPKOR HOLDINGS LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES

RESULTS
Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News
Service of the JSE Limited (the “JSE”) on 23 June 2020, relating to the issue of 172,500,000
new ordinary no par value shares in the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company
(the “Placement Shares”) through an accelerated bookbuild (the “Bookbuild”) under and in
accordance with the Company’s existing general authority to issue shares for cash, granted
by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 11 March 2020 (the ""Placement"").
Pepkor is pleased to announce the successful completion of the Bookbuild. The Placement
Shares were issued at a price of R11.00 per share, a 6.2% discount to the pre-launch 30
business day volume weighted average price of R11.73 per share as at market close on
23 June 2020, in compliance with section 5.52(d) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE.

The Placement raised gross proceeds of R1.9 billion for the Company.
The Placement Shares being issued represent in aggregate 4.95% of the Company's issued
ordinary share capital prior to the Placement. The Placement Shares when issued will be fully
paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing ordinary shares in
issue, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid
after the date of issue of the Placement Shares.

An application will be made to the JSE for the listing of the Placement Shares. Subject to
approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placement Shares are expected to occur on the
JSE on Monday, 29 June 2020, and dealings in the Placement Shares are expected to
commence at the same time.
Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International Plc acted as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the Placement
(the “Bookrunners”).

USE OF PROCEEDS
The proceeds from the Placement will be used specifically to:
   •   reduce Pepkor’s current gearing level to move towards its stated target of 1 times net
       debt-to-EBITDA. As of March 2020, the Company’s gearing ratio is 1.7 times.;
   •   support securing of the business against the current and future uncertainties from both
       a macro and economic perspective; and
   •   provide investors with an opportunity to invest in the future growth and success of
       Pepkor.

The Placement is a precautionary measure to strengthen Pepkor’s financial flexibility and
liquidity position in the light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting macro-
economic pressure. In addition to other cash-saving initiatives already undertaken by the
Group, the Placement will help Pepkor to further enhance the liquidity profile and increase
resilience of its balance sheet, should a more negative macro-economic scenario realise.

LAUNCH OF AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING OF PEPKOR HOLDINGS LIMITED ORDINARY SHARES AND UPDATE ON TRADING AND LIQUIDITY

INTRODUCTION
Pepkor announces its intention to conduct a non pre-emptive placing of up to 172.5 million
ordinary shares in the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company
(the ""Placement Shares"") to certain institutional investors (the ""Placement""), which
represents up to 4.95% of the Company's existing issued ordinary shares. The Placement
Shares will be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its existing general
authority to issue shares for cash, granted by shareholders at the annual general meeting of
the Company held on 11 March 2020.
The Placement is being conducted via an accelerated bookbuild process (the ""Bookbuild""),
which will be launched immediately following this announcement.
Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International Plc are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the Placement
(the “Bookrunners”).

RATIONALE AND USE OF PROCEEDS
While Pepkor's trading following the relaxation of lockdown measures in South Africa on
1 May 2020 has exceeded expectations, the duration and evolution of COVID-19, and the
related impact on the economy and the Group’s trading in the near to medium term remains
uncertain.
Pepkor is continuously assessing various scenarios to ensure that it takes the appropriate
financial and operational actions to reduce costs, conserve cash, access liquidity and improve
flexibility in its capital structure during these unprecedented times.
Key short-term interventions implemented by management to protect the business have
included:
-   reduced operating expenditure;
-   reduced capital expenditure;
-   significantly curtailed credit granting with a focus on collections; and
-   suspension of the dividend payment for the current year.

The proceeds from the Placement will be used specifically to:
-   reduce Pepkor’s current gearing level to move towards its stated target of 1 times net debt-
    to-EBITDA. As of March 2020, the Company’s gearing ratio is 1.7 times;
-   support securing of the business against the current and future uncertainties from both a
    macro and economic perspective; and
-   provide investors with an opportunity to invest in the future growth and success of Pepkor.

The Placement is a precautionary measure to strengthen Pepkor’s financial flexibility and
liquidity position in the light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
macro-economic pressure. In addition to other cash-saving initiatives already undertaken by
the Group, the Placement will help Pepkor to further enhance the liquidity profile and increase
resilience of its balance sheet, should a more negative macro-economic scenario realise.

UPDATE ON TRADING ENVIRONMENT SINCE MAY 2020
The trading performance reported below comprise like-for-like sales growth for the last four
trading weeks of May 2020, following the relaxation of lockdown measures on 1 May 2020,
and the first three trading weeks of June 2020, unless otherwise stated.

The sales momentum reported for the three trading weeks in May during Pepkor’s interim
results presentation on 27 May 2020 continued into the fourth week and the month of June
2020. The Group’s more defensive market positioning which is aligned to basic consumer
needs continues to drive good performance. Satisfactory inventory levels have been achieved
as a result of the strong winter trade.

Strong trading in PEP and Ackermans continued, reporting combined like-for-like sales growth
of 40% in May and achieving the highest ever monthly turnovers for both retail brands. Trading
momentum continued during the first three weeks of June with like-for-like growth of 21%.

Sales in PEP Africa, which contribute c.3% to Group revenue, declined by double digits in
constant currencies during April, May and June, impacted by a weakness in local economies
and currencies due to COVID-19. Lockdowns in the respective countries varied in timing and
duration.

The Speciality business, which focuses on more discretionary adult wear and footwear product
categories, traded well and achieved like-for-like sales growth of 28% in May and 21% in June.

The consumer electronics and appliances division (Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi
Corporation) in the JD Group performed extremely well since re-opening with like-for-like sales
growth of 39% in May despite the fact that only a limited product range could be sold. Trading
momentum continued into June with like-for-like growth of 58%. The furniture division was
unable to trade during May but achieved like-for-like growth of 26% since re-opening in June.

Trading in The Building Company has been negative due to the fact that building contractors
and the construction industry only re-opened on the first of June. Since the re-opening of the
industry, trading has shown a positive trajectory with June showing a cumulative negative
growth of only 1%.

The FLASH business continued to trade during lockdown and reported 28% growth in virtual
turnover for the quarter to date.
Capfin continued to curtail the granting of credit and the size of the book reduced to R2 billion.
Since the commencement of the lockdown period, focus has been mainly on collection of the
book which has exceeded expectations thus far.

UPDATE ON LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW
Liquidity has improved compared to pre-COVID-19 levels due to the positive trading
performance and credit book collections. This enabled the Group to early settle its
R521 million bridge term loan facility.

The credit curtailment and consequent reduction in sizes of the credit books supported cash
flow since the start of April 2020. Collections to date have been better than expected although
the impact of COVID-19 on future collections remains uncertain.

Constructive discussions are continuing to waive and amend debt covenants going forward.
The Group continues to assess opportunities to reduce costs, conserve cash, access liquidity
and improve flexibility in its capital structure during these unprecedented circumstances.

OUTLOOK
The Group continues to assess its portfolio strategy with preference to businesses that provide
the best returns.

Despite the current positive trading levels the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the
South African economy and consumer remains to be seen. Pepkor continues to implement
measures to protect the Group and improve flexibility in its capital structure during these
unprecedented circumstances.

Pepkor is confident that its defensive discount and value positioning will support market share
gains in the current and medium term environment as the market consolidates and consumers
focus on basic and affordable products.

The Group continues to make a positive difference in the lives of our customers and the
communities in which we operate by providing convenient access to everyday products and
services at affordable prices.

released on 27 May 2020, available at https://www.pepkor.co.za/investor-relations/latest-
results/.

THE PLACEMENT
The Placement is offered to qualifying institutional investors only and will not be offered to the
public in any jurisdiction. The Placement is not an “offer to the public” as contemplated under
the South African Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, as amended
(the ""South African Companies Act""). Accordingly, this announcement does not, nor does it
intend to, constitute a ""registered prospectus"" or an ""advertisement"", as contemplated by the
South African Companies Act; and no prospectus has been filed with the South African
Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (the ""CIPC"") in respect of the Placement.

As a result, this announcement does not comply with the substance and form requirements
for a prospectus set out in the South African Companies Act and the South African Companies
Regulations of 2011, and has not been approved by, and/or registered with, the CIPC, or any
other South African authority.

The Placement Shares will be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its
existing general authority to issue shares for cash, granted by shareholders at the annual
general meeting of the Company held on 11 March 2020, being up to 172.5 million shares
which represents up to 4.95% of the total issued ordinary shares of Pepkor. The book for the

Placement is open with immediate effect and is expected to close as soon as possible.
The price per ordinary share at which the Placement Shares will be placed
(the ""Placement Price"") will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing
of the Bookbuild, the Placement Price and allocations are at the discretion of the Company
and the Bookrunners. The Placement Price will be announced as soon as practicable on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited (the ""JSE"") after the close of the Bookbuild.

The Placement Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects
with the existing ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company, including the right to
receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue of
the Placement Shares.

Subject to the approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placement Shares on the JSE is
expected to commence at 09h00 on Monday, 29 June 2020 (or such time and/or date as may
be agreed between the Company and the Bookrunners).

Pursuant to the terms of the placing agreement entered into between the Company and the
Bookrunners, the Company has, subject to certain exceptions agreed to between the
Company and the Bookrunners, agreed to customary lock-up arrangements for a period of
180 days from the closing date of the Placement.

UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020


Pepkor’s defensive discount and value positioning underpinned resilient performance.


1.   STATUTORY HIGHLIGHTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS – INCLUDING THE
     ADOPTION OF IFRS 16

     •   Revenue increased by 6.5% to R37.6 billion.

     •   Operating profit before capital items increased by 17.2% to R4.0 billion.

     •   Headline earnings per share decreased by 13.6% to 44.3 cents per share.

     •   The Group adopted IFRS 16: Leases during the current reporting period, using a
         modified retrospective approach with no restatement of prior period reported results.
         This had a material impact on the Group’s statutory results for the current period. To
         form a meaningful assessment of Group performance, shareholders are referred to
         Pepkor’s full results announcement, available on the Pepkor website at

     OF IFRS 16

     •   Revenue increased by 6.5% to R37.6 billion.

     •   Operating profit before capital items increased by 0.3% to R3.4 billion.

     •   145 new stores opened, increasing stores to 5 498 stores.

3.   OVERVIEW

     The Pepkor Group achieved commendable results for the six months ended
     31 March 2020 as its proven defensive discount and value market positioning,
     disciplined focus on customer needs and leading low cost of doing business
     underpinned performance.

     The retail environment was constrained with low consumer spending, high levels of
     unemployment, load shedding and low economic growth. This was exacerbated during
     March with the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) across South Africa and the
     globe – resulting in the declaration of a national state of disaster and the implementation
     of a national lockdown effective from 27 March 2020 until 30 April 2020.

4.   OUTLOOK

     The duration and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on the
     Group’s trading in the near to medium term remains uncertain. It is expected that
     COVID-19 and the lockdown measures will severely impact the South African economy,
     the retail sector as a whole, and the Pepkor Group as consumers face increased
     unemployment and hardship.

     Pepkor is confident that it is well positioned to gain market share in the post-COVID-19
     ‘new economy’ with its defensive discount and value positioning being more resilient
     through its focus on babies’ and children’s clothing and large contribution of basic and
     replenishment products.

     A live webcast of the results presentation will be broadcast at 11:00 am (SAST) on
     27 May 2020. A registration link for the webcast is available on the Company’s website:
     www.pepkor.co.za. The presentation will be made available on the Company’s website
     prior to the commencement of the webcast.

5.   DIVIDEND DECLARATION

     No interim dividend is declared as in prior interim periods. Based on heightened levels
     of prudence applied by the board and the focus on liquidity preservation and allocation
     of resources, it is not expected that a full year dividend will be declared for FY20.

6.   SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT

     This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors of the Company. It
     contains only a summary of the information in the full announcement and does not
     contain full or complete details. The full announcement can be found at:

COMMENTARY ON RECENT TRADING AND THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS

The following update was provided at the Pepkor annual general meeting today by Mr. Leon
Lourens, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company:

Consumers have remained under financial pressure in the current economic environment and
trading remains volatile.

Trading during January was stronger in both Pep and Ackermans which achieved double-digit
growth in sales on the back of the shift in ""back to school"". This was followed by weaker trading
in February and brings year-to-date performance largely in line with that what was reported
during the first quarter.

Trading in both JD Group and The Building Company was weaker during January and
February in context of the continued challenging trading environment for durable and building
material products. High unit prices and the challenges in the construction industry continue to
impact on the businesses in these divisions.

The impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has not been significant on group sales year-to-
date but will undoubtedly have an impact on the second half of the current financial year due
to the lag effect in the supply chain. Most of Pepkor's retail brands source products from China
and interruptions in production will in all likelihood lead to temporary shortages on certain stock
items. Certainty on the exact impact will only become clear once most factories resume
normalised production levels.

Pepkor's defensive business model will count in its favour to reduce the risk and impact on
the group. The bulk of Pepkor's product range is defensively skewed towards basic, everyday
products which are sourced well in advance of it being required in-store. This results in fairly
long supply chain lead times, allowing our buying teams, in collaboration with our long-term
loyal suppliers, the opportunity to tactically respond and put measures in place to mitigate any
negative impact. Management therefore expects interruptions to its product availability but
remains optimistic that customer service levels in the respective retail brands will be largely
maintained.

RESULTS OF THE SCRIP DIVIDEND AND ALTERNATIVE CASH DIVIDEND

Shareholders are referred to the Company's announcements released on SENS on 25
November 2019, 7 January 2020, 14 January 2020 and 23 January 2020 regarding the scrip
dividend (""Scrip Dividend"") declared in respect of the year ended 30 September 2019 with a
cash alternative of 20.9 cents (""Alternative Cash Dividend"") (""Announcements"").

As detailed in the Announcements, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders that
were recorded in the securities register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record
Date""), to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the Alternative Cash
Dividend, were entitled to be issued that number of Pepkor ordinary no par value shares
determined in the ratio of 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the
Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders who did not elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend, will automatically receive the Scrip Dividend.

In terms of the Scrip Dividend, 37 850 881 new ordinary shares were issued today at 1 707.15
cents per share to shareholders who did not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend in
respect of all or part of their shareholding, resulting in a capitalisation of distributable retained
profits of the Company of R646 171 315.

Shareholders recorded in the register of the Company at the close of business on the Record
Date holding 358 261 962 ordinary shares elected to receive the gross Alternative Cash
Dividend of 20.9 cents per ordinary share, resulting in a total gross cash dividend of
R74 876 750, which was paid out of distributable retained profits of the Company.

The Company's issued share capital, following the Scrip Dividend, is as follows:

Authorised share capital
20 000 000 000 ordinary shares of no par value
Issued share capital
3 487 850 881 ordinary shares of no par value

The Company's issued share capital does not include any treasury shares held.

In addition to the cash dividend payment today, share certificates will be dispatched to
certificated shareholders and CSDP/broker accounts of dematerialised shareholders will be
credited.

resilience of its business profile stemming from its leading position as South Africa's largest
non-grocery retailer.""

Pepkor is considering opportunities in the capital bond market with the objectives of
diversifying its sources of funding and reducing financing cost. This supports the Group's
target to reduce its leverage in the medium term to 1x net debt-to-EBITDA.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

The Pepkor group increased revenue from continuing operations by 7.6% to R20.9 billion for the
three months ended 31 December 2019.

The clothing, footwear and homeware (CFH) retail brands successfully defended and
expanded their market shares, according to the latest RLC data.

Continuing operations

Clothing & general merchandise

The clothing and general merchandise segment reported total revenue growth of 5.0% for the
quarter.

The Pep and Ackermans brands in aggregate reported sales growth of 6.4% and like-for-like
sales growth of 3.2%. Sales performance was negatively impacted by a shift in ""back-to-
school"" trade from December 2019 to January 2020 as a result of the later start to the school
year. This is confirmed by double digit sales growth during the first three trading weeks of
January 2020.

Retail selling price inflation in core CFH product categories increased to 9.1%, driven by
fluctuations in exchange rates. This compares to 1.6% in the comparative quarter and sales
units reduced as a consequence.

Notwithstanding the inflation, both Pep and Ackermans protected their positions as price
leaders in the discount and value markets.

Retail space of Pep and Ackermans expanded by 4.8% compared to the comparative
quarter. New stores are performing in line with expectations and continue to meet feasibility
thresholds.

Pep Africa, which contributes c.3% to group revenue, continued to consolidate amidst
adverse macro-economic conditions across most countries of operation. High levels of
product inflation due to depreciating currencies in Angola, Nigeria and Zambia impacted
consumer affordability. Constant currency sales declined by 2.8% and like-for-like sales
reduced by 6.4%, translating to a decline in sales of 12.7% in rand terms.

The Speciality division reported sales growth of 1.6% with like-for-like sales reducing by 0.6%.
The clothing product categories performed well during the quarter. In the current economic
environment consumers tend first to reduce spending on higher priced products such as
footwear, resulting in a very challenging trading environment for the footwear brands. Tekkie
Town continues to focus on improving stock-holding and other inefficiencies in the business
which continues to impact performance.

Furniture, appliances & electronics

The JD Group reported revenue growth of 3.6% for the quarter.

Retail sales increased by 2.2% while like-for-like sales declined by 0.7%. Credit sales declined to
an overall credit mix of 17.5% compared to the prior year's corresponding 18.1%. Black Friday
promotions were very successful reflecting the price sensitivity of over-stretched consumers.

Building materials

The Building Company reported a decline in sales and like-for-like sales of 4.1% and 2.9%
respectively. Sales performance in the retail division improved during the quarter while
performance in the wholesale and specialist divisions were negatively impacted by the
challenging market conditions in the construction and building materials market.

Fintech

The Fintech segment reported revenue growth of 44.4%. This includes the contribution from
Capfin following the internalisation of its credit book funding which is not included in the
comparative quarter.

The FLASH business increased revenue by 30.9% and continued to invest in new products,
businesses, channels and geographies to complement its informal trader business, which
consists of 170 000 traders.

Capfin reported good results for the quarter. The loan book is healthy with credit performance
meeting expectations.

Outlook

Trading in January 2020 has been relatively stronger in most brands, supported by the shift in
""back-to-school"". On a relative basis, Pepkor continues to perform well in context of the

CASH FRACTION APPLICABLE TO THE SCRIP DIVIDEND


Shareholders are referred to the Company's annual results for the year ended 30 September
2019 and the scrip dividend declaration announced on SENS on 25 November 2019, wherein
the board of directors of Pepkor advised that it resolved to declare a scrip dividend
(""Scrip Dividend"") in respect of the year ended 30 September 2019 with a cash alternative of
20.9 cents (""Alternative Cash Dividend"").

A circular (including a form of election for certificated shareholders) detailing the terms of the
Scrip Dividend and the Alternative Cash Dividend was distributed to shareholders on Tuesday,
7 January 2020 (""Circular"").

As detailed in the Circular and the Company's announcement released on SENS on
7 January 2020, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued
fully-paid Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding as at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary
shareholding and to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend. Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend of 20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor on the Record Date, instead of the Scrip Dividend. For the avoidance
of doubt, shareholders who do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will
automatically receive the Scrip Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

As announced on SENS on Tuesday, 14 January 2020 (""Finalisation SENS""), the ratio of
Pepkor ordinary shares to which each shareholder recorded in the securities register of Pepkor
on the Record Date will become entitled pursuant to the Scrip Dividend (to the extent that such
Shareholder has not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend) is 1.22426 shares for
every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record Date.

As further mentioned in the Finalisation SENS, where a Shareholder's entitlement to new
Pepkor ordinary shares under the abovementioned ratio applicable to the Scrip Dividend gives
rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to the
nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction (""Rounding Provision""). In terms of the Listings
Requirements of the JSE Limited (""JSE""), the applicable cash payment in respect of fractional
entitlements has been determined with reference to the volume weighted average price
(""VWAP"") of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive
the Scrip Dividend or the Alternative Cash Dividend), less 10%.

The VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020
was 1 699 cents per share. This amount, discounted by 10%, is 1 529 cents per share, which
amount will be used to determine the cash payment for the fractional entitlements.

Example of fractional entitlement:

This example assumes that a shareholder holds 100 Pepkor ordinary shares at the close of
business on the Record Date and does not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend for
all or part of such Pepkor ordinary shares held.

The ratio of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled pursuant to
the Scrip Dividend is 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record
Date.

By applying the Rounding Provision, the shareholder with 100 Pepkor ordinary shares will
receive 1 new Pepkor ordinary share for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held and a cash
payment for the fraction of 0.22426 x 1 529 = 342.89354 cents.

Shareholders are informed that, as far as the tax implications of the cash payment of the
fractional entitlements are concerned, the receipt of the cash payment will not be subject to
dividend withholding tax.

The above is a general guide and is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of the
taxation consequences of the cash payment of fractional entitlements in terms of South African
taxation law. It is not intended to be, nor should it be considered as legal or taxation advice
and shareholders are advised to seek their own tax advice from an independent tax adviser.
The Company and its advisers cannot be held responsible for the taxation consequences that
the Scrip Dividend may have on individual shareholders and therefore shareholders are
advised to consult their own tax advisers if they are in any doubt about their tax position.

As detailed in the Circular and the Company's announcement released on SENS on
7 January 2020, in terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued
fully-paid Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary
shareholding as at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary

Alternative Cash Dividend. Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the
Alternative Cash Dividend of 20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary

of doubt, shareholders who do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will
automatically receive the Scrip Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

The number of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled in terms of
the Scrip Dividend will be determined with reference to such shareholder's ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor (at the close of business on the Record Date) in relation to the ratio
that 20.9 cents bears to the volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") at which Pepkor
ordinary shares traded on the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") during the
10 trading day period ended on Monday, 13 January 2020, being 1 797 cents, discounted by
5%. However, where the application of this ratio gives rise to a fraction of a Pepkor ordinary
share, the rounding principles described below will be applied. For clarity, the 10-day VWAP
as noted in the Circular, was only for illustrative purposes and does not include trading

The ratio of Pepkor ordinary shares to which each shareholder recorded in the securities
register of Pepkor on the Record Date will become entitled pursuant to the Scrip Dividend (to
the extent that such Shareholder has not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend) is
therefore 1.22426 shares for every 100 Pepkor ordinary shares held on the Record Date,
subject to the rounding principles described below.

Where a Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend to new Pepkor ordinary shares
gives rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to
the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction. In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, the
applicable cash payment in respect of fractional entitlements will be determined with reference
to the VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive

 listing of Pepkor ordinary shares in respect of the Scrip Dividend
 adjusted to reflect the actual number of Pepkor ordinary shares issued
 in terms of the Scrip Dividend

In terms of the Scrip Dividend, Pepkor shareholders recorded in the securities register of
Pepkor on Friday, 24 January 2020 (""Record Date""), will be entitled to be issued fully-paid
Pepkor ordinary no par value shares in respect of all or part of their ordinary shareholding as
at the close of business on the Record Date, in proportion to their ordinary shareholding and
to the extent that such shareholders have not elected to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend.

Shareholders will, however, be entitled to elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend of
20.9 cents per share, held in respect of all or part of their ordinary shareholding in Pepkor on
the Record Date, instead of the Scrip Dividend. For the avoidance of doubt, shareholders who
do not elect to receive the Alternative Cash Dividend, will automatically receive the Scrip
Dividend (the Scrip Dividend is the default option).

The number of Pepkor ordinary shares to which a shareholder will become entitled in terms of
the Scrip Dividend will be determined with reference to such shareholder's ordinary
shareholding in Pepkor (at the close of business on the Record Date) in relation to the ratio
that 20.9 cents bears to the volume weighted average price (""VWAP"") at which Pepkor
ordinary shares traded on the exchange operated by the JSE Limited (""JSE"") during the
10 trading day period ending on Monday, 13 January 2020, discounted by 5%. The finalisation
information including the ratio applicable to the Scrip Dividend is expected to be released on
SENS on Tuesday, 14 January 2020, by 11:00 am.

Where a Shareholder's entitlement under the Scrip Dividend to new Pepkor ordinary shares
gives rise to a fraction of a new Pepkor ordinary share, such fraction will be rounded down to
the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Pepkor ordinary shares and a cash
payment in respect of the fraction. In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE, the
applicable cash payment in respect of fractional entitlements will be determined with reference
to the VWAP of Pepkor ordinary shares traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 22 January 2020,
(being the day on which Pepkor ordinary shares begin trading  ex' the entitlement to receive
the Scrip Dividend or the Alternative Cash Dividend), less 10%. The value to be used for
calculating cash payments for fractional entitlements will be announced on SENS on
Thursday, 23 January 2020, by 11:00 am.

The distribution of the Circular, and the rights and entitlements to receive Pepkor ordinary
shares pursuant to the Scrip Dividend in jurisdictions other than the Republic of South Africa,
may be restricted by law and any failure to comply with such restrictions may constitute a
violation of the securities laws of such jurisdictions. Accordingly, shareholders will not be
entitled to receive any Scrip Dividend shares, directly or indirectly, in those jurisdictions and
shall be deemed to have elected the Alternative Cash Dividend. Such non-resident
Shareholders should inform themselves about and observe any applicable legal requirements
in such jurisdictions. Shareholders who have any doubts as to their position, including, without
limitation, their tax status, should consult an appropriate adviser in the relevant jurisdictions
without delay.

The Circular will be available on the Company's website at https://www.pepkor.co.za/investor-
relations/shareholder-diary-meetings-and-notices. In addition, copies of the Circular will be
available for inspection, in English only, during normal business hours until Friday, 24 January
2020 at the Company's registered office at 36 Stellenberg Road, Parow Industria and at the
offices of its sponsor, PSG Capital, at 1st Floor, Ou Kollege, Stellenbosch and 2nd Floor,
Building 3, 11 Alice Lane, Sandhurst, Sandton.
