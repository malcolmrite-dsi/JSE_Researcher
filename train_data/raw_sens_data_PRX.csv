LAUNCH OF SHARE REPURCHASE AND SHARE PURCHASE


On 30 October 2020, Prosus announced its intention to implement an on-market:

•      Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion from its free-
       float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

•      Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of up to
       US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
       Transaction).

Prosus today announces the launch of the Transaction. The board of directors of Prosus (the
Prosus Board) is of the view that the Transaction is, among other things, an investment in the
group’s current strong internet portfolio, which is a sensible use of capital given full market
valuations in consumer tech M&A, and the sizeable discount to the group’s net asset value (NAV).
Prosus has a track record of generating good returns by investing across the consumer internet
space. Prosus also takes a long-term approach to capital allocation across its operations,
investments, and this approach now extends to its asset base – directly and indirectly via its
own stock. The Prosus Board believes that the Transaction will generate value for its
shareholders.

Prosus has appointed intermediaries to execute the Transaction within parameters set by it,
allowing the execution of (re)purchases in the open market during open and closed periods.
These intermediaries will make their trading decisions independently from, and uninfluenced by,
Prosus and Naspers.

Each of the Share Repurchase and the Share Purchase will commence on 24 November 2020
and end on 26 November 2021, or sooner if the maximum consideration under the Share
Repurchase or the Share Purchase, as applicable, is reached before then.

Prosus intends to cancel the Prosus ordinary shares N repurchased by it under the Share
Repurchase in due course. The Naspers N ordinary shares held by Prosus after having been
purchased under the Share Purchase will constitute treasury shares under the JSE Listings
Requirements. Prosus intends not to exercise any voting rights attaching to the Naspers N
ordinary shares acquired under the Share Purchase.

The Transaction will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law and
regulations, as well as the authorities granted by the general meeting of shareholders of Prosus
dated 18 August 2020 and Naspers dated 21 August 2020, as these may be renewed.

Prosus will provide weekly updates on the Share Repurchase in accordance with the Market
Abuse Regulation (as defined below) by means of press releases and announcements on the
JSE’s Stock Exchange News Service (SENS), and, together with details on a daily basis, on the
Prosus website (www.prosus.com).

COMMENTARY
September 2020 marked the first anniversary of the listing of Prosus on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. This
created Europe's largest consumer internet company and a new investment opportunity on the global technology stage,
improving the group's access to international internet investors. A year on, ownership of Prosus continues to expand and
diversify. The group's recent inclusion in Europe's leading index, the Euro Stoxx 50, is expected to attract additional
European investor interest over time.

Given the wide geographical span of our operations and significant M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity in
ecommerce, reported earnings are materially impacted by foreign exchange movements and the effects of acquisitions and
disposals. Where relevant in this report, we have adjusted for these effects. These adjustments (pro forma financial 
information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics reported under International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). 

The following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which include consolidated subsidiaries
and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures), unless otherwise stated.

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
The group delivered good results for the first six months ended 30 September 2020, despite Covid-19. Group revenue,
measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$12.7bn, reflecting growth of 28% (32%), a meaningful acceleration of 16pp
(12pp) over the same period last year. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (51%) year on year. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy
27% (28%). Group trading profit grew 39% (43%) to US$2.7bn. Tencent's contribution to the group's trading profit
improved 31% (32%).  

Core headline earnings were US$2.2bn - up 28% (29%), driven by improved profitability from our Ecommerce units and the
growing contribution from Tencent. 

We ended the period with a strong and liquid balance sheet. We had a net cash position of US$4.3bn, comprising
US$9.95bn in cash and cash equivalents (including short-term cash investments), net of US$5.7bn in interest-bearing debt
(excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We hold an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded 
net interest expense of US$49m for the period. 

In July 2020, Prosus successfully raised more than US$2bn in debt, comprising its longest-dated US dollar offering to
date and its debut euro notes offering. The offerings drew strong investor demand, resulting in attractive pricing that
reduced the group's average funding cost while extending the blended maturity profile of its outstanding notes to almost
12 years. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including future M&A activity, and to further
augment the company's liquidity. Issuances consisted of 2050 US$1bn 4.027% notes, 2028 ?500m 1.593% notes and 2032 
?500m 2.031% notes. The group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

Consolidated free cash inflow was US$370m, a significant improvement on the prior year's free cash inflow of US$14m.
This reflects growth in our Ecommerce unit's profitability, dividends received from Tencent of US$458m (2019: US$377m)
and improved working capital management.

There were no new or amended accounting pronouncements effective from 1 April 2020 with a significant impact on the
group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Effective 1 April 2020, the group made a voluntary change to its accounting policy on the subsequent measurement of
written put option arrangements with non-controlling shareholders. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of put option
liabilities previously recognised in the income statement in ""Other finance income/(costs) - net"" are now recognised
through equity. We believe the change in accounting policy will provide more relevant information about the effects of
underlying transactions with non-controlling shareholders. Written put option arrangements are considered equity
transactions because the settlement with non-controlling shareholders does not result in losing control over a subsidiary.
Furthermore, on initial recognition of the written put option liability, the group simultaneously recognises the 
non-controlling interest because the risks and rewards of ownership are not deemed to have transferred to the group 
until the written put option liability is settled. 

The group has adopted this change in accounting policy retrospectively, however, the impact is insignificant to the
consolidated statement of financial position as all previous remeasurements recognised through the income statement are
already accumulated in equity as at the effective date of the change. The previous remeasurements accumulated in retained
earnings have been reclassified to the ""existing control business combination reserve"". Consequently, comparative
figures on the statement of financial position have been restated for the reclassification between retained earnings and 
other reserves. The carrying value of the written put option liabilities and the total equity of the group in the 
comparative periods remain unchanged. The condensed consolidated income statement and finance income/costs note have 
been restated for the remeasurement of written put option liabilities as these are now recognised directly in equity.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in this interim results
announcement.

We continue to explore growth opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and position the business
for sustainable growth. In our Classifieds segment, we merged letgo and OfferUp, resulting in a business with national
reach across the United States (US), well positioned for growth in a highly competitive market. The merger included a 
new US$120m investment round led by Prosus. Furthermore, we injected our Middle Eastern Classifieds assets into Emerging
Markets Property Group (EMPG) and participated in a US$150m financing round that valued the business at over US$1bn. OLX
Brazil has subsequently completed the US$520m (BRL2.9bn) acquisition of leading real estate vertical Grupo ZAP, announced
in March 2020. In our Payments and Fintech segment, we made an additional investment of US$53m in Remitly to expand 
its footprint in the US, United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. We participated in Mail.ru's capital raise to fund growth
initiatives, investing US$25m. Finally, we are focused on increasing our exposure to edtech (educational technology) by 
investing US$60m in Eruditus, a global professional higher-education online platform. In November we announced a total 
investment of US$500m in Churchill Capital Corp II's planned acquisition of Software Luxembourg Holding S.A. (Skillsoft) 
and Global Knowledge Training LLC (Global Knowledge). The transaction will create the world's leading digital learning 
company with a comprehensive suite of on-demand and live virtual content.

COVID-19
We started the financial year responding to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has proven to be a global
challenge. Despite the social and economic impact across the world, Prosus remained resilient and performed well in the 
first half of the current financial year - accelerating revenue growth, improving profitability and cash flow generation, 
and growing customer numbers as consumers moved online. Ecommerce revenues grew 37% (51%) year on year. Group trading 
profit grew 39% (43%). 

Like most companies, Prosus faced challenges, particularly in countries where government lockdown regulations were
extensive and protracted, reducing economic activity. We quickly implemented our contingency plans and we saw a sharp
recovery in all of our businesses as lockdown regulations began easing. 

Throughout the crisis, we prioritised the health and wellbeing of our employees, safeguarded jobs as far as possible,
and protected and positioned our business for the long term. When necessary, we extended support to our partners to
ensure the supply chain remained strong and donated to government Covid-19 response programmes. 

After the easing of lockdowns and curfews in many countries in the second quarter, almost all business activities have
resumed year-on-year growth. In addition, Tencent remained resilient throughout the pandemic and is performing well.
Unfortunately, a second Covid-19 wave is impacting some markets in which we operate, however, we remain confident that 
the plans we have put in place and our firm financial position will ensure that we manage the potential impacts going
forward. Longer term, we believe we will benefit from the acceleration of the underlying trends to online platforms which
propel the growth of the consumer internet market, and we will ensure our businesses are positioned to emerge well from 
the crisis.

Trading statement,16 Nov 2020,"Trading statement

Prosus N.V. (previously Myriad International Holdings N.V.)
(Incorporated in the Netherlands)
(Trade Reg No 34099856)
AEX and JSE Share Code: PRX ISIN: NL0013654783
(“Prosus”)


Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Prosus group (“the group”) is finalising its condensed consolidated
interim report for the six months ended 30 September 2020.

Prosus is a subsidiary of Naspers Limited (“Naspers”), a company incorporated in South Africa and
listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) Limited in South Africa.

For context, in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, South African listed entities with a primary
listing on the exchange are obliged to issue a trading statement as soon they are reasonably certain
that the upcoming financial results would differ by at least 20% from those of the previous
corresponding period. Trading statements are generally issued to provide shareholders with a range
of outcomes in respect of key financial metrics.

The financial results of Prosus almost completely account for Naspers’ results. Based on Naspers’
anticipated period ended 30 September 2020 results, Naspers is required to issue a trading statement
in terms of the above JSE listing requirements. To ensure that shareholders of Prosus are provided
simultaneously with equivalent information, Prosus is issuing this trading statement.

As outlined in the table below, the Group is expected to deliver good results for the first half ended
30 September 2020 despite the impacts of Covid-19.

We have completed several acquisitions in the first six months and have continued to explore growth
opportunities to advance our strategy, expand our ecosystem and to position the business for
continued long-term growth.

More details will be published with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements on
Monday, 23 November 2020.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in earnings, headline earnings and core headline
earnings per share for the period ended 30 September 2019 as compared to 30 September 2020 in
the tables below:

                                         30
                                                      30 September 2020
                                     September                                        Expected
                                                       expected increase
                                       2019                                          increase %
                                                           US cents
                                      US cents
 Earnings per share (1)                    154                 26 – 35           16.9% – 22.7%
 Headline earnings* per share (1)           99                 47 – 53           47.5% – 53.5%
 Core headline earnings** per              105                 25 – 32           23.8% – 30.5%
 share (1)

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator
of the operating performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline
earnings per share for the current period is expected to increase by between 25 and 32 cents per
share (between 23.8% and 30.5%). This reflects the continued growth in the group’s ecommerce
businesses and strong performance from Tencent.

Like most companies, in the period we faced some challenges due to Covid-19, particularly in countries
where government lockdown regulations were wide ranging and long lasting. However, we have seen
a sharp recovery in all of our impacted businesses as our contingency plans produced results once
lockdown regulations began easing. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation
to ensure we safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our                                                                                                     
businesses for the long-term. While forward visibility remains difficult, given the challenges some
countries face in dealing with the longer-term effects of Covid-19, we continue to believe we will
benefit from the acceleration of the trends that have propelled the growth of the consumer internet.

* Headline earnings represent net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the group, excluding certain defined separately identifiable
remeasurements relating to, amongst others, impairments of tangible assets, intangible assets (including goodwill) and equity-accounted investments, gains
and losses on acquisitions and disposals of investments as well as assets, dilution gains and losses on equity-accounted investments, remeasurement gains and
losses on disposal groups classified as held for sale and remeasurements included in equity-accounted earnings, net of related taxes (both current and deferred)
and the related non-controlling interests. These remeasurements are determined in accordance with Circular 1/2019, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South
African Institute of Chartered Accountants, pursuant to the JSE Listings Requirements.
** Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period, excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets, as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments and
unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) once-off gains and losses (including
acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses, as these items relate to changes in the composition of the group and are not
reflective of its underlying operating performance; and (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business combinations and acquisitions and (vi)
donations made to various governments in assisting with the Covid-19 pandemic, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments
are made to the earnings of combined businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent
that the information is available.

(1) Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.

PROSUS ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO ACQUIRE UP TO US$5 BILLION OF PROSUS
AND NASPERS SHARES

Prosus today announces its intention to implement:

   •   an on-market Prosus ordinary share N repurchase programme of up to US$1.37 billion
       from its free-float shareholders (the Share Repurchase); and

   •   an on-market Naspers Limited (Naspers) N ordinary share purchase programme of
       up to US$3.63 billion (the Share Purchase, together with the Share Repurchase, the
       Proposed Transaction).

Today’s announcement marks another step in Prosus’s continuing creation of shareholder
value and reflects its focus on reducing the current discount of the share price to Prosus’s net
asset value (NAV) over time. The board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) is of the
view that the Proposed Transaction is a timely investment in the group’s strong internet
portfolio, which is a sensible use of capital given full market valuations in consumer internet
M&A, and the sizeable discount to the group’s NAV.

Prosus has a track record of generating good returns by investing across the consumer
internet space. The group takes a long-term approach to capital allocation across its
operations and investments, and this approach now extends to its asset base - directly and
indirectly via its own stock. The Prosus Board believes that the Proposed Transaction will
generate value for shareholders.

Prosus intends to launch the Proposed Transaction following the release of its results for the
six months ended 30 September 2020, expected to be announced on 23 November 2020.

The Proposed Transaction will be implemented in accordance with, and subject to, applicable
law and regulations, as well as the authorities granted by Prosus’s and Naspers’s
shareholders, as applicable.

Prosus intends not to exercise any voting rights attaching to the Naspers N ordinary shares
acquired under the Share Purchase.

Shareholders will be updated on further details relating to the implementation of the Proposed
Transaction in due course.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE PROCESSING OF DIVIDENDS IN SOUTH AFRICA


Further to the announcement on 18 August 2020, the EUR/ZAR exchange rate was 20,7111 as at 18 August 2020.
Shareholders holding their ordinary shares N on the South African register will receive a distribution of ZAR228 cents
per ordinary share N. The distribution to the holders of ordinary shares N has been rounded up to the nearest cent
due to the complexities of the repaid capital. Shareholders of ordinary shares A1 will receive a dividend of
ZAR12,46808 cents per ordinary share A1.
Shareholders electing to receive a dividend will receive a dividend declared from retained earnings. Dividends will be
subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% yielding a net dividend of ZAR193,8 cents per ordinary share
N and ZAR10,59786 cents per ordinary share A1 to those shareholders not entitled to an exemption or relief from
Dutch dividend tax.

In addition to the Dutch dividend tax, dividends paid in respect of ordinary N shares on the South African register will
also be subject to South African dividend tax at a rate of up to 20% in relation to shareholders not entitled to an
exemption from South African dividend tax. The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable will be
calculated by deducting from the 20% South African dividend tax otherwise due, a rebate equal to the Dutch dividend
withholdings tax lawfully payable in respect of the dividend (without any right of recovery) i.e. the amount of Dutch
dividend tax due after taking into account any applicable exemptions or tax treaty relief that may reduce the Dutch
dividend tax payable. Those shareholders, unless exempt from paying Dutch and South African dividend tax, or entitled
to a reduced Dutch dividend withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty, will be subject to a maximum of
20% aggregate dividend tax.

South African corporates who own 5% or more of the shares in Prosus may qualify for a Dutch domestic exemption
from Dutch dividend withholding tax. Those shareholders who qualify for domestic relief have until 8 December 2020
to provide evidence to ABN Amro that their dividend qualifies for domestic relief from Dutch dividend withholding tax.

The treaty between South Africa and the Netherlands notes that the Dutch dividend withholding tax may get reduced
from 15% to 10%. This reduction applies equally to corporates holding less than 10% of the capital of Prosus,
individuals and other persons who qualify as residents of South Africa for treaty purposes. If shareholders, or their
tax advisors, conclude that they are entitled to benefits arising from the tax treaty, such shareholders should follow
the process prescribed by the tax treaty to claim relief.

Please note that no Dutch dividend withholding tax will be withheld on repayments of share capital. There will also
be no South African dividend tax on repayments of share capital.

result of which they could not ask follow-on questions or vote.
Summary of statements from the annual general meeting:


A transformational year
This was a truly transformational year: the successful listing of Prosus sets the company on a path to generating even
more value for our stakeholders in the future.


Clear focus and direction
For many years now, we have concentrated on creating value by improving people’s lives around the world. At heart,
we are entrepreneurs who want to make a positive impact. We do this through a combination of being focused and
disciplined, remaining open to opportunity and change, and always looking to grow and create long-term sustainable
value in a responsible way.


We continue to transform our group - investing in new and existing businesses and creating innovative technology-
enabled products and services. As ever, we focus on backing entrepreneurs, technology and business concepts that
meet fundamental human needs. This is at the core of how we create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.


In our highly dynamic, fast changing, high-growth world, we never lose sight of our commitment to good governance.
We aim to conduct the group’s business with integrity, applying appropriate corporate governance policies and
principles. We are building on our commitment to sustainability and we continually evaluate where to improve
governance.


Strong performance
Prosus ended its inaugural year as a listed company in a position of strength, with accelerating revenue in our
ecommerce portfolio, improved profitability and a substantial net cash position which provides us with ample liquidity.
As the world continues to confront the global Covid-19 crisis, some core trends directly related to our business are
accelerating and solidifying. The data that we see shows that consumers are consistently increasing their online activity
and spending. We believe that this change is structural, so as a 100% online business, we expect Prosus to emerge
from the crisis even stronger.


Revenue grew 17% (23%) year on year, with revenue in ecommerce growing 33% to $4.3 billion, a 7% acceleration on
last year. Profitability improved by 12% (16%) even as we significantly stepped up our investment in Food Delivery.
Profitability was mainly driven by Tencent, Classifieds and Payments and Fintech, which remained profitable at the
core. We are investing further to expand our ecosystem in both the Classifieds and Paymentsand Fintech segments.
Excluding the increased investment in Food Delivery and Payments and Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals,
ecommerce trading losses reduced by a healthy 28% or $78 million in local currency.
Taking each of our core segments in turn, Classifieds grew revenues 49% (37%) year on year and trading profit US$34
million despite the step up in the investment to build out our transaction business, which is growing fast – up 282%
(164%) year on year. Our Food Delivery business is scaling driven by strong demand and order growth. We have also
seen signs of improved efficiency and customer acquisition. Revenue increased 99% (105%) to US$751 million. Trading
losses increased to US$624 million reflecting continued investment in growth. Turning to Payments and Fintech, PayU
grew revenue 19% (21%) year on year. In India, revenue grew even faster at 29%(31%) year over year. India continues
to be a key focus for Ventures - the underlying market drivers represent significant potential. In the last financial year,
we invested in Meesho and ElasticRun, and in the previous year we invested in BYJU’S. So far, we have invested about
US$855 million in our Ventures portfolio. Our edtech investments, for example in BYJU’s and Brainly, are by a
significant margin the largest in the Ventures portfolio. Covid-19 is accelerating the demand and impact of edtech and
this creates an opportunity for us.


We had another good year with Tencent. The company continued to grow strongly. Our share of Tencent’s revenue
and trading profit grew 21% and 22% respectively.


Committed to our strategy
We remain firmly committed to our strategy. We are active participants in our investments and we have become
increasingly close to our partners during the crisis, to ensure we support them. Being both an operator and investor
helps us to prioritise and share best practises at a very concrete level. We always take a long-term view and our focus
remains on building sustainable leadership positions across our core segments. This is key to attaining profitability on
a sustainable basis. Through the year, we invested US$1.3 billion in Food Delivery, Classifieds, Payments and Fintech,
and Ventures. We continue to be highly disciplined in our capital allocation.
During the year we considered over 5,000 potential deals and executed on 54. (We have also walked away from high
profile transactions where it was the right thing to do.)


Aligning remuneration to performance and value creation
We aim to attract, motivate and retain the best people to create sustainable shareholder value. Our people are at the
heart of our success. We operate in a highly competitive global market for the digital talent we need. To attract and
retain the best and achieve our goals, we focus on pay for performance, encourage ownership and an entrepreneurial
spirit in our teams around the world, and align management compensation with the creation of shareholder value
over time.


We successfully listed Prosus on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in September 2019. As a strategic investor
and operator we focus on long-term value creation by building leading technology companies that improve people’s
daily lives in high-growth markets. As a global consumer internet group, we are one of the largest technology
investors in the world. Our business moves fast as technology trends and consumer adoption change, and we seek to
run businesses that have broad potential, can address big societal needs and can attain market leadership over time.

                                                            
Our executives continue to be compensated based on both Naspers and Prosus performance.


This year, 60% of the longer-term incentive awards (LTIs) to senior executives will be made in performance share units
(PSUs), which will vest after three years only if key performance metrics are met. PSUs, as part of our remuneration
toolkit, including share options (SOs) and share appreciation rights (SARs), create a balanced mix of LTIs with value-
based performance hurdles that will help drive the right longer-term outcomes for stakeholders.


Below the executive level, we are using restricted share units (RSUs) more broadly across the organisation, to better
align our compensation practices with our peers and increase opportunity for employees to own shares in the
company. RSUs will be complemented with SAR allocations on our unlisted assets, to further align incentives to
performance delivery and value creation.
Societal fairness is very important to us, particularly as we operate in developing economies were socioeconomic
disparity can be large. We take our responsibilities in that respect seriously and ensure that our pay practices around
the world are fair and competitive. And pay is an important aspect, but not the only consideration. In general, our
people join us because of the opportunity to do meaningful work where they have the opportunity to make a
difference, to learn and grow.


We will continue to engage closely with our investors and advisers – listening and responding to feedback and above
all, focusing on strongly aligning our HR and remuneration to Prosus’s strategy and performance.

Tax Implications
1.     Dutch Tax Implications
1.1.       General
           Capital repayments will be paid from share capital. No Dutch dividend withholding tax (""DWT"") will be
           withheld on the amounts of capital repayments paid to shareholders.


           Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend, generally, 15% DWT will be withheld by Prosus on the cash
           dividend, leaving a distribution amount per share net of Dutch DWT, unless:


                                                           
1.1.1.         a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch
               domestic law (including implementation of EU Directives) and/or a tax treaty concluded by the
               Netherlands; and


1.1.2.         the formal requirements to apply such exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT are satisfied (insofar
               applicable).


           Prosus will initially withhold 15% on ALL cash dividends distributed on Tuesday, 17 November 2020. As a
           subsequent step, if and to the extent Prosus has been provided before 8 December with proof that a
           shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch domestic
           law, the difference between 15% and the Dutch DWT to be withheld will be paid out to the shareholder,
           after the Dutch DWT return and/or Dutch DWT notification has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax
           authorities. Prosus will remit the Dutch DWT to be withheld to the Dutch tax authorities based on the Dutch
           DWT return.


1.2.       Domestic exemptions from Dutch DWT
1.2.1.         General
               Corporate shareholders may be exempt from Dutch DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law, if:
1.2.1.1.            The shareholder is tax resident in the Netherlands and owns 5% or more of the share capital of
                    Prosus, provided that the further requirements for the application of the Dutch participation
                    exemption are met. Special rules may apply for corporate shareholders that are considered tax
                    transparent in their country of residence, or considered tax transparent from a Dutch tax
                    perspective; or


1.2.1.2.            A shareholder is considered tax resident within the EU or EEA or is a tax resident of a country with
                    which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty containing an article on taxation of dividends
                    (such as South Africa), and, as a general rule, this corporate shareholder is the beneficial owner of
                    the dividends distributed by Prosus and owns 5% or more of the share capital of Prosus. In addition
                    to the shareholding requirement, the shareholder is also required to meet certain other conditions
                    relating to the application of the Dutch participation exemption, determined as if the corporate
                    shareholder is a Dutch tax resident.


               The above exemptions are not available in cases of abuse, for which a main purposes test and artificial
               arrangement test applies.


               If a shareholder is eligible for an exemption from Dutch DWT, in order to place reliance on such
               exemption, the shareholder is required to submit certain information to ABN AMRO as set-out below

                                                           
1.2.2.        Dutch corporate shareholders owning 5% or more of Prosus' share capital
              In order to rely on this domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in paragraph 1.2.1.1 above, the
              shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with: (i) its name, address and
              place of residency, and corresponding extract from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce; (ii) the number
              and percentage of shares owned in Prosus; (iii) its bank account details; and (iv) a statement confirming
              that the Dutch participation exemption applies to the dividend at the level of the Dutch corporate
              shareholder. This information should be submitted before Tuesday 8 December 2020.


              As indicated above, Prosus will, as a general rule, initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends distributed on
              Tuesday, 17 November 2020. If, however, Prosus has been provided with proof, to its satisfaction,
              ultimately 8 December 2020, that the relevant shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT,
              no amount of DWT will be withheld, and the 15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be
              paid out by Prosus to the relevant shareholder directly, after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus
              with the Dutch tax authorities.


1.2.3.        EU/EEA or tax treaty country resident corporate shareholders owning 5% or more
              In order for a corporate shareholder to rely on the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in in
              paragraph 1.2.1.2 above, the shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with:
              (i) its name, address and place of residency; (ii) the number and percentage of shares owned in Prosus;
              (iii) a tax residency certificate issued by its country of residence; (iv) its bank account details; and (v) a
              statement confirming that all relevant conditions of the DWT exemption are met. This information
              should be submitted before 8 December 2020. Subsequently, Prosus will need to file a Dutch DWT
              notification with the Dutch tax authorities.


              Shareholders are advised that Prosus will, as a general rule, initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends
              distributed on the dividend payment date, being Tuesday, 17 November 2020. If, however, ABN AMRO
              has been provided with proof, to its satisfaction, ultimately 8 December 2020, that the relevant
              shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT, no amount of DWT will be withheld, and the
              15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be paid out by Prosus to the relevant
              shareholder directly, after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities.


1.3.     Tax treaty relief
         Shareholders that do not qualify for the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT as outlined in paragraph 1.2,
         may qualify for an exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of a relevant tax treaty concluded
         by the Netherlands. The claiming of tax treaty relief or a credit will generally be subject to formal                                                            
         requirements. Shareholders could consult their tax advisor to determine if such an exemption or reduction is
         applicable to their situation and in which way, they can claim this back
2. South African Tax Implications
2.1.     General
         A capital repayment in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE will be regarded as a ""foreign return
         of capital"" for South African tax purposes. No South African dividend withholding tax (""SADWT"") will be
         withheld on the amounts paid to shareholders as a capital repayment.


         For shareholders holding Prosus shares as a capital investment, the capital repayment will reduce the South
         African tax base cost of the Prosus shares in the hands of the shareholder by an amount equal to the capital
         repayment. To the extent that the capital repayment may exceed the tax base cost of the Prosus shares,
         taxable gains may result shareholders subject to South African capital gains tax.


         Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE, such
         distribution will be regarded as a ""foreign dividend"" for South African income tax purposes and should
         generally be exempt from normal tax in South Africa. However such foreign dividends will, generally, be
         subject to 20% SADWT, to be withheld by the regulated intermediary in South Africa (CSDP), leaving a
         distribution amount per share net of SADWT, unless:


2.1.1.       a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from, or a reduction of, SADWT, on the basis of South African
             domestic law or a tax treaty concluded by South Africa and before the dividend is paid, the formal
             requirements to apply such exemption or reduction from SADWT are satisfied (insofar as applicable); or


2.1.2.       The dividend is paid to another CSDP; or


2.1.3.       The beneficial owner of such dividend is a natural person, deceased estate or insolvent estate in respect
             of a dividend paid in respect of a tax free investment as contemplated in section 12T(1) of the Income
             Tax Act 58 of 1962 (as amended).


         In order to qualify for any exemption or reduction from SADWT described in paragraph 2.1.1. the person to
         whom the dividend is paid must provide the following documentation to the CSDP before the dividend is
         paid:


2.1.4.       a written declaration that the dividend is exempt from SADWT in terms of South African domestic law;
             and


                                                          
2.1.5.       a written undertaking to inform the regulated intermediary in writing should the circumstances affecting
             the exemption/reduction applicable change, or should the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial
             owner, by the date determined by the CSDP, or where no date is determined, by the date of payment
             of the dividend.


2.2.     Tax implications for South African corporate shareholders
         Where the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a company, the dividend will be exempt
         from SADWT in terms of domestic law, provided the documentary requirements set out above are complied
         with.


2.3.     Tax implications for South African non-corporate shareholders
         Where the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a non-corporate shareholder, the
         dividend may be exempt from SADWT in terms of domestic law. Where the dividend does not qualify for one
         of the domestic exemptions, SADWT will be paid at an initial rate of 20%, subject to a rebate for Dutch DWT
         paid in respect of such dividend without any recovery by any person.


2.4.     Rebate on SADWT paid
         A rebate for foreign taxes (i.e. Dutch DWT) imposed on the dividend paid is available to reduce the SADWT
         liability. This rebate is calculated based on the Dutch DWT paid without the right of recovery by any person.
         In other words, the rebate is limited to the amount of Dutch DWT paid after taking into account relevant
         exemptions from, or reductions of, Dutch DWT that the shareholder may be eligible for as described in
         paragraph 1 above.


         The rebate will further be limited to the SADWT imposed. For example, if the dividend is exempt from Dutch
         DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law as a result of the shareholder holding 5% or more of Prosus’s shares,
         no rebate will be available.


         The CSDP is responsible for withholding SADWT from the dividend payable to shareholders on the South
         African register and paying such amounts to the South African Revenue Service.


         In order to apply a rebate, the CSDP must be satisfied:


2.4.1.       that DWT was applied; and


2.4.2.       that the relevant shareholder qualifies for a reduced rate of DWT.


                                                         
         The rebate for foreign taxes is determined in Rand by translating the foreign currency amount using the same
         rate used to translate the foreign dividend.


2.5.    Refund mechanism
         The maximum effective dividend tax to be paid by South African tax resident shareholders on the South
         African register, who are not exempt from SADWT will be 20%. For example, where a CSDP is satisfied that
         a particular shareholder has paid 15% Dutch DWT, which is not recoverable by that shareholder from the
         Dutch tax authority, such CSDP should withhold only 5% SADWT, being the 20% SADWT less 15% DWT (unless
         a specific South African domestic exemption applies and the required documentation as set out in paragraph
         2 has been provided to the CSDP).


         If such shareholder pays more than an aggregate 20% dividends withholding tax (being the total Dutch and
         South African dividend tax paid on the same dividend), such shareholders are advised to follow the
         procedures set out paragraphs 1, if appropriate, in order to claim a refund of Dutch DWT taxes overpaid.
         Where an amount of SADWT has been overpaid as a result of failure to comply with the requirements
         described in paragraphs 2.1.4 and 2.1.5, or the failure to deduct a rebate as described in paragraph 2.4, the
         shareholder may be entitled to claim a refund of the SADWT overpaid. This refund must be claimed from
         the CSDP within a period of three years after the date of payment of the dividend.


         Whether or not there is a refund due to the shareholder should be determined with reference to the specific
         facts applicable to that shareholder.


         The information provided above does not constitute tax advice and is only provided as a general guide on
         the South African tax treatment of the cash dividend declaration by Prosus to South African tax resident
         shareholders. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa, the dividend may have other legal or tax
         implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers
         in this regard.


Looking forward with confidence
Our core objectives are unchanged and strong market dynamics underpin our structural growth. We are at the
beginning of our Prosus journey, but we have made a great start and are clear about where we are heading in the
interests of our shareholders and all our stakeholders. So, the fundamentals are strong and we have real momentum.

offering, priced on 28 July 2020. These issuances consist of US$1.00 billion
4.027% notes due 2050, EUR500 million 1.593% notes due 2028 and EUR500
million 2.031% notes due 2032, in each case to be issued under its Global
Medium-Term Note Programme (the “Bonds”).

The current favourable market backdrop enabled Prosus to diversify its funding
sources by establishing a position in the euro bond market, while at the same
time extending the duration of the Company’s financing curve to 30 years in
the US dollar market.

The purpose of the offerings is to raise proceeds for general corporate
purposes, including potential future M&A activity, and to further augment the
company’s liquidity position.

The offerings attracted strong investor demand, with US dollar notes more
than seven times subscribed and the euro debut notes more than eleven times
subscribed on the eight year notes and twelve times subscribed on the twelve
year notes, allowing pricing of the Bonds at rates that reduce the Company’s
average funding cost, while at the same time extending the blended maturity
profile of its outstanding notes to almost 12 years.

It is expected that this financing will be ratings neutral for Prosus. Prosus
remains committed to an Investment Grade credit rating, as management
believes this to be important in providing the group with debt capital market
access at attractive rates.

The offerings are expected to close on 3 August 2020, subject to customary
closing conditions.
                                                                            
An application has been made to Euronext Dublin to admit the Bonds to listing
on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and trading on the regulated market
thereof.

Dividend declaration

Further to the company’s summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March
2020 released today, Monday, 29 June 2020, shareholders are advised that the company’s board of
directors (“the board”) recommends that holders of N ordinary shares are entitled to a gross payment,
in the form of a capital repayment, of 11 euro cents per share and holders of A1 ordinary shares will
receive a dividend distribution of 0.602 euro cent per share.

Furthermore, the board recommends that holders of N ordinary shares as at Friday, 23 October 2020
(the dividend record date) who do not wish to receive a capital repayment can elect to receive a
dividend instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out of the other option. If confirmed by
shareholders at the virtual annual general meeting on Tuesday, 18 August 2020, elections to receive
a dividend instead of a capital repayment will need to be made by holders of N ordinary shares by
Monday, 9 November 2020. Capital repayments and dividends will be payable to shareholders
recorded in the books on the dividend record date and paid on or after Tuesday, 17 November 2020.

Capital repayments will be paid from share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No dividend tax will be
withheld on the amounts of capital reductions paid to shareholders.

Dividends and capital repayments are declared and paid in euros. For those holders holding their N
ordinary shares in South Africa via Strate as well as South Africa holders of A1 ordinary shares, the
proposed dividend and capital reduction as denominated in euro will be translated to South African
rand at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of approval of the dividend at the annual general
meeting.

Shareholders electing to receive a dividend will receive a dividend declared from retained earnings.
Dividends will be subject to the Dutch dividend withholding tax rate of 15% to those shareholders not
exempt from dividend withholding tax and to those shareholders who are not entitled to a reduced
dividend withholding tax rate.

Dividends payable to shareholders who elect to receive a dividend and who hold their N ordinary
shares in South Africa via Strate will, in addition to the Dutch dividend withholding tax, be subject to
South African dividend tax at a rate of up to 20%. The amount of additional South African dividend tax
payable will be calculated by deducting from the 20% South African dividend tax otherwise due, a
rebate equal to the Dutch dividends withholdings tax paid in respect of the dividend (without any right
of recovery). Those shareholders, unless exempt from paying dividend tax or entitled to a reduced
withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty, will be subject to a maximum of 20% total
dividend tax.

Holders of Prosus American Depositary Receipts which trade on an over-the-counter basis in the
United States will receive a distribution of repaid capital.

The issued ordinary share capital as at 29 June 2020 was 1 624 652 070 N ordinary shares and
3 511 818 A1 ordinary shares.

Dear Madam/Sir 
I am pleased to enclose the notice of the virtual annual general meeting of Prosus N.V. (the company or Prosus), 
which will be held at 14:00 (Central European time) on Tuesday 18 August 2020. Formally, the virtual meeting will 
be held at ABN AMRO, Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

In accordance with the Temporary Act Covid-19 Justice and Safety, shareholders can only attend the meeting virtually 
via the internet at www.abnamro.com/evoting and if they wish, vote in real time online. The meeting can also be followed 
on the Prosus website www.prosus.com/investors.

At the virtual annual general meeting, our chief executive, Bob van Dijk, will update you on the progress of the business 
in FY20. Subsequently, introductions will be given on other items on the agenda. Following these presentations, we will 
have a full Q&A session on all matters tabled before we conduct the formal business of the virtual meeting (the voting 
on all tabled voting items). 

In accordance with the board rotation plan, Don Eriksson, Mark Sorour, Emilie Choi, Manisha Girotra and Rachel Jafta 
are offering themselves for re-election. 

The end of FY20 marked the retirement of Fred Phaswana as a director and lead independent director of Prosus (and Naspers). 
I would like to thank Fred again on behalf of the board for his contribution to the Naspers and Prosus groups. Fred has 
been a director in the Naspers group for over 15 years and played a key role in transforming Naspers, and subsequently 
Prosus, into one of the top 10 global consumer internet companies by market capitalisation. 

As announced on 29 April 2020, the board decided to nominate Ms Ying Xu for appointment as a non-executive director

COMMENTARY
The past financial year has seen the Prosus group transform as we executed several significant strategic initiatives, 
which we believe will unlock value over time. Operationally, the group ended the year in a position of strength, with 
accelerating revenue growth in its ecommerce (online commerce) portfolio, improved profitability and substantial net 
cash position with sufficient liquidity. Underpinning these results, Tencent continued to report resilience in an 
uncertain macro-environment. 

Most recently, the onset of a global pandemic has had a marked impact on the daily lives of people globally and the 
economy at large. While the impact is likely to persist for some time, we are confident to weather the storm. The 
group's focus is on safety, plus leveraging its financial flexibility to continue building a business that grows 
strongly, generates high rates of return and provides employment for thousands over the long term. 

After many years of stock-price outperformance, Naspers now represents an outsized position on the JSE Limited's 
shareholder weighted index (SWIX). To extend the Naspers shareholder base and reduce that outsized position, on 
11 September 2019, Naspers listed its international internet assets on Euronext Amsterdam as Prosus N.V. Prosus 
includes all Naspers's operations and investments outside South Africa in online classifieds, food delivery, payments 
and fintech (financial technology), etail (online retail), travel, education, and social and internet platforms. As 
Europe's most valuable consumer internet company, Prosus gives global internet investors direct access to our portfolio 
of international internet assets, as well as exposure to China, India and other high-growth markets. Prosus also has a 
secondary listing on the JSE Limited (JSE) in South Africa. At the date of listing, Prosus was 73.84% owned by Naspers, 
with a free float of 26.16%. In January 2020, to fulfil an obligation to the South African Reserve Bank to repatriate 
US$1.5bn to South Africa, Naspers sold 22 million shares in Prosus, representing 1.35% of the issued Prosus N ordinary 
shares, to institutional investors for gross proceeds of ?1.5bn (US$1.64bn). Following the disposal, Prosus was 
72.49% owned by Naspers with a free float of 27.51%. Naspers has no intention to sell additional shares of Prosus. 

In ecommerce, all key segments made progress against financial and strategic objectives. The classifieds as well as 
payments and fintech segments have now reached profitability at their core and continue to grow profits, while investing 
to drive growth. Classifieds is expanding considerably faster than many of its peers. Food Delivery was the most significant 
investment area, as we grow the market and our position in it by investing in technology. We are also focusing on building 
first-party delivery capabilities, and city and restaurant reach. To date, this investment has driven order and revenue 
growth in our Food Delivery operations ahead of global peers. We believe Food Delivery fits our strategy, as it addresses 
a major consumer need that can be fundamentally transformed by technology. The progress of our core ecommerce segments, 
which are scaling well, builds confidence in our ability of identifying opportunities to create value. 

Tencent delivered a solid financial performance, particularly in fintech and business services. Its expanding ecosystem 
drives strong user engagement, ahead of local and international peers. This positions Tencent to offer new products and 
services to users. We continue to benefit from the close relationship and partnerships we have established in some of 
our markets.

We ended the financial year facing the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets locking down in March 2020. Our 
priority was the wellbeing of our 20 000 people and the communities we serve around the world. As a global company operating 
in numerous local markets, we take our responsibility seriously. We are helping our people and communities navigate this 
crisis. We donated INR100crore (US$13.1m) to the Indian government's response to the crisis via the Prime Minister's Citizen 
Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund. In addition, at local level, many of our companies have made meaningful 
contributions. Across the group, we continue to identify ways in which our technological expertise, global networks and 
resources can be used to support the fight against this virus. 

We will continue to respond quickly to the evolving situation to safeguard our people, maintain our ability to serve our 
customers and protect our businesses. While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular growth 
trends, the global pandemic has affected operations and we need to draw attention to its potential impacts on 2021's 
financial year. That said, we believe the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong. We have sufficient liquidity to 
run the company and the ability to invest in opportunities that may arise during this period. 

Given the wide geographical span of our operations and significant investments in ecommerce in particular, reported 
earnings are materially impacted by foreign exchange movements and the effects of acquisitions and disposals. Where relevant 
in this report, adjustments have been made for the effects of foreign currencies and acquisitions and disposals. These 
adjustments (pro forma financial information) are quoted in brackets after the equivalent metrics reported under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU). A reconciliation of pro forma financial 
information to the equivalent IFRS-EU metrics is provided elsewhere in these summarised consolidated financial statements.

Financial review
Group revenue, measured on an economic-interest basis, was US$21.5bn, reflecting growth of 17% (23%) from continuing operations.
Measured similarly, and including the stepped-up investment in Food Delivery, group trading profit grew 12% (16%) year on year 
to US$3.8bn. Tencent grew revenues by a healthy 16% (21%) year on year. Driven by classifieds, etail, and payments and fintech, 
the ecommerce business posted strong performance. Overall, revenue growth in ecommerce, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals,
grew 33% in local currency, a 7% acceleration year on year. This was led by the Food Delivery segment, which grew orders 102% 
and revenues by 99% (105%), and strong growth in Classifieds, up 49% (37%). Tencent's profitability improved 17% (22%). 
Trading losses in ecommerce rose to US$918m, reflecting our investment in Food Delivery to grow markets and sustain our leading 
positions. Excluding the increased investments in Food Delivery, and Payments and Fintech as well as acquisitions and disposals, 
ecommerce trading losses reduced by 28% or US$78m in local currency.

Core headline earnings from continuing operations were US$3.4bn ? up 9% (13%). Improving profitability in Tencent and the more 
established ecommerce businesses were partially offset by the additional investment in the Food Delivery business. 

Across the group, we invested US$1.3bn to expand our ecosystem and reach. Notably: through PayU, an investment of US$66m in 
Wibmo to expand our Indian footprint in payment security, mobile payment solutions and processing services; an investment of 
US$163m in PaySense broadens our ecosystem in India as we now start to offer consumer credit; an investment of US$199m in 
Iyzico, a leading payment service provider in Turkey, and US$48m in Red Dot Payment (Red Dot), providing payment solutions 
in Singapore and expanding across Southeast Asia. In Classifieds, we acquired a controlling stake in Frontier Car Group for 
US$320m and the contribution of certain subsidiaries, expanding our transactions business. Ventures invested US$81m in 
Meesho Inc., a leading social commerce online marketplace in India, continuing our successful track record of identifying 
Indian opportunities with the potential to become large businesses. We are also increasing our exposure to the edtech 
(educational technology) businesses by investing a further US$25m and US$44m in our education associates Brainly and Udemy 
respectively. In the Food Delivery business, we invested a further US$100m in our associate Swiggy.

At year-end, we had a solid net cash position of US$4.5bn, comprising US$8.0bn of cash and cash equivalents (including 
short-term cash investments), net of US$3.5bn of interest-bearing debt (excluding capitalised lease liabilities). We also 
have an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. Overall, we recorded net interest expense of US$22m for the year. 
In December 2019, we established a US$6bn global medium-term note programme. In terms of this programme, we may 
periodically issue notes denominated in any currency, with a maximum outstanding aggregate nominal amount of US$6bn. 
The notes trade on the Euronext Dublin stock exchange. Under the programme, in January 2020, we successfully issued 
US$1.250bn 3.68% notes due in 2030. The purpose of this offering was to raise proceeds to redeem the US$1.0bn 6.00% 
notes due in July 2020. The principal and interest accrued to the maturity date of these notes were repaid in February 
2020. The group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

Consolidated free cash outflow was US$338m, compared to the prior-year outflow of US$102m from continuing operations 
(excluding the Video Entertainment segment). This change reflects increased investment in the Food Delivery business, 
as well as negative working-capital effects related primarily to merchant cash timing differences of US$28m and transaction 
costs of unbundling MultiChoice Group and listing Prosus of around US$85m. Dividend income received from Tencent increased 
US$35m to US$377m. Cash extractions from our profitable Classifieds businesses continued to grow, increasing US$70m to 
US$305m. The pandemic may have a short-term impact on that trajectory but, the positive trend is expected to return.

We adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases on a prospective basis. Accordingly, comparative information has 
not been restated. Refer to note 2 for further details.

The company's external auditor has not reviewed or reported on forecasts included in these summarised consolidated 
financial statements.

Unless otherwise stated, the following segmental reviews are prepared on an economic-interest basis (which includes 
consolidated subsidiaries and a proportionate consolidation of associates and joint ventures).

Segmental review
Internet
Internet revenues were US$21.5bn, up 17% (23%). Internet trading profit rose 12% (16%), even as we increased investment 
across the portfolio and particularly in Food Delivery, as many ecommerce units improved their profitability. Tencent 
delivered a solid performance.

Ecommerce
Overall, ecommerce revenue increased 19% (33%) to US$4.3bn, a 7% acceleration year on year. This was led by contributions 
from Classifieds, Payments and Fintech, Food Delivery and Etail.

Trading losses rose to US$918m after increased investment to capture the online food-delivery opportunity and additional 
investments in payments and fintech to expand its footprint and build its credit offering. Excluding these and 
acquisitions and disposals, ecommerce trading losses reduced by 28% or US$78m in local currency, excluding acquisitions 
and disposals. Our investments in the Food Delivery business have already started delivering meaningful scale, evidenced 
by continued strong growth in orders and revenue. Classifieds continued to invest in convenient transactions, resulting 
in increased trading losses in that business as it scales. However, overall profitability in Classifieds improved year 
on year due primarily to continued revenue growth and strong margins at Avito, Central and Eastern Europe, and reduced 
losses in letgo. Overall, Classifieds trading profit increased 1 100% in local currency, excluding acquisitions and 
disposals. Etail reported narrowing trading losses. Growth in PayU's core payment service provider (PSP) businesses 
reduced the trading profit margin from 2% last year to 1% this year. 

Revenues from our profitable ecommerce businesses totalled US$2.3bn, with trading profits of US$402m. Compared to 
US$2.0bn and US$407m last year, this reflects growth in local currency of 18% and 12% respectively.

Classifieds
Building on the momentum from the previous financial year when the core business became profitable, Classifieds 
delivered healthy results while expanding its business model. This is one of the fastest growing classifieds businesses 
globally, with accelerating revenue growth of 49% (37%) to US$1.3bn. Its businesses generated trading profits of US$34m, 
driven by strong revenue growth in listings and margin improvement. 

Convenient transactions revenue was US$393m, compared to US$103m in the prior year, growing 282% (164%) and contributing 
31% of overall Classifieds revenue for the year. We are investing to improve the value proposition for our customers 
by deepening our relationships with partners and the breadth of our offering in autos. Larger markets in Russia and 
Europe drive growth, with strength in autos and real estate verticals, where leading market positions combine with 
operational execution to drive monetisation and successful financial outcomes. In Russia, Avito has maintained good 
momentum, recording revenues of RUB25.7bn, or year-on-year growth of 22%. Avito delivered a trading profit margin of 
51%, with autos and real estate revenue growing 38% and 21% year on year, respectively. Poland remains the cornerstone, 
growing revenues 16% (21%) to US$185m and recording a trading profit margin of 58%. Autos, real estate and business 
services all performed above expectations.

In the convenient transactions business, CashMyCar in India grew revenue 229% in local currency to US$78m, by expanding 
to over 70 inspection centres and more than 21 000 transactions at the end of the period. 

OLX Brazil, our joint venture with Adevinta, improved its financial performance with year-on-year revenue growth of 10% 
(20%), due to vertical strength. 

Competition in general classifieds increased steadily. In 2020, we expanded our ecosystem and offering, while anchoring 
our competitive advantage where possible. This has allowed us to enhance our localised footprint. 

In December 2019, Classifieds increased its shareholding to a majority in Frontier Car Group, enabling synergies and a 
presence in 10 developing countries globally, with more than 450 inspection centres and over 89 000 transactions for 
the financial year. In Russia, the acquisition of MaxPoster in January 2020 (focused on providing business solutions 
to car dealers) deepens product offerings across the autos category. 

On 3 March 2020, OLX Brazil reached an agreement to acquire Grupo Zap, which includes two leading Brazilian real estate 
verticals: Zap and VivaReal. The transaction is subject to approval by the Brazilian competition authorities and is 
expected to close in the second half of 2020. This investment will be financed equally by the joint venture partners.

On 26 March 2020, we announced the merger of our letgo US business with OfferUp, a deal that combines two of the leading 
classifieds brands in the US with complementary footprints. This will give the business a solid foundation in a highly 
competitive market, this transaction received regulatory approval and is expected to close 1 July 2020.

On 26 April 2020, we completed the merger of our subsidiary Dubizzle Limited (BVI), the leading classifieds platform 
for users in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with Emerging Markets Property Group (EMPG). EMPG owns and operates bespoke 
classifieds portals in emerging markets across the world, including Bayut in Dubai, Zameen in Pakistan and Mubawab in 
Morocco, North Africa. The group also contributed cash of some US$75m. Following the transaction, the group will hold 
a 39% interest in EMPG, and account for this interest as an investment in associate.

In mid-March 2020, many of the markets in which we operate entered lockdown. In Classifieds we have seen a decline in 
traffic in marketplaces but have taken steps to assist customers and partners. In the short term, we expect to record 
some impact on revenue and profitability.

Food Delivery
This sector is evolving rapidly, moving from a marketplace model (third-party or 3P) to implementing an own-delivery 
model (first-party or 1P). This is increasing the size of the market and corresponding opportunity. We are at the 
forefront of this transformation and investing heavily in food delivery to grow both the size of the market and our 
position. We invest in product and technology innovation, including logistics, convenience and grocery delivery, cloud 
kitchens and private brands. We are also investing in technology, which is significantly improving consumer targeting 
to optimise customer acquisition and marketing costs while improving 1P economics by smartly routing delivery 
representatives to points of highest demand density. We anticipate further opportunity in this market which will be 
disrupted by technology. Our investment in the Food Delivery business has meaningful scale, as evidenced by continued 
growth in orders and revenue.

In the current year, this segment grew rapidly and is now one of the fastest-growing platforms globally, producing 
cumulative annualised gross merchandise value (GMV) growth of 76% year on year. Segment revenue increased 99% (105%), 
with strong contributions from our entire portfolio. Trading losses rose to US$624m from US$171m, reflecting continued 
investments in growth by the respective businesses. 

In Latin America, iFood posted revenue growth of 94% (113%), as a result of product innovation and the growth of its 
logistics business. iFood remains the clear leader in Brazil and holds competitive positions in Mexico and Colombia. 
In March 2020, iFood Brazil supported a network of 160 000 active restaurants and processed 31 million orders, 
compared to 17 million last year. iFood Brazil has ramped up its own-delivery business, and 1P orders now exceed 
30% of orders and the total volume of the nearest 1P competitor. In April 2020, we announced that iFood would join 
forces with Delivery Hero in Colombia. iFood will retain a 51% share and operate the combined business, Domicilios.com.

In India, Swiggy's revenue grew 182% year on year, driven by expansion into new cities. Swiggy now operates in over 
520 cities and supports more than 160 000 restaurant partners, up from 85 000 a year ago. We invested an additional 
US$100m in Swiggy in February 2020 to support its business growth, increasing our already substantial commitment 
in India. 

For the year ended 31 December 2019, Delivery Hero reported segmental revenue growth of 109% and order volume 
growth of 80%. GMV grew 66% year on year in constant currency to ?7.4bn, primarily due to faster delivery times, 
efficiencies in customer acquisition and increased order frequency following investments to improve product and 
technology. Delivery Hero engaged in M&A and portfolio consolidation during the year, like the acquisition of shares 
in South Korean Woowa Brothers Corp., and the incorporation of a joint venture to consolidate their footprint in 
the region. Delivery Hero has also restructured its German operations, disposing of its food-delivery business to 
Takeaway.com N.V. for cash and an equity stake in Takeaway. More information on Delivery Hero's results is available 
at https://ir.deliveryhero.com. 

The lockdown state in many of our markets affected the Food Delivery business. While our platforms are recording 
increased demand, we have not always been able to meet demand due to supply issues as restaurants closed. In India, 
Swiggy has been permitted to continue operating during the lockdown, but this was not implemented uniformly across the 
country and Swiggy's services have been halted in some regions. It is engaging with national and regional authorities 
in India. In Brazil, iFood's efforts to assist its restaurant and food-delivery partners have mitigated some supply 
issues and order volume is holding up well. In the longer term, we believe the current environment may drive a 
structural shift in global consumption patterns in favour of food delivery.

Payments and Fintech
PayU's revenue grew 19% (21%) year on year, on the back of 26% (29%) higher volumes processed. Processed volumes reached 
US$37.9bn, driven by 30% growth in the number of transactions processed. The Payments and Fintech business's trading loss 
margin increased from 12% last year to 16%. This reflected improvement in profitability in the core PSP business, offset 
by investment to build a credit offering, primarily in India, and expanding our footprint in Southeast Asia with the 
Red Dot acquisition.

The payments business in India remains the growth engine, with volumes growing 30% (32%). In 2020, India's processed 
volumes were US$19.4bn, 51% of the total volume processed by PayU. Structural shifts to digital payments in the country, 
our ability to increase conversion rates for enterprise merchants, and our ability to enter new segments such as billing 
and small/medium-sized businesses, have been the main drivers of this growth at market rates.

In July 2019, we acquired Wibmo (a payment security leader) and also created closer partnerships with leading banks to 
reduce transaction failures and further strengthen our relationship with merchants.

In line with PayU's mission to build a world without financial borders, we have been pioneering credit for underbanked 
people in India. We started building an inhouse credit business two years ago and organically scaled this to over US$10m 
monthly issuances. We recently acquired a majority stake of 79.2% in PaySense for US$163m. PayU is setting the ambitious 
goal of building a strong credit franchise in India. While we believe the expansion of our credit business over time 
offers significant potential, it is important that we build the loan book methodically, with acceptable loss rates. We 
have temporarily paused due to the global pandemic. 

In mid-March 2020, our Payments and Fintech business began to be impacted by lockdowns in markets in which we operate. 
It is still too early to estimate the full impact although we have seen a significant initial drop in transaction volumes 
in payments. India represents over 50% of the Payments and Fintech business's transaction volumes. In time, this business 
is expected to benefit from large sectoral trends, including more customers transacting online and more online transactions 
being executed through alternative forms of payment (other than cash). Our European businesses appear resilient and continued 
to grow during the pandemic, although that could change if the broader economic environment deteriorates further. 

In December 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 90% interest in Iyzico for around US$199m to consolidate our position 
in Turkey's high-growth ecommerce market. Turkey is now our second-largest market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa 
region. On integration, PayU will be able to leverage existing relationships with global merchants and Iyzico's product 
capabilities to drive incremental cross-border volume.

We also added the South Asia market to our footprint by acquiring a majority in Red Dot, based in Singapore. Southeast 
Asia is an attractive base to enter one of the most dynamic markets globally, with ecommerce growth (62% CAGR 2015-19) 
and a high share of alternative payment methods (70% of ecommerce). This transaction gives us access to local 
payment-processing capabilities, supporting our merchants' expectations, and provides unique payment solutions particularly 
for the hotel and hospitality segment. We have integrated Red Dot into our global hub to offer all existing merchants access 
to the Southeast Asia market. 

Etail
The Etail segment accelerated revenue growth to 16% year on year, measured in local currency and adjusted for the disposal 
of Flipkart. On the same basis, the segment also improved profitability, reducing its trading losses by economies of scale 
such as higher gross margins and fixed cost control.

eMAG, our leading business-to-consumer (B2C) platform in Central and Eastern Europe, continued to outpace market growth 
and improve its economics over the review period. Organic revenue growth reached 16% and trading profit increased 35%. 
eMAG's core market, Romania, realised 17% GMV growth in local currency. Performance was particularly strong across the 
3P marketplace, which grew 26% in local currency. In Hungary, eMAG's second-largest market, the business delivered GMV 
growth of 25% in local currency. Both the retail and marketplace businesses contributed meaningfully to eMAG Hungary's 
results. 

eMAG's main market, Romania, entered lockdown on 26 March 2020, but the business is holding up well. It recorded a boost 
in the early stages of the lockdown as customers shifted to online purchasing. While the rate of growth is likely to subside 
over time, we believe the pandemic may prove an accelerator in the structural shift to ecommerce. 

In October 2019, the Hungarian competition authority approved the merger of eMAG Hungary with eDigital, two leading online 
retailers. This combination expands eMAG's product offering to consumers and brings in the experienced and talented 
eDigital founders, who will lead the merged business.

Travel
In April 2019, we announced the exchange of our 43% interest in MakeMyTrip, our equity-accounted online travel investment 
in India, for a 5.6% interest in Trip.com Group Limited (formerly Ctrip.com International Limited) (Trip.com). The transaction 
closed at the end of August 2019, resulting in a gain of US$599m. Our share of MakeMyTrip's reported revenues was US$146m, 
up 8% (measured in local currency, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals).

We include eight months of results for MakeMyTrip in our segmental results, representing our share of its earnings for 
the period up to disposal and a catch-up of the lag period applied in reporting its results. On a similar basis, trading 
losses in the Travel segment (measured in local currency, adjusted for acquisitions and disposals) increased 21% year on 
year. After the Trip.com transaction, our Travel segment will cease to exist and will not be reported on after this 
financial year. The investment in Trip.com is accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income. More information 
on MakeMyTrip's results is available at http://investors.makemytrip.com.

Tencent
For the year ended 31 December 2019, Tencent's revenue of RMB377bn was up 21% year on year. Non-GAAP profit attributable 
to shareholders (Tencent's measure of normalised performance) grew 22% to RMB94bn.

Revenues from value-added services increased 13% to RMB200bn, with online games revenues growing 10% to RMB115bn and social 
networks revenues rising 17% to RMB85bn. Revenues from fintech and business services increased 39% to RMB101bn, and revenues 
from the online advertising business rose 18% to RMB68bn.

Tencent continued to lead in China, with nine of the top 20 mobile apps. Combined monthly active users (MAU) of Weixin and 
WeChat increased 6% to 1.16 billion. The Weixin mini program ecosystem became increasingly vibrant, with an annual 
transaction volume of over RMB800bn. With enhanced chat and friend recommendation features, as well as entertainment use 
cases via mini programs, QQ's popularity with the younger generation continues to increase. However, QQ smart devices' MAU 
declined 7.5% year on year to 647 million as Tencent proactively cleaned up spamming and bot accounts. 

China's online games market recovered after in-game monetisation licence approvals resumed in December 2018. Tencent 
extended its leadership. It has also made breakthroughs in self-developed games for international markets, with five of 
the top 10 international mobile games. Tencent's international revenue rose to 23% of total online games revenue in the 
fourth quarter of 2019.

Tencent currently operates the largest mobile payment platform in China by daily active users (DAU) and transaction volumes. 
Daily commercial payment transactions exceeded 1 billion as Tencent deepened penetration among offline merchants. In cloud, 
Tencent has over 1 million paying customers and outgrows peers with increasing scale and higher operating efficiency.

Despite the challenging economic environment, Tencent achieved robust advertising revenue growth by progressively realising 
the potential of Weixin Moments and expanding its mobile ad network. Tencent video subscriptions exceeded 100 million. 
Music subscription accelerated as it benefited from the pay-for-streaming model. 

Tencent continues to grow off a very large base in a market that appears to be emerging well from the impact of Covid-19. 
It has been working relentlessly to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. Tencent has steered its engineering scale and 
product suite to help the government and businesses navigate and recover from the impacts of Covid-19. This has benefited 
millions of enterprises that used WeChat for Work to resume operations in the wake of the outbreak. Over 300 million Weixin 
users have used Tencent Health as an access point for real-time pandemic data, online consultations and self-diagnosis 
services powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Through Tencent Medipedia, users can access professional medical information. 
Tencent has also provided medical AI imaging capabilities to assist the diagnosis of Covid-19. Its operational performance 
has remained resilient through the crisis, underpinning the value of its diverse portfolio and broad ecosystem.

More information on Tencent's results is available at www.tencent.com/en-us/ir.

Mail.ru
For the year ended 31 December 2019, Mail.ru's revenues grew 22% to RUB87.1bn. Non-GAAP EBITDA (Mail.ru's measure of 
normalised performance) grew 10% to RUB29.8bn. Advertising revenue rose 23% to RUB36.5bn. This was driven by user and 
user engagement growth, increased inventory of video advertisements and contextual targeting advertisements, and technology 
advancements in its advertising platforms. 

Online games revenue grew 20% to RUB28bn. International revenues accounted for 68% of online games revenue.

Mail.ru is leveraging its leadership in the social and communications segment to build social ecommerce and online-to-offline 
(O2O) verticals that complement its user experience. A transformational AliExpress Russia joint venture between Mail.ru, 
Alibaba, MegaFon and Russian Direct Investment Fund was launched. This integrates Mail.ru's cross-border ecommerce platform, 
Pandao, with Alibaba's AliExpress and Tmall services in Russia. In December 2019, Sberbank and Mail.ru formed a Russian O2O 
services platform joint venture, focusing on food technology and mobility. Mail.ru contributed its food-delivery business, 
Delivery Club, and a 29.67% stake in Citymobil, Russia's second-largest taxi application, to the new entity.

As a long-term investor in Russian digital businesses, we continue to monitor proposed legislation that would potentially
limit foreign ownership of businesses in Russia that are defined as significant information resources. As a long-standing 
participant in the country, we have stayed the course through various business cycles, up and down. We remain confident 
of a continued favourable disposition to our investment in the country.

Prospects
We anticipate a time when Covid-19 will no longer have the impact on the global economy it has today. We hope to emerge 
from the global pandemic stronger.

Until then, we face these challenges from a position of relative financial strength. We closed our financial year on 
31 March 2020 with US$4.5bn in net cash and a US$2.5bn undrawn revolving credit facility; with accelerating growth in 
our ecommerce portfolio; and improved profitability. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to run the company, while 
investing in opportunities that may arise during this period. 

Our focus will remain on driving profitability in our more-established ecommerce segments, such as the classified 
markets and PSP business in the payment and fintech segment. We will invest substantially in food delivery, as well 
as the convenient transaction model in classifieds and credit in payments. Our strong balance sheet provides a basis 
for driving growth and unlocks new opportunities. We will also improve the competitiveness of our platforms by investing 
in tech and product, and reinforcing our AI capabilities.

All our operations have business continuity plans in place. We are assessing potential impacts and supporting our 
businesses. The challenges of Covid-19 will vary by sector and geography, but we have the teams, the resources and the 
experience required to navigate them.

Risks
Our risk management and compliance processes provide the board with periodic and holistic overviews and understanding 
of key risks and their management. Businesses are required to apply a methodical approach to governing risks and 
opportunities, so that risks and opportunities are governed as intended and desired outcomes are achieved. The principal 
risks faced by the group are categorised as financial capital, human capital, manufactured capital, intellectual 
capital, social and relationship capital, and natural capital. Specific risks and uncertainties appear in the annual 
report under the section Managing risks and opportunities, which will be available on the Prosus website on 29 June 2020. 
The annual report describes these risk categories and individual risks (including measures in response to those risks) 
that could have a material adverse effect on Prosus's financial position and results. In addition, the annual report, 
under the section Responding to Covid-19, sets out our response to the pandemic that affected the latter part of the 
year ended 31 March 2020 and has been identified as a new risk affecting the group.

Additional risks not known to Prosus, or currently believed not to be material, could later turn out to have a material 
impact on our business, objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity or capital resources. 

Directorate
The directorate of the company substantially mirrors that of its holding company, Naspers Limited. The board of 
directors is a one-tier structure, comprising both executive and non-executive directors.

The executive directors, Bob van Dijk (chief executive) and Basil Sgourdos (chief financial officer), were appointed 
from 16 May 2019. The non-executive directors, namely Koos Bekker (chair), Emilie Choi, Hendrik du Toit, Craig Enenstein, 
Don Eriksson, Rachel Jafta, Nolo Letele, Debra Meyer, Roberto Oliveira de Lima, Steve Pacak, Fred Phaswana (lead 
independent director), Mark Sorour, Cobus Stofberg and Ben van der Ross were appointed from 14 August 2019.

From 31 March 2020, our non-executive director and lead independent director, Fred Phaswana retired from the board. 
Fred Phaswana served on the Prosus board and acted as lead independent director since August 2019. He was a director of 
Naspers Limited and various group structures. He was also a member of the Prosus human resources and remuneration, and 
nomination committees. The board thanks him for his superb commitment to the Naspers group over many years ? his 
unique contributions were highly valued and will be missed. From 1 April 2020, Hendrik du Toit, an independent 
non-executive director, was appointed lead independent director. 

In addition, from 24 April 2020, Ben van der Ross, independent non-executive director, stepped down from the 
audit and risk committees and was appointed to the social, ethics and sustainability committee. The board thanks him 
for his valuable contribution over many years to the audit and risk committees.

The appointment of Manisha Girotra as an independent non-executive director was confirmed on 1 October 2019. 
Ms Girotra also serves as a member of the audit committee. 

As announced on 29 April 2020, the board will nominate Ying Xu for appointment as an independent non-executive director 
of Prosus at the upcoming annual general meeting.

Dividend number 1
(All figures in euro cents unless stated otherwise.) 

The board recommends that shareholders are entitled to a gross payment, in the form of a capital repayment, of 
11 euro cents per listed N ordinary share. Holders of A1 ordinary shares will receive a dividend distribution of 
0.602 euro cent per share. Furthermore, the board recommends that holders of N ordinary shares as at 23 October 2020 
(the dividend record date) who do not wish to receive a capital repayment can make a choice to receive a dividend 
instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out of the other option. If confirmed by shareholders at the virtual 
annual general meeting on 18 August 2020, elections to receive a dividend instead of a capital repayment will need 
to be made by holders of N ordinary shares by 9 November 2020. Capital repayments and dividends will be payable to 
shareholders recorded in the books on the dividend record date and paid on 17 November 2020. 

Capital repayments will be paid from share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No dividend tax will be withheld on the 
amounts of capital reductions paid to shareholders. 

Shareholders electing to receive a dividend will receive a dividend declared from retained earnings. Dividends will 
be subject to the Dutch dividend tax rate of 15% to those shareholders not exempt from dividend withholding tax and 
to those shareholders who are not entitled to a reduced dividend withholding tax rate. 

Dividends payable to shareholders who elect to receive a dividend and who hold their listed N ordinary share through 
the listing of the company on the JSE will, in addition to the Dutch dividend withholding, be subject to South African 
dividend tax at a rate of up to 20%. The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable will be calculated 
by deducting from the 20% South African dividend tax otherwise due, a rebate equal to the Dutch dividends tax paid 
in respect of the dividend (without any right of recovery). Those shareholders, unless exempt from paying dividend 
tax or entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty, will be subject to a 
maximum of 20% total dividend ta

The issued ordinary share capital as at 29 June 2020 was 1 624 652 070 N ordinary shares and 3 511 818 A1 ordinary shares.

(1) Relates to MultiChoice Africa and Irdeto which were disposed of to Naspers, who subsequently distributed their Video 
    Entertainment business to their shareholders in February 2019 through a listing on the JSE Limited stock exchange (refer 
    to note 4). Non-controlling interests shared in the losses of these entities.

(3) The current year relates mainly to the put option liabilities raised from the existing control business combination 
    reserve of US$137.5m. The group's various disposals and other transactions with non-controlling interest resulted in the 
    realisation of reserves to retained earnings of US$9.6m and non-controlling interest of US$228.5m. In the prior year the 
    settlement of put option liabilities and transactions with non-controlling interest amounted to US$924.9m.

    (2019: US$439.4m), the recycling of share-based compensation reserve of US$173.6m (2019: US$44.8m) on the vesting of the 
    share options and existing business combination reserves of US$7.1m (2019: US$nil).

Notes to the summarised consolidated financial statements
1.  General information
    Prosus N.V. (Prosus or the group) (formerly Myriad International Holdings N.V.) is a public company with limited liability 
    (naamloze vennootschap) incorporated under Dutch law, with its registered head office located at Symphony Offices, 
    Gustav Mahlerplein 5, 1082 MS Amsterdam, The Netherlands, (registered in the Dutch commercial register under number 34099856). 
    Prosus is a subsidiary of Naspers Limited (Naspers), a company incorporated in South Africa. On 11 September 2019, Prosus 
    was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange, with a secondary listing on the JSE Limited stock exchange (JSE) 
    in South Africa.

    The Prosus group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.
    Operating and investing in countries and markets across the world with long-term growth potential, Prosus builds leading
    companies that empower people and enrich communities. The group operates and partners with a number of leading internet
    businesses across the Americas, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Asia in sectors including online classifieds, food
    delivery, payments and fintech, travel, education, health, and social and internet platforms. The summarised consolidated
    financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 have been authorised for issue by the board of directors on 
    29 June 2020.

2.  Basis of presentation and accounting policies
    Information on the summarised consolidated financial statements
    The summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies as
    applied by Prosus and consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
    31 March 2020. The summarised consolidated financial statements contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim 
    Financial Reporting (IAS 34) with the exception of IAS 34.56 and accordingly, the financial information for the second 
    half of the current year is not presented separately. These summarised consolidated financial statements do not 
    constitute the full financial statements within the meaning of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
    
    The summarised consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosures required for complete
    consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
    by the European Union (IFRS-EU). All amounts disclosed are in millions of US dollar (US$'m), unless otherwise stated. 
    The summarised financial information included in these financial statements are derived from the consolidated financial 
    statements as included in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2020. The summarised financial statements should 
    be read in conjunction with the annual report that has been authorised for issue and is available on the Prosus website
    https://www.prosus.com.

    The summarised consolidated financial statements presented here report earnings per share, diluted earnings per
    share, headline earnings per share and core headline earnings per share (collectively referred to as earnings per share).
    These are calculated as the relationship of the number of ordinary shares of Prosus issued as at 31 March 2020, to the net
    profit, headline earnings and core headline earnings attributable to the shareholders of Prosus. Earnings per share are
    also reported for the prior reporting period, based on the same shares issued. This is applied as the actual change in
    shares issued (including redenomination) in the period only represents a capitalisation and/or share split without the
    receipt of any consideration for the shares issued. Pursuant to the listing, the group issued 438 656 059 N ordinary
    shares and 1 059 213 A ordinary shares to shareholders. As the MIH Ming He Holdings Limited (Ming He) acquisition is 
    already reflected as from the transition date onwards, the actual share issuance is considered a capitalisation without
    consideration received.

    Operating segments
    The group's operating segments reflect the components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating
    decisionmaker as defined in note 39 ""Segment information"" in the consolidated financial statements. The group
    proportionately consolidates its share of the results of its associates and joint ventures in its operating segments.

    Going concern
    The summarised consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis. Based on forecasts and
    available cash resources, the group has adequate resources to continue operations as a going concern in the foreseeable
    future. As at 31 March 2020, the group recorded US$8.03bn in net cash, comprising US$4.18bn of cash and cash equivalents 
    and US$3.87bn in short-term cash investments. The group had US$3.52bn of interest-bearing debt (excluding capitalised lease
    liabilities) and an undrawn US$2.5bn revolving credit facility. 
    
    In assessing going concern, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the group's operations and liquidity was
    considered in preparing the forecasts. The board is of the opinion that the group has sufficient financial flexibility 
    given its low gearing and very strong liquidity position at 31 March 2020 to negate the expected negative effects that 
    could result from the Covid-19 impact on the group's businesses in the year subsequent to the date of these 
    financial statements.

    First-time consolidated financial statements of Prosus
    Up until 11 September 2019, Prosus was exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements as it was an unlisted,
    wholly owned subsidiary of Naspers. As a consequence, Prosus was able to apply the consolidation exemption following
    Article 408 of the Dutch Civil Code and the requirements from this Article. 
    
    For purposes of the listing, Combined Carve-out Financial Statements were prepared for the combined Prosus group
    under IFRS-EU for the year ended 31 March 2019 (including 2018 and 2017 as comparatives), and for the quarter ended 
    30 June 2019 (including 2018 comparatives), in accordance with the requirements of IAS 34. The annual Combined Carve-out
    Financial Statements and interim Combined Carve-out Financial Statements are hereinafter referred to as the Combined 
    Carve-out Financial Statements. These Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, which were published for the purpose of 
    the listing of Prosus in the listing prospectus, are available, along with the listing prospectus itself, on the 
    Prosus website.
    
    For reporting periods beginning 1 April 2019, Prosus, as the legal parent of the group, prepared consolidated
    financial statements based on applicable Dutch and European Union law, including relevant comparative financial 
    information, which are different in comparison with the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. In the consolidated 
    financial statements for the 2019 financial year, the income statement does not include certain corporate allocations 
    which were included in the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. Also, the consolidated financial statements include 
    the assets and liabilities, income statement and cash flows of certain businesses of the Video Entertainment business 
    until its disposal on 28 September 2018, which were excluded from the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. A further 
    explanation and reconciliation of these differences is included in the other information section of these summarised 
    consolidated financial statements.

    Formation of the Prosus group
    In preparation for the listing of the Prosus group, Naspers completed a series of corporate restructurings to form
    the group (comprising of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures) with Prosus as its legal parent. Historically,
    Prosus was an investment holding company, which held the Naspers international ecommerce and internet businesses, 
    as well as its sub-Saharan African Video Entertainment business. Its former parent company, Ming He, indirectly 
    held Naspers's investment in Tencent Holdings Limited. The main restructurings are as follows:
    - On 28 September 2018, Prosus distributed its interest in certain businesses of the Video Entertainment business to
      Ming He, which then distributed it to its parent, MIH Holdings Proprietary Limited (MIHH). Subsequent to this
      distribution, the Video Entertainment business was listed on the JSE Limited stock exchange.
    - On 1 June 2019, through a capital contribution in kind in return for N and A ordinary shares, Prosus acquired the
      business of Ming He via the acquisition of MIH Services FZ LLC, various receivables to its intermediate parent MIHH 
      and the shares and related activities in Ming He (the Ming He acquisition), as passed on to Prosus's subsidiary Myriad
      International Holdings Asia B.V. As a result, Prosus then indirectly held Naspers's investment in Tencent Holdings Limited.

    In respect of the distribution of the Video Entertainment business, the company has distributed this business to its
    direct shareholder as a common control transaction at book value, which is in line with the group's accounting policies.
    
    In respect of the Ming He acquisition, Prosus management considers this acquisition as a transaction under common
    control. Prosus management accounted for this transaction using the predecessor (book value) accounting method, where 
    this book value is derived from the book value captured in the consolidated financial statements of its ultimate parent,
    Naspers. This transaction contributed US$0.9m in trade and other receivables, US$16.5bn investments in associates, 
    US$44.3m of cash and cash equivalents and US$4.9m in liabilities as of 1 April 2018. It also applied the option of presenting
    comparative information if the relevant activities, assets and liabilities and cash flows had always been part of the
    Prosus group. This method allows a consistent presentation of prior-period financial information in these summarised
    consolidated financial statements and aligns such information as presented in the parent's financial statements.
    
    First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
    Prosus existed as a company prior to 1 April 2018. It consists of Prosus and its direct and indirect subsidiaries,
    associated companies and joint ventures. Prosus did not previously prepare consolidated financial statements. As of the
    financial year ending 31 March 2020, Prosus has prepared consolidated financial statements based on IFRS-EU. Therefore,
    these summarised consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of
    International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 1). The transition date to IFRS is 1 April 2018. The summarised
    consolidated financial results presented here are based on uniform IFRS-EU accounting policies. As consolidated financial
    statements were not previously required to be prepared for the Prosus group, the reconciliations with those envisaged 
    pursuant to IFRS 1.24 are not required. Accordingly, the comparative summarised consolidated statement of financial 
    position as at 1 April 2018 is presented as part of these summarised consolidated financial statements for the year 
    ended 31 March 2020.
    
    As permitted under IFRS 1.18 and in conjunction with IFRS 1 Appendix D16a, Prosus has used the carrying amounts
    presented in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Naspers. Such carrying amounts also represent the application 
    of IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively for acquisitions made by Prosus before the date of transition. Other than
    that, none of the exemptions provided for in IFRS 1 were used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the
    Prosus group. The group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) with effect from 1 April 2019, consistent with the approach
    by Naspers and the requirements in IFRS 1 Appendix D16a. We refer to new accounting pronouncements set out below.

    New accounting pronouncements
    The group has adopted all new and amended accounting pronouncements that are relevant to its operations and that are
    effective for financial years commencing 1 April 2019. The impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements is outlined
    below and includes, significantly, the first-time application of IFRS 16 with effect from 1 April 2019. A number of
    other pronouncements were also effective from 1 April 2019, but did not have a significant effect on the group's summarised
    consolidated financial statements.

    IFRS 16 Leases 
    IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases (IAS 17) and IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease (IFRIC 4) and
    outlines the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. In terms of IFRS 16,
    the group now recognises all leases (with limited exceptions) as right-of-use assets and obligations to make lease
    payments (lease obligations) in the statement of financial position whereas previously lease payments relating to 
    arrangements classified as operating leases in terms of IAS 17 were expensed on a straight-line basis in the 
    income statement.
    
    In accordance with IFRS 16, lease payments are allocated between lease obligations and finance costs. The
    corresponding lease obligations, net of finance costs, are included in long-term liabilities or the current portion of 
    long-term liabilities. The interest element of lease payments is charged to the income statement over the relevant 
    lease term. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the relevant right-of-use asset's estimated useful 
    life and the lease term, on a straight-line basis.
    
    The group has applied IFRS 16 on a prospective basis with effect from 1 April 2019 and has therefore not restated the
    comparative information contained in these summarised consolidated financial statements. On transition to IFRS 16,
    lease liabilities were measured at the present value of remaining lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing
    rate as at 1 April 2019. The right-of-use assets recognised on 1 April 2019 were measured at an amount equal to the lease
    liability adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments and onerous contracts provision. There was no adjustment to
    the group's opening balance to retained earnings on 1 April 2019.

    The group has applied the following practical expedients:
    - The group did not reassess whether contracts contained leases and accordingly the previous classifications applied
      to these contracts in terms of IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were retained (ie the accounting for contracts not previously
      identified as leases was sustained).
    - Operating leases of which the underlying assets were of low value were not recognised as right-of-use assets and
      obligations to make lease payments in the statement of financial position - the existing accounting for these leases 
      was sustained (ie lease payments continue to be expensed on a straight-line basis for these leases).
    - Where appropriate, the group applied a single incremental borrowing rate to a portfolio of leases and onerous
      contract provisions with reasonably similar characteristics. 
    - The group relied on its existing onerous lease contract assessments as an alternative to performing impairment
      reviews on right-of-use assets as at 1 April 2019 and recognised all existing provisions for onerous leases as 
      adjustments to the relevant right-of-use assets as at 1 April 2019.
    - Operating leases under which the lease terms end within 12 months (short-term leases) of 1 April 2019 are accounted
      for as short-term leases (ie lease payments continue to be expensed on a straight-line basis for these leases).
    - The group excluded any initial direct costs from the measurement of right-of-use assets as at 1 April 2019. 
    - The carrying amounts of leased assets and lease obligations relating to leases that were classified as finance
      leases in terms of IAS 17 were treated as the carrying amounts of the right-of-use assets and lease obligations for 
      purposes of IFRS 16 immediately before the date of transition (ie as at 31 March 2019).
    - The group applied hindsight in determining the lease terms for contracts that contain extension and termination
      options. 

    On transition to IFRS 16, the group recognised right-of-use assets of US$193.3m and lease obligations of US$186.2m.
    The difference related primarily to pre-existing onerous lease provisions and prepaid or accrued lease payments that were
    adjusted to the carrying value of the relevant underlying right-of-use assets. Apart from leases of assets of low value
    and short-term leases, lease obligations and right-of-use assets have been measured by discounting lease payments
    (including those arising under extension options where relevant) using the relevant lease's incremental borrowing rate 
    as at 1 April 2019. The weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities was 3.3%.
    
    The group presents right-of-use assets in ""Property, plant and equipment"" and capitalised lease liabilities in the
    statement of financial position. Interest on lease liabilities is included in ""Interest expense"" in the income statement
    and included in the ""Cash flows from operating activities"" in the statement of cash flows.
    
    The group's leasing arrangements relate primarily to office buildings, warehouse space, equipment and motor vehicles.
    Lease agreements are generally entered into for fixed periods of between two and 10 years, depending on the nature of
    the underlying asset being leased. Leasing arrangements may contain extension and/or termination options that are
    exercisable by the group. In determining the lease term for arrangements that contain extension and/or termination 
    options the group considers all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive to exercise an extension 
    and/or not exercise a termination option. The leases do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used 
    as security for borrowing purposes. 
    
    In the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2019, the group disclosed the operating
    lease commitments in terms of IAS 17 on an undiscounted basis. The impact on transition to IFRS 16 provides a
    reconciliation of the lease commitments disclosed under IAS 17 as at 31 March 2019 to the lease liability recognised on 
    a discounted basis using the weighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 April 2019. The impact on the financial 
    statements on transition to IFRS 16 is detailed below:

    (2) Refers to share-based incentives settled in equity instruments of the Naspers group, where the 
        Prosus group has no obligation to settle the awards with participants, ie they are settled by Naspers.

    On 24 April 2020, the Naspers Limited board approved a prospective change in the settlement mechanism for the group's
    share appreciation rights (SAR) plans from settlement in Naspers N ordinary shares to using cash resources for
    settlement. Accordingly, going forward these plans will be classified as cash-settled share-based payment expenses at 
    both Prosus and Naspers. The change in settlement mechanism had no impact on the Prosus consolidated accounts, however, 
    the CODM will review share-based incentives on a cash-settled basis for both Naspers Limited and Prosus N.V. going 
    forward. The cash-settled charge will therefore be included in the groups trading profit going forward.

4.  Loss from discontinued operations
    In September 2018, the group disposed of its sub-Saharan African Video Entertainment business, which was subsequently
    listed and distributed by the Naspers group to its shareholders in an unbundling transaction in February 2019. The
    segment offered digital satellite and digital terrestrial television services to subscribers as well as mobile and internet
    services through MultiChoice Africa in sub-Saharan Africa. Through Irdeto, the business provided digital content
    management and protection systems to customers globally to protect, manage and also monetise digital media on any platform.
    These businesses represented a separate line of business and were classified as the Video Entertainment segment. The
    results and cash flows of the group's Video Entertainment segment have been presented as discontinued operations in these
    summarised consolidated financial statements. Discontinued operations also includes the group's subscription video-on-demand
    service in Poland which was closed at the end of January 2019 and which formed part of the Video Entertainment segment.

    The loss and cash flows from discontinued operations are detailed in the table below:

5.  Headline and core headline earnings 
    Headline earnings
    Headline earnings represent net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the group, excluding certain
    defined separately identifiable remeasurements relating to, among others, impairments of tangible assets, intangible
    assets (including goodwill) and equity-accounted investments, gains or losses on acquisitions and disposals of investments
    as well as assets, dilution gains or losses on equity-accounted investments, remeasurement gains or losses on disposal
    groups classified as held for sale and remeasurements included in equity-accounted earnings, net of related taxes (both
    current and deferred) and the related non-controlling interests. These remeasurements are determined in accordance with
    Circular 1/2019, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, pursuant to the
    JSE Listings Requirements.

    Core headline earnings
    Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period, excluding certain
    non-operating items. Specifically, headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline
    earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where there is no cash cost to the company. 
    These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain 
    share-based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income 
    recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred tax assets, as this generally relates to multiple prior periods 
    and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments (including put option 
    liabilities) and unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating 
    performance; (iv) once-off gains or losses (including acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and 
    disposals of businesses, as these items relate to changes in the composition of the group and are not reflective of 
    its underlying operating performance; (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business combinations, 
    and acquisitions and (vi) donations made to various governments in assisting with the Covid-19 pandemic, as these 
    expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments are made to the earnings of businesses controlled 
    by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent that the 
    information is available.

    Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on 31 December or more frequently if there is a change in circumstance 
    that indicates that it might be impaired. The group reassessed its 10-year budgets and forecasts by adjusting cash 
    flow projections and budgets to include the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The group also updated its discount 
    rates where required. These adjustments took into account the impact of the pandemic on revenue and margins as well 
    as the periods of interruptions to business operations as a result of lockdown trading restrictions. Covid-19 has had 
    a broad impact on the group, with the restrictions impacting some businesses negatively where they are unable to operate 
    and on the other hand, having a positive impact on the group's major business operations where online services and sale 
    of goods is the primary solution for social distancing measures imposed. An impairment loss of US$9.6m (2019: US$6.4m) 
    recognised as at 31 March 2020 takes into account the impact of the pandemic on the group and its cash-generating 
    units which is the group's best estimate amidst this current uncertain economic environment. Estimating the future 
    performance of the group's cash-generating units is challenging during this pandemic. As circumstances change and/or 
    information becomes available, the group may be required to recognise impairments in future periods. The goodwill 
    impairment relates to the group's Classifieds business.

10. Commitments and contingent liabilities
    Commitments relate to amounts for which the group has contracted, but that have not yet been recognised as
    obligations in the statement of financial position.

                                                                                       2020       2019

    (1) The significant decrease in the current year is as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases. Refer to note 2 
        for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements during the reporting period.                          

    The group operates a number of businesses in jurisdictions where taxes are payable on certain transactions or
    payments. The group continues to seek relevant advice and works with its advisers to identify and quantify such 
    tax exposures. The group has an uncertain tax position of US$170.8m (2019: US$177.0m) related to amounts receivable 
    from tax authorities.

    In October 2019 the group concluded the merger of Dante International Korl?tolt Feleloss?gu T?rsas?g (eMAG Hungary),
    its Hungarian operations with operations of Ed Group Vagyonkezelo Korl?tolt Felelossegu T?rsas?g (Extreme Digital), 
    one of the leading marketers in Hungary. The group contributed the operations of its subsidiary eMAG Hungary as well as
    US$1m cash with an aggregate value of US$13m. Following the merger, eMAG is the majority shareholder, with an effective
    interest of 52% in the newly merged entity. The group accounted for the acquisition of its interest in Extreme Digital 
    as a business combination and recognised an investment in subsidiary. The purchase price allocation: intangible assets
    US$21m; property, plant and equipment US$8m; other assets US$1m; liabilities US$9m; and the balance of US$4m to goodwill. 
    The main intangible assets recognised in the business combination were customer relationships and brand names. The
    transaction gave rise to the recognition of non-controlling interest of US$11m, which has been measured at the 
    non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of Extreme Digital as at the acquisition date. 

    The group has a put option arrangement with the non-controlling interest exercisable at specified future dates or
    upon termination of employment of the non-controlling interest. The settlement of the put option arrangement is in cash or
    shares at the group's discretion. The portion of the put option linked to employment is accounted for as a cash-settled
    share-based compensation arrangement over the employment period. At acquisition, the cash-settled liability for this
    arrangement amounted to US$9m.

    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is Extreme Digital's market presence and
    engineering capabilities. The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

    effective and fully diluted interest in Iyzi ?deme ve Elektronik Para Hizmetleri Anonim Sirketi (Iyzico), a 
    leading payment service provider in Turkey. The acquisition of Iyzico was accounted for as a business combination with 
    an effective date of December 2019. The shares held by non-controlling interest in Iyzico are linked to an employment 
    service period and will be accounted for as a cash-settled share-based compensation arrangement over the employment 
    service period. Accordingly, no non-controlling interest has been recognised at the acquisition date. The purchase price 
    allocation: intangible assets US$40m; cash and deposits US$28m; fixed assets US$2m; trade and other liabilities US$25m; 
    deferred tax liabilities US$9m, and balance of US$98m to goodwill. The main intangible assets recognised in the business 
    combination were customer relationships, brand names and technology.
    
    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is Iyzico's market presence and
    engineering capabilities. The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
    
    In December 2019 the group invested an additional US$163m in PaySense Private Limited (PaySense), a technology
    platform providing Indian consumers with access to credit lines based on an alternative-data decisioning model. Prior to 
    this transaction the group held 21% in PaySense and was accounted for as an investment in an associate. Following this
    additional investment, the group now holds a 79% effective and fully diluted interest in PaySense. The fair value of the
    group's previously held interest in PaySense was US$31m at the date of obtaining control. A gain of US$14m has been
    recognised in ""Gains/(losses) on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the remeasurement of the group's
    previously held equity interest in PaySense to its fair value. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination 
    with an effective date of December 2019. The purchase price allocation: intangible assets US$41m; cash and deposits US$98m,
    fixed assets US$1m, trade and other receivables US$3m; liabilities US$22m; deferred tax liabilities US$10m, and the
    balance of US$90m to goodwill. The main intangible assets recognised in the business combination were technology and brand
    names. The transaction gave rise to the recognition of non-controlling interest of US$8m, which has been measured at the
    non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of PaySense as at the acquisition date. A
    portion of the shares held by non-controlling interest in PaySense is linked to an employment service period and will be
    accounted for as a cash-settled share-based compensation arrangement over the employment service period. Accordingly,
    the non-controlling interest recognised at the acquisition date relates to 50% of their legal shareholding not linked to
    an employment service period.

    The group has a put option arrangement with the non-controlling interest exercisable at specified future dates or
    upon termination of employment of the non-controlling interest. The settlement of the put option arrangement is in cash 
    or shares at the group's discretion. The portion of the put option linked to employment is accounted for as a cash-settled
    share-based compensation arrangement over the employment period. At acquisition, the cash-settled liability for this
    arrangement amounted to US$5m. 
    
    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is PaySense market presence and
    technological capabilities. The goodwill that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

    Used Car Group B.V. (IUCG) and Poland Used Car Group B.V. (PUCG) for an additional interest in Frontier Car Group
    (FCG). FCG is a used-car marketplace in emerging markets providing consumers with access to buy used cars. Prior to this
    transaction the group held 33% effective interest (32% fully diluted) in FCG and was accounted for as an investment in 
    an associate. Following this additional investment, the group holds an 84% effective interest (83% fully diluted) in 
    FCG. A gain of US$59m has been recognised in ""Gains/(losses) on acquisitions and disposals"" in the income statement on the
    remeasurement of the group's previously held equity interest in FCG to its fair value. The aggregate value of the investment
    in FCG was US$455m consisting of the cash consideration, fair value of the previously held interest in the company of
    US$118m and the fair value of PUCG and IUCG contributed amounting to US$4m and US$11m respectively. The transaction was

    US$31m; inventory US$22m; property, plant and equipment US$15m; liabilities US$78m; deferred tax liabilities US$22m;

    or shares at the group's discretion. The portion of the put option linked to employment is accounted for as a cash-settled
    share-based compensation arrangement over the employment period. At acquisition, the cash-settled liability for this
    arrangement amounted to US$20m. 
    
    The main factor contributing to the goodwill recognised in the acquisition is FCG's market presence. The goodwill
    that arose is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
    
    Since the acquisition dates of the above business combinations, revenue of US$193m and net losses of US$41m have been
    included in the group's income statement. The impact on revenue and net losses from the above transactions, had the
    acquisitions taken place on 1 April 2019, were US$833m and US$125m respectively.
    
    During the reporting period the group disposed of its 100% effective interest in its subsidiary BuscaPe Company

    There have been no transfers between levels 1 to 3 during the reporting period, nor were there any significant
    changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring fair value.
    
    For earn-out obligations, current forecasts of the extent to which management believes performance criteria will be
    met, discount rates reflecting the time value of money and contractually specified earn-out payments are used. 
    
    Changes in these assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments.
    
    The fair value of level 2 financial instruments is determined with the use of exchange rates quoted in active markets
    and interest rate extracts from observable yield curves.
    
    The fair value of level 3 financial instruments is determined with the use of the most recent transaction values
    determined from recent funding rounds that occurred in the current year for these transactions.
    
    The group discloses the fair values of the following financial instruments as their carrying values are not a
    reasonable approximation of their fair values:
    
                                                                     31 March 2020                31 March 2019

    management, legal, treasury, control and accounting, human resources, taxes and investor relations. Subsequent to the 
    listing on 11 September 2019, corporate expenses have been directly attributed or allocated to non-South African 
    ecommerce and internet businesses and are accordingly, recharged the relevant business to which it relates. Those 
    costs remaining in corporate entities have been allocated to Prosus based on specific identification 
    criteria/allocation keys. During the current year Prosus recharged US$8.4m to Naspers companies while recovering 
    costs of US$8.5m.

16. Events after the reporting period
    In March 2020 it was announced that OfferUp and letgo US, two of America's most popular apps to buy and sell locally,
    intend to combine their businesses in the United States. OLX Group will therefore contribute its letgo US business plus
    cash of US$100m. OLX Group will own 40% of the newly combined entity. The transaction received regulatory approval and
    is expected to close on 1 July 2020. The group expects to account for its interest in OfferUp as an equity-accounted
    associate.

    In March 2020 MIH Movile Holding B.V. (Movile) signed an agreement to sell its subsidiary Wavy Global Holdings B.V.
    (Wavy) to Stockholm-based customer engagement platform, Sinch AB, in exchange for cash of approximately US$68m
    (approximately BRL355m) and a 2.70% equity investment in Sinch AB. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. 
    The group expects to account for its interest in Sinch AB as an investment at fair value through other comprehensive 
    income.
    
    On 26 April 2020 OLX Global B.V. (OLX) merged its subsidiary, Dubizzle Limited (BVI) (Dubizzle) the leading
    classifieds platform for users in the United Arab Emirates, with Emerging Markets Property Group (EMPG). EMPG owns and 
    operates bespoke classifieds portals in different emerging markets across the world, including Bayut in Dubai, Zameen 
    in Pakistan, and Mubawab in Morocco, North Africa. The group also contributed cash of approximately US$75m. Following the
    transaction, the group will hold a 39% interest in EMPG. The group will account for its interest in EMPG as an investment 
    in associate.

Independent auditor's report on the summarised consolidated financial statements

To: the Board of Directors of Prosus N.V.

Our opinion
In our opinion, the accompanying summarised consolidated financial statements of Prosus N.V. (the Company), are
consistent, in all material respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements, on the basis described in 
note 2 ""Basis of presentation and accounting policies"".

The summarised consolidated financial statements
The Company's summarised consolidated financial statements derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2020 comprise:
- the summarised consolidated income statement;
- the summarised consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
- the summarised consolidated statement of financial position;
- the summarised consolidated statement of changes in equity;
- the summarised consolidated statement of cash flows; and
- the related notes to the summarised consolidated financial statements. 

The summarised consolidated financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Reading the consolidated summarised financial statements and the auditor's report thereon, therefore, is not a substitute 
for reading the audited consolidated financial statements and the auditor's report thereon. 

The audited consolidated financial statements and our report thereon
We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on the audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated 29 June
2020. That report also includes the communication of other key audit matters. Key audit matters are those matters that,
in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the audited consolidated financial statements
of the current period.

Management's responsibility for the summarised consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of the summary consolidated financial statements on the basis described
in note 2 ""Basis of presentation and accounting policies"" which states that the summarised consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies as applied by Prosus and consistent with those
applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020. The summarised consolidated financial
statements contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) with the exception of 
IAS 34.56 and accordingly, the financial information for the second half of the current year is not presented separately.

Auditor's responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the summarised consolidated financial statements are
consistent, in all material respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements based on our procedures, which we
conducted in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 810, 'Engagements to Report on Summary Financial Statements'.

A.  Reconciliation to Combined Carve-out Financial Statements and the consolidated financial statements
    For purpose of the listing Combined Carve-out Financial Statements were prepared for the combined Prosus group under
    IFRS as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) for the years ended 31 March 2019, 2018 and 2017, and for the quarters
    ended 30 June 2019 and 2018, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34). The
    annual combined carve-out financial statements and the interim combined carve-out financial statements are hereinafter
    referred to as the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. The Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, which were 
    published for the purpose of the listing of Prosus in a listing prospectus, are available, along with the listing 
    prospectus itself, on the Prosus website.
    
    For reporting for periods beginning on 1 April 2019, Prosus as the legal parent of the group prepared consolidated
    financial statements based on applicable Dutch and European Union law, including relevant comparative financial
    information, which are different in comparison to the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. In the consolidated financial
    statements for the 2020 financial year (including comparatives), the income statement does not include certain corporate
    allocations which were included in the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements using a range of allocation keys. These
    allocations were not necessarily indicative of the costs included in the historical corporate structure of the consolidated
    financial statements. Also, the consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities, income statement
    and cash flows of certain businesses of the Video Entertainment business until its disposal at 28 September 2018, which
    were excluded from the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.

    Below is a reconciliation to the information presented in the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements of Prosus for
    the year ended 31 March 2019 and for the statement of financial position as at 1 April 2018.

        liquidation of Showmax Poland B.V., but does not include certain corporate allocations which were included 
        in the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.
    (b) As noted above, following the disposal of the Video Entertainment business in September 2018, the results 
        of the Video Entertainment business were classified as a discontinued operation. The Video Entertainment 
        business had non-controlling shareholders that shared in the profits of the segment. Refer to note 4 for 
        details of the loss from discontinued operations.

    (a) These reconciling items relate primarily to balances with various related parties, notably the Video 
        Entertainment business, and were disclosed in the ""Net parent investment"" in equity in the Combined Carve-out 
        Financial Statements, as these parties were not part of the combined Prosus group, but are part of the consolidated 
        Prosus group. As at 1 April 2018 the reconciling items also include the assets and liabilities of the Video 
        Entertainment business which were excluded from the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.
    (b) The Combined Carve-out Financial Statements excluded the assets and liabilities, income statement and cash 
        flows of the Video Entertainment business. The net parent investment included the net asset value contributions 
        to and distributions from businesses that were under common control of Naspers Limited (the group's ultimate 
        controlling parent), as they did not form part of the Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. In the consolidated 
        financial statements, the Video Entertainment business does form part of the Prosus group and accordingly the 
        equity reserves have been reallocated to the appropriate line items in the statement of financial position and 
        correctly reflect the composition of the Prosus group.

B.  Non-IFRS financial measures and alternative performance measures
B.1 Growth in local currency, excluding acquisitions and disposals 
    The group applies certain adjustments to segmental revenue and trading profit reported in the summarised consolidated
    financial statements to present the growth in such metrics in local currency and excluding the effects of changes in
    the composition of the group. Such underlying adjustments provide a view of the company's underlying financial performance
    that management believes is more comparable between periods by removing the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates
    and changes in the composition of the group on its results. Such adjustments are referred to herein as ""growth in local
    currency, excluding acquisitions and disposals"". The group applies the following methodology in calculating growth in
    local currency, excluding acquisitions and disposals: 
    - Foreign exchange/constant currency adjustments have been calculated by adjusting the current period's results to the
      prior period's average foreign exchange rates, determined as the average of the monthly exchange rates for that period.
      The local currency financial information quoted is calculated as the constant currency results, arrived at using the
      methodology outlined above, compared to the prior period's actual IFRS results. The relevant average exchange rates
      (relative to the US dollar) used for the group's most significant functional currencies, were:

    - Adjustments made for changes in the composition of the group relate to acquisitions, mergers and disposals of
      subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments, as well as to changes in the group's shareholding in its equity-accounted
      investments. For acquisitions, adjustments are made to remove the revenue and trading profit/(loss) of the acquired entity
      from the current reporting period and, in subsequent reporting periods, to ensure that the current reporting period and
      the comparative reporting period contain revenue and trading profit/(loss) information relating to the same number of
      months. For mergers, adjustments are made to include a portion of the prior period's revenue and trading profit/(loss) of
      the entity acquired as a result of a merger. For disposals, adjustments are made to remove the revenue and trading
      profit/(loss) of the disposed entity from the previous reporting period to the extent that there is no comparable revenue 
      or trading profit/(loss) information in the current period and, in subsequent reporting periods, to ensure that the previous
      reporting period does not contain revenue and trading profit/(loss) information relating to the disposed business. 

    The following significant changes in the composition of the group during the respective reporting periods have been
    adjusted for in arriving at the pro forma financial information:

Prosus N.V. (previously Myriad International Holdings N.V.)
(Incorporated in the Netherlands)
(Trade Reg No 34099856)
AEX and JSE Share Code: PRX  ISIN: NL0013654783
(“Prosus”)


Trading statement


Shareholders are advised that the Prosus group (“the group”) is finalising its summarised consolidated financial statements
and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Prosus is a subsidiary of Naspers Limited (“Naspers”), a company incorporated in South Africa and listed on the JSE Limited
stock exchange in South Africa (“JSE”). On 11 September 2019, Prosus was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange,
with a secondary listing on the JSE.

The group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world. Operating and investing
in countries and markets across the world with long-term growth potential, Prosus builds leading companies that empower
people and enrich communities. The group operates and partners with several leading internet businesses across Asia, Central
and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Africa in sectors including online classifieds, food delivery, payments
and fintech, education, health, etail and social and internet platforms.

In terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE in South Africa, South African listed entities with a primary listing are obliged
to issue a trading statement to their shareholders to communicate anticipated changes to a company’s trading position that
would be relevant to the upcoming financial results release. Trading statements are generally issued to provide shareholders
with a range of outcomes in respect of key financial metrics as soon as a company has reasonable certainty in respect of those
outcomes.

Prosus is a subsidiary of Naspers, and its financial results almost completely account for Naspers’ results. Based on Naspers’
anticipated year ended 31 March 2020 results, Naspers is required to issue a trading statement in terms of the JSE’s listing
requirements. To ensure that shareholders of Prosus are provided simultaneously with equivalent information, Prosus is issuing
this trading statement.

We ended the financial year facing into the global Covid-19 pandemic, with many of our markets entering lockdown in the last
two weeks of March 2020. We continue to respond quickly to the evolving Covid-19 situation to ensure we safeguard our
people, maintain our ability to serve our customers and protect our businesses for the long term.

During the year ended 31 March 2020, all key ecommerce segments made good progress against financial and strategic
objectives. Classifieds again grew considerably faster than many of its peers and increased profits. Payments and Fintech have
now reached profitability at their core while also investing to drive future growth. Food Delivery was a key investment area
during the year as we seek to grow the market and our position in it by investing in technology and building out our first-party
delivery capabilities, city and restaurant reach. Initial results are highly encouraging as, to date, this investment has driven
significant order and revenue growth in our Food Delivery operations. The progress of our core ecommerce segments, which
are growing fast and scaling well, gives us confidence in our ability to continue identifying opportunities to create significant
value into the future. Tencent delivered a solid financial performance. Further details will be provided in the summarised
consolidated financial results, due for release on 29 June 2020.

While we believe each of our segments will continue to benefit from secular growth trends, the global pandemic has negatively
impacted some operations and we need to caution against the potential impacts of Covid-19 on the 31 March 2021 financial
year. That said, it is important to note that the fundamentals of our businesses remain very strong and we believe that the we
are well positioned to weather this unprecedented storm. We have sufficient liquidity to provide our businesses with the
appropriate level of funding as well as invest in external opportunities that may present themselves during this period.

For the year ended 31 March 2020, the group’s earnings, headline earnings and core headline earnings are impacted by a
number of discreet items that investors should be aware of.

                                                                                                                                
Growth in earnings per share in the current period is expected to reduce as a consequence of:
   -    A gain of approximately US$600m recognised on the disposal of the group’s interest in MakeMyTrip Limited,
        compared to a gain of US$1.6bn in the prior period recognised on disposal of the group’s interest in Flipkart Limited.
        This negatively impacts the year-over-year comparison by approximately US$1bn,
   -    US$114m in donations in response to the Covid-19 in March 2020, as the group expensed its proportionate share of
        Covid-19 donations made by Tencent Holdings Limited (Tencent) up to end March 2020, and
   - Our increased investment to build leadership in the group’s attractive and fast-growing food delivery segment;
   -    This is partially offset by expected increased contributions from associates, particularly Tencent, and consolidated
        trading profits from our classifieds and etail segments.

Growth in headline earnings per share is negatively impacted by:
   -    Fair-value gains on investments held by Tencent (classified as at fair value through profit and loss) of approximately
        US$549m, compared to gains of US$1.5bn recognised in the prior period.

Shareholders are reminded that the board considers core headline earnings an appropriate indicator of the operating
performance of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items. Core headline earnings per share from continuing operations
for the current period is expected to increase by between 7 and 23 cents per share (between 4% and 12%). The
abovementioned gains on disposals of investments, fair-value losses and Covid-19 donations have been excluded from core
headline earnings. As such, growth in core headline earnings is expected to benefit by continued healthy growth from Tencent
and growth in many of our established ecommerce business, however, this is expected to be offset by the additional investment
to drive strong growth in the food delivery business.

The group has illustrated the anticipated changes in core headline earnings per share, earnings and headline earnings per share
for the year ended 31 March 2019 as compared to 31 March 2020 (to be included in the summarised consolidated financial
results for the year ended 31 March 2020) for both total operations and continuing operations in the tables below:

* Headline earnings represent net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the group, excluding certain defined separately identifiable
remeasurements relating to, amongst others, impairments of tangible assets, intangible assets (including goodwill) and equity-accounted investments, gains
and losses on acquisitions and disposals of investments as well as assets, dilution gains and losses on equity-accounted investments, remeasurement gains and
losses on disposal groups classified as held for sale and remeasurements included in equity-accounted earnings, net of related taxes (both current and deferred)
and the related non-controlling interests. These remeasurements are determined in accordance with Circular 1/2019, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South
African Institute of Chartered Accountants, pursuant to the JSE Listings Requirements.
** Core headline earnings, a non-IFRS performance measure, represent headline earnings for the period excluding certain non-operating items. Specifically,
headline earnings are adjusted for the following items to derive core headline earnings: (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses on transactions where
there is no cash cost to the company. These include those relating to share-based incentive awards settled by issuing treasury shares as well as certain share-
based payment expenses that are deemed to arise on shareholder transactions; (ii) deferred taxation income recognised on the first-time recognition of deferred
tax assets as this generally relates to multiple prior periods and distorts current period performance; (iii) fair-value adjustments on financial instruments
(including put option liabilities) and unrealised currency translation differences, as these items obscure the group's underlying operating performance; (iv) one-
off gains and losses (including acquisition-related costs) resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses as these items relate to changes in the
composition of the group and are not reflective of its underlying operating performance; (v) the amortisation of intangible assets recognised in business
combinations and acquisitions; and (vi) the donations due to Covid-19, as these expenses are not considered operational in nature. These adjustments are made
to the earnings of businesses controlled by the group as well as the group's share of earnings of associates and joint ventures, to the extent that the information
is available.

      Per share information is based on the net number of A and N ordinary shares in issue during the respective periods.

      Per share information for the comparative periods is based on the net number of shares issued for the year ended

Update on impact of COVID-19


   -   Focussing on the health of its employees and communities

   -   Working hard to safeguard customers, partners and businesses

   -   Strong financial position to navigate uncertain times

Today, 8 April 2020, Prosus (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the ""Group"")
provides an update on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and outlines its actions to
safeguard its employees, customers and businesses as well as to support the communities
in which it operates.

The Group is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors
in the world. The Group’s businesses serve customers in more than 90 markets. The Group
estimates that approximately one-fifth of the world’s population use products and services
of businesses that the Group has built, acquired or invested in. The Group's diversified
portfolio comprises businesses in high-growth sectors, including food delivery, online
classifieds, payments and fintech, etail, online education, and social and internet
platforms.

Safeguarding its employees, customers and businesses

The Group has monitored COVID-19-related developments in its markets and has
implemented measures to limit the potential spread of the virus among its employees, its
customers and persons connected to its businesses. The Group early-on implemented
work-from-home policies and travel restrictions for its employees to help protect the health
of its employees and those around them. For those employees directly serving customers,
the Group has implemented measures designed to safeguard both them and its customers.
In addition, the Group has implemented measures to support the key partners of its
businesses.

   -   Food delivery: the Group has implemented several initiatives, including iFood
       making available over R$50million in support to restaurants and couriers in Brazil
       affected by COVID-19. In some instances, the Group's businesses have also:
       waived commissions charged by it to restaurants; reduced restaurant payment
       cycles to boost restaurants' liquidity; provided masks, gloves and thermal checks
       for ""delivery-only kitchen"" staff; and provided best practice guidelines for the
       health and safety of restaurant staff and couriers.

   -   Classifieds: the Group has: extended payment and delivery services to more
       categories of users, where possible; offered cameras to users for virtual real estate
       tours; and piloted car inspections by video in some of its automotive businesses.
       To support sellers on some of its marketplaces, the Group has extended the
       duration of listings and provided financial relief to support their ongoing business
       viability.

   -   Payments and fintech: PayU has rolled out a number of initiatives to help
       merchant partners across its markets, including “Startups helping Startups”, which
       allows businesses to collaborate to support COVID-19 efforts. These initiatives
       include collecting donations for hospitals at points-of-sale, and rolling out free
       digital training webinars on how merchants can adapt to trading online.

   -   Etail: eMAG is offering customers alternative ways to receive their purchases.
       These include enabling customers to collect their goods from hundreds of
       conveniently located lockers, which are sanitised multiple times a day, and
       contactless delivery, where drivers deposit packages outside customers’ homes.
       eMAG is also adding new offline retailers to its marketplace to help drive business
       for them.

The Group continues to respond to the developing situation, adhering to official guidance
and applicable law and regulation to limit the potential spread of COVID-19.

Supporting the communities in which it operates

The Group is taking action at a group level and at a local company level to support its
communities, particularly where it can use its technological expertise, global networks and
resources to contribute to the response to COVID-19.

   -   Swiggy has launched a campaign to donate meals to persons in need in India. The
       public can also donate to this campaign. The campaign is currently donating
       approximately 35,000 meals per day, with a goal of distributing approximately
       500,000 meals per day in the short-term.

   -   OLX is using its marketplace to help find homes for doctors and arrange
       transportation for the elderly, and is moderating fake advertisements.

   -   Codecademy has awarded 85,000 scholarships to learners in more than 80
       countries to the Pro version of its course catalogue, and BYJU’S has offered its
       learning platform for free in India.

Prosus's parent company, Naspers, is contributing ZAR1.5 billion (US$82 million) in
emergency aid to the South African government’s response to COVID-19. Naspers was
founded in South Africa over 100 years ago and it is committed to working with the South
African government and civil society to help overcome the impact of COVID-19 and make
a difference in the country. Naspers will contribute ZAR500 million (US$27.3 million) to
the Solidarity Response Fund and will buy ZAR1 billion (US$54.7 million) worth of personal
protective equipment and other medical supplies in China and fly these to South Africa

The Group continues to encourage the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit of its local
teams to identify additional opportunities to put its capabilities and expertise to work
across the world.

Business and financial impact

The Group's leadership team is in communication with its businesses to anticipate the
impact of COVID-19 on operations. It is still too early to estimate the scope of any impact,
whether positive or negative, on the Group's operations and financial information,
particularly in view of rising global infections and evolving government responses to the
outbreak. The size of the impact on operations will vary across sector and geography. The
Group intends to continue to invest in its businesses to position them for future recovery.

Importantly, the Group believes that it faces this challenging period from a position of
relative financial strength and with sufficient liquidity to both navigate the changing
environment and seek out new opportunities. The Group closed its financial year on 31
March 2020 with more than US$4 billion in net cash and a US$2.5 billion undrawn revolving
credit facility in place. Prosus's bond offering in January 2020 successfully priced US$1.25
billion 3.680% notes (due 2030) to raise proceeds to redeem its US$1.0 billion 6.000%
notes that were due in July 2020. The Group has no debt maturities due until 2025.

  -   The Group's largest investment, Tencent, continues to grow off a very large base
      and in a market, China, which appears to be emerging well from the impact of
      COVID-19.

  -   In classifieds, the Group has seen a decline in traffic to its marketplaces. The
      Group, however, has taken a number of steps to assist customers and partners
      during this time. In the short-term, the Group expects to experience a negative
      impact on revenue and profitability in its Classifieds businesses.

  -   In payments and fintech, the Group's European businesses appear to be resilient.
      That, however, may change. It remains too early to estimate the impact of the
      recent lockdown in India on its Payments and Fintech business. India represents
      more than 50% of its Payments and Fintech business's transaction volume in
      payments and has initially seen a significant drop in transaction volume. In time,
      the payments and fintech business is expected to benefit across its markets from
      large sectoral trends, including more customers transacting online and more online
      transactions being executed through alternative forms of payment (rather than
      cash).

  -   In food delivery, while the Group is experiencing an increased demand for food
      delivery across its portfolio, it has not always been able to meet that demand due
      to supply issues as restaurants close. In India, Swiggy is permitted to continue to
      operate during the lockdown in India. The lockdown in India has, however, not been
      implemented uniformly across the country and Swiggy's service has been halted in
      some regions. Swiggy is engaging with the national and regional authorities in India
      to ensure the uniform implementation of the lockdown. In Brazil, iFood’s efforts to
      assist its restaurant and food delivery partners has helped mitigate some of the
      supply issues and, at this stage, order volume is holding up well. In the longer-term,
      the Group believes that it is likely that the current environment may drive a
      structural shift in global consumption patterns in favour of food delivery.

  -   In etail, while eMAG’s main market of operation, Romania, entered a lockdown on
      26 March 2020, the business is holding up well at this stage.

All of the Group's businesses have continuity plans in place. The Group is actively assessing
potential impacts and supporting its businesses as they take appropriate, market-specific
action as needed. The challenges of COVID-19 will vary by sector and geography, but the
Group believes it has the teams, the resources and the experience required to navigate
them successfully. The Group believes it will emerge from this period well-placed to
continue to deliver long-term growth in the markets it serves.

To give further context to the impacts of COVID-19 on the Group's businesses,
Prosus invites shareholders to attend a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, 9
April 2020 at 15:00 CET. To access the call please pre-register here. Once
registered, participants will be provided with the information needed to join the

of the call will be made available on the website, www.prosus.com.

Forward-looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are, or may be, forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on
current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
materially from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts
included in this announcement may be forward-looking statements. Without limitation,
forward-looking statements often include words such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”,
“hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,

look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “is subject to”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the
negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that
certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably”
or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors
described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could
cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or
implied by, such forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking statements. Due
to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any
forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of Prosus and no
assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

written forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus or its directors, officers, advisers
or employees or any person acting on any of their behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. No person
provides any representation, warranty, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the
events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will
actually occur. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, Prosus is
not under, and does not undertake, any obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention
or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.

statements of the Group as of, and for the financial year ended, 31 March 2020 and the

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement is intended as or shall be deemed
to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No statement in, or referred to in, this
announcement or should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant),
cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Prosus for
the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or

BOND OFFERING BY PROSUS N.V.


Shareholders are advised that Prosus, on 14 January 2020, successfully priced US$1.25 billion
3.680% notes due 2030 (the ""Bonds"") issued under its Global Medium-Term Note Program.

The purpose of this offering was to raise proceeds to redeem the U.S.$1.0 billion 6.000% notes
due in July 2020 (the ""2020 Bonds""). Demand for the Bonds was five times the originally
contemplated US$1.0 billion at attractive pricing terms, which is why Prosus has chosen to
increase the size of the issuance.

An application has been made to Euronext Dublin to admit the Bonds to listing on the Official
List of Euronext Dublin and trading on the regulated market thereof.

The net proceeds of the offering of the Bonds will be used by Prosus for the redemption of the
2020 Bonds and otherwise for general corporate purposes. Prosus is considering various options
for the redemption of the 2020 Bonds, including exercising the ""make-whole"" call option.

LAPSE OF THE OFFER for JUST EAT PLC by PROSUS N.V.
through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.

NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A
VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF THAT JURISDICTION

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION

On 19 December 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the final increased offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the entire issued and to be issued
share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

As at 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020 (being the closing date of the Final Increased Offer),
Prosus had received valid acceptances of the Final Increased Offer in respect of 158,037 Just Eat Shares,
representing approximately 0.02 per cent. of the issued share capital of Just Eat. MIH does not own any Just
Eat Shares. As such, the Acceptance Condition has not been satisfied and the Final Increased Offer has
now lapsed.

As the Final Increased Offer has lapsed, it is no longer open to acceptances and any accepting Just Eat
Shareholders cease to be bound by their acceptances.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: ""We would like to thank the Just Eat board and management
team for their constructive engagement throughout the process. As stated in our Original Offer and
subsequently, we consider Just Eat an attractive business though one which will require significant
investment. We have been clear throughout that we would remain disciplined in how we allocate our capital
and the price that we would offer.

We have an outstanding track record of executing M&A at the right price for our shareholders and of
generating strong returns. Just Eat is not an acquisition we wanted to make at any cost and while we have
significant financial capacity, we believe that our final offer of 800 pence per share was appropriate in light of
the investment required and preserved our ability to create value for our shareholders.

Our core operating segments are growing fast with significant runway ahead of them. We will continue to
identify and pursue opportunities that will be both additive to our current strategy and generate high levels of
return for our shareholders.""
            
In respect of Just Eat Shares held in certificated form, the Form of Acceptance, Second Form of Acceptance
and/or Third Form of Acceptance (as applicable), share certificate(s) and/or other document(s) of title will be
returned by post (or by such other method as may be approved by the Panel) within 14 days of the Final
Increased Offer lapsing to the person or agent whose name and address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions
is set out in the relevant box on the relevant Form of Acceptance or, if none is set out, to the first-named or
sole holder of his registered address outside the Restricted Jurisdictions. No such documents will be sent to
an address in any Restricted Jurisdiction.

In respect of Just Eat Shares held in uncertificated form, Computershare, the Receiving Agent, will,
immediately (or within such longer period as the Panel may permit, not exceeding 14 days after the lapsing
of the Final Increased Offer), give instructions to Euroclear to transfer all Just Eat Shares held in escrow
balances and in relation to which it is the escrow agent for the purposes of the Final Increased Offer to the
original available balances of the Just Eat Shareholders concerned.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the

PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 19 December 2019 relating to the final
increased offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to
acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final
Increased Offer), Prosus announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of
the Final Increased Offer and the procedures for its acceptance (the Final Increased Offer
Document) is being published and posted to the shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the
case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat Shares in certificated form, the related Third Form of
Acceptance to accept the Final Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer Document will also be
published on Prosus’s website at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Final Increased Offer is
subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Final Increased Offer Document and the Third Form
of Acceptance. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and should be construed
accordingly.

Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, commented: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other European
markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as competitive
dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we would remain
disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an attractive
business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining acceptable
returns for Prosus shareholders.”

To accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Third Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to

sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer or the Increased Offer
will automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue
of their prior acceptance and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further
action.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or

November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of
their respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States                                                   
disclosure and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable,
settlement procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on
which the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or
arrangements to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in
the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply
with applicable law, including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about
such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a
Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Final Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United
States federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.

                                                  
Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final
Increased Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation
to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as
the case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore
subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ
materially from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement
may be forward looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words
such as “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”,
“outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”,
“estimates”, “will look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”,
“forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance
or the negative thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain
actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur
or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties
surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or                                                   
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

UPDATE ON FINAL INCREASED CASH OFFER FOR JUST EAT PLC BY PROSUS N.V.
THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V
 


Prosus notes the announcement by Just Eat’s board regarding its recommendation and
Takeaway.com’s announcement regarding the acceptance level for its offer.

Prosus has offered to acquire the entire share capital of Just Eat for 800p per share. This cash offer
remains open to acceptances from Just Eat shareholders. However, Prosus does not plan currently to
make market purchases of Just Eat shares in support of its offer.

Commenting, Bob van Dijk, CEO of Prosus, said: “We maintain our belief that in the UK and other
European markets, Just Eat will require significant investments in own-delivery and technology as
competitive dynamics and customer preferences continue to evolve. We have always stated that we
would remain disciplined with respect to price on acquiring Just Eat, balancing our desire to own an
attractive business with the need for significant investment in that business while maintaining
acceptable returns for Prosus shareholders.”

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Final
Increased Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England
and Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any applicable
requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the
Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the Final Increased
Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Final Increased Offer, may be affected by the laws
of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any doubt
regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their relevant
jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the
laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
companies and other persons involved in the Final Increased Offer disclaim any responsibility or liability
for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Final Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Final Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted
Jurisdiction or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Final Increased Offer
will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within
a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the Final
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where
to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including
agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them                                                    
in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so would violate the
laws in that jurisdiction. If the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme (unless
otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by
any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Final Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation
of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and  will  be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.


                                                    
The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and any
person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance or

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies

commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent                                                     
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at

FINAL INCREASED CASH OFFER for JUST EAT PLC by PROSUS N.V.

through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.

MIH FOOD DELIVERY HOLDINGS B.V. IS SEEKING TO MAKE MARKET PURCHASES AT UP TO
   800 PENCE PER JUST EAT SHARE. ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED
                                    STATES
INTERESTED IN SELLING JUST EAT SHARES SHOULD CONTACT J.P. MORGAN CAZENOVE /
             MORGAN STANLEY (USING THE CONTACT DETAILS BELOW)

1.      Final Increased Cash Offer

Prosus N.V. (Prosus) is pleased to announce the terms of an increased and final cash offer by its
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) for the entire issued and to be
issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Final Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Final Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             800 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Final Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital
of Just Eat at approximately £5.5 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       36 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019 (being
        the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement);

•       35 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       26 per cent. to the Closing Price of 636 pence per Just Eat Share on 26 July (being the last
        Business Day before the commencement of the Offer Period).

The financial terms of the Final Increased Offer are final and will not be increased. The closing date of
the Final Increased Offer has been extended to 1.00 p.m. on 10 January 2020 and will not be extended
beyond that time (save with Panel consent).

Save as set out in this announcement, the Final Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Increased Offer. The Final Increased Offer is a revision to the Increased Offer and
should be construed accordingly.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in
any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

Commenting on the Final Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We have been very clear from the beginning about our ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business. The acquisition of Just Eat, which brings its portfolio of good market positions, would
be a meaningful step in realising this goal. Following extensive discussions with Just Eat’s and Prosus’s
shareholders, we have decided to make a final increase in our cash offer to 800p per share. This level
delivers outstanding and certain value to Just Eat shareholders while also providing an appropriate
return for our own shareholders, given strong levels of competition and significant investment required
to reinvigorate growth. We urge Just Eat shareholders to accept this final offer and bring the uncertainty
around Just Eat’s future to a close.”

2.      MIH seeking to acquire Just Eat Shares

MIH is seeking to make market purchases of Just Eat Shares at a price of up to 800 pence per share.

Eligible Just Eat Shareholders, who are institutional investors outside the United States, interested in
selling their shares at the price of up to 800 pence per Just Eat Share should contact J.P. Morgan
Cazenove / Morgan Stanley (using their normal sales and trading contacts), who have authority from
Prosus and MIH to purchase Just Eat Shares other than pursuant to the Offer such as in the open
market or through privately negotiated purchases. Such purchases shall comply with the City Code, the
rules of the London Stock Exchange and Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act. Information about
such purchases will be disclosed as and if required by applicable securities laws. Retail investors should
contact their broker.

Due to regulatory requirements, MIH is unable to purchase Just Eat Shares from shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States, or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States.

3.      Overview of the Final Increased Offer

Following further investor engagement, and in the context of strong equity market performance and
consolidation in the sector since Prosus’s Increased Offer, Prosus is today pleased to announce a Final
Increased Offer of 800 pence in cash per Just Eat Share.

The Final Increased Offer represents a compelling proposition for Just Eat Shareholders with the
certainty of a cash exit at a substantial premium to Just Eat’s unaffected share price and to the value
of the Takeaway.com Offer.

The Final Increased Offer represents a premium of 36 per cent to Just Eat’s Closing Price on 21 October
2019 (the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which already includes
a premium from the Takeaway.com’s Offer and which Prosus believes compares favourably with
precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context.

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, its historically
strong market positions are being eroded by intensifying competition. Prosus is the right owner for Just
Eat and intends to provide the necessary investment in product, technology, marketing and own-
delivery capabilities to enable Just Eat to shift to an own-delivery focused hybrid model, protect its
market positions, and capitalise on its long-term opportunity. Prosus benefits from a long and successful
track record of investing in and building out market-leading hybrid and own-delivery businesses.

The Offer is an important step towards achieving Prosus’s ambition to build the world’s leading Food
Delivery business and is the logical next step for Prosus’s and Just Eat’s partnership in iFood. Prosus
has the conviction and financial resources to help Just Eat achieve its long-term potential, whilst also
targeting an appropriate risk adjusted return on invested capital for Prosus shareholders.

Prosus believes that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will not address Just Eat’s issues
and carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders. In the context of slowing organic growth,
Takeaway.com’s share price is at an all-time high and trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than
Just Eat’s own unaffected multiple.

Takeaway.com has limited experience in competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.
Furthermore, Takeaway.com’s management lacks experience of operating own-delivery operations at
scale, and has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable. Prosus believes Takeaway.com will not be able to support Just Eat in competing
effectively in many of Just Eat’s core markets including the UK where Uber Eats and Deliveroo have
been operating at scale for years with large and growing market share.

Prosus believes that it is the right owner for Just Eat and Prosus’s Final Increased Offer provides
compelling and certain value to Just Eat Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s
all-share offer, which comes with significant risk.

Prosus urges Just Eat Shareholders to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible
and, in any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 10 January 2020.

4.      Financing of the Final Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Final Increased Offer will be financed: (a) by a
bridge loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders, providing for a term loan bridge facility; and (b) from the existing cash resources of Prosus.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources available
to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat Shareholders
under the terms of the Final Increased Offer.

5.      How to accept the Final Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Final Increased Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and
conditions to, the Final Increased Offer together with the associated revised form of acceptance (the
Third Form of Acceptance) will be posted to Just Eat Shareholders and be available, subject to certain
restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat, in due course.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just
Eat Shares should complete either: (a) the Second Form of Acceptance accompanying the
Increased Offer Document; or (b) the Third Form of Acceptance which will accompany the Final
Increased Offer Document in due course. The relevant form of acceptance should be completed,

but in any event so as to be received by not later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January
2020.

Just Eat Shareholders wishing to accept the Final Increased Offer in respect of uncertificated
Just Eat Shares, should do so electronically through CREST by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London
time) on 10 January 2020. If you are a CREST sponsored member, you should refer to your
CREST sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction
to Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Offer or the Increased Offer will
automatically be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Final Increased Offer by virtue of
their prior acceptance and do not need take any further action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Final Increased Offer Document, please
contact the Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370

(London time).

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Final Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in
any event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 10 January 2020.

Just Eat Shareholders who have accepted the Takeaway.com Offer should be aware that if the
Takeaway.com Offer has not become or been declared unconditional as to acceptances by 1.00
p.m. on 1 January 2020, they can withdraw their acceptance of the Takeaway.com Offer and
accept the Final Increased Offer.

6.      Level of acceptances and disclosure of interests in relevant securities

As at 1.00 p.m. on 19 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Increased Offer in
respect of 44,718 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0065 per cent. of the current issued
share capital of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own
any Just Eat Shares.

The percentages of Just Eat Shares referred to in this announcement are based on a figure of
682,985,706 Just Eat Shares in issue on 18 December 2019.

7.      General

Notice to US investors

The Final Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in
reliance on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
US Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Final Increased Offer is being made in the
United States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Final Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Final Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to
disclosure and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure
and procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Final Increased Offer will
comply with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement
procedures, particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Final Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Final Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which
the Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements
to purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market
at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with
Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will be
disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will    be    available   on     the    London     Stock   Exchange      website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

In relation to MIH’s intention to buy Just Eat Shares in the market outside the Final Increased Offer,
MIH and its affiliates and brokers cannot purchase Just Eat Shares from Just Eat Shareholders
incorporated or located in the United States or where the Just Eat Shares would be sold from the United
States. Any purchases will be made to the extent permitted by, and in compliance with Rule 14e-5(b)
under the US Exchange Act and in compliance with the City Code.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the Final
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Final Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Final Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Final Increased
Offer or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this announcement. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the US Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Final Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in
nature and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations,
valuations, targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject
to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially
from the future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as “targets”,
“plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”, ”risk”, “seeks”,
“aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will look to”,
“budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-saving”, “is
subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative thereof, as well
as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”,
“could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements
are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking
statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just Eat.
All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus, MIH
or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and any
person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty, assurance or
guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking statements in
this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations
(including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation, and each of the
foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant
securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an
offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required
to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

                                              APPENDIX I

                                          Sources and Bases


    (a) All prices and Closing Prices for Just Eat Shares are closing middle market quotations
        derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL).

    (b) All prices and Closing Prices for Takeaway.com Shares are closing middle market quotations
        derived from the Euronext Amsterdam Daily Official List.

    (c) The aggregate value of the Final Increased Offer consideration of approximately £5.5 billion is
        calculated by multiplying the offered amount of 800 pence in cash per Just Eat Share by Just
        Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

    (d) The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,107,905 shares (as published by
        Takeaway.com in its circular to shareholders dated 9 December 2019).

    (e) The strong equity market performance since Prosus’s Increased Offer refers to the 4.2%
        increase in the FTSE 100 from market close on 6 December 2019 to the market close on 18
        December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this announcement).

    (f) Takeaway.com’s slowing organic order growth is illustrated by an order growth of 21 per cent
        in Q3 2019 vs 22 per cent in H1 2019 in Germany and an order growth of 15 per cent in Q3
        2019 vs 18 per cent in H1 2019 in the Netherlands.

    (g) Takeaway.com all time high share price is based on € 88.90 (on 18 December 2019) which is
        defined as the highest close price on any given day after its first trading day following IPO on
        30 September 2016.

    (h) Takeaway.com broker consensus is based on the following:

        i.    Takeaway.com consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July

              as they are connected advisors to Just Eat. Estimates from J.P. Morgan Cazenove and
              Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected advisors to Prosus.

(i) Takeaway.com’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 10.2x is based on Takeaway.com’s
    enterprise value of €5,655 million is calculated as Takeaway.com’s equity value of €5,468
    million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.5 million as per Takeaway.com’s circular to
    shareholders published on 9 December 2019 and share price of €88.90 as at 18 December
    2019 plus net debt of €166 million, and other adjustments of €21 million. 2020 revenue
    reflects the arithmetic average broker consensus of €556.0 million as defined above

(j) Just Eat broker consensus as at 26 July 2019 is based on the following:

   i.    Just Eat consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 6 March 2019

         date) and includes group level estimates from the following analysts: Barclays (9 July

         J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected
         advisors to Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as
         they are a connected advisor to Takeaway.com;

   ii.   the minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,247 million, the
         maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,301 million; and

   iii. in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
        with the agreement or the approval of Just Eat.

(k) Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 3.4x as at 26 July 2019 is based on:

   i.    Just Eat’s enterprise value of approximately £4,425 million is calculated as Just Eat’s
         equity value of approximately £4,370 million (based on total shares outstanding of 687
         million as per the Just Eat H1 2019 report and share price of £6.36 as at 26 July 2019)
         plus net debt of £118 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million; and

   ii.   2020 revenue reflects the arithmetic average broker consensus of £1,301 million as
         defined above.

(l) The statement that Takeaway.com is currently trading on a revenue multiple 3.0 times Just
    Eat’s own unaffected multiple is based on Takeaway.com’s current multiple of 10.2x as
    defined above, divided by Just Eat’s unaffected multiple of 3.4x.

                                                  for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Publication of Investor Presentation

Further to the announcement on 9 December 2019 by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery
Holdings B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital
of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are today pleased to announce the
publication of an investor presentation (the Investor Presentation) in connection with the Increased
Offer.

A copy of the presentation is available at www.prosus.com/investors/justeat.

Prosus continues to believe that its superior cash offer represents compelling and certain value to
Just Eat Shareholders. The Increased Offer is at a premium to the look through value of the
Takeaway.com Offer, and provides certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the
significant risks associated with the Takeaway.com Offer. The presentation develops the arguments
set out in the offer document, and in addition, contains the following new information:

Illustrative Premium Calculation

•       Prosus Increased Offer of 740 pence per share in cash comes at a 44 per cent. illustrative
        premium assuming the 15% premium on announcement of the Takeaway.com offer in July
        remained embedded in Just Eat’s share price of 589 pence as at 21 October 2019 (implying
        an illustrative unaffected price for Just Eat of 512 pence adjusted for this 15% premium)


                                                
The illustrative premium of 44% is calculated by reversing the 15% premium on announcement of the
Takeaway.com offer out of the 589p Takeaway.com share price on 21 October 2019 (that being the
last business day prior to the date of Prosus’s Original Offer Announcement), to establish an
illustrative unaffected Just Eat share price for that day of 512 pence, which, compared to Prosus’s
increased cash offer of 740 pence implies a 44% premium.

Illustrative Value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple (updated
for the latest GrubHub share price as of 10 December 2019)

If Just Eat were to re-rate to GrubHub's current 2020 EV/Revenue multiple of 2.7x, this would result in
an illustrative share price for Just Eat of 502 pence, to which Prosus’s increased offer represents an
illustrative premium of 48%.

Prosus believes that the Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a significant premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risks.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer.

A    copy     of    this  announcement    will  be    available     on    Prosus’s   website   at

The Increased Offer will be being implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Increased Offer
Document, which will contain further information about the Increased Offer.

This announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus exempted document.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their                                                 
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Original Offer Document.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.


                                                 
Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality                                                  
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates
                                                     
No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

Sources and Bases of Calculations

Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue of 2.7x as at 10 December 2019 is based on: Grubhub’s
enterprise value of US$4,007 million is calculated as Grubhub’s equity value of US$3,690 million
(based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.5 million and share price of US$39.04 as at 10 December
2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of
US$1,461 million.

The illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiple is for
illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
the City Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue multiple (as
calculated above) of 2.7x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below)
to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of £3,501 million, and using net debt of £118 million, and
other adjustments of £(63) million to obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,446 million. Dividing by
shares outstanding of 687 million obtains the illustrative share price of 502 pence per share, to which
Prosus’s Increased Offer of 740 pence per share represents a 48% premium.

Just Eat consensus comprises all analyst notes available to Prosus since 31 July 2019 (the date of
Just Eat’s H1 2019 results statement) as at 10 December 2019 (the last practicable date prior to the
publication of this Announcement) and includes group level estimates from the following analysts:
Arete Research Services (4 November 2019), Barclays (22 October 2019), Berenberg (9 August
2019), Credit Suisse (13 November 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019), HSBC (23
October 2019), Investec (04 November 2019), Jefferies (22 October 2019), Liberum (23 October
2019), Macquarie (2 October 2019), Numis Securities (31 October 2019), Peel Hunt (30 October
2019) and RBC Capital Markets (24 October 2019). Estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS have
been excluded from the consensus as they are connected advisors to Just Eat. Estimates from J.P.
Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley have been excluded as they are connected advisors to
Prosus. Estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch have been excluded as they are a connected                                                  
advisor to Takeaway.com.The minimum 2020 group revenue estimate per the consensus is £1,191
million, the maximum is £1,458 million, and the arithmetic average is £1,276 million. In accordance
with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown with the agreement or the
approval of Just Eat.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

10 December 2019

                             UPDATE ON INCREASED CASH OFFER

                                                 for

                                           JUST EAT PLC

                                                  by

                                            PROSUS N.V.

       through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.


Update on Prosus’s Increased Offer to acquire Just Eat

Further to the announcement yesterday by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings
B.V. (MIH) of their increased offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just
Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus and MIH are pleased to confirm that the Spanish
Markets and Competition Commission have cleared the acquisition of Just Eat Shares by MIH under
the Spanish Competition Act.

This is an important milestone that further increases deal certainty of the Increased Offer following
yesterday’s reduction of the Acceptance Condition to a simple majority of the Just Eat Shares (50 per
cent. plus one Just Eat Share). In contrast, the Takeaway.com Offer remains subject to a 75 per cent.
acceptance condition and the approval of Takeaway.com’s own shareholders, and there can be no
certainty that the higher acceptance condition and/or shareholder approval will be obtained. The
Increased Offer is therefore clearly superior to the Takeaway.com Offer both in terms of value offered
and deal certainty.

Commenting on the receipt of clearance, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“We are pleased to have cleared the competition hurdle which further underlines the certainty and
deliverability of our superior cash offer of 740p per share to Just Eat Shareholders.”

                                               
The Increased Offer remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the remaining Conditions set out
in the increased offer document dated 10 December 2019 in respect of the Increased Offer (the
Increased Offer Document).

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document.

A copy of this announcement  will be available on  Prosus’s  website at

Restricted Jurisdictions.

Overseas shareholders

The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in, and the availability of the Increased
Offer to persons who are residents, citizens or nationals of, jurisdictions other than England and
Wales and the Netherlands may be restricted by law and regulation and therefore any persons into
whose possession this announcement comes who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United Kingdom and the Netherlands should inform themselves about and observe any
applicable requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United
Kingdom or the Netherlands, or who are subject to the laws of another jurisdiction, to participate in the
Increased Offer or to accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased Offer, may be affected by the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Just Eat Shareholders who are in any
doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent financial adviser in their
relevant jurisdiction without delay. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a
violation of the laws and/or regulation of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the companies and other persons involved in the Increased Offer disclaim any
responsibility or liability for any violation of such restrictions by any person.

This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City
Code, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the
information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this
announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and
Wales and/or the Netherlands.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

                                                  
Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Original Offer Document.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and    will    be    available   on    the    London    Stock    Exchange     website    at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.

                                                   
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service    and      will  be      available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Original Offer Document and the Increased
Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to financial
information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will                                                    
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

                                                   
An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

                    PUBLICATION OF THE INCREASED OFFER DOCUMENT


Further to the announcement by Prosus N.V. (Prosus) on 9 December 2019 relating to the increased
offer by its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH) to acquire the
entire issued and to be issued share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Increased Offer), Prosus
announces that the offer document containing full terms and conditions of the Increased Offer and the
procedures for its acceptance (the Increased Offer Document) is being published and posted to the
shareholders of Just Eat today, together with, in the case of Just Eat Shareholders holding Just Eat
Shares in certificated form, the related Second Form of Acceptance to accept the Increased Offer.
The Increased Offer Document will also be published on Prosus’s website at
www.prosus.com/investors/justeat. The Increased Offer is subject to the terms and conditions set out
in the Increased Offer Document and the Second Form of Acceptance. The Increased Offer is a
revision to the Offer and should be construed accordingly.

The level of acceptances required to satisfy the Acceptance Condition of the Increased Offer has
been reduced to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of the Just Eat Shares.

To accept the Increased Offer in respect of certificated Just Eat Shares, the Second Form of
Acceptance accompanying this Document should be completed, signed and returned to
Computershare at Corporate Actions Projects, Bristol, BS99 6AH or by hand to

sponsor as only your CREST sponsor will be able to send the necessary TTE Instruction to
Euroclear.

Just Eat Shareholders who have previously accepted the Original Offer will automatically be
deemed to have accepted the terms of the Increased Offer by virtue of their prior acceptance
and, therefore, such Just Eat Shareholders need not take any further action.

If you have any questions relating to this announcement or the Offer Document, please contact the
Receiving Agent, Computershare on 0370 707 1066, (if calling within the UK) or on +44 370 707 1066

event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) on 27 December 2019.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set
out in the Increased Offer Document in respect of the Offer (including words or expressions defined in
the Increased Offer Document by reference to the Offer Document).

The Increased Offer Document also includes corrected share of orders from Low Competition Markets
for Takeaway.com for H1 2019 (69% as compared to 65% stated previously) and for a combination of
Takeaway.com and Just Eat for H1 2019 (27% as compared to 28% stated previously). These
corrected percentages highlight an even stronger decrease in the share of Low Competition Markets
for the combined entity.

The receipt of cash pursuant to the Increased Offer by Just Eat Shareholders may be a taxable
transaction under applicable national, state and local, as well as foreign and other tax laws. Each Just
Eat Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to him.

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law
and regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or
indirectly in, into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile,
e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of
any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to
do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of
the Increased Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction
or where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be
capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a
Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of
that jurisdiction. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and any documentation relating to the
Increased Offer are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted or otherwise
forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction
where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents
(including agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute
or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction where to do so
would violate the laws in that jurisdiction. If the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme
(unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), no person may vote in favour of the
Scheme by any use, means, instrumentality or form and the Increased Offer will not be capable of
acceptance from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, if to do so would
constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction.

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or
citizens of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11
November 2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United
States by MIH and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their
respective affiliates will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

                                                  
The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange
Act, MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make
certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the
Increased Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for
acceptance (or, if the Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the
Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to
purchase were to be made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at
prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law,
including, to the extent applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in accordance with normal UK practice and consistent
with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and their affiliates may continue to act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares
on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain other purchasing activities consistent with their
respective normal and usual practice and applicable law. Any information about such purchases will
be disclosed as required in the UK and the United States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information
Service     and     will   be     available   on    the    London    Stock     Exchange      website   at
www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made public in the United
Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019
and the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and
under applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United
States and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of
the Netherlands and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are
residents of countries other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat, or any of their respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US
securities laws. It may be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors,
officers and affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is
substantial doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws
and judgments of a US court.



                                               
Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United
States or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the
tender offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the
case may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

Forward looking statements

This Announcement contains certain statements that are or may be forward looking statements,
including with respect to the Increased Offer. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature
and are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations,
targets, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks
and uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the
future results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All
statements other than statements of historical facts included in this announcement may be forward
looking statements. Without limitation, forward looking statements often include words such as
“targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “hopes”, “continues”, “expects”, “is expected”, “objective”, “outlook”,
”risk”, “seeks”, “aims”, “intends”, “will”, “may”, “should”, “would”, “could”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “will
look to”, “budget”, “strategy”, “would look to”, “scheduled”, “goal”, “prepares”, “forecasts”, “cost-
saving”, “is subject to”, “synergy”, “projects” or words or terms of similar substance or the negative
thereof, as well as variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might”, “probably” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding
future expectations.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of
such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-
looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement.
Any forward-looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as
of the date of this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH
respectively and no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been
correct.

No forward-looking or other statements have been reviewed by the auditors of Prosus, MIH or Just
Eat. All forward looking statements contained in this announcement and all subsequent oral or written
forward-looking statements attributable to Prosus, MIH or Just Eat or their respective members,
directors, officers, advisers or employees or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement. None of Prosus,
MIH or Just Eat, or any of their respective members, associates or directors, officers or advisers and
any person acting on behalf of one or more of them, provides any representation, warranty,
assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward looking
statements in this announcement will actually occur. Other than in accordance with their legal or
                                                    
regulatory obligations (including under the City Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules), no member of the Prosus Group is under, or undertakes, any obligation,
and each of the foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from
operations, free cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group
(as applicable) for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic
published cash flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just
Eat, Prosus, MIH or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of
relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror
other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely
in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period
and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a)
applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a
securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must
instead make a Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of
any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant
securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must
contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and
rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed
under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no
later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If
two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or
informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities
exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at
www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the
offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel’s
Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are
required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


STATEMENT REGARDING TAKEAWAY.COM N.V. (“TAKEAWAY.COM”) INVESTOR CIRCULAR

The boards of Prosus N.V. (“Prosus”) and MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (“MIH”) note the release
this morning of an investor circular by Takeaway.com.

The investor circular includes the implausible claim that Just Eat’s shares could have an illustrative
trading value of up to around £11 under the Takeaway.com Offer. This is based on the unsubstantiated
claim that the combined business of Just Eat and Takeaway.com (the “Combined Group”) could re-rate
to Takeaway.com’s average trading revenue multiple since IPO of 8.3x.

Prosus believes that the combination could be highly value destructive. Given that Just Eat’s revenues
would account for 73% of the Combined Group’s business, and a significantly reduced proportion of
Combined Group’s business would operate in Low Competition Markets, Prosus believes that Just Eat’s
trading multiple would be much more relevant to the trading level of the Combined Group than
Takeaway.com’s above market multiple. If the Combined Group were to re-rate to Just Eat’s trading
revenue multiple prior to Prosus’s approach of 3.3x, the illustrative trading value of Just Eat’s shares
would be around £4 per share(1). Based on this calculation, the illustrative value of Takeaway.com’s
shares would be €47 per share(1). Prosus believes that this would be consistent with trends in other
comparable food delivery businesses. It would also represent a premium to GrubHub’s trading revenue
multiple of 2.9x.

Relative to these two potential outcomes, which in themselves illustrate the significant uncertainties for
shareholders presented by the Takeaway.com Offer, Prosus’s Increased Offer of £7.40 provides
compelling value and certainty to Just Eat’s shareholders.

Furthermore, Prosus believes that it is illogical for Takeaway.com to refer to Prosus’s Increased Offer
as “derisory”, when its own, inherently more risky offer, comes at a significant discount to Prosus’s
Increased Offer.

Capitalised terms in this announcement, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out
in Prosus’s offer document dated 11 November 2019 in respect of the Offer.


(1)Illustrative valuation on the basis of a number of assumptions that are detailed in Sources and Bases. This is not an asset
valuation for the purposes of Rule 29 of the City Code.

2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United States by MIH
and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their respective affiliates
will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Increased
Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes
effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be
made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in
private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required
in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be
available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in
accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their affiliates may continue to
act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain
other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal and usual practice and applicable
law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the United
States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock
Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made
public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.

No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements

announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH
or Naspers or the Enlarged Group (as applicable).

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant

offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies

identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent

whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror

      i.   Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           calculated as:

               a. Takeaway.com’s expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of
                  £467m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular dated 9 December

     ii.   Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) £5,693m is calculated
           as Combined Group expected revenue for the year ended 31 December 2020 of £1,740m
           multiplied by a 3.3x multiple based on Just Eat’s enterprise value / 2020 revenue as at 21
           October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement).

    iii.   Combined Group net debt of £267m sourced from the Takeaway.com Investor Circular
           dated 9 December 2019.

    iv.    Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m is calculated as
           Combined Group enterprise value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,693m less
           Combined Group net debt of £267m.

     v.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m is calculated as Just Eat Shareholders’ share of the Combined
           Group of 52.12% sourced and based in paragraph 19.2(C)(i) multiplied by the Combined
           Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost benefits) of £5,426m.

    vi.    Just Eat Shareholders’ share in the Combined Group equity value (pre-NPV of net cost
           benefits) of £2,828m divided by the fully diluted share capital of Just Eat of 687,107,905
           shares outstanding is equal to 412p.

   (b) Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

    vii.   Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
           US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
           US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million.

   viii.   2020 revenue reflects the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million.

   (e) The value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 6 December 2019 of 710 pence per Just Eat Share
       is obtained by:

     xi.    dividing Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €86.50 as at 6 December 2019 (being the last

            rate of £:€ of £1:€1.187 as at 6 December 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the
            date of the Increased Offer announcement) as derived from data provided by Bloomberg;

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

9 December 2019


Increased cash offer for JUST EAT PLC by MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V.
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Prosus N.V.


1.      Increased Cash Offer

On 22 October 2019, Prosus N.V. (Prosus) announced the terms of a cash offer by its wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary MIH Food Delivery Holdings B.V. (MIH), to acquire the entire issued and to be issued
share capital of Just Eat plc (Just Eat) (the Offer Announcement). On 11 November 2019, the Offer
Document setting out the full terms and conditions of the Offer was published.

Today, Prosus is pleased to announce the terms of an increased cash offer for the entire issued and to
be issued share capital of Just Eat by MIH (the Increased Offer).

Under the terms of the Increased Offer, Just Eat Shareholders will be entitled to receive:

                             740 pence in cash for each Just Eat Share

The terms of the Increased Offer value the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Just
Eat at approximately £5.1 billion and represent a premium of approximately:

•       25.6 per cent. to the Closing Price of 589 pence per Just Eat Share on 21 October 2019 (being
        the last Business Day before the date of the Offer Announcement); and

•       24.6 per cent. to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer of 594 pence per Just Eat Share based
        on Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 on 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day
        before the date of the Offer Announcement);


                                                  
MIH also announces today that it has reduced the level of acceptances required to satisfy the
Acceptance Condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share) of Just Eat Shares,
thereby significantly increasing deal certainty.

As a consequence of today’s announcement, the closing date of the Increased Offer has been extended
to 1.00 p.m. on 27 December 2019.

Save as set out in this announcement, the Increased Offer is subject to the same terms and conditions
as the Offer. The Increased Offer is a revision to the Offer and should be construed accordingly.

Commenting on the Increased Offer, Bob van Dijk, the Group CEO of Prosus said:

“Following the announcement of our offer, we have had the opportunity to listen to the views of Just Eat
Shareholders, share our perspective on the global food delivery sector and reflect on the
unquestionable challenges Just Eat faces, as clearly seen in its Q3 results. We have also had extensive
discussions with our own shareholders with regards to our long term strategy for food delivery and Just
Eat’s role within that. We continue to believe in the sector and, as we have demonstrated in Brazil, if
you act decisively and invest effectively in technology as well as the opportunities of own-delivery, then
you can build an attractive growth business that is equipped to win in the long-term. We believe the
investment required is substantial and this impacts our view of potential returns. As disciplined investors
we obviously need to factor the required investment into our value considerations.

Just Eat is a quality business, which we believe has all the ingredients to be transformed into a long-
term sector winner. In recognition of this potential, we have decided to increase our offer to 740 pence
per share, which we believe provides Just Eat Shareholders with compelling value and therefore good
reason to accept our all-cash offer. Unlike the Takeaway.com Offer, which relies on shares remaining
at an above sector multiple, our cash offer provides certainty of value to Just Eat Shareholders. We
urge shareholders to accept our offer, as it is the only one that delivers certainty in the face of undeniable
industry change.”

2.      Overview of the Increased Offer

Following Prosus’s offer for Just Eat, Prosus’s management have had extensive discussions with Just
Eat Shareholders to explain the rationale for the Offer and the compelling value it represents. Prosus’s
management have also had extensive discussions with Prosus’s own shareholders, including at
Prosus’s recent Capital Markets Day with regards to Prosus’s long-term strategy for food delivery and
Just Eat’s role in this strategy.

Prosus continues to believe that Just Eat is an attractive business, albeit one that requires investment
which has now also been acknowledged by the Just Eat Board, which Prosus has taken into account
when assessing the targeted return on investment for its shareholders and the price it can justify offering
for Just Eat.

Following careful consideration, and in the interest of bringing the process to a close, Prosus has
decided to increase its offer to 740 pence per Just Eat Share in cash, whilst also reducing its acceptance
condition to a simple majority (50 per cent. plus one Just Eat Share). Prosus believes the Increased
Offer underscores its commitment to the transaction and constitutes attractive and certain value for Just
Eat Shareholders, while allowing Prosus to target appropriate risk-adjusted returns for its own
shareholders.

The Increased Offer is at a 25.6 per cent premium to Just Eat’s closing share price on 21 October 2019
(the last Business Day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement), which Prosus believes
compares favourably with precedent premia for such transactions in a UK context when taking into
account that the Just Eat share price on the day before the Offer Announcement (21 October 2019) of
589 pence already included a premium from the Takeaway.com Offer. The Increased Offer also
represents a 10.4 per cent. premium to the initial offer of 670p made to the Just Eat Board by Prosus.
Further, the value of the Increased Offer comes at a premium to the value of the Takeaway.com Offer
when it was announced of 731 pence, which was recommended by the Just Eat Board. Prosus
encourages the Just Eat Board to recognise the superior value of Prosus’s Increased Offer.

The Increased Offer is superior to the look through value of the Takeaway.com Offer and provides
certainty of value for Just Eat Shareholders, in contrast to the significant risks associated with swapping
into the shares of a company currently trading on a revenue multiple 3 times higher than Just Eat’s own
unaffected multiple.

2.1       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides compelling and certain value for a business that is
          facing substantial challenges

While Prosus believes Just Eat is an attractive business with strong long-term potential, it is currently
facing significant challenges. Just Eat’s historically strong market positions are being eroded by
intensifying competition in the UK and other core markets, including Spain and Italy, with market share
loss recently accelerating in a number of markets. Just Eat has seen UK year-on-year order growth
deteriorate substantially from 30.9 per cent. in 2016 to 8 per cent. in Q3 2019 and UK EBITDA margin
decrease from 51.4 per cent. in 2016 to 35.2 per cent. in H1 2019. Just Eat has lost its leading position
in five of its thirteen markets. Unsurprisingly, shareholder returns have similarly suffered - over the last
two years Just Eat has delivered a negative shareholder return of -15.6 per cent. (versus +4.3 per cent.
for FTSE 350).

While the Just Eat price on the day before the date of the Prosus Offer Announcement (21 October
2019) was 589 pence, in Prosus’s view there is significant further downside risk to this share price. The
Just Eat Board has now acknowledged that increased investment is required and that this “may impact”
profitability. This statement was made after Prosus’s Offer Announcement and is not reflected in the
current Just Eat share price, which Prosus believes has decoupled from fundamentals and is currently
trading on M&A speculation. In a comparable context, Grubhub has seen significant derating, and is
now trading at 2.9x 2020 revenues – if Just Eat were trading at this multiple, the illustrative share price
would be 526 pence to which Prosus’s Increased Offer represents an illustrative 40.7 per cent. premium
(calculated by multiplying Just Eat’s consensus 2020 revenue by 2.9x and applying Just Eat’s enterprise
value to equity bridge of -£31 million to get an illustrative equity value of £3,614 million, then dividing by
Just Eat’s fully diluted shares of 687 million to get an illustrative share price of 526 pence per share).(1)

Prosus believes Takeaway.com’s claims about the lack of comparability between Just Eat’s and
Grubhub’s situations are flawed and fail to appreciate the competitive dynamics the two companies are
facing. Both companies are marketplace incumbents with a history of market leadership and strong
profitability. Both have been disrupted by intensifying competition from well-funded and rapidly growing
entrants operating an own-delivery led model. Despite attempts to defend their position by rolling out
own-delivery operations both companies have continued to lose market share and experience slowing
growth and decreased profitability.

2.2       Prosus’s Increased Offer takes into account significant investments required in own-
          delivery, product, technology and marketing

Prosus believes Just Eat has underinvested in addressing the challenges outlined above, with only £51
million invested in growth initiatives in 2018, substantially less than peers including iFood, Grubhub and


(1)    This calculation is illustrative and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or profit forecast under
       the Takeover Code

                                                        
Delivery Hero. Prosus believes that this underinvestment has prevented Just Eat from effectively
transitioning to a hybrid model.

In Prosus’s view the 25 per cent. share of own-delivery orders that the Just Eat Board quotes masks
Just Eat’s lack of traction with its own-delivery rollout as it represents a blend of Canada (acquired by
Just Eat in December 2016) with 100 per cent. own-delivery and other geographies where own-delivery
represented only 7.8 per cent. of orders in H1 2019. Notably, within Just Eat’s portfolio, Canada (100
per cent. own-delivery), and Brazil (greater than 20 per cent. own-delivery) exhibit vastly superior growth
compared to other assets such as UK, Spain and Italy where Just Eat is losing market share at an
accelerating pace to own-delivery competitors with a superior customer proposition.

Just Eat’s track record in Australia and New Zealand starkly demonstrates how underinvestment can
erode value. Just Eat acquired Menulog in May 2015 for £421 million. Prosus believes Menulog was
slow to react to the intensifying competitive pressure after Deliveroo and Uber Eats entered the market,
investing less than £10 million in 2018 to enhance its proposition. As a result, Menulog lost market
leadership and market share and suffered declining revenue. In 2017 Just Eat incurred a £180 million
impairment relating to Menulog, and current broker consensus for Menulog’s SOTP value is £104
million, 75 per cent. below the acquisition price.

This is in contrast to Brazil, where, with Prosus’s operating support and investment (in 2018, Prosus
announced an additional investment commitment of US$400 million in iFood) in partnership with Just
Eat, iFood has been able to swiftly react to competitive pressures, rapidly building out its own-delivery
capabilities and accelerating its growth.

As consistently stated by Prosus, and now acknowledged by Just Eat’s Board, Just Eat requires
increased investment, which Prosus intends to make in own-delivery, marketing, product and
technology. This investment need is taken into account in the value of the Increased Offer.

2.3       Prosus’s Increased Offer provides certainty whilst the Takeaway.com Offer carries
          significant risks for Just Eat Shareholders

The Takeaway.com Offer carries significant risk for Just Eat Shareholders with Takeaway.com’s current
share price of €86.50 marginally below its all-time high. Takeaway.com is trading at 9.9x 2020E
enterprise value/revenue, two to three times the level of peers. This is in the context of Takeaway.com’s
Q3 2019 order growth slowing to 15 per cent. for the Netherlands and 21 per cent. for Germany (by
comparison, Prosus’s food assets are growing at 320 per cent. for Swiggy, 122 per cent. for iFood and
92 per cent. for Delivery Hero). At these valuation levels, Prosus believes that there is little room for
execution missteps, further growth slowdown or increased competition.

Immediately prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price
was €44.90. Prosus believes that one of the key drivers of Takeaway.com’s strong share price
performance since the transaction has been an increase in the share of orders from Low Competition
Markets, which has increased from 37 per cent. in the nine months to September 2018 to 65 per cent.
in H1 2019. Combining with Just Eat would reduce Takeaway.com’s share of orders in Low Competition
Markets to 28 per cent.,(2) which is materially below pre-Germany deal levels. Prosus believes that this
indicates that there is a very meaningful downside risk to the valuation of the combined entity.

The limited synergies that Takeaway.com and Just Eat have announced represent just 1.6 per cent. of
the combined cost base. These limited synergies do not, in Prosus’s view, compensate for the risks
outlined above. These synergies also primarily come from “operational and technology efficiency”,
which Prosus believes relies on the 3 per cent. headcount reductions referenced by Takeaway.com.
This is in contrast to Prosus’s focus on investment.

(2)   Based on H1 2019 orders


2.4     Takeaway.com’s playbook developed in Germany and the Netherlands would not
        address Just Eat’s challenges

Prosus believes that Takeaway.com takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally
on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany. These markets have so far been relatively insulated
from innovative and well-funded global own-delivery competitors meaning Takeaway.com has limited
experience of competing against own-delivery players operating at scale.

In contrast, in the UK both Uber Eats and Deliveroo have been operating at scale for years with large
and growing market share and consumers have come to expect the superior selection and service
quality these platforms deliver. As just one example, 20 of the Tripadvisor top 50 ranked restaurants in
London are listed on Deliveroo or Uber Eats, compared to six of 50 listed on Just Eat. Prosus believes
this illustrates the ability of innovative own-delivery platforms to unlock superior selection for customers,
leading to increasing variety / frequency of delivery occasions and ultimately superior growth compared
to underinvesting marketplace incumbents.

Prosus believes that the severe market share loss suffered by Menulog in Australia at the hands of the
same two own-delivery competitors provides a cautionary tale for Just Eat in the UK and other markets.
If the consumer demand for superior selection and service quality provided through the own-delivery
model is not addressed, then Just Eat Shareholders may well face the same reality of meaningful
market share loss and value erosion, but on a much larger scale.

Prosus does not believe Takeaway.com is well-positioned to help Just Eat address this challenge. In
both Berlin and Amsterdam, Takeaway.com offers only four of the Tripadvisor top 50 restaurants on its
platforms. While this marketplace-driven approach has so far worked in Takeaway.com’s markets given
the absence or lack of focus of global own-delivery competitors, Prosus believes the UK situation is
different and Takeaway.com’s playbook will not help address the significantly higher customer
expectations in Just Eat’s markets.

2.5     Takeaway.com is not the right partner to help Just Eat transition to an own-delivery
        focused hybrid model

The Just Eat Board is now acknowledging that building a hybrid own-delivery / marketplace model is
required for long-term success. Takeaway.com has very limited own-delivery experience and no
meaningful track record, with an own-delivery order share of just 4.9 per cent. Takeaway.com’s
management has repeatedly stated that it believes own-delivery to be an inferior business model that
cannot be profitable, which in Prosus’s view is not true and reflects Takeaway.com’s lack of own-
delivery experience and narrow view of the food delivery industry restricted to the European markets
Takeaway.com operates in. Prosus is confident that the own-delivery model is profitable at scale, as
shown by the performance of Swiggy, Just Eat Canada, Meituan Dianping and Wolt, which profitably
operates an own-delivery model in a number of European markets.

Furthermore, Just Eat and Takeaway.com appear not to be aligned on own-delivery strategy. Just Eat
plans to leverage their “world-class Skip technology and operational know-how to build own-delivery
capabilities” while Takeaway.com intends to roll-out its “Scoober restaurant delivery services in the UK”.
Just Eat and Takeaway.com also appear to disagree on the expected impact of such growth
investments on profitability. Just Eat acknowledges the potentially negative impact on profitability, whilst
Takeaway.com claims that the roll out of own delivery (Scoober) will have “no material negative impact
on the bottom line”.

                                                    
These contradictions demonstrate the reactive nature of Just Eat and Takeaway.com’s response to the
changing dynamics in the sector raised by Prosus and represent a lack of strategic alignment and
consistency, highlighting the operational execution risk attached to Takeaway.com’s offer. In contrast,
Prosus has been consistent throughout in its stated strategy for Just Eat.

Prosus believes that its initial Offer to Just Eat Shareholders provided fair and certain value.
The Increased Offer provides even more compelling and certain value for Just Eat’s
Shareholders at a further premium to Takeaway.com’s all-share offer, which comes with
significant risk.

Just Eat Shareholders are urged to accept the Increased Offer as soon as possible and, in any
event, by no later than 1.00 p.m. (London time) 27 December 2019.

3.      Financing of the Increased Offer

The cash consideration payable by MIH pursuant to the Increased Offer will be financed by a bridge
loan agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV,
Citibank, N.A., London Branch, Citibank, N.A., Jersey Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.a., Filiale Frankfurt am Main as original
lenders (the Original Lenders), providing for a term loan bridge facility. The proceeds of the bridge
facility will be used to fund the cash consideration payable by MIH to Just Eat Shareholders in
connection with the Increased Offer. Prosus has secured the fully committed bridge financing from the
Original Lenders.

J.P. Morgan Cazenove, as financial adviser to Prosus and MIH, is satisfied that the resources available
to MIH are sufficient to enable it to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable to Just Eat Shareholders
under the terms of the Increased Offer.

4.      How to accept the Increased Offer

A revised offer document (the Revised Offer Document) containing the full terms of, and conditions

As at 3.00 p.m. on 6 December 2019, MIH had received valid acceptances of the Offer in respect of
12,295 Just Eat Shares representing approximately 0.0018 per cent. of the current issued share capital
of Just Eat, all of which may count towards the Acceptance Condition. MIH does not own any Just Eat
Shares.

This Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the City

Unless otherwise determined by MIH or required by the City Code, and permitted by applicable law and
regulation, the Increased Offer is not being made and will not be made available directly or indirectly in,
into or from or by any use, means, instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a

violate the laws of that jurisdiction. No person may accept or procure the acceptance of the Increased
Offer by any use, means, instrumentality of, or from within, any Restricted Jurisdiction or where to do
so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction, and the Increased Offer will not be capable of acceptance
by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or, from or within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any
other jurisdiction, if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Accordingly,

Further details in relation to Just Eat Shareholders who are resident in, ordinarily resident in, or citizens
of, jurisdictions outside England and Wales is contained in the Offer Document dated 11 November
2019.

Notice to US investors

The Increased Offer is being made to Just Eat Shareholders resident in the United States in reliance
on, and compliance with, the applicable US tender offer rules, including Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act, and Regulation 14E thereunder. The Increased Offer is being made in the United States by MIH
and no one else. None of J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley or any of their respective affiliates
will be making the Increased Offer in or outside the United States.

The Increased Offer relates to the shares of a UK incorporated company and is subject to disclosure
and other procedural requirements, which are different from certain United States disclosure and
procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement
procedures and timing of payments.

                                                   
Furthermore, the payment and settlement procedure with respect to the Increased Offer will comply
with the relevant United Kingdom rules, which differ from US payment and settlement procedures,
particularly with regard to the date of payment of consideration.

In accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
MIH, certain affiliated companies and their nominees or brokers (acting as agents) may make certain
purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares in Just Eat other than pursuant to the Increased
Offer, before or during the period in which the Increased Offer remains open for acceptance (or, if the
Increased Offer is implemented by way of a Scheme, until the date on which the Scheme becomes
effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn). If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be
made they would be made outside the United States either in the open market at prevailing prices or in
private transactions at negotiated prices and would comply with applicable law, including, to the extent
applicable, the US Exchange Act. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required
in the UK and the Unites States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be
available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. In addition, in
accordance with normal UK practice and consistent with Rule 14e-5(b) under the US Exchange Act,
J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and their affiliates may continue to
act as exempt principal traders in Just Eat Shares on the London Stock Exchange and engage in certain
other purchasing activities consistent with their respective normal and usual practice and applicable
law. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK and the United
States, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock
Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. To the extent that such information is made
public in the United Kingdom, it will also be publicly disclosed in the United States.

Financial information included in this announcement, the Offer Document dated 11 November 2019 and
the Revised Offer Document has been or will have been prepared in accordance with accounting
standards applicable in the UK and the Netherlands, as applicable, and may not be comparable to
financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

The receipt of consideration by a US holder for the transfer of its Just Eat Shares pursuant to the
Increased Offer may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under
applicable United States state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws. Each Just Eat
Shareholder is urged to consult their independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax
consequences of the Increased Offer applicable to them, including under applicable United States
federal, state and local, as well as non-US and other, tax laws.

It may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights, effect service of process within the United States
and/or enforce any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Just Eat is incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. Prosus and MIH are organised under the laws of the Netherlands
and the majority of the officers and directors of Just Eat, Prosus and MIH are residents of countries
other than the United States. It may not be possible to sue Prosus, MIH or Just Eat, or any of their
respective directors, officers or affiliates, in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel Prosus, MIH, Just Eat and their respective directors, officers and affiliates to
subject themselves to the jurisdiction and judgment of a US court. There is substantial doubt as to the
enforceability in the United Kingdom of original actions, or of actions for enforcement of judgments of
US courts, based on civil liability provisions of US federal securities laws and judgments of a US court.

Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has
approved or disapproved the Increased Offer, or passed upon the fairness of the Increased Offer or
passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offence in the United States.


                                                  
No offer to acquire securities or to exchange securities for other securities has been made, or will be
made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by the use of the mails of, or by any means or instrumentality
of interstate or foreign commerce or any facilities of a national securities exchange of, the United States
or any other country in which such offer may not be made other than: (i) in accordance with the tender
offer requirements under the Exchange Act, or the securities laws of such other country, as the case
may be; or (ii) pursuant to an available exemption from such requirements.

are not based on current or historical facts, but rather on assumptions, expectations, valuations, targets,
estimates, forecasts and projections about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from the future
results, performance or events expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. All statements

statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Any forward-
looking statements made in this announcement on behalf of Prosus or MIH are made as of the date of
this announcement based on the opinions and estimates of directors of Prosus or MIH respectively and
no assurance can be given that such opinions or estimates will prove to have been correct.

foregoing expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking

No profit forecasts or estimates

No statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this
announcement is intended as or shall be deemed to be a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No
statement in, or referred to in, this announcement or incorporated by reference into this announcement
should be interpreted to mean that income of persons (where relevant), cash flow from operations, free
cash flow, earnings or earnings per share for Just Eat, Prosus or the Enlarged Group (as applicable)
for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historic published cash
flow from operations, free cash flow, earnings, earnings per share or dividend for Just Eat, Prosus, MIH

Disclosure requirements of the City Code

Under Rule 8.3(a) of the City Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant

offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must
make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of an offer period and, if later,
following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person’s interests and short positions in,
and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any
securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies
must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the 10th business day following the
commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the
10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first
identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities
exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a
Dealing Disclosure. Under Rule 8.3(b) of the City Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in
1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange
offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree
company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing
concerned and of the person’s interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant
securities of each of: (i) the offeree company; and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent
that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to
whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 p.m. (London time) on the business day
following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement
or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of
an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the
purpose of Rule 8.3.

Opening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and
Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons
acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). Details of the offeree and offeror
companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing
Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel’s website at

                                                 APPENDIX 1

                                           SOURCES AND BASES

(a)         All prices and Closing Prices for Just Eat Shares are closing middle market quotations derived
            from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List (SEDOL).

(b)         All prices and Closing Prices for Takeaway.com Shares are closing middle market quotations
            derived from the Euronext Amsterdam Daily Official List.

(c)         The aggregate value of the Increased Offer Consideration of approximately £5.1 billion is
            calculated by multiplying the offered amount of 740 pence in cash per Just Eat Share by Just
            Eat’s fully diluted share capital (as referred to below).

(d)         The fully diluted share capital of Just Eat is 687,127,131 shares (as published by Just Eat in its
            circular to shareholders dated 25 November 2019).

(e)         The references made to Just Eat’s Board acknowledging the need for additional investment
            refer to the Chairman’s Letter as published by Just Eat in the circular to its shareholders dated
            25 November 2019.

(f)         The values of the Takeaway.com Offer are calculated as:

      i.         the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 21 October 2019 of 594 pence per Just Eat
                 Share is obtained by:

            a)       dividing Takeaway.com’s Closing Price of €71.00 as at 21 October 2019 (being the last
                     Business Day prior to the date of the Offer Announcement) by the exchange rate of £:€
                     of £1:€1.165 as at 21 October 2019 (being the last Business Day prior to the date of
                     the Offer Announcement) as derived from data provided by Bloomberg; and

            b)       multiplying the number obtained by the exchange ratio of 0.09744 Takeaway.com
                     Shares per Just Eat Share as set out in the announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the
                     City Code released on 5 August 2019 in connection with the Takeaway.com Offer; and

      ii.        the value of the Takeaway.com Offer as at 26 July 2019 of 731 pence is taken from the
                 announcement pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the City Code released on 5 August 2019 in
                 connection with the Takeaway.com Offer.

(g)         Grubhub's enterprise value / 2020 revenue is based on:

      i.         Grubhub’s enterprise value of US$4,199 million is calculated as Grubhub's equity value of
                 US$3,882 million (based on diluted shares outstanding of 94.7 million and share price of
                 US$41.01 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of US$317 million. 2020 revenue reflects
                 the Capital IQ broker consensus of US$1,461 million; and

      ii.        the illustrative value of Just Eat at the Grubhub 2020 enterprise value / revenue multiples
                 is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a valuation estimate or
                 profit forecast under the Takeover Code. It is calculated by applying Grubhub’s enterprise
                 value / 2020 revenue multiple (as calculated above) of 2.9x to Just Eat’s 2020 consensus
                 revenue of £1,276 million (as detailed below) to obtain an illustrative enterprise value of
                 £3,699 million, and using net debt of £32 million, and other adjustments of £(63) million to
                 obtain an illustrative equity value of £3,614 million. Dividing by shares outstanding of 687
                 million obtains the illustrative share price of 526 pence per share.

                                                     
(h)          Shareholder returns have been sourced from Bloomberg and reference the period from 21
             October 2016 to 21 October 2019.

(i)          Prior to acquiring Delivery Hero’s German assets in 2018, Takeaway.com’s share price was
             €44.90 (as at 20 December 2018).

(j)          Just Eat invested £51 million in growth initiatives in 2018 according to their H1 2019 investor
             presentation. This compares to a US$400 million multi-year investment commitment
             announced in November 2018 for iFood, US$200 million in marketing and delivery expansion
             in 2018 for Grubhub, and €350 million in growth initiatives in 2019 for Delivery Hero.

(k)          The less than £10 million investment in Menulog by Just Eat referenced by Prosus is calculated
             as their £19 million investment in Canada and Australia announced in Just Eat’s 2018 annual
             report, less the £12 million uEBITDA loss in Canada reported in their 2018 annual report. The
             Menulog writedown of £180 million was reported in Just Eat’s 2017 annual report. Menulog’s
             broker valuation of £104 million is the arithmetic average of the value assigned to Australia and
             New Zealand by those brokers available to Prosus which provide an SOTP valuation of Just
             Eat dated after 31 July 2019 (that being the date of Just Eat’s H1 2019 results). These brokers
             include:

       i.        Barclays (1 August 2019), Exane BNP Paribas (30 October 2019) and Macquarie (6 August
                 2019);

      ii.        the minimum ANZ valuation estimate per the consensus is £76 million, the maximum is
                 £128 million, and the arithmetic average is £104 million; and

      iii.       in accordance with Rule 28.8(c) of the City Code, the consensus estimates are not shown
                 with the agreement or the approval of Takeaway.com.

(l)          The source for Just Eat own-delivery orders referenced by Prosus is Just Eat’s H1 2019 results
             presentation.

             H1 2019 results presentation.

(n)          Takeaway.com all time high share price is based on €86.85 (30 August 2019) which is defined
             as the highest Close Price on any given day after its first trading day following IPO on 30
             September 2016.

             enterprise value of €5,481 million is calculated as Takeaway.com's equity value of €5,294
             million (based on total shares outstanding of 61.2 million as per the Just Eat Scheme Document
             and share price of €86.50 as at 6 December 2019) plus net debt of €166 million, and other
             adjustments of €21 million. 2020 revenue reflects the arithmetic average broker consensus of
             €556 million as defined above.
