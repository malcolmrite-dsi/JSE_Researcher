(1) Starting 2013, the non-loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to a
10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.

(2) This value is currently 11.000% (May 2020: 10.500%) of risk-weighted
assets, being the Basel global minimum requirement of 8.000%, the Capital
Conservation Buffer of 2.500% and the Domestic Systemically Important
Bank(“D-SIB”) capital add-on of 0.500%, disclosable in terms of Directive 4
issued by the Prudential Authority on 27 August 2020. Directive 4 has
replaced Directive 6 of 2016 and requires banks to publicly disclose their D-
SIB capital add-on as part of their composition of regulatory capital
disclosure. In terms of the regulations relating to banks the Individual
Capital Requirement (“ICR”) is excluded.

The Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 on 6 April 2020 and temporarily
relaxed the Pillar 2A South African country-specific buffer of 1.00% to
provide temporary capital relief to banks during this time of financial
stress following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, in a manner that
ensures South Africa’s continued compliance with the relevant internationally
agreed capital framework.

(2) Capitec has a net cash inflow after applying the run-off weightings,
therefore outflows for the purpose of the ratio are deemed to be 25% of gross
outflows. As at 31 August 2020, R534.8 million (31 May 2020: R563.6 million)
of the total net cash outflows is attributable to Mercantile Bank Limited.

(3) The Prudential Authority issued Directive 1 of 2020 on 31 March 2020 and
decreased the minimum LCR requirement on 1 April 2020 from 100% to 80%. The
reason for the decrease is attributable to the current financial market turmoil
where market liquidity has decreased, and banks expected to be under increased
pressure to comply with the currently prescribed LCR requirements.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE 6 MONTHS ENDED
31 AUGUST 2020


1.   SALIENT FEATURES

     Operating profit before tax decreased by 86% to R538 million, from R3.83 billion in the
     prior year.

     Headline earnings per share decreased by 78% to 562 cents per share, from
     2 545 cents per share in the prior year.

     Earnings per share decreased by 79% to 537 cents per share, from 2 549 cents per
     share in the prior year.

     No interim ordinary dividend was declared in the current year compared to 755 cents
     per share in the prior year.

2.   DIVIDEND

     The South African Reserve Bank published Guidance Note 4/2020 on 6 April 2020 in
     which banks were directed to act prudently in preserving capital and focusing on financial
     and economic stability. This was due to the absence of appropriate factual information to
     determine the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the South African economy.
     There was a clear expectation communicated in the Guidance Note that banks should not
     declare ordinary dividends during 2020. The board considered the guidance of the
     Reserve Bank and decided against the declaration of an interim ordinary dividend.

TRADING STATEMENT AND QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE
REGULATIONS RELATING TO BANKS

The COVID-19 national lockdown resulted in increased credit impairment
charges and lower loan sales and transaction volumes, and as a result,
Capitec incurred a loss of R404 million for the quarter ended 31 May 2020.
The impact of the lockdown on the business is detailed below.

Total lending income (including credit life insurance):
The total lending income is 7% below expectation. This is due to retail and
business loan sales being 43% and 25%, respectively, below expectation.

Net funding expense:
The average deposit balance is 7% above expectation. As a result, interest
income on investments was 6% above expectation. There was a decrease of 2.5%
in the repo rate that led to the interest expense being 13.5% lower than
expectation.

Credit impairment charge and provision:
The credit impairment charge is 145% higher than expectation. This is
predominately due to R5.75 billion and R236 million in retail and business
credit balances, respectively, being rescheduled or granted payment breaks
due to the lockdown. These clients were in good standing at the end of
February 2020 and we believe the increased risk is not as high as normally
associated with rescheduled balances.

Due to our conservative approach the group provision for credit impairments
increased by R3.3 billion since February 2020. The tables below show gross
loans and related provisions by category for retail and business banking:

Credit life reinsurance:
The retail bank’s reinsurance agreements expired on 30 April 2020. We self-
insure claims with event dates (i.e. retrenchment notification date, date of
death or date of disability) from 1 May 2020. The reinsurance cover in place
up to 30 April 2020 covers all claims with an event date up to 30 April 2020.
We are negotiating with reinsurance companies for death cover that provides a
meaningful transfer of risk that, given the cost, would be acceptable to both
parties. Our clients continue to be covered for retrenchment, death and
disability. To date we have not seen any significant increase in retrenchment
or death claims.

Net transaction fee and treasury foreign currency income:
The net transaction fee and treasury foreign currency income is 20% below
expectation. Retail transaction volumes are 11.5% below expectation. On a
monthly basis volumes were 2.7% down in March, 25.3% in April and 7.1% in
May. The merchant acquiring business was 33% below expectation.

Banking client behaviour shifted to fewer, higher value transactions during
the quarter and was most severely impacted during level 5 of the lockdown.
Subsequent to level 5 lockdown, volumes improved but have not yet recovered
to pre-lockdown levels.

Funeral insurance:
Funeral insurance income is 17% above expectation, although the number of
policies issued was below expectation. The increase in income is due to an
increase in the average premium, as well as collection rates being above
expectation for April and May. The collection rates increased to above 80%
in May 2020.

Operating expenditure:
Operating expenditure is 12% lower than planned. We will continue to apply a
conservative approach in the management of operating expenditure.

Prospects:
Stricter credit granting criteria were implemented at the start of the
lockdown. As the economic fallout of the lockdown is assessed, credit
granting criteria will be adjusted to reflect market conditions. We
anticipate reaching pre-lockdown credit sales at the start of the next
financial year. We are currently focused on credit pricing and client
experience to stabilise our credit market share.

Repayment of rescheduled loans and commencement of payments after payment
holidays will determine whether we were too conservative or lenient in our
provisioning. The first payment due at the end of June gave a positive
indication, however, July and August payments will clarify the effect.

There will be continued focus on digital innovation. As the country exits
the lockdown we expect transaction volume and revenue to increase, supported
by growth in quality banking clients in both the business and retail banks.

We will continue to launch new products to meet the needs of our clients. We
see an opportunity to grow our business banking footprint and there is still
a focus on building our future business bank.

There is a reasonable degree of certainty that Capitec’s headline earnings
per share and earnings per share will decline by more than 70%, or more than
1782 cents and 1784 cents, respectively, compared to the headline earnings
per share of 2545 cents and earnings per share of 2549 cents for the six
months ended 31 August 2019. We do, however, believe that the results for the
second half of the 2021 financial year could return to normal levels.
We will provide a more specific guidance range when there is reasonable
certainty of the range of headline earnings and earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed and reported on by Capitec’s auditors.

Regulation 43:
Capitec and its subsidiaries (“the group”) have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.


Both Capitec and Capitec Bank Limited (“Capitec Bank”) have maintained
healthy buffers above the minimum capital adequacy requirements, despite the
breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic during the quarter.


The group’s consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
first quarter of the 28 February 2021 financial year are set out below:

(1) Capitec incurred a loss during the 1st Quarter of 2021 which amounted to
R404.1 million. Also included in the movement in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital
for the quarter is the additional phase-in of IFRS 9 in accordance with
Directive 5 of 2017, which amounted to R162.0 million, and amounts arising
from unused tax losses which amounted to R267.8 million. The remainder of the
movement for the quarter relates to movements in intangible assets and other
reserves, which include the cash flow hedge reserve, foreign currency
translation reserve and the net impact of the share option scheme for the
group.

(2) Starting in 2013, the non-loss absorbent AT1 and T2 capital is subject to
a 10% per annum phase-out in terms of Basel 3.

(3) This value is currently 10.500% (February 2020: 11.500%)of risk-weighted
assets, being the Basel global minimum requirement of 8.000% and the Capital
Conservation Buffer of 2.500%, disclosable in terms of a SARB November 2016
directive in order to standardise reporting across banks. In terms of the
regulations relating to banks the Individual Capital Requirement (“ICR”) is
excluded. The Prudential Authority issued Directive 2 of 2020 on 6 April 2020
and temporarily relaxed the Pillar 2A South African country-specific buffer
of 1.00% to provide temporary capital relief to banks during the time of
financial stress following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a manner
that ensures South Africa’s continued compliance with the relevant
internationally agreed capital framework.

(1) As at 31 May 2020, R987.9 million (29 Feb 2020: R1.15 billion) of the total
High-Quality Liquid Assets is attributable to Mercantile Bank Limited
(“Mercantile Bank”).

(2) Capitec has a net cash inflow after applying the run-off weightings,
therefore outflows for the purpose of the ratio are deemed to be 25% of gross
outflows. As at 31 May 2020, R563.6 million (29 Feb 2020: R550.7 million) of
the total net cash outflows is attributable to Mercantile Bank.

(3) The Prudential Authority issued Directive 1 of 2020 on 31 March 2020 and
decreased the minimum LCR requirement from 100% to 80% effective from 1 April
2020. The decrease is attributable to the current financial market turmoil
which has decreased market liquidity, and the expectation that banks will
remain under increased pressure to comply with the currently prescribed LCR
requirements.

amounts to R181,000,000 and the 200,000 shares that are the subject of the
collar serve as security against the loan. It is Wimsey's intention to

(“Limietberg”) over a portion (referencing 1,250,000 shares) of
Limietberg’s shareholding in Capitec Bank Holdings Limited (the “2017
Hedging Transaction”) and the announcement released on SENS on 24 February
2020, relating to the partial unwind of a portion (“394,737 shares”) of
the 2017 Hedging Transaction.

Shareholders are now advised that, in anticipation of the upcoming expiry
of the remaining 2017 Hedging Transaction (the “Current Hedge”) and the
settlement of any financing relating thereto, Limietberg has concluded a
new hedging and financing transaction (the ""New Hedge"") over 1,250,000
shares on the basis set out below:

 DIRECTOR’S INTEREST IN THE
 TRANSACTIONS

The hedging counterparty shall provide Limietberg with loan financing for
the duration of the New Hedge. The maximum financial obligation under that
financing arrangement, including all interest thereon, will never exceed
the total number of shares hedged multiplied by the put strike price.
Limietberg will therefore always be in the position to fully cover the
liability under the financing arrangement with the shares hedged.

The default legal position on the Current Hedge is cash settlement (i.e.
not physical settlement) and Limiteberg is thereby not required to sell
any shares irrespective of whether the share price might be (a) below the
put strike price or (b) above the call strike price, at expiry. The
Current Hedge (855,263 shares) has already, as at the date of this
announcement, begun the process of unwinding naturally and Limietberg’s
intention remains to cash settle any rights or obligations that arise on
the expiry thereof. The proceeds of the financing arrangement under the
New Hedge will be used to cash settle the obligations of the financing
arrangement under the Current Hedge. As such, all the underlying shares
will continue to be retained by Limietberg.

TRADING STATEMENT

The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting businesses in South Africa across
the board and generally causing increased distress in the South African
economy. We do not as yet fully understand the ultimate economic
outcome of the pandemic. The national lockdown affected Capitec from
the end of its first month of the 2021 financial year and the impact
continues. The relaxation of the lockdown restrictions enabling
broadened business activity from 1 June 2020 is imperative to
facilitate economic recovery in South Africa.

Over the period of the national lockdown, Capitec transaction volumes
(branch transactions, cash withdrawals and point-of-sale transactions)
number of funeral policies sold and credit sales were lower. Many
clients applied for a payment holiday. It is still early days to
determine the extent, but doubtful debt is expected to increase.

All reasonable measures are being taken to contain expenses.

Capitec’s liquidity and capital positions continue to be very strong.
Capitec’s deposit base increased further and we believe this is due to
clients’ normal spending habits being curtailed due to the national
lockdown.

It is not possible at this stage to provide specific guidance to
shareholders on the results for the 6 months ending on 31 August 2020
(“the interim reporting period”). The potential remedial effect of the
relaxation of the economic restrictions from 1 June 2020, on Capitec’s
interim results, will only become apparent over the second half of the
interim reporting period. Due to the impact of the national lockdown
over the first half of the interim reporting period, however, there is
a reasonable degree of certainty that Capitec’s headline earnings per
share and earnings per share will decline by more than 20% or more than
509 cents and 510 cents respectively, compared to the headline earnings
per share of 2545 cents and earnings per share of 2549 cents for the
six months ended 31 August 2019.

We will provide a more specific guidance range when there is reasonable
certainty of the range of headline earnings and earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has
not been reviewed and reported on by Capitec’s auditors. The financial
results for the half year ending on 31 August 2020 are expected to be
published on or about 30 September 2020.

CAPITEC BANK LIMITED (WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CAPITEC BANK HOLDINGS
LIMITED): FOREIGN CURRENCY LONG-TERM ISSUER CREDIT RATING LOWERED IN
LINE WITH COUNTRY RATING

On 29 April 2020, S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) lowered the credit ratings
on South Africa to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’ based on the impact that Covid-19 is
expected to have on the country’s fiscal and growth prospects.

S&P does not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the
foreign currency long term sovereign ratings. Therefore, on 7 May 2020,
Capitec Bank’s foreign currency long-term issuer credit rating was
lowered to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’ in line with that of South Africa. The rest
of Capitec Bank’s credit ratings were left unchanged. The ‘B’ short-
term rating was affirmed. The outlook is stable. Furthermore, the
‘zaAA’ long-term and ‘zaA-1+’ short-term national scale ratings were
affirmed.

S&P’s standalone credit assessment of Capitec Bank has been maintained
despite their view of higher system-wide economic risks. This is
underpinned by ‘the banking sector’s long track record of sound asset
quality, muted risk appetite, and solid regulatory capitalization.’

QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE REGULATIONS RELATING
TO BANKS

Capitec and its subsidiaries (“the group”) have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.

Capitec Bank Limited (“Capitec Bank”), the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capitec, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Mercantile Bank
Holdings Limited (“Mercantile Holdings”) on 7 November 2019, the date on
which the final purchase price was paid. On 12 November 2019, the assets and
liabilities of Mercantile Holdings were transferred to Capitec Bank.
Mercantile Bank Limited (“Mercantile”) is now the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Mercantile Holdings is in the process of being
deregistered.

Mercantile is consolidated in the disclosures in respect of the 3rd and 4th
quarters of the 2020 financial year ended on 29 February 2020. Both Capitec
and Mercantile apply the standardised approach to calculate capital
adequacy.

The acquisition of Mercantile has a significant impact on Capitec’s capital
adequacy ratio, as Capitec’s qualifying capital is measured against the
combined risk weighted assets of Mercantile and Capitec.

The impact of the acquisition of Mercantile on the capital adequacy ratio of
Capitec was partly offset by an increase in appropriated profits and the
placement of excess funds in investments with lower risk weightings such as
South African National Treasury bills.

Both Capitec and Capitec Bank have maintained healthy buffers above the
minimum capital adequacy requirement.

The group’s consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
fourth quarter for the 29 February 2020 financial year end are set out
below:

AUDITED SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
29 FEBRUARY 2020


1.   SALIENT FEATURES

     Operating profit before tax increased by 14% to R8.06 billion, from R7.08 billion in the
     prior year.

     Headline earnings per share increased by 19% to 5 428 cents per share, from 4 577
     cents per share in the prior year.

     Earnings per share increased by 18% to 5 400 cents per share, from 4 571 cents per
     share in the prior year.

     Total dividends per share decreased by 57% to 755 cents per share, from 1 750 cents
     per share in the prior year.

2.   DIVIDEND

     Capitec’s ordinary dividend policy is to pay out 40% of headline earnings. As Capitec’s
     capital base and liquidity ratios remain strong, it was the intention of the board to declare
     the final dividend this year. The South African Reserve Bank published Guidance Note
     4/2020 on 6 April 2020 in which banks are directed to act prudently in preserving capital
     and focusing on financial and economic stability. This is due to the absence of appropriate
     factual information to determine the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the South
     African economy. There is a clear expectation communicated in the Guidance Note that
     banks should not declare ordinary dividends for the time being. The board therefore
     considered the guidance of the Reserve Bank as well as the expectation of ordinary
     shareholders regarding the dividend declaration. After extensive deliberation, the board
     decided to support the guidance of the Reserve Bank and decided against the declaration
     of the final ordinary dividend.

WITHDRAWAL OF MERCANTILE BANK LIMITED’S (“MERCANTILE”) MOODY’S INVESTOR
SERVICES (MOODY’S) CREDIT RATINGS

On 26 November 2019, Mercantile requested a withdrawal of their Moody’s
credit ratings. The credit ratings at the time of withdrawal were
Ba3/Not-Prime global scale and Baa1.za/P-2.za national scale issuer
ratings. At the time of the withdrawal, the long-term global scale
issuer rating had a stable outlook.

Mercantile withdrew its Moody’s credit ratings following its acquisition
by Capitec Bank on 7 November 2019. Mercantile is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Capitec Bank is rated by S&P Global Ratings.
There is thus no reason for Mercantile to continue to have separate
credit ratings. The integration of Mercantile into Capitec Bank is in
process and it will become a division of Capitec Bank. Moody’s issued a
statement today in which they indicate that the ratings were
discontinued due to ‘business reasons’. Included in Moody’s definition
of ‘business reasons’ they state ‘Moody’s generally do not reflect any
concerns about the Rated Entity’s creditworthiness or the quality of its
management’.

GENERAL STATEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the guidance provided in
Capitec’s trading statement published on the JSE Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) on 6 March 2020 advising that
headline earnings per share and earnings per share are expected
to increase by between 18% and 21%. This guidance remains
unchanged and Capitec’s fundamental business remains strong.

Globally, markets are in economic turmoil due to the effects
of Covid-19, and many companies, including the banks, have
seen big declines in their share prices.

We believe that the sharp decline in the Capitec ordinary
share price since yesterday may be attributable to the
following technical reasons:
• International shareholders are impacted by the continued
   weakening of the Rand which, over and above the declining
   share price, further motivated the disposal of their
   Capitec shares.
• The algorithms applied by professional traders enforce
   disposal of a share when the price of that share declines
   below a certain limit.
•  Banks that are counterparties to collar transactions are
   inclined to sell the underlying share when contracted
   limits are breached.

There is speculation in the market that Capitec will be
severely impacted by Covid-19 due to the market on which it
focuses and its unsecured credit business model. Shareholders
are reminded of the following important features of Capitec’s
business model as highlighted in the FY2020 interim results
published on SENS on 26 September 2019:

1. Only 1.1 million of Capitec Bank’s 12.6 million active
   clients (9%) have credit with Capitec Bank.
2. Capitec’s business model is well diversified and income
   is strengthened by transaction fee income and funeral
   cover sales. Net transaction fee and funeral income
   contribute 46% of net income and covers 91% of operating
   expenses.
3. There has been a significant migration in Capitec Bank’s
   client base to the middle and higher income segment. 81%
   of credit granted in August 2019 was to clients with a
   gross salary of over R10 000 per month, and 47% to
   clients with a gross salary of over R20 000 per month.
4. The bank has a strong retail deposit base.

Capitec’s liquidity position as of today remains strong and
its liquidity ratios remain in line with that published on 12
December 2019 being:
- Capital Adequacy Ratio – 28.4%
- Liquidity Coverage Ratio – 1 444%
- Net Stable Funding Ratio – 186%
- Leverage Ratio – 16.6%
- Capitec Bank’s excess deposit base has grown by more than
  5% from 31 August 2019.

Management continuously assesses changes in the economy and
trading conditions and make appropriate adjustments to
business and granting models as required. This is particularly
relevant in these uncertain times.

Capitec’s full year results for the reporting period ended 29
February 2020 will be published on SENS on 14 April 2020 and
in the press on 15 April 2020.

DEALING IN SECURITIES BY AN ASSOCIATE OF A DIRECTOR

In compliance with paragraphs 3.63 to 3.74 of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements, the following information, relating to the dealing in
securities by an associate of a director is disclosed:

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 11 July
2017, with regards to the hedging transaction entered into by Limietberg
Sekuriteit (Pty) Ltd (""Limietberg"") over a portion of Limietberg's
shareholding in Capitec Bank Holdings Limited (the ""2017 Hedging
Transaction"").

Shareholders are now advised that Limietberg has, on 21 February 2020,
early unwound and terminated a portion of the 2017 Hedging Transaction in
respect of 394,737 underlying shares (the ""Partial Unwind""). Limietberg
elected to cash settle its obligations pursuant to the Partial Unwind and,
as a consequence, no underlying shares were acquired or sold by
Limietberg. No other amendments have been made to the 2017 Hedging
Transaction.

Shareholders are further advised that Limietberg has concluded a new
hedging and financing transaction over the same quantum of shares
(394,737) on the basis set out below:

The hedging counterparty has provided Limietberg with loan financing for
the duration of the collar. The maximum financial obligation under that
financing arrangement, including all interest thereon, will never exceed
the total number of shares hedged multiplied by the put strike. The shares
hedged will therefore always be in the position to fully cover the
liability under the financing arrangement.

QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE IN TERMS OF REGULATION 43 OF THE REGULATIONS RELATING
TO BANKS

Capitec and its subsidiaries (""the group"") have complied with Regulation 43
of the Regulations relating to banks, which incorporates the requirements of
Basel.

In terms of Pillar 3 of the Basel rules, the consolidated group is required
to disclose quantitative information on its capital adequacy, leverage and
liquidity ratios on a quarterly basis.

Capitec Bank Limited (""Capitec Bank""), the wholly-owned subsidiary of
Capitec, acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Mercantile Bank
Holdings Limited (""Mercantile Holdings"") on 7 November 2019, the date on
which the final purchase price was paid. On 12 November 2019, the assets and
liabilities of Mercantile Holdings were transferred to Capitec Bank.
Mercantile Bank Limited (""Mercantile"") is now the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Capitec Bank. Mercantile Holdings is in the process of being
deregistered.

Mercantile is consolidated in the disclosures in respect of the 3rd quarter
of the 2020 financial year ended on 30 November 2019. Both Capitec and
Mercantile apply the standardised approach to calculate capital adequacy.

The acquisition of Mercantile has a significant impact on Capitec's capital
adequacy ratio, as Capitec's qualifying capital is measured against the
combined risk weighted assets of Mercantile and Capitec.

The impact of the inclusion of Mercantile's risk weighted assets resulted in
a decrease of 5.5% in the group capital adequacy ratio. Of the total risk
weighted assets as at 30 November 2019, R13.0 billion is attributable to
Mercantile.

In terms of the Regulations relating to banks, goodwill and intangible
assets net of the related deferred tax liability, are treated as specified
adjustments and are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 (""CET1"") capital and
reserve funds. The goodwill originating on the acquisition of Mercantile and
Mercantile's intangible assets at acquisition therefore also reduce the
qualifying CET1 capital of Capitec on consolidation and resulted in a
further 1.2% decrease in the group capital adequacy ratio.

The impact of the acquisition of Mercantile on the capital adequacy ratio of
Capitec was partly offset by an increase in appropriated profits and the
placement of excess funds in investments with lower risk weightings such as
South African National Treasury bills.

Both Capitec and Capitec Bank have maintained healthy buffers above the
minimum capital adequacy requirement.

The group's consolidated capital and liquidity positions at the end of the
third quarter for the 29 February 2020 financial year end are set out below:


                                      3rd Quarter 2020                  2nd Quarter 2020

PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION ON ACQUISITION OF MERCANTILE BANK HOLDINGS
LIMITED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (""MERCANTILE"")

Capitec Bank concluded the purchase of Mercantile on 7 November 2019 for
R3.56 billion. Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement of the
same date regarding the purchase and the payment of the purchase price.

This announcement provides detail on the acquisition date accounts of
Mercantile as well as the allocation of the purchase price to these
accounts and other intangibles identified.

Capitec Bank will consolidate Mercantile from the acquisition date and
Capitec Bank's results for the year ending 29 February 2020 will include
the Mercantile earnings from 7 November 2019.

Capitec Bank determined the acquisition date accounting of Mercantile
through the following processes:
1. Obtaining the statement of financial position of Mercantile as at 7
    November 2019 which reflects a net asset value of R2.69 billion.
    Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement dated 31 October
    2019 that disclosed Mercantile's net asset value at R2.66 billion at
    30 September 2019. This date was used to determine the purchase
    price. The net asset value of R2.69 billion as at 7 November 2019
    was used to allocate the purchase price. The difference relates to
    Mercantile's earnings for the month of October 2019.
2.  Obtaining an unqualified special purpose reasonable assurance
    opinion from Mercantile's auditors reflecting a net asset value of
    R2.69 billion.
3.  Supplementing the Capitec accounting policies with those of
    Mercantile to the extent that they provide more granularity on the
    business banking segment. This did not result in adjustments to the
    net asset value of the acquisition date accounts.
4.  Applying IFRS 3 - Business combinations in order to determine the
    allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets, assumed
    liabilities and residual goodwill.

The outcome of the purchase price allocation was as follows:

1.  Fair value of assets and liabilities
    A fair value exercise was performed on all assets and liabilities.
    No material differences were noted between net asset value and fair
    value.

2.  Identified intangible assets
    Core deposit and client relationship intangibles not previously
    recognised were identified. A value of R80.8 million and R17.7
    million was placed on the core deposit and client relationship
    intangibles respectively.

    The brand value was considered to be immaterial as Mercantile has
    less than 1% of the market share in South Africa and their
    geographical footprint is limited.

    The intangible assets raised through the business combination will
    be amortised over 7 years. It is expected that this will result in a
    post-tax charge of R3.38 million to Capitec's income statement for
    the year ending 29 February 2020.

3.  Goodwill
    The net asset value of Mercantile of R2.69 billion as at 7 November
    2019 was increased by R98.5 million for intangible assets and offset
    by an increase in deferred tax of R27.6 million. The resultant fair
    value of identifiable net assets of R2.76 billion compared to the
    purchase price of R3.56 billion results in goodwill of R794.5
    million. This goodwill is attributable to future revenue expected to
    be generated from new business banking clients, the leveraging of
    the Capitec brand and the Mercantile business banking process. None
    of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax
    purposes.
                                                                  R'000

The purchase price of R3.56 billion was paid in cash. Capitec Bank
incurred acquisition related costs of R9.5 million (mainly Securities
transfer tax) during the year and these will be included in operating
expenses for the year ending 29 February 2020.

CAPITEC BANK LIMITED (THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CAPITEC BANK
HOLDINGS LIMITED) CREDIT RATINGS AFFIRMED AND OUTLOOK CHANGED

On 22 November 2019, S&P Global Ratings (""S&P"") revised its outlook on
South Africa to negative on weakening fiscal and debt trajectory and
sizable contingent liabilities. S&P's policy is to not rate financial
institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency long term
sovereign ratings, of  BB' and short term ratings of  B' due to the
direct and indirect impacts a sovereign distress would have on South
African banks' operations. Capitec Bank's credit ratings' outlook has
therefore been revised to negative from stable on 26 November 2019.

Simultaneously, S&P affirmed the global and national scale ratings of
Capitec Bank. The global long term ratings remain  BB' and the global
short term ratings  B'. The national scale long term ratings are
affirmed as 'zaAA' and the national short term ratings  zaA-1+'.
