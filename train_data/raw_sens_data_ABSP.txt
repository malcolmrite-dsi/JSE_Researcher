ABSA GROUP LIMITED – BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2020

This Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group) and
Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group’s regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-     The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-     Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not
      superseded by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.



1. Key prudential metrics and RWA


In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage positions of the Group and the Bank in this document are reflected on a
regulatory basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded). However, the capital and leverage positions of the Group are also managed
on a statutory basis (which includes unappropriated profits). The summary table below provides key capital adequacy and liquidity information on both
a regulatory and statutory basis as at 30 September 2020. As at 30 September 2020 all profits in the Group and Bank were appropriated, with the
result that regulatory and statutory basis were identical.

Capital
-     The Group’s CET1 capital position was well above minimum regulatory requirements as at 30 September 2020 and within the Board target range
      of 11 - 12%.
-     Group RWAs decreased by R14.6bn from R935.7bn to R921.1bn from June 2020 to September 2020 mainly within the Absa Regional Operations.
      This was driven by rand strength combined with the impact of the Group deploying more of its surplus liquidity into low risk securities rather than
      deposits with banks.
-     Group CET1 capital increased by R1.3bn due to higher capital supply supported by improved profitability. At a total capital level, this was offset
      by a decrease in Tier 2 capital of R1.5bn post the call of subordinated debt during September 2020.
-     The Bank leverage ratio has decreased marginally from June 2020. This is due to an increase in leverage exposure as a result of balance sheet
      growth mainly in investment securities and loans to customers which was partially offset by improvements in capital supply. The Group leverage
      ratio remained flat due to additional capital supply generated by Group entities.




                                                                                                                                       
Liquidity
-     The liquidity risk position of the Group is in line with risk appetite, and well above the minimum regulatory requirements.
-     The Group liquidity coverage ratio increased to 139% (June 2020: 127%) as the liquidity resources of the Group strengthened over the third
      quarter of the year and included Absa Bank investing in alternative forms of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as the Bank reduces reliance on
      the committed liquidity facility (CLF), in line with the phase out requirements set out by the Prudential Authority.
-     The Group net stable funding ratio strengthened to 119% (June 2020: 117%) with strong core deposit growth from retail and corporate clients.




1.2 KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)
In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an
incurred loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory
capital impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5 issued by the Prudential Authority. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of
the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on a transitional basis.

Notes:

 (1)    IFRS capital ratios (including unappropriated profits) are managed against Board capital target ranges.
 (2)    The 2020 minimum regulatory capital requirements of 11.5% includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes the bank-specific individual
        capital requirement (Pillar 2B add-on).
 (3)    The difference between the CET1 and Total capital ratio on a transitional basis and the fully loaded ECL accounting model CET1 and Total
        capital ratio is less than 5bps, hence no difference is discernible
 (4)    The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (5)    SARB Directive 4/2020 requires the D-SIB add on to be disclosed. Previously the disclosure of the D-SIB add on was not a disclosure
        requirement. Comparatives have been restated to allow for better comparability with prior period disclosures.
 (6)    The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank LCR and the LCR of ARO. For this purpose, a simple average of the relevant 3
        month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Absa Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-day
        LCR observations.
 (7)    Absa Bank Limited includes subsidiary undertakings, special-purpose entities, joint ventures, associates and offshore holdings.
 (8)    The 2020 minimum regulatory capital requirements of 11.5% includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes the bank-specific individual
        capital requirement (Pillar 2B add-on).
 (9)    SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (10)   Includes the operational risk floor.
 (11)   IFSR9 RWA phase excluded
 (12)   IRC: incremental risk charge
 (13)   Numbers reported are on a regulatory quarter-end basis.

     >   Ensuring business resilience through:
         o Capital and liquidity preservation; and
         o   Operational stability.
     >   Delivering our corporate purpose through:
         o The safety and wellbeing of our employees;
         o   The safety and financial wellbeing of our customers; and

Normalised financial results as a consequence of Barclays PLC Separation
A normalised view of the 2020 interim results is provided which adjusts for the consequences of the separation from Barclays
PLC. This view better reflects the Bank’s underlying performance. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) compliant
financial results will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act and the JSE Limited (JSE) Listings Requirements
and include a reconciliation between the normalised and IFRS views. Normalised results will be presented for future periods to
the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is considered material.

The normalised results have not been prepared using the accounting policies of the Group and do not comply with IFRS. These
results are considered to be pro forma financial information, are presented for illustrative purposes only and have been presented
in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, the SAICA Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information and any relevant
guidance issued by the IRBA. The normalised results have not been reviewed or reported on by the external auditors of the
Company and are the responsibility of the Group’s Board of Directors. Because of its nature, the pro forma financial information
may not fairly present the Group’s financial position, changes in equity, and results of operations or cash flows

In accordance with paragraph 3.59 of the JSE Listings Requirements, shareholders are
informed of the following changes to the Absa Group and Absa Bank boards:

As indicated in the Notice of annual general meeting (AGM) issued on 31 March 2020,
Mohamed Husain, the Lead Independent Director, will retire at the conclusion of the AGM,
tomorrow, 4 June 2020. Sipho Pityana, who was appointed as independent non-

Director. Francis Okomo-Okello will assume the role of chairman of the Social and Ethics
Committee (SEC) from 4 June 2020.

Colin Beggs, who has been an independent non-executive director on the Absa Group
and Absa Bank boards since 23 June 2010, will become a non-independent non-
executive director on 4 June 2020, and will step down as member and chairman of the

the position of GACC chairman from 4 June 2020.

Daniel Hodge will no longer represent Barclays PLC as a nominee from 4 June 2020, but
will remain on the Absa Group Board as a non-executive director. Following a cooling-

The Absa Group Board is also pleased to announce the appointment of Fulvio Tonelli as

from Barclays PLC (Separation). This view better reflects Absa Bank's underlying performance. International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) compliant financial statements will continue to be presented as required by the Companies Act

Normalised results will be presented for future periods to the extent that the financial impact of the Separation is
considered material.

Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are considered pro forma financial information as per JSE Listings
Requirements. The pro forma financial information, is the responsibility of the Bank's board of directors and is presented
for illustrative purpose only and because of its nature may not fairly present the Bank's financial position, changes in

ABSA GROUP LIMITED - BASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURE AS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2019

This quarterly Pillar 3 disclosure contains the quantitative Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in respect of Absa Group Limited (Absa Group or the Group)
and Absa Bank Limited (Absa Bank or the Bank). The quarterly report provides a view of the Group's regulatory capital and risk exposures, and it complies
with:

-      The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (Pillar 3 standard).
-      Regulation 43 of the Regulations relating to Banks (Regulations), issued in terms of the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), where not superseded
       by the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.


1. Key prudential metrics and risk weighted assets (RWA)

In line with regulatory and accounting requirements, the capital and leverage position of Group and Bank in this document is reflected on a regulatory
basis (which requires unappropriated profits to be excluded), and in accordance with IFRS accounting rules (which requires the impact of the contribution
amounts received from Barclays PLC as part of the separation to be included). However, the capital and leverage position of the Group is also managed
on a statutory basis. For reference, the summary table below provides key capital and leverage information on a statutory, IFRS basis as at 30 September
2019.

Capital adequacy

The Group remains capitalised above the minimum regulatory capital requirements. Absa Group continues to optimise the level and composition of capital
resources. In line with this objective, the Group will continue to raise Basel III compliant capital instruments as and when appropriate, in the domestic
and/or international capital markets.
The Absa Group statutory CET 1 ratios (calculated on an IFRS basis) have reduced by 70bps over Q3 2019, driven by the impact of the interim dividend
of R4.2bn combined with RWA growth.

1.   Key prudential metrics and RWA



KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)

In line with the requirements of IFRS 9, which became effective on 1 January 2018, the Group moved from the recognition of credit losses on an incurred
loss basis to an expected credit loss (ECL) basis. The Group elected to utilise the transition period of three years for phasing in the regulatory capital
impact of IFRS 9, as afforded by Directive 5. The table below reflects the capital and leverage position of the Group on a fully loaded basis, as well as on
a transitional basis.

The key drivers of change in RWA consumption from 30 June 2019 to 30 September 2019 were as follows:

-        Credit risk: The increase of R38.2bn is attributable to increases in the IRB portfolios of R17.9bn and standardised portfolios of R20.3bn. The primary
         driver for the increase in the South African IRB portfolios is exposure growth in Retail and Business Banking (RBB). The R20.3bn increase in the
         standardised portfolios is as a result of balance sheet growth of R12.5bn and foreign exchange movements of R7.5bn.
-        CCR & CVA: The decreases in CCR of R1.2bn and in CVA of R1.5bn are mainly attributable to market volatility.
-        Market Risk: The increase of R1.7bn is primarily as a result of specific risk capital on local currency sovereign bonds held by ARO.

Notes:
 (1) These numbers have been restated. Refer to reporting changes overview on the inside front cover of the Group results booklet for the period ended
      30 June 2019.
 (2) The countercyclical buffer is not required for banks in South Africa.
 (3) Bank-specific confidential requirement.
 (4) The Group LCR reflects an aggregation of the Bank LCR and the LCR of the Absa Regional Operations (ARO). For this purpose, a simple average
      of the relevant 3 month-end data points is used in respect of ARO. In respect of Bank, the LCR was calculated as a simple average of 90 calendar-
      day LCR observations. The December 2018 and March 2019 Group LCR was restated post a change in certain assumptions.
 (5) The 2019 minimum regulatory capital requirement is calculated at 11.5% (2018: 11.13%), which includes the capital conservation buffer but excludes
      the bank-specific individual capital requirement (Pillar 2b add-on) and the D-SIB add-on.
 (6) SA-CCR amount is calculated using the current exposure method (CEM).
 (7) Includes the operational risk floor.
 (8) IRC: incremental risk charge.
 (9) Calculated at 11.5% of RWA.
 (10) Numbers reported are on a regulatory basis, and include the contribution amounts from Barclays PLC as part of the separation.
 (11) The Absa Group LCR for 30 September 2019 reflects an aggregation of the Absa Bank and Absa Regional Operations (ARO) LCR. The ARO LCR
      is calculated as a simple average of the relevant 3 month-end data points. The surplus HQLA of ARO in excess of the minimum requirement of
      100% has been excluded from the calculation of the ARO LCR.
 (12) The Absa Bank Limited quarterly LCR is calculated on a simple average of 90 calendar-day observations.

ABSA BANK LIMITED: CHANGE IN NATIONAL SCALE RATING BY STANDARD & POOR’S
RATINGS SERVICES (‘S&P’)

Notice is hereby given in terms of the Debt Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited that S&P Global
Ratings (S&P) has on 26 November 2019 lowered its national scale ratings on South Africa's financial
institutions. S&P does not rate financial institutions in South Africa above the foreign currency sovereign
ratings and, as a result, Absa Bank’s long term national scale rating was lowered to zaAA from zaAA+.

For additional details on the rationale of the ratings action please see "S&P Global Ratings: Outlook On
South African Banks Now Negative After Same Action On Sovereign; National Scale Ratings Lowered”
published November 26, 2019, on RatingsDirect (www.spglobal.com/ratingsdirect).


Summary of credit rating change:
                                                  To                                From
