RESULTS OF THE ODD-LOT OFFER

Shareholders are referred to the circular issued by Implats on Monday, 14 September 2020 (“Circular”) and the SENS
announcements dated 14 September 2020, 14 October 2020 and 27 October 2020, relating to the Odd-lot Offer.
Unless otherwise defined, the definitions and interpretations contained in the Circular apply, mutatis mutandis, to the
terms used in this announcement.

The Odd-lot Offer closed on Friday, 6 November 2020, and the results thereof are as follows:

                                                                                           Total number of
                                                                                           Shares repurchased

                  retained by election    sold by election         sold by default(1)     to the Odd-lot Offer
Certificated                       381                 226                   54 528                     54 754

Total                           71 373             698 896                  326 419                  1 025 315
(1) Odd-lot Holders who did not make an election were automatically regarded as having sold their Odd-lot Holdings to
the Company.

Implats repurchased a total of 1 025 315 Shares, representing 0.131% of the total issued ordinary share capital of
Implats for a total consideration of R177 094 472.81. The Shares repurchased by the Company in terms of the Odd-lot
Offer will be cancelled and delisted on or about Wednesday, 11 November 2020, and accordingly the total issued
ordinary share capital of Implats will be reduced from 782 800 320 to 781 775 005 Shares.

Implats Shareholders’ attention is drawn to paragraph 5.2 of the Circular which showed, for illustrative purposes only,
if Implats had implemented the Odd-lot Offer on 28 August 2020, being the Last Practicable Date before the Circular
was distributed, assuming an Offer Price of R173.98 per Share, and based on Odd-lot Holdings of approximately
232 581 Shares, the financial impact on Implats, if funded from existing cash resources, would have resulted in a
reduction of cash resources of R40 464 442.38 and a reduction of total equity by R40 464 442.38.

Due to a significant increase of trading in Shares at holdings below 100 Shares between Tuesday, 27 October 2020
and Tuesday, 3 November 2020 (being the last day to trade to participate in the Odd-lot Offer), the number of Odd-lot
Holdings increased from 232 581 to 1 096 688 Shares. As a result, the Company has repurchased a total of 1 025 315
Shares at the Offer Price of R172.72 per Share (as contained in the finalisation announcement dated 27 October
2020), totalling R177 094 472.81, which was funded from existing cash resources, resulting in a reduction of cash
resources of R177 094 472.81 and a reduction of total equity by R177 094 472.81.

Notwithstanding the largely increased Odd-lot Offer amount, the Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer process
achieved the desired outcomes for the Company as set out in the Circular whilst also facilitating an increased
repurchase of the Company’s Shares, which Implats believes is in the best interests of Shareholders.

Implats Shareholders are reminded of the following remaining salient dates and times in relation to the Odd-lot Offer:

                                                                                                         2020

First quarter production report for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 September 2020

Key highlights

   •   Zero fatalities and a 7% and 26% improvement in the reported lost-time injury and all
       injury frequency rates, respectively

   •   An 11% increase in total 6E concentrate volumes to 859 000 ounces, with an 11% gain
       in managed volumes to 623 000 ounces, a 23% increase in JV production to 142 000
       ounces and a 6% decline in third-party receipts to 94 000 ounces

   •   A 58% improvement in gross 6E refined and saleable production volumes to 870 000
       ounces on improved availability at Group processing assets and the inclusion of
       contributions from Impala Canada

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Implats has delivered a strong start
to FY2021 with pleasing improvements in safety and a number of notable operational gains.
This was achieved despite the continuing challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic and
is testament to the operational resilience our team has worked so hard to develop and entrench.
Production losses attributable to the pandemic in the quarter were minimal and our health,
safety and operating protocols have proved effective in mitigating the impact of the virus on our
operations, employees, host communities and customers. PGM pricing remains robust and we
continue to experience strong demand for our primary products. We are well positioned to
continue delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders in the year ahead.”

HEALTH AND SAFETY
Implats’ goal is to eliminate harm to the health and safety of our employees and contractors.
Effectively managing workplace health and safety risks, therefore, remains a key priority in
achieving the Group’s vision of zero harm. Focused attention across all operations and targeted
precautionary measures have mitigated the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic
and Implats has delivered an improved safety performance in the quarter under review.

Management of the Covid-19 pandemic required extensive revisions to operating practices over
the course of 2020, with additional care required to ensure the safe start-up of operations
following Covid-related restrictions and interruptions. Pleasingly, the infection rate across the
Group, which peaked in June 2020, has maintained a steady downward trend throughout the
first quarter of FY2021. To date, the Group has recorded 2 137 infections and currently has 17
active cases.

The Group operated without a fatal incident during the quarter. The lost-time injury rate of 4.91
per million-man hours worked improved by 7% from 5.27 recorded in the first quarter of FY2020,
the all injury frequency rate of 9.19 per million-man hours worked improved by 27% over the
same period.

PRODUCTION
Gross tonnes milled at managed operations improved by 18% to 6.13 million tonnes during the
quarter, compared to 5.21 million tonnes achieved in the prior comparable period. The increase
was primarily due to the maiden inclusion of Impala Canada, but production gains at Marula
also aided this performance and helped offset slightly lower milled volumes from Impala
Rustenburg and Zimplats. The resolution of milling challenges experienced at our joint ventures
(JVs) resulted in higher volumes from both Two Rivers and Mimosa during the period.

As a result, 6E in concentrate production of 623 000 ounces at managed operations was 11%
higher than in the prior comparable quarter. JV production from Mimosa and Two Rivers
increased by 23% and helped offset the impact of lower third-party receipts in the period. Total
6E concentrate volumes rose by 82 000 ounces, or 11%, to 859 000 ounces.

Refined 6E production in the prior comparable period was significantly impacted by planned
maintenance at the Zimplats furnace and Impala Rustenburg’s smelting complex, which
constrained processing capacity. During the period under review, gross refined volumes
benefitted from the accelerated processing maintenance across the Group and the inclusion of
saleable production from Impala Canada. In total, gross refined 6E production increased by
58% to 870 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 551 000 ounces).

Impala
Milled production at Impala Rustenburg decreased by 2% to 2.96 million tonnes negatively
impacted by the residual effect of Covid-19 on labour availability, declining reserves at the short-
life shafts (6 and 9 shafts) and increased Eskom power failures. Higher delivered grade of 3.93
g/t (Q1 FY2020: 3.88 g/t) and improved recoveries and yield gains resulted in stable 6E in
concentrate production of 346 000 ounces. Refined 6E production increased significantly to
372 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 184 000 ounces) and benefitted from greater availability of
processing capacity due to the timing of scheduled maintenance in the previous comparable
period.

Marula
Marula continues to deliver improvements in operational momentum. Tonnes milled increased
by 8% to 525 000 tonnes (Q1 FY2020: 488 000 tonnes), benefitting from a quick ramp up
following Covid-related interruptions, a step change in safety performance, the notable absence
of community disruptions and improved mining performance. Mill grade decreased by 2% to
4.33 g/t (6E) (Q1 FY2020: 4.43 g/t) but 6E in concentrate production improved in line with higher
milled tonnage to 68 000 ounces during the period (Q1 FY2020: 63 000 ounces).

Zimplats
Zimplats continues to benefit from uninterrupted operation and remained relatively unaffected
by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mined tonnage increased by 2% due to improved fleet productivity
and increased production from the new Mupani Mine, which is still in development. Mill
throughput of 1.67 million tonnes declined marginally due to planned maintenance at the Ngezi
concentrator during the quarter, while grade and recoveries were stable, resulting in a 2%
decline in 6E concentrate produced of 148 000 ounces (Q1 FY2020: 151 000 ounces). Routine
smelter maintenance in Q1 FY2020 resulted in elevated matte volumes relative to concentrate
production during that quarter, which normalised in the current period. As a consequence, 6E
volume in matte was 6% lower at 142 000 ounces.

Impala Canada
Operational delivery during the first quarter was impacted by the residual impact of Covid-
related challenges at the mine site and planned underground infrastructure enhancements,
which were completed in the period under review. Milled throughput of 980 000 tonnes and a
6E head grade of 2.48 g/t yielded 6E in concentrate production of 61 000 ounces.

Mimosa
The impact of Covid-19 infections in the broader Mimosa community were well controlled,
benefitting from the protocols and practices implemented at the onset of the pandemic. In Q1
FY2020, concentrate production at Mimosa lagged mined volumes due to extended repairs to
the milling circuit. In the period under review, mined volumes improved by 12%, while milled
tonnage of 724 000 tonnes and 6E in concentrate production of 67 000 ounces both improved
by 23% from the previous comparable quarter.

Two Rivers
The delayed return of foreign employees following Covid-related national border closures
impacted staffing levels at Two Rivers in the early weeks of the reporting period, but the mine
had returned to full staffing and production levels by mid-quarter. Concentrate production
volumes in Q1 FY2020 were heavily impacted by extended maintenance and metallurgical
challenges at the concentrator plant, which were resolved during FY2020. In the period under
review, tonnes milled were flat at 802 000 tonnes (Q1 FY2020: 798 000 tonnes), while a 1%
decrease in mill grade to 3.37g/t was more than compensated for by improved plant
performance and recoveries. As a result, 6E production in concentrate rose by 23% to 75 000
ounces (Q1 FY2020: 61 000 ounces).

Impala Refining Services (“IRS”)
Gross receipts at IRS increased by 18% to 474 000 6E ounces (Q1 FY2020: 399 000 ounces).
The rebound in mine-to-market deliveries marginally offset weaker third-party deliveries, which
declined by 6% or 6 000 ounces. Refined production increased by 21% to 443 000 ounces (Q1
FY2020: 366 000 ounces) with volumes benefitting from improved availability at Group
processing facilities.

On 3 September 2020 the board of directors of Implats determined to pay a final cash dividend
of 400 cents per ordinary share payable on 28 September 2020. The ruling rand to pound
sterling conversion rate on 24 September 2020 of R21.6151 to GBP1.00 will be used in
calculating the sterling amount payable to shareholders registered in the United Kingdom
section of the share register. This converted amount equates to a pre-tax interim cash dividend
of 18,50558 pence per ordinary share to United Kingdom registered shareholders.

PROPOSED ODD-LOT OFFER AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE CIRCULAR AND NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING

1.     Introduction and rationale

     As at 28 August 2020, Implats had a total of 10 123 ordinary shareholders (“Odd-lot
     Holders”) each holding less than 100 Implats ordinary shares of no par value (“Implats
     Shares”) (“Odd-lot Holdings”), holding a total of 232 581 Implats Shares, representing only
     0.03% of the total issued share capital of Implats. Odd-lot Holders represent 48.7% of the
     total number of ordinary shareholders (“Implats Shareholders”) in the Company. The
     recurring administrative costs for the Odd-Lot Holders is disproportionately large relative to
     the small size of their Odd-lot Holdings and negatively affects all Implats Shareholders. To
     reduce the administrative time and costs associated with the Company’s shareholder base,
     the board of directors of Implats (“Board”) has proposed the implementation of an odd-lot
     offer (“Odd-lot Offer”) to facilitate the reduction in these Odd-lot Holders in a fair manner,
     which will result in the repurchase by the Company of the Odd-lot Holdings from the Odd-lot
     Holders at the offer price, being at a 10% premium to the 30-calendar day volume weighted
     average price (“VWAP”) of an Implats Share at the close of business on Monday, 26 October
     2020 (“Offer Price”).

     The Odd-lot Offer will provide Odd-lot Holders with the ability to dispose of their Odd-lot
     Holdings on an efficient basis and will provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect
     not to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election, in which case such Odd-lot
     Holders will be deemed to have agreed to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings. Odd-lot Holders
     will sell their Odd-lot Holdings to Implats and receive the Offer Price in cash (“Cash
     Consideration”). Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings.

     An odd-lot offer is a ‘standard’ corporate action undertaken by JSE-listed companies and is
     permitted by the Company’s memorandum of incorporation (“MoI”). For Implats to implement
     the Odd-lot Offer, the directors are seeking approval from Implats Shareholders to (i) effect
     certain required amendments to the MoI (“MoI Amendments”), and (ii) implement the Odd-
     lot Offer.

2.   MoI Amendments

     Paragraph 1(2)(n) and (o) read together with paragraph 14 of the MoI provides that if the
     Company makes an Odd-lot Offer, Odd-lot Holders may elect to increase their Odd-lot
     Holding to 100 Shares (“top-up provision”). The top-up provision was contained in historic
     versions of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) Listings Requirements and was included in the MoI. The
     top-up provision was repealed by the JSE in c. 2007. Accordingly, in order to align the MoI
     with the JSE Listings Requirements and current practice, Implats Shareholder approval is
     being sought to give effect to the MoI Amendments to remove the sections in the MoI allowing
     for the top-up provision.

3.   Key terms of the Odd-lot Offer

     The Odd-lot Offer will be subject to Implats Shareholder approval (“Shareholder Approval”).

     In order to (i) provide Odd-lot Holders with an opportunity to realise the value of their
     investment without suffering dealing charges which might otherwise make it impractical to
     sell their holding, and to provide liquidity for those Odd-lot Holders who elect not to retain
     their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election and; (ii) from the Company’s perspective, to
     reduce the costs and complexity of managing a large number of Odd-lot Holders, Implats has
     decided to proceed with the implementation of the Odd-lot Offer to repurchase the Implats
     Shares from the Odd-lot Holders at the Offer Price. For purposes of payment of the Offer
     Price to Odd-lot Holders on the United Kingdom share register, the Offer Price will be
     converted at the GBP/ZAR exchange rate at the close of business on Monday, 26 October
     2020.

     Odd-lot Holders can elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings or sell their Odd-lot Holdings
     at the Offer Price. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election by 12:00 (SA
     time) and 10:00 (UK time, for Odd-lot Holders on the United Kingdom register) on
     Friday, 6 November 2020 will automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-
     lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Odd-lot Holdings.

4.   Circular and notice of general meeting

     For Implats to implement the Odd-lot Offer, the Board is seeking approval from Implats
     Shareholders to give effect to the MoI Amendments and to implement the Odd-lot Offer, and
     is therefore convening a general meeting of Implats Shareholders (“General Meeting”), to
     be held through electronic communication on Wednesday, 14 October 2020 at 12:00 (SA
     time) or 11:00 (UK time), at which all Implats Shareholders will be entitled to vote on the
     resolutions required to give effect to the MoI Amendments and to implement the Odd-lot
     Offer. A circular (“Circular”), containing details of the MoI Amendments and the Odd-lot
     Offer, together with a notice of General Meeting (“Notice of General Meeting”), will be
     posted to Implats shareholders on Monday, 14 September 2020.

5.   Odd-lot Offer mechanics

     Following receipt of Shareholder Approval, the Odd-lot Offer will open and Odd-lot Holders
     must decide to either:

     •          sell their Odd-lot Holding to Implats at the Offer Price; or

     •          retain their Odd-lot Holding.

     If Odd-lot Holders wish to retain their Implats Shares, they must specifically make an election
     to do so. Those Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will automatically be regarded
     as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and chosen to dispose of their Implats Shares to Implats
     and will receive the Cash Consideration.

6.   Salient dates and times
                                                                                                  2020

                their Odd-lot Holdings or who make no election, are specifically referred to paragraph 8.2 of
                the Circular as regards the processing and payment of their Cash Consideration.

7.     Tax considerations

       The Board has specifically resolved that the Odd-lot Offer will be distributed as a return of
       capital and will result in a reduction of ‘contributed tax capital’ as defined in section 1 of the
       South African Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, as amended. The Cash Consideration will
       therefore not be regarded as a dividend for South African income tax purposes. Implats
       Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax and/or other professional advisors
       regarding the taxation implications arising out of the acceptance of the Odd-lot Offer.

Commentary
Safety remains the Group's foremost priority. In a 
period marked by unexpected public health and associated 
operational challenges, Implats recorded 14% and 11% 
improvements in the lost-time and total injury frequency 
rates, respectively. Despite these gains, Implats mourns 
the loss of five employees at managed operations and two 
employees at joint ventures during FY2020.

The strategic repositioning of Implats over the past 
several years enabled the Group to successfully navigate 
the challenges created by the external shock of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. Operational resilience enabled 
sustained delivery of refined metal to customers and 
the Group benefitted from robust pricing for primary 
products and achieved record financial results.

The coronavirus pandemic significantly disrupted and 
impacted business performance during the second half 
of the financial year and resulted in an opportunity 
cost of mine-to-market concentrate production of 290 000 
6E ounces. The release of previously identified excess 
inventory mitigated the impact on reported production and 
refined 6E production declined by 8% to 2.8 million ounces.

Reported unit costs were impacted by lower volumes, 
additional investment in development and changes in ore 
mix, which impacted yield. These compounded the impact of 
inflationary pressures and a weaker rand, increasing 
stock-adjusted unit costs by 12% to R13 345 per 6E ounce. 
This excludes abnormal production costs of R1.3 billion. 
If these were included, stock adjusted unit costs would 
have increased by 18% to R14 067 per 6E ounce.

Pricing for the Group's primary products was robust and, 
together with rand depreciation, drove substantial 
improvements in the Groups' financial performance. Revenue 
improved by 44% to R69.9 billion, gross profit increased to
R23.3 billion and headline earnings increased to R16.1 billion
- or R20.75 per share.

The Group generated R14.4 billion of free cash flow after 
capital investment of R4.2 billion and ended FY2020 with 
gross cash of R13.3 billion, net cash of R5.7 billion and 
liquidity headroom of R16.1 billion, notwithstanding the 
acquisition of Impala Canada, the payment of the R973 million 
interim dividend and expenditure incurred to induce the early 
conversion of the US$250 million bond.

Gains in safety and efficiency at Impala Rustenburg resulted 
in upward revisions to the planned production profile at the 
operating complex, negating the need for large-scale 
retrenchments. In Zimbabwe, operations continued to excel 
despite increasing socioeconomic pressures. The operational 
turnaround and renewed social stability at Marula sustained, 
yielding substantial financial value and, at Two Rivers, a 
project to increase processing capacity was approved and 
advanced during the year. The competitiveness of the Groups' 
portfolio was enhanced by the acquisition of Impala Canada, 
a mechanised, high-margin primary palladium producer which 
further diversified Implats' operating footprint.

Strengthened relationships with key stakeholders were 
affirmed by a multi-year wage agreement concluded without 
third-party intervention. A strong environmental performance 
underpinned the continued commitment to responsible 
corporate stewardship.

Meaningful advances were made to strengthen the Group 
balance sheet through the reduction of debt and dividend 
payments were reinstated. The capital allocation framework 
adopted during the year will serve to guide the effective 
future allocation of financial resources.

Production rates at most operations normalised back to 
near full capacity by year end and the risk of material 
disruptions as a result of the pandemic are now steadily 
receding.

FY2021 production volumes will be supported through the 
planned release of accumulated inventory. Group refined 
production is estimated at between 2.8 and 3.4 million 6E 
ounces. Implats expects Group stock-adjusted operating costs 
of between R14 500 and R15 500 per 6E ounce and capital
expenditure of between R6.0 and R6.8 billion. This guidance 
is based on an assumed R/US$ and C$/US$ exchange rate of 
R16.63/US$ and C$1.35/US$, respectively and does not account 
for further potential Covid-related public health disruptions.

The financial information on which this outlook is based has 
not been reviewed and reported on by Implats' external 
auditors.

Declaration of dividend
Shareholders are advised that the board has resolved to 
declare a final gross cash dividend of R4.00 per ordinary 
share for the financial year ended 30 June 2020. The final 
dividend has been declared in terms of the dividend policy 
previously communicated to shareholders. The dividend policy 
states that a dividend will be declared from 30% of free cash
flow, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the 
board's discretion. The final cash dividend is in addition to 
the interim cash dividend of R1.25 declared in February 2020, 
bringing the total dividend for the financial year to R5.25
per ordinary share.

Implats has 799 034 147 ordinary shares in issue and the 
Company's tax reference number is 9700178719. The cash dividend 
will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax for 
shareholders who are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, 
a reduced rate of withholding tax. Therefore, the net dividend 
amount is R3.20 per ordinary share for shareholders liable to 
pay the dividend withholding tax and R4.00 per ordinary share 
for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding tax. 
Shareholders are advised to complete the requisite declaration 
form to make the Company aware of their tax status. The
salient dates are as follows:

Declaration date:                 Thursday, 3 September 2020
Last day for trading to be
eligible for cash dividend:       Monday, 21 September 2020
Trading ex-dividend commences:    Tuesday, 22 September 2020
Record date:                      Friday, 25 September 2020
Dividend payment date:            Monday, 28 September 2020

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised 
between Tuesday, 22 September 2020 and Friday, 25 September
2020, both days inclusive.

     PROPOSED REPURCHASE OF IMPLATS TREASURY SHARES FROM A SUBSIDIARY

1.   Introduction
     Developing an optimal capital structure remains a key strategic imperative for Implats. The Group
     seeks to create value by sustaining and leveraging a strong and flexible balance sheet within a
     prudent capital allocation framework.

     During FY2020, substantial progress was made in this regard through the induced conversion of
     the US$250 million bond, the funding of the acquisition of Impala Canada through a combination
     of cash and debt, and the implementation of a revised dividend policy based on a declaration of at
     least 30% of free cash flow, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the discretion of the
     board of directors of Implats (""Board"").

     In addition, the Board has approved the cancellation of treasury shares, which are currently held
     by a subsidiary of the Group. While this is a non-cash transaction for Implats, in order to effect this,
     the Company, Impala Platinum Limited (""Impala"") and Gazelle Platinum Limited (“Gazelle”) (both
     Impala and Gazelle being subsidiaries of Implats) have entered into a repurchase agreement dated
     26 August 2020 in terms of which Implats will repurchase 16 233 994 ordinary shares currently
     held by Gazelle in the issued share capital of Implats (the “Specific Repurchase”).

     As certain shareholder approvals are required to effect the Specific Repurchase, full details of the
     Specific Repurchase will be incorporated in the notice of annual general meeting which is expected
     to be distributed to shareholders on or about Monday, 14 September 2020 and will include a special
     resolution relating to the Specific Repurchase. The annual general meeting is scheduled to be held
     on Wednesday, 14 October 2020.

2.   Terms of the Specific Repurchase
     2.1.   The price at which the 16 233 994 ordinary shares are to be repurchased will be equal to the
            closing market price as quoted on the JSE Limited of an Implats ordinary share on the day
            immediately preceding the date of the Specific Repurchase, being Friday, 16 October 2020.

     2.2.   The effective date of the Specific Repurchase will be Monday, 19 October 2020.

     2.3.   The Specific Repurchase represents 2.03% of the current ordinary shares in issue.
     2.4.   The ordinary shares to be repurchased in terms of the Specific Repurchase are reflected as
            treasury shares in the consolidated annual financial statements of Implats. Subsequent to
            the Specific Repurchase, application will be made to the JSE for the cancellation and
            delisting of the 16 233 994 Implats ordinary shares, which delisting and cancellation will take
            place on or about Thursday, 22 October 2020.

     2.5.   After the Specific Repurchase, there will be 4 613 469 treasury shares in issue which are
            held in terms of the Implats LTIP 2018 Share Plan.

3.   Suspensive conditions
     The Specific Repurchase is subject to the following suspensive conditions:

     3.1.   shareholders of Implats passing the requisite special resolution required to approve the
            Specific Repurchase at the annual general meeting of Implats to be held on Wednesday, 14
            October 2020; and

     3.2.   JSE approval of the Specific Repurchase.

4.   Impact of the Specific Repurchase on financial information
     As the Specific Repurchase involves the repurchase by Implats of treasury shares, the Board
     confirms that the implementation of the Specific Repurchase will have no impact on the financial
     information of Implats, other than reducing the number of ordinary shares in issue, increasing the
     inter-company loan accounts and the payment of Securities Transfer Tax on the cancellation of the
     16 233 994 Implats ordinary shares.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Implats will release its results for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“the period”) on or about
3 September 2020.

Implats issued a trading statement on SENS on 23 July 2020 indicating that it expected to
report that both basic and headline earnings per share for the period had improved by
significantly more than 20% than those reported for the year ended 30 June 2019 (“the
comparative period”). Implats now has reasonable certainty on its earnings and therefore
advises shareholders of the following:

Implats’ headline earnings and headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the period are
expected to be between R15 600 million and R16 200 million and between 2 007 cents and
2 084 cents per share, respectively. This represents an increase of between 413% and 433%
for headline earnings and an increase of between 374% and 393% for HEPS. Headline
earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R3 038 million and 423 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) for the period are expected to be between
R15 810 million and R16 100 million and between 2 034 cents and 2 072 cents per share,
respectively. This represents an increase of between 975% and 994% for basic earnings and
an increase of between 892% and 911% for EPS. Basic earnings and EPS in the comparative
period were R1 471 million and 205 cents respectively.

Group operations have delivered production volumes at the top-end of the guided range
provided to the market on 24 June 2020, despite the impact of Covid-19.

The benefit of a significant increase in the dollar basket price for PGMs, together with rand
depreciation, has resulted in a meaningful increase in gross profit, which is expected to
increase to R23 billion in the period from R7 billion in the comparative period, despite an
expected 5% decline in refined and saleable PGMs to 2.8 million 6E ounces relative to the
comparative period.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the period increased from 718.6 million
to 777.2 million due to the issue of 64.3 million Implats ordinary shares on 1 August 2019, after
US$ bond holders elected to exercise their option to convert their bonds into Implats ordinary
shares.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the external auditors of Implats.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Implats will release its results for the year ended 30 June 2020 (“the period”) on or about
3 September 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading
statement on SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for
the period to be reported on will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding
reporting period.

A significant increase in the dollar basket price for PGMs, together with rand depreciation, has
resulted in a higher rand PGM basket price received by the Group during the period.
Consequently, Implats is expecting headline earnings and headline earnings per share
(“HEPS”) for the period, to be significantly more than 20% higher than that reported for the
year ended 30 June 2019 (“the comparative period”). Headline earnings and HEPS for the
comparative period were R3 038 million and 423 cents respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are also expected to be significantly more
than 20% higher than the comparative period primarily due to the improvement in rand PGM

June 2020 market update

Implats refers to its SENS announcement of 30 April 2020 which provided revised Group
guidance for FY2020. The Group cautioned at the time as to the fluidity of the operating
environment created by the Covid-19 pandemic and its potential impact on guided production
parameters. Implats is therefore pleased to provide a further market update ahead of its closed
period starting 30 June 2020.

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Several innovative solutions have
been developed by our management teams including different cycles of work and staggered
shift systems aimed at enabling the best possible precautionary measures against the spread
of Covid-19 among our employees. Through collaboration and co-operation between
employees, union structures and management, we have created safer workplaces, and, a
better-than-expected production performance across Group operations in the final quarter of
FY2020.

Logistical constraints have eased and, despite the undeniable impact of the pandemic on
global economic activity, demand for metal from our customers has remained robust, allowing
us to capitalise on a reduction in excess inventory and a period of robust rand PGM pricing.

As the pandemic progresses in the coming months, we expect to face increasing challenges
to our medical preparedness and operational resilience. The benefit of experience gained by
our team over the past few months, together with the geographical diversification of our
operational footprint and the strong financial position of the Group, will prove vital to
successfully navigating the expected variability in the near-term operating environment.”

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE FOR FY2020

South Africa

The nationwide lockdown in South Africa, implemented on 26 March 2020, imposed legislated
limits on staffing levels at Impala Rustenburg, Marula and the joint venture at Two Rivers, but
made allowances for continued operations at the Group’s processing operations.

From 1 June 2020, restrictions on staffing levels were uplifted. However, the need for a
prudent and phased approach to intra-provincial travel by employees, particularly those
identified as returning from ‘hot spots’, has continued to limit attendance levels at operations
in Limpopo and the North West. Implats has made use of mandatory quarantine and isolation
protocols for returning workers from ‘hot spot’ areas to minimise the risk of transmission to its
workforce and host communities. In addition, South Africa’s national borders remain closed
and circa 5% of Group employees remain in their home countries.

Despite these limitations on staffing, the ramp-up of production has surpassed initial
expectations, with revised operating protocols proving effective in mitigating the impact of
potential virus-related interruptions at the Group’s South African mines, which had returned to
circa 85% of capacity by mid-June 2020.

Infection rates are expected to peak in South Africa in the coming months, and the challenges
associated with screening and identifying Covid-19 cases will be further complicated by the
prevalence of seasonal influenza. It remains Implats’ view that much of FY2021 will be
characterised by a ‘BUSINESS UNUSUAL’ operating environment.

Impala Refining Services (IRS)

Force majeure notices instituted on IRS customers from 26 March 2020 were uplifted in a
phased approach in May and June 2020. Excess concentrate and matte inventory
accumulated by customers (including Group operations) during the force majeure period are
expected to be received in full by Q1 FY2021.

Smelters and refineries were identified as ‘essential services’ during the national lockdown in
South Africa and the systematic ramp-up of operations and continued, albeit reduced,
production of refined volumes has resulted in the Group being able to fully refine the previously
identified excess in-process PGM inventory. As a result, refined and sales volumes will exceed
concentrate production in FY2020.

Given production rates relative to plan in FY2020, a decision was made to bring forward the
annual acid plant maintenance scheduled for July 2020. This is expected to result in greater-
than-usual alignment of processing and mining capacity in Q1 FY2021 but will have a small
impact on the FY2020 year-end processing inventory.

Implats declared force majeure on its contractual deliveries of final metal to its customers when
the national lockdown in South Africa was announced on 23 March 2020. This was uplifted on
22 June 2020. Prior to this upliftment, discussions for customer deliveries were conducted
monthly. To date, the overwhelming majority of Implats’ customers have elected to receive
their metal rather than exercise their right under force majeure to cancel deliveries. Logistical
constraints have eased with the resumption of international flights, such that these no longer
pose a risk to Implats’ ability to deliver metal.

Zimbabwe

Both Zimplats and the joint venture at Mimosa have operated uninterrupted and well within
pre-Covid-19 FY2020 guidance. Despite the indefinite extension of the national lockdown,
permission to continue mining operations remains in place and, to date, potential risks to output
associated with virus-related employee attendance and supply chain and logistical challenges
have not materialised. Residual concentrate and matte inventory accumulated in-country
during the IRS force majeure period is expected to be delivered to our Rustenburg processing
facilities in full by Q1 FY2021.

Canada

At Impala Canada, an outbreak of Covid-19 at the operation in mid-April 2020, necessitated
the temporary cessation of mining operations. The progress of the pandemic in Canada and
the “fly-in, fly-out” staffing model also required an appropriately cautious approach to re-staffing
and re-starting operations at Lac des Iles, with the mine expected to return to full production in
Q1 FY2021.

Capital investment

Implats’ capital allocation framework highlights the importance of appropriate levels of capital
investment to support operational resilience and environmental compliance. Interruptions to
operational activity across the Group as a result of national lockdowns has impacted the ability
to spend to plan in FY2020. Lower guidance therefore reflects the impact of business
interruption rather than a deliberate reduction of investment spend.

Implats elects not to exercise its option to increase its stake in the Waterberg Project

Implats refers to its SENS announcement of 16 October 2017, regarding its strategic
investment in the Waterberg Development Project (the project) and its right to acquire majority
ownership in the project through the exercise of a sale and subscription option following
completion of a definitive feasibility study (“DFS”). The Board of Implats has elected not to
exercise the current option arrangement to acquire up to 50.1% from the joint venture partners
(""JV partners""). Implats will, however, retain its 15% ownership in the project.

The original investment decision was informed by Implats’ stated strategy to rebalance its
portfolio of mining assets towards lower risk, shallow and mechanisable orebodies. The final
decision to increase participation in the project was always dependent on the outcomes of the
DFS. Following completion of this study, which was approved by the JV partners in December
2019, the following key considerations, among others, were considered in assessing the
Group’s appetite for increasing its participation in the project:

     •   The long-term PGM demand outlook combined with the project schedule and
         production ramp-up profile.
     •   Implats’ funding and return requirements at 50.01% shareholding in the context of the
         Group’s capital allocation framework, which prioritises balance sheet strength and
         shareholder returns.
     •   More recently, the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economic
         outlook.
     •   Investor financing appetite for large greenfield projects in general.

After taking these considerations into account, the Implats Board resolved that the Group will
not exercise its option to increase its shareholding in the project at this time.

Implats reiterates its support for both the project and its JV partners. The Group intends to
remain an active participant in the project at its current 15% shareholding, including funding its
share of costs depending on future implementation decisions taken by all the JV partners.

In addition, the Group confirms that its rights relating to the concentrate offtake from the project
remains unchanged and affirms its commitment to continue negotiations in this regard with the
JV partners in good faith.

Costs associated with further study and optimisation work to de-risk the project implementation
programme will continue to be funded by Implats, up to a maximum of R55 million as previously
announced, with planned studies expected to be complete by mid-August 2020.

Notification in terms of Section 45(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008

Following the completion of the acquisition of North American Palladium Limited (""NAP"") in
December 2019, the Company earlier this year finalised the process of refinancing the bridge
loan facility which was utilised by the Company and its subsidiaries to fund the acquisition of
NAP, as well as NAPs existing working capital facilities (the ""Acquisition Debt""), through
various means. This included the conclusion of a USD 275,000,000 term and revolving credit
facility by NAP (renamed Impala Canada Ltd.) which is guaranteed by the Company, Impala
Holdings Limited and Impala Platinum Limited.
The Company is also pleased to announce that it has amended its rand revolving credit facility
(""Rand Facility"") made available to the Company and guaranteed by Impala Platinum Limited
so that the Company will be entitled to request access to additional credit facilities of up to
ZAR2,000,000,000 under the same facility agreement should the need for additional liquidity
arise in the next 12 months. The amendments require the Company to confirm the financial
assistance in the form of indemnities provided to its subsidiary as contemplated in Section 45
of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the ""Companies Act"").

As part of its treasury management activities, the Company has refreshed approvals for the
following intercompany loans granted to certain subsidiaries:

Impala Platinum Limited       ZAR5,316,283,530
Gazelle Platinum Limited      ZAR199,679,283
Impala Holdings Limited       ZAR11,345,697,296

In addition, the Board of directors (the ""Board"") has authorised that the Company may, as
required from time to time over the next six months, provide direct or indirect financial
assistance - as contemplated in section 45 of the Companies Act - of up to a maximum
ZAR500,000,000 in aggregate, to any of its present or future related or inter-related companies
or corporations (including in the form of intercompany loans, guarantees to Eskom and the
Department of Mineral Resources, and cash management arrangements) (""Intercompany
Financial Assistance"").

Further, the Board has authorised that the Company may, as required from time to time over
the next six months, provide financial assistance - as contemplated in Section 44 and Section
45 of the Companies Act - of up to a maximum ZAR20,000,000 in terms of the Impala Platinum
Holdings Limited Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2012 (""2012 LTIP"") (“LTIP 2012
Financial Assistance”).

Accordingly, notice is hereby given that, in terms of the provisions of Section 45(5) of the
Companies Act, and pursuant to the special resolution passed at the general meeting held on
17 October 2018, the Board has adopted resolutions to provide the financial assistance in
relation to the Acquisition Debt, the Rand Facility and the Intercompany Financial Assistance
to direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company and in terms of the 2012 LTIP.
Shareholders are advised that the total value of the aforesaid financial assistance will exceed
one-tenth of 1% of the Company's net worth as at the date of the last meeting of the Board,
being 4 June 2020 and, as a consequence has triggered this notice in terms of section 45(5)
of the Companies Act.

Having considered all reasonable financial circumstances of the Company in terms of and
pursuant to the provisions of Section 45 as read with Section 4 of the Companies Act, the
Board satisfied itself that:

  •    immediately after providing the financial assistance referred to above, the Company
       would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test contemplated in Section 4 of the
       Companies Act;
  •    all relevant conditions and restrictions relating to the granting of such financial
       assistance by the Company contained in the Company's memorandum of
       incorporation are satisfied; and
  •    the terms and conditions on which such financial assistance is to be given are fair and
       reasonable to the Company.

RETIREMENT OF A DIRECTOR

Implats announces the planned retirement of Dr Mandla Gantsho as an independent non-
executive director and Chairman of the Board of directors of Implats (“the Board”) in
accordance with paragraph 3.59(b) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements. Dr Gantsho’s
retirement will take effect on conclusion of the scheduled annual general meeting of the
Company on 14 October 2020. Dr Gantsho was appointed to the Board in November 2010 as
a non-executive director and appointed Chairman in October 2015.

Implats CEO Nico Muller said: “Dr Gantsho has led the Board through some of the most testing
times in the history of both the broader PGM industry and the Group. His wise and steady-
handed stewardship of our leadership throughout his tenure as Chairman will be sorely missed.
Thanks in no small part to his clarity of vision and courageous leadership, Dr Gantsho leaves
the Group in a significantly stronger position with Implats now well equipped to navigate the
current challenging operating and economic environment that we find ourselves in. We are all
deeply grateful for his guidance and contribution over the years. On behalf of the Board and
the greater Implats team, I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Dr Gantsho for his
outstanding contribution over the past decade of Board service.”

The Board has started a process to appoint a new Chairman. Shareholders will be notified
once a candidate has been nominated and appointed.

Third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2020

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Implats continued to make excellent
progress in delivering a strengthened operational performance across the Group in a period
characterised by robust pricing for our primary products. The emergence of the coronavirus
pandemic has however, heralded a time of unprecedented uncertainty, which will require new
ways of thinking and innovative solutions to challenges we have not faced as a company before.

Implats is faced with nationwide lockdowns and legislated limitations on operating and
production capacity across all our operations aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. The
geographical spread of our operations has allowed mining production to continue during the
lockdown periods, albeit in varying degrees in different geographies, while the continued
production of refined metal has provided an opportunity to reduce excess in-process inventory.

The impact of the coronavirus will be a feature for some time and, in our view, operating in a
‘business as usual’ environment will not be possible until effective prevention and treatment
measures become readily available. Our internal planning to secure operational resilience
during the coronavirus pandemic has been ongoing since its emergence in early 2020. Our
primary focus remains on protecting the safety and health of our employees while sustaining
operational delivery as far as possible. The Group has taken decisive steps to secure and
sustain financial viability and continues to engage actively with the governments where we
operate, given the significant contribution we make to both local and national economies.

The Group’s focus for the remaining months of FY2020 will be multipronged and will include
securing operational stability in a period where unplanned interruptions are likely to be a regular
feature; protecting the health and wellbeing of our employees; maintaining close and
collaborative relationships with our customers; and further reducing the Group’s excess
processing stockpile to secure cashflow and protect our financial position.”

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Increased leadership focus and greater collaboration with all stakeholders, to prioritise safe
production across all operations, has yielded positive results and no fatalities were reported at
managed operations during the quarter under review. Regrettably, Mimosa, a non-managed
joint venture operation, recorded a fatal injury on 24 March 2020 when the late Stephen Chizola
was fatally injured in a fall-of-ground accident. The Board of Directors and management team
have extended their sincere sympathies to the family and friends of our colleague.

The lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and all injury frequency rates were 4.87 and
11.86 per million man hours worked, respectively, an improvement of 6% on both metrics from
those reported in FY2019. Nine of the 17 Group operations were on millionaire or multi-
millionaire status in terms of fatality free shifts at the end of the reporting period.

The Group fully supports the implementation of national lockdown measures to help curb the
spread of coronavirus, recognising the significant threat it represents to employees and
communities where we operate and we are cognisant of the role Implats must play in complying
with these measures.

Implats has implemented and enforced several measures to provide further health protection to
employees, rolling out several programmes which have been in development internally since
the threat of coronavirus emerged. The lockdown period was used to significantly strengthen
these preparations. Stock levels of medical protective equipment and PPE have been
increased, regular large-scale disinfection of workplaces is being performed and screening and
testing procedures for all employees reporting to work have been implemented. A meaningful
increase in medical care preparedness was also undertaken through further increasing the
capacity of the Group’s comprehensive internal medical facilities and through the coordinated
collaboration with industry peers, public/private partnerships and both local and regional
medical institutions.

Management teams across all Group operations have introduced risk-based operating
procedures to further protect employees. These measures are specifically aimed at reducing
the risk of viral infections in high-risk work areas and to vulnerable employee categories. These
steps include modifying at-risk employee behaviour, improved hygiene practices, restrictions on
the amount of work performed, social distancing while performing work and while travelling to
and from work, the provision of additional PPE where social distancing is not possible and the
implementation of screening and testing procedures.

Employees are screened using questionnaires, thermo-scanning of skin temperature, and if
necessary, core temperature screening, before entering their work areas. Employees with risk
indicators are isolated at dedicated areas at the operations and then transported to designated
medical facilities for diagnosis and, if necessary, testing, quarantine and/or hospitalisation.

A key part of Implats’ strategy has been to identify potentially vulnerable employees and to
institute additional precautionary measures to increase protection. This includes the provision
of vitamin and dietary supplements, flu vaccinations and critical medical screening. In addition,
employees have been provided with pre-packaged supplies of chronic medication for a period
of six months to ensure high-risk employees do not need to visit hospitals or clinics during this
time. Suitable temporary company accommodation is also being availed to employees who
may not be able to self-isolate or practise recommended social distancing measures when not
at work.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE THIRD QUARTER

On 23 March 2020, the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa issued a directive for a
national lockdown to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. Implats successfully
ramped down all South African operations and placed them on care and maintenance from
26 March 2020. The implementation of the lockdown is estimated to have resulted in a 6%
reduction in reported milled tonnage from each of Impala, Marula and Two Rivers, equivalent to
approximately 26 000 ounces of 6E mine-to-market concentrate production during the quarter.

Post the declaration of a state of emergency in Ontario, Impala Canada’s mining operations
were classified as an essential business by the Ontario government and after confirmation of
this status, operations resumed, with two days of lost production occurring in the period.

In accordance with the directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on 27 March 2020,
both Zimplats and Mimosa applied for, and were granted approval to continue operations during
the Zimbabwean national lockdown under agreed precautionary measures, with negligible
impact on reported production in the period under review.

IRS receipts from both third parties and mine-to-market operations were impacted by the
declaration of force majeure on concentrate and Zimplats matte deliveries from 24 March 2020
as processing facilities were prepared for care and maintenance ahead of the lockdown.

PRODUCTION

Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Group tonnes milled (excluding JV operations) improved by 18% to 5.36 million tonnes during
the quarter, compared to 4.53 million tonnes in the prior comparable period. An improved mining
performance at Marula and Zimplats compensated for lower volumes from Impala Rustenburg,
with absolute volume gains driven by the inclusion of Impala Canada and its contribution of
865 000 tonnes. Reported mill grade declined by 4% to 3.64g/t (6E), benefitting from a strong
performance at Marula but impacted by the inclusion of lower-grade volumes from Impala
Canada.

Mine-to-market 6E concentrate production was stable on a like-for-like basis with stronger
volumes from Marula and Zimplats offsetting weaker production from Impala Rustenburg and
Two Rivers. Together with production from the recently acquired Impala Canada operation,
concentrate volumes increased by 8% to 667 000 ounces from the prior comparable period.

IRS 6E in concentrate receipts from third-party and toll customers increased by 3% to 85 000
ounces. Gross concentrate production and receipts improved by 7% to 751 000 ounces.
Refined and saleable 6E production, which includes saleable ounces from Impala Canada,
increased by a more material 23% to 862 000 ounces.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
In the nine-month period ended 31 March 2020, the inclusion of Impala Canada compensated
for slightly lower year-to-date volumes from Impala Rustenburg. Tonnes milled, excluding
production from JV operations, increased by 6% to 15.67 million tonnes as the average mill
grade declined by 2% to 3.75g/t (6E).

Mine-to-market 6E concentrate production benefitted from higher volumes at Zimplats and
Marula and the initial contributions from Impala Canada, which helped offset weaker volumes
at Impala, Two Rivers and Mimosa. Gross 6E concentrate production of 2.02 million ounces is
1% higher than in the prior corresponding nine months.

In line with volume gains reported over the period, 6E third party and toll material received in
concentrate increased by 3% to 275 000 ounces.

Refined 6E production was impacted by the programme of scheduled maintenance at the
Groups’ processing facilities, including the scheduled furnace rebuild at Zimplats and acid plant
maintenance during the first half of financial year and the number 4 furnace ring repair
completed at Impala Rustenburg in 3Q 2020.

Gross refined production, including saleable ounces from Impala Canada declined by 5% to
2.18 million ounces – while saleable platinum production of 1.06 million ounces declined by 6%,
saleable palladium production of 689 000 ounces benefitted from the contribution of Impala
Canada and is 1% higher than in the prior comparable period.

The implementation of a revised stock allocation policy between IRS and Impala Rustenburg
resulted in a reallocation of refined volumes in 2Q 2020, and while Impala’s refined
6E production increased by 5% in the nine months ended 31 March 2020, IRS volumes were
19% lower.

At 31 March 2020, circa 200 000 ounces excess 6E in concentrate remained in stock, a
decrease of 150 000 ounces from the 350 000 ounces reported at 31 December 2019. These
stocks will continue to be used to bolster refined volumes and sales in the final quarter of
FY2020.

Impala Rustenburg
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 17 500 ounces of 6E, was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown. Tonnes
milled during the quarter declined by 8% to 2.37 million tonnes, compared to 2.58 million tonnes
in the prior comparable period. Lower volumes were delivered as expected from 1 and 10 shafts
due to reduced operations and challenging ground conditions, offset by the ramp-up in
production from 16 shaft.

The increase in the development-to-stoping ratio and continued orepass rehabilitation at 16 and
20 shafts impacted milled grade. However, concentrate production was buffered by improved
recovery and yield from the trial tailings campaign and other surface sources, resulting in a 7%
decrease in volumes to 275 000 ounces, compared to 296 000 ounces in the prior comparable
period.

Refined 6E production of 343 000 ounces improved by 12% during the quarter from 307 000
ounces in the prior corresponding period. This was due to the implementation of a revised stock
allocation policy between Impala Rustenburg and IRS during the current financial year.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Tonnes milled decreased 5% to 8.1 million tonnes and the milled grade of 3.92g/t (6E) was 1%
lower. Higher recoveries and contributions from the trial tailings campaign were offset by lower
production from other high-grade surface sources including smelter reverts. 6E production in
concentrate of 928 000 ounces declined by 4% from 969 000 ounces in the prior corresponding
period.

Refined 6E production increased by 5% to 1.10 million ounces from 1.05 million ounces during
the previous comparable period, benefitting from the change in stock allocation and despite
constrained smelter capacity due to ongoing maintenance.

Zimplats
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Zimplats operations received approval to operate during the national lockdown in Zimbabwe
resulting in minimal interruptions to production. The operation delivered a strong performance
during the quarter under review. Tonnes milled increased by 6% to 1.70 million tonnes, while
the delivered mill grade was stable at 3.46g/t (6E). 6E concentrate production improved by 6%
to 150 000 ounces compared to 141 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. Matte
production and concentrate sales were slightly higher than milled volumes in the period and
improved by 6% to 152 000 ounces.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput of 5.08 million tonnes was 3% higher and 6E concentrate production improved
by 3% to 449 000 ounces from the prior comparable period. Production in matte, together with
concentrates sold, were impacted by the accumulation of in-process inventory due to the
furnace rebuild in 1Q 2020 and declined by 3% to 419 000 ounces from 433 000 ounces.

Marula
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 3 500 ounces 6E was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown. Despite
this headwind, Marula delivered a much-improved performance in the current quarter benefiting
from the treatment of some surface material. Milled volumes increased by 23%, milled grade
rose by 17% and 6E concentrate production was up 37% to 55 000 ounces from the previous
comparable quarter when operational continuity was hampered by community disruptions,
which resulted in a seven-day work stoppage.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput improved by 8% to 1.40 million tonnes from 1.30 million tonnes in the previous
corresponding period. Grade increased by 9% and concentrate production rose by 14% to
179 000 ounces from 158 000 ounces.

Impala Canada
The acquisition of Impala Canada was concluded in December 2019 and operational results
reflect a full quarter of metrics for the first time. During the period, the integration of Impala
Canada into the Group was meaningfully advanced with a focus on financial and technical
support, together with alignment on several Implats operating principles and practises including
the progression of community and stakeholder relations.

The operational performance in the period was characterised by milling constraints due to
inclement weather conditions and ongoing rehabilitation of the ore pass system at the mine. In
total, 865 000 tonnes were milled generating 6E production of 55 000 ounces and saleable
volumes of 57 000 ounces.

Mimosa
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Mimosa received approval to operate during the national lockdown in Zimbabwe resulting in
minimal interruption to production in the quarter under review. Mining operations were placed
on care and maintenance at the end of the quarter as milling from stockpiled material continued.
Mining has since been resumed in terms of an exemption received from the government of
Zimbabwe.

Mimosa continued to recover from the first quarter when concentrate volumes were impacted
by extensive mill repairs. Milled volumes of 683 000 tonnes and delivered grade of 3.85g/t (6E)
were maintained versus the prior comparable period. Lower recoveries impacted marginally on
concentrate production, which declined by 2% to 61 000 ounces. The primary process
bottlenecks at Mimosa will be addressed through the installation of additional milling equipment
during the plant optimisation project which is currently underway at the operation.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
During the nine-month period, mill throughput declined by 5% from the prior comparable period
due to the breakdown in the primary mill in 1Q 2020, with a total of 1.99 million tonnes treated.
6E concentrate production of 181 000 ounces was 7% lower than the prior comparable period.

Two Rivers
Quarter ended 31 March 2020
An estimated 6% of production volume, equating to 4 500 ounces of 6E, was lost due to the
implementation of care and maintenance ahead of the start of the national lockdown at the end
of the quarter, with a further two days of production lost due to an Eskom transmission line fault
earlier in March 2020.

Total tonnes milled declined by 3% to 808 000 tonnes and milled grade was 4% lower at
3.46g/t (6E). Concentrator recoveries continued to be negatively impacted by lower grade and
changes in mineralogy as greater proportions of feed are sourced from split-reef and
development tonnage. Concentrate volumes of 71 000 ounces declined by 9% from the 78 000
ounces produced in the prior comparable period.

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Mill throughput decreased by 2% to 2.45 million tonnes, while mill grade decreased by 3% to
3.45g/t (6E) and metallurgical recoveries reduced by 6%. Consequently, 6E concentrate
production declined by 13% to 209 000 ounces from 239 000 ounces in the prior comparable
period. A project aimed at increasing mill capacity to compensate for the structural change in
feed-grade was approved in February 2020 with work commencing during the period.

IRS

Quarter ended 31 March 2020
Gross concentrate receipts were negatively impacted by the declaration of force majeure on
23 March 2020 to allow for an orderly shutdown of the processing facilities ahead of the start of
the national lockdown and restrictions on the transportation of non-essential goods during the
lockdown period. Refined 6E production of 462 000 ounces from both mine-to-market
operations (Zimplats, Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa) and IRS third-party and toll customers,
was 17% higher than in the previous period (396 000 ounces).

9 months ended 31 March 2020
Gross concentrate receipts benefitted from higher deliveries from Marula and third parties which
mitigated the impact of lower production from Zimplats, Mimosa and Two Rivers. While gross
concentrate receipts were fractionally lower, refined 6E production decreased by 19% to
1.01 million ounces, due largely to the change in the stock allocation policy between IRS and
Impala Rustenburg.

UNAUDITED FINANCIAL POSITION

Net cash, excluding finance leases, amounted to R3.2 billion at 31 March 2020, an improvement
of R2.1 billion from closing levels at 30 June 2019 of R1.1 billion, after the payment of
R978 million (FY2019: nil) in dividends to Implats shareholders during March 2020. The balance
sheet remains strong with an unutilised revolving credit facility of R4.0 billion available until
7 June 2021. The Group had liquidity headroom of R12.9 billion at 31 March 2020 compared to
the R12.2 billion available at the end of June 2019.

In addition, the Group has embarked on various cash preservation measures to improve liquidity
during the next 12 to18 months. These include a material reduction of non-essential operational
and capital expenditure and the extension of the maturity of the Standard Bank term loan
associated with the Marula BEE ownership of R865 million from 30 June 2020 to
30 September 2020.

FORCE MAJEURE

The bulk of Implats metals sales are sold into annual contracts and delivered on a monthly basis
to customers around the world. Implats declared force majeure on its contractual metal
deliveries when the national lockdown in South Africa was announced on the 23 March 2020.
This allows both Implats and its customers to suspend the operation of the contract for the
duration of the force majeure event, as reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Depending
on how the situation develops, partial, and later possibly complete, upliftment of the force
majeure protection can then be considered.

Discussions for resumed customer deliveries have been ongoing on this basis as greater
clarification regarding operating conditions has been reached. The majority of Implats’
customers have elected to receive metal on a delayed delivery schedule and, where logistics
have allowed, delivery of metal to customers has occurred in April 2020.

The relief of force majeure restrictions on deliveries in terms of IRS offtake agreements with
both Group companies and third parties is, however, conditional on the Group’s ability to sell
and transport final metal to customers and the impact of further amendments to the terms of the
South African national lockdown. The Group is working towards the upliftment of the force
majeure on its IRS receipts as a near-term priority.

OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE

The Group was well on-track to meet the guidance parameters on production, unit costs and
capex provided with the release of its half year results ended 31 December 2019. However,
Implats is now faced with a period of unprecedented uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the implementation of nationwide lockdowns and legislated limitations on production
capacity at the Group’s South African operations.

Operational activities during the lockdown period 26 March - 30 April 2020
While milled volumes from Zimbabwean operations were largely unaffected by the Zimbabwean
national lockdown, underground production from Impala Rustenburg, Marula and the
Two Rivers joint venture were heavily impacted during the initial period of the South African
national lockdown. Minimal underground production was secured during April 2020 as the focus
remained on the safety and health of employees and ensuring the orderly screening, testing
and training of returning employees ahead of the gradual resumption of drilling and blasting.

At Impala Canada, following a positive case of COVID-19, further employees have tested
positive and the mine was placed on care and maintenance and the workforce quarantined for
a two-week period from 13 April 2020. Regrettably, an employee with comorbidities passed
away on 23 April 2020. The Board and management team have extended their sincere
condolences to his family, friends and colleagues and wish all affected employees at the
operation a speedy recovery. Discussions for a planned resumption of operating activities are
ongoing with the relevant health authorities in Ontario.

While mining production was stopped in South Africa during April 2020, the Group took a phased
approach to processing activities, in line with regulations which recognised smelters and
refineries as ‘essential services’ during the lockdown period. This has allowed a systematic
ramp-up of operations and continued, albeit reduced, production of refined volumes during the
lockdown period. This development has allowed for a reduction of excess in-process inventory
at the Group and, as such, refined volumes are likely to exceed concentrate production in the
FY2020 period.

Implats’ revised production guidance considers the production losses suffered in March and
April 2020 and assumes average production rates of between 30% and 40% of previous plans
in May and June 2020 for South African operations. In Zimbabwe, the Group’s mines have
operated successfully to date but remain vulnerable to potential unforeseen interruptions during
the remainder of the forecast period. In Canada, the guidance assumes operations will resume
in May 2020 but at a lower production rate.

The Group is pleased that its cost performance in the nine months to March 2020 was within
guidance despite the impact of a weaker-than-expected rand on the translated cost base of both
Zimplats and Impala Canada. The operating environment is now highly uncertain and the
combination of variable production parameters, staffing levels and currency volatility creates
exceptional forecast risk at this point in time. As a result, Implats is withdrawing its unit cost
guidance for FY2020.

Capex spend has been impacted by the wider effects of the South African national lockdown,
together with rand weakness on spend in Zimbabwe and Canada. Revised capex guidance
reflects rand weakness, offset by savings and deferment where necessary.

The revised Group guidance is illustrated in the table below. Implats cautions as to the fluidity
of the current operating environment and the downside risks presented by the potential for
further lockdowns or variations in operating parameters. It is the Group’s intention to issue a
further market update ahead of the year-end on 30 June 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE

Implats refers all stakeholders to its SENS announcements of 24 March and 30 March 2020 noting
its acknowledgement and support for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a
21-day national lockdown to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in South Africa. The national
lockdown of all non-essential businesses and services was effective from midnight Thursday,
26 March 2020 and, following the recently announced two-week extension, will continue until
midnight on Thursday, 30 April 2020. In terms of an amendment to the regulations and these
directives, announced on 16 April 2020, mining operations may now conduct activities at a reduced
capacity of not more than 50% during the extended lockdown period, subject to the implementation
of specified precautionary measures aimed at protecting employees and limiting the spread of the
virus. Once the provisions of the lockdown have been lifted, operations may ramp up capacity further
as determined by the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy.

Implats supports the lockdown measures taken by national governments to reduce the spread of the
coronavirus and welcomes the amended regulations, which will assist in securing critical mining
infrastructure and mitigate the severe impact of these measures on the lives and livelihoods of
employees, host communities and suppliers.

The Group’s internal planning to secure operational resilience during the coronavirus pandemic has
been ongoing since January 2020. Implats’ approach is based on the view that the virus will be a
feature for some time and operating in a ‘business as usual’ environment will not be possible in the
near term. Implats’ primary focus has therefore been on protecting the lives and livelihoods of its
stakeholders by taking steps to secure and sustain the financial viability of the Group and support
the national economies of the countries in which it operates.

Implats will establish a mechanism to enable members of its Board, the Group Executive Committee
and all Implats employees to donate up to one third of their salaries over the next three months. The
donations, including those received from our international operations, will, at the donor’s election,
either be paid into the Solidarity Fund - established to improve prevention and detection of COVID-
19 and cushion the impact of the pandemic on the country’s most vulnerable citizens - or be used to
provide care and support to our mine host communities. This mechanism heeds the call by the
President and the Cabinet, and their demonstrated leadership in action, in which they will donate
one third of their salary for three months into the Solidarity Fund.

All South African operations (Impala Rustenburg mining, processing and refining and Marula mining
and concentrating) were successful ramped down and placed on care and maintenance from
Thursday, 26 March 2020. The Group continued with limited operating activities at its critical
smelting and refining infrastructure and performed care and maintenance on underground
operations during the initial 21-day lockdown period. This allowed the Group to secure its furnaces
by treating some in-process inventory during this period. The Group’s ability to deliver precious
metals to customers has been constrained by the unavailability of secure air freight during the
lockdown, while base metal sales have been impeded by road and port restrictions.

Preventative measures

Implats has implemented and enforced several measures to provide protection to employees who
are at work, rolling out a number of programmes which have been in development internally since
the threat of coronavirus emerged in January 2020. The lockdown period has been used to
significantly strengthen preparations to ready the business and safeguard employees. Stock levels
of medical protective equipment and PPE have been increased, regular large-scale disinfection of
workplaces is being performed and screening and testing procedures for all employees currently
reporting to work to perform essential services have been implemented. At this time, no COVID-19
cases have been diagnosed among employees or their dependants at the Group’s South African
and Zimbabwean operations.

A meaningful increase in medical care preparedness has also been undertaken through increasing
the capacity of internal medical facilities and through the coordinated collaboration with industry
peers, public/private partnerships and both local and regional medical institutions.

Management teams across all Group operations have introduced vital risk-based operating
procedures to further protect employees. These measures are specifically aimed at reducing the risk
of viral infections in high-risk work areas and to vulnerable employee categories. These steps
include improved hygiene, restrictions on the amount of work performed, social distancing while
performing work and while travelling to and from work, the provision of additional PPE and the
implementation of screening and testing procedures.

All essential services employees are currently screened using questionnaires, thermo-scanning of
skin temperature, and if necessary, core temperature screening, before entering their work areas.
These protocols will continue to ramp-up as employees return to work. Employees with abnormal
temperatures will be isolated at dedicated areas at the operations and then transported to designated
medical facilities for diagnosis and, if necessary, testing, quarantine and/or hospitalisation.

A key part of Implats’ return to work strategy has been to identify potentially vulnerable employees
and to institute additional specific precautionary measures to increase protection. This includes the
provision of vitamin and dietary supplements, flu vaccinations and critical medical screening. In
addition, employees have been provided with pre-packaged supplies of chronic medication for a
period of six months to ensure high-risk employees do not need to visit hospitals or clinics during
this time. Suitable temporary company accommodation is also being availed to employees who may
not be able to self-isolate or practise recommended social distancing measures when not at work.

Operational update

Implats’ operational strategy is aimed at securing the integrity of key infrastructure and facilitating a
safe start-up once operations are cleared to resume. A systematic increase in labour attendance
was planned at Impala Rustenburg and Marula from 14 April 2020, in line with the permissions
received from the regulator. Following the easing of the lockdown provisions announced on
16 April 2020, the South African operations will advance measures to responsibly manage a gradual
return to work from Friday, 17 April 2020, taking the precautionary measures necessary to protect
employees. The management team continues to engage with the relevant authorities in this regard.

As previously indicated, management met with organised labour at both the national and branch
level before the lockdown began and agreed to continue paying full salaries to all employees during
the 21-day lockdown period. However, it was communicated to all stakeholders that the Group’s
financial position could not sustain this arrangement post the initial 21-day lockdown period and
therefore alternative arrangements would be implemented should the lockdown period continue
beyond the originally envisaged 21 days. The Group's standpoint is unchanged in this regard but
remain open to exploring alternative measures with its social partners to assist employees where
possible.

Impala Canada’s mining operations were classified as an essential business by the Ontario
government and operations continued at the Lac des Iles mine (LDI) during the declared state of
emergency. The provincial government has since extended the period to 12 May 2020. The
emergence of seven confirmed cases of COVID-19 at LDI over the past week, despite extensive
preventative measures that had been implemented to ensure employee safety, has required a ramp
down of operating activity. The operation was placed into temporary care and maintenance on
Monday, 13 April 2020. The majority of employees have left the site and are in self-quarantine until
27 April 2020. Management continues to collaborate with the health authorities and operations will
resume when it is safe to do so.

In accordance with the directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on Friday, 27 March 2020,
a 21-day lockdown commenced in Zimbabwe on Monday, 30 March 2020. Zimplats and Mimosa
applied for, and were granted, approval to continue with operations under agreed precautionary
measures. This has allowed Zimplats to maintain mining and processing operations, while at
Mimosa, limited mining operations to supplement available ore resources have allowed concentrate
production to continue during the lockdown.

Nico Muller, Implats CEO, said: “We are living in times of unprecedented uncertainty, which requires
new ways of thinking and innovative solutions to challenges we have not faced before. At Implats
we have taken several proactive steps to safeguard our business, with a key focus on securing and
ensuring the well-being of our employees.

“As management, we maintain regular and open communication with our key stakeholders including
our employees, organised labour and the national governments of Zimbabwe, South Africa and
Canada. To this end, we will continue to enhance our strategies for a successful resumption of
operating activities. This is necessary to secure the vital role our company plays in the livelihoods of
our employees, our host communities and the national economies in which we operate.

“Implats remains committed to engaging with all our stakeholders as we navigate through the
challenges presented by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We have been working tirelessly since
the emergence of the virus, to safeguard our employees and ensure the sustainability of our
company. We have significantly strengthened the preventative safety and health measures put in
place and are ready for a safe and orderly start up once we are given the go ahead to resume full-
scale production at our operations.”

Implats will provide additional updates as the situation develops. In addition, guidance on operations
will be provided in the scheduled third quarter FY2020 production update on 30 April 2020.

COVID-19 UPDATE

Implats refers all stakeholders to its SENS announcement of 24 March 2020 noting South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a 21-day national lockdown of all non-essential
businesses and services, effective from midnight Thursday, 26 March 2020 to help curb the spread
of COVID-19 in South Africa. The South African national lockdown is planned to continue until
midnight on Thursday, 16 April 2020.

The Group supports the decisive action taken by the South African government to help flatten the
curve of the COVID-19 infection rate. Implats is committed to contributing where it can to South
Africa’s socio-economic stability. During the national lockdown, Implats’ primary focus is on
protecting the lives and livelihoods of employees, service providers and communities through doing
all it can to sustain the financial viability of its business and the national economies of the countries
in which it operates.

Implats successfully ramped down all South African mining operations (Impala Rustenburg and
Marula) and placed them on care and maintenance from Thursday, 26 March 2020. Essential care
and maintenance services are continuing to ensure the integrity of key infrastructure and facilitate
a safe start-up once operations are cleared to resume.

In line with South African government regulations, the Group has applied for permission to conduct
limited smelting operations at Impala Rustenburg together with limited operations at its Springs
refinery. This would allow some in-process inventory to be treated during the lockdown period
under controlled conditions. The Group will also apply for permission to conduct limited
underground ore transport and milling at its South African mining operations under agreed
precautionary measures. This would greatly assist in securing underground infrastructure during
the lockdown period and significantly enhance our ability to safely resume operations after the
lockdown period.

Impala Canada’s mining operations have been classified as an essential business by the Ontario
government and are therefore permitted to continue operations during the provincial 14-day
lockdown. Our executive leadership team is taking all the necessary precautions pertaining to
COVID-19. They are actively monitoring developments in the province of Ontario and Canada and
will adapt work procedures accordingly.

Following a directive issued by the Government of Zimbabwe on Friday, 27 March 2020, a 21-day
lockdown commenced in Zimbabwe on Monday, 30 March 2020. In line with government regulation,
executives at Zimplats and Mimosa have applied to continue with operations under agreed
precautionary measures. This would allow mining and processing operations to continue relatively
uninterrupted at Zimplats during the lockdown. Mimosa will continue to process stockpile material
during the lockdown and conduct limited mining operations to supplement available ore resources
during the period.

The safety of employees and contractors on all sites is a key priority and additional measures are
in place to protect the health of employees working during the lockdown and thereafter. These
include, but are not limited to, heightened risk mitigation measures through early COVID-19
detection, an enhanced focus on pandemic awareness, workplace hygiene, medical surveillance,
additional PPE and medical supplies, and isolation and treatment of suspected and confirmed
cases. All clinics and the Impala Rustenburg hospital will remain open and fully operational during
the lockdown period. At this time, no COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed among employees or
their dependants.

Management met with organised labour at both the national and branch level before the lockdown
and agreed to continue paying all employees during the 21-day lockdown period. However, it was
communicated to all stakeholders that alternative arrangements will need to be implemented
should the lockdown period continue beyond the envisaged 21 days.

Force majeure letters have been issued to all consultants and contractors for the duration of the
lockdown, to legally suspend our obligations under these contracts.

Force majeure letters have also been issued in respect of offtake agreements with both Group
companies and third parties, as well as customer supply contracts, to legally suspend our
obligations under these contracts.

With respect to offtake agreements, deliveries from all parties to the smelter were suspended on
24 March 2020 to enable the smelting operations to prepare for an orderly shutdown. With respect
to customer supply contracts, deliveries can resume once the force majeure is lifted, provided
delivery logistics permit.

We remain in regular contact with all our service providers and customers to work towards meeting
their continued requirements as best as possible while our business is impacted, aligned to the
force majeure provisions as it applies to each party.

Several steps have been taken to respond at short notice to President Ramaphosa’s directive while
seeking to preserve the financial viability of our business. The Group will continue to maximise the
business flexibility provided by our diverse asset base and mine-to-market operating model, and
detailed planning is underway to ensure a swift and safe start-up once the lockdown suspended.

Implats will provide additional updates as the situation develops. In addition, guidance on its
operations will be provided in its scheduled third quarter FY2020 production update on or around
30 April 2020.

COVID-19 LOCKDOWN

Implats notes South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directive for a 21-day national shutdown
of all non-essential businesses and services, effective midnight Thursday 26 March 2020.

The Group supports the decisive action taken to help bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control
and flatten the curve of the infection rate. The health and safety of our employees and host
communities is of paramount importance to Implats.

The Group is working systematically to ensure an orderly transition to a period of care and
maintenance at our mining, smelting and refining operations, as directed by the South African
government.

Implats plays a key role in the economy of South Africa, is a major employer, and our operations
support multiple businesses and families in our host communities. As such, the Group is engaging
with the South African government to ensure the sustainability of the Group and mitigate, where
possible, the negative socio-economic outcomes of the shutdown.

The Implats Board and executive are engaged in detailed analysis and planning related to the impact
the shutdown will have on the Group. Further details will be communicated once the Group has more
certainty.

Implats CEO Nico Muller said: “These are unprecedented and extraordinary times and we all need
to make sacrifices for the greater good. Implats will do what is necessary to protect our employees,
communities and the South African economy.”

Commentary
Implats delivered solid results for its half year ended 31 December 2019. Sustained operating performances
from mining operations, together with robust rand PGM pricing during the period, offset short-term challenges
associated with concentrator maintenance and constrained smelter availability, resulting in improved free 
cash flow and strong headline earnings. 

This enabled the funding of the acquisition of Impala Canada through a combination of cash, a forward sale
of metal and debt. The Group was also able to reinstate dividends, based on a pay-out ratio of free cash flow
generated before growth capital of 30%. The Board declared an interim dividend of R1,25 per ordinary share,
which will be paid on 23 March 2020. 

Safety remains the Group's foremost priority. Despite 6% and 9% improvements in the total and lost-time
injury frequency rates, respectively, Implats mourns the loss of three employees at its managed operations. 

The Group's strategic re-positioning as a high-value, profitable and competitive PGM producer was
meaningfully advanced through initiatives to improve organisational effectiveness at key operations. In addition, 
a three-year wage settlement was secured with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union at Impala
Rustenburg and Marula. 

At Impala Rustenburg, the sustained improvement in cost performance, productivity and safety at 12 and 
14 Shafts has resulted in these operations collectively meeting the internal targets set to avoid disposal or
closure and we now expect to operate these assets for the foreseeable future. While higher pricing has provided
some medium-term life extension at 1 Shaft, 9 Shaft is likely to be closed in the short-term due to depleted
mineable reserves.

The Group delivered stable 6E in concentrate production of 1,53 million ounces, with Group refined
6E production down by 17% on constrained smelter availability due to a planned furnace rebuild at Zimplats. 

Free cash inflow of R5,0 billion improved year-on-year as received rand PGM pricing rose by 41% per ounce,
offsetting a 16% decline in 6E sales volumes due to an increase in work-in-process metal inventories.
Revenue improved by 19% to R28,0 billion, gross profit increased by more than 90% to R6,2 billion and 
headline earnings rose by 52% to R3,4 billion or 436 cents per share. 

Net cash generated from operating activities amounted to R6,0 billion for the six months. The incentivised
early conversion of the US$ bond resulted in a R3,1 billion reduction in debt as 64,3 million Implats shares
were issued in August 2019. The benefit of this, together with the payment of residual debt at Zimplats, was
partially offset by a bridging loan used to fund the acquisition of Impala Canada, and the Group ended the half
year in a net debt position of R1,9 billion.

DECLARATION OF INTERIM DIVIDEND

The Board of Implats wishes to inform shareholders that it has approved the declaration of an interim cash
dividend of R1,25 per ordinary share for the six-month period ended 31 December 2019. The interim dividend has
been declared in terms of the newly approved dividend policy, which is aligned to the Company's capital
allocation framework. The dividend policy states that a dividend will be declared from 30% of free cash flow
generated, pre-growth capital, for any given period, subject to the Board's discretion. 

The Company has 799 034 147 ordinary shares in issue and the Company's tax reference number is 9700178719.
The dividend has been declared from retained earnings and will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax 
for shareholders who are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, a reduced rate of withholding tax. Therefore,
the net dividend amount is R1,00 per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay the dividend withholding tax
and R1,25 per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding tax. Shareholders are advised
to complete the requisite declaration form to make the Company aware of their tax status. The salient dates 
are as follows:

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019

Implats will release results for the half year ended 31 December 2019 (""the period"") on 27 February 2020.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading statement on
SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that financial results for the next reporting period will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Implats' headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period are expected to increase
by between 42% and 62% and by between 32% and 50% respectively, compared to those reported for the
six months ended 31 December 2018 (""the comparative period""). Headline earnings are expected to be
between R3.160 billion and R3.600 billion and HEPS will increase to between 408 cents and 465 cents per
share. Headline earnings and HEPS for the comparative period were R2.228 billion and 310 cents per share,
respectively.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period are expected to increase by between 37%
and 57% and by between 27% and 46% respectively, compared to the comparative period. Basic earnings are
expected to be between R3.170 billion and R3.630 billion and EPS to be between 409 cents and 469 cents
per share. Basic earnings and EPS for the comparative period were R2.306 billion and 321 cents per share,
respectively.

Despite sales volumes for the period being lower than the comparative period due to the impact of ongoing
planned smelter maintenance on refined production, gross profit is expected to increase by more than 90%
to approximately R6 billion, primarily due to the higher rand PGM basket price.

This increase was partially offset by:

    *   the once off expense of R509 million or 66 cents per share (no tax impact), relating to the incentivised
        early conversion of the US$ convertible bonds during the period;
    *   restructuring costs of R238 million or 31 cents per share (after tax); and
    *   higher taxation charges due to improved profitability.

Further, in the comparative period, earnings included the non-taxable income from Zimplats of export
incentives of R417 million or 58 cents per share, which did not recur in the current period.

The weighted average number of shares in issue for the period increased to 774.4 million due to the issue of
64.3 million Implats ordinary shares on 1 August 2019, after US$ bond holders elected to exercise their option
to convert their bonds into Implats ordinary shares.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

Forward-Looking Statements

This announcement contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the securities
laws of certain jurisdictions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words like ""may,""
""will,"" ""likely,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,""
""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""continue"" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are neither
historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current
beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and
strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent
uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which
are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this announcement are
made only as of the date of this announcement, and except as otherwise required by law, we do
not have any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect
subsequent events or circumstances.

Forward-looking statements in this announcement include, but are not limited to: statements with
respect to the completion of the Transaction and the timing for its completion; the satisfaction of
conditions precedent which include, without limitation the conditions referred to in paragraph 1
above, including compliance by Implats and NAP with various covenants contained in the
Arrangement Agreement; statements with respect to the effect of the Transaction on Implats and
its strategy going forward; statements with respect to the anticipated benefits associated with the
acquisition of NAP; and NAP’s financial outlook for estimated net and gross revenues from the
sale of palladium for fiscal 2020.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions regarding Implats and NAP,

including the completion of the Transaction, anticipated benefits from the Transaction, and
expected growth, results of operations, performance, industry trends and growth opportunities.
While Implats and NAP consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information
currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements.

The factors and assumptions contained in this news release, which may prove to be incorrect,
include, but are not limited to: the completion of the Transaction on the terms detailed above; NAP
will be able to continue normal business operations at Lac des Iles Mine; palladium prices and
exchange rates between the Canadian and United States dollar will be consistent with NAP's
expectations; there will be no significant disruptions affecting operations; and that prices for key
mining and construction supplies, including labour, will remain consistent with NAP's
expectations. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

The assumptions of Implats and NAP, although considered reasonable by them at the time of
preparation, may prove to be incorrect. In addition, forward-looking statements necessarily involve
known and unknown risks, including, without limitation, risks associated with general economic
conditions; adverse industry events; future legislative, tax and regulatory developments; inability
to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, and/or inability to access sufficient
capital on favourable terms; the ability of NAP to implement its business strategies; competition;
currency and interest rate fluctuations and other risks. Among other things, there can be no
assurance that the Transaction will be completed or that the anticipated benefits from the
Transaction will be achieved.

Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive. Readers are further cautioned not
to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as there can be no assurance that the
plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are placed will occur. Such information,
although considered reasonable by management at the time of preparation, may prove to be
incorrect and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated.

Forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified by this
cautionary statement and reflect our expectations as of the date hereof, and thus are subject to
change thereafter.

Notice to U.S. Holders. Both Implats and NAP have been formed outside of the United States.
The Transaction will be subject to disclosure requirements of Canada that are different from those
of the United States. Financial statements included in the documents, if any, will be prepared in
accordance with Canadian accounting standards and may not be comparable to the financial
statements of United States companies. It may be difficult for a securityholder in the United States
to enforce his/her/its rights and any claim a securityholder may have arising under U.S. federal
securities laws, since the companies are located in Canada, and some or all of their officers or
directors may be residents of Canada or another country outside of the United States. A
securityholder may not be able to sue a Canadian company or its officers or directors in a court
in Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States for violations of U.S. securities laws. It may
be difficult to compel a Canadian company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's
judgment.

IMPLATS REACHES A THREE-YEAR WAGE SETTLEMENT

Implats' operating subsidiaries - Impala Platinum Limited's Rustenburg operations and Marula
Platinum Limited - have signed a three-year wage settlement with the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).

The settlement is effective from 1 July 2019 and assures employees of increases to all major
components of remuneration over the next three years including basic salaries, living-out and
home-ownership allowances, medical aid and pension fund contributions. The agreement is
in line with current mining inflation of c.7% and takes into consideration the reality of
inflationary pressures faced by our employees.

This agreement secures three years of stability at Implats' operating entities and has been
achieved through a collaborative process typified by mutual respect and consideration and
without requiring intervention or mediation by third parties. The agreement removes
substantial uncertainty for our employees and allows a singular focus on the pursuit of safe
and sustainable production.

First quarter production report for the period 1 July 2019 to 30 September 2019

Key highlights

    -   Despite an improvement in safety performance, the Group regretfully reported two employee
        fatalities at managed operations during the reporting period. Implats remains resolute in its
        commitment to achieving our vision of zero harm.

    -   Production at Impala, Marula and Zimplats was delivered to plan. Production from JV
        operations was negatively impacted by a mill failure at Mimosa and scheduled maintenance
        and metallurgical challenges at Two Rivers.

    -   Scheduled maintenance at the Zimplats smelter and at Impala Rustenburg's acid plant
        impacted refined production, resulting in a build-up in concentrate stocks as expected. 

    -   Implats accelerated the repositioning of its portfolio with an offer to acquire North American
        Palladium, a shallow, mechanised, palladium-rich, and cash-generative asset in Canada.

Implats' Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: ""We knew our first quarter would be
characterised by an increase in working capital due to our stringent maintenance schedule at key
processing assets. The unforeseen challenges at Mimosa and Two Rivers were addressed by the
respective management teams, with plans in place to mitigate the impact of the slow-start on full-year
production targets at these operations. The markets for our primary products remain buoyant and we
have taken bold steps to advance our stated strategy of repositioning the Group through the induced
conversion of the dollar convertible bond, and more recently, the announcement of our offer to acquire
North American Palladium. Our leadership remains committed to securing a fair and equitable wage
agreement at our South African operations and we continue to monitor developments in Zimbabwe, with
close interaction and communication with the Zimbabwean government to counter the challenges
presented by the uncertain macro-economic outlook. We remain confident in our ability to deliver to plan
in FY2020.""

SAFETY
Safety remains a key business imperative for the Group. The regression in safety performances during
the last quarter of the previous financial year was extremely disappointing following a period of
unprecedented improvements. This has necessitated increased leadership focus and collaboration with
all stakeholders to arrest the decline and prioritise safe production across all operations.

During the quarter under review, the lost time injury frequency rate of 5.27 per million man hours worked
improved by 7.7% from the 5.71 recorded in the fourth quarter of FY2019 and by 0.6% on the 5.30
reported for FY2019.

Despite this improvement in safety performance, Impala Rustenburg regretfully recorded two employee
fatalities during the reporting period, the first in a tramming incident at 1 Shaft and the second in a scraper
winch incident at 11 Shaft. In addition, Two Rivers, a non-managed joint venture operation, recorded a
fatal incident during the period, its first in seven years. The board of directors and management team
have extended their sincere sympathies to the families and friends of these colleagues. Implats provides
ongoing support to their families, recognising the severe impact of their loss. Each incident was subject
to a rigorous independent investigation and remedial action was taken to prevent reoccurrence.

Implats' safety strategy is premised on providing an inherently safe work environment, maintaining
leading safety practices and inculcating safe behaviour at all times. Management remains resolute in its
commitment to working with all stakeholders to prioritise safe production and achieve our vision of zero
harm.

PRODUCTION
Gross tonnes milled at managed operations decreased by 2.4% to 5.21 million tonnes during the quarter,
compared to 5.34 million tonnes achieved in the prior comparable period. This was largely due to lower
production from Impala Rustenburg's 1 Shaft, as plans were progressed to outsource mining operations,
and at Marula where the successful narrowing of the stoping width resulted in improved ore quality.

Platinum in concentrate of 280 000 ounces produced at managed operations was unchanged from the
prior comparable quarter. Across all mining operations (managed and joint venture) platinum in
concentrate production declined by 4.2% to 334 000 ounces (FY2019 Q1: 349 000 ounces) largely as a
result of milling constraints experienced during the reporting period at Two Rivers and Mimosa.

At IRS, lower receipts from the JV operations at Mimosa and Two Rivers, were offset to some extent by
higher receipts from third-parties. As a result, receipts decreased by 9.5% to 187 000 ounces of platinum
in concentrate.

Gross refined platinum produced during the quarter was significantly impacted by planned maintenance
at Zimplats' furnace and Impala Rustenburg's acid plant, which constrained processing capacity. As a
result, refined platinum production declined by 24.0% to 281 000 ounces (FY2019 Q1: 369 000 ounces).
In-process inventory consequently increased during the quarter and is expected to be released over the
remainder of the financial year. Forecast refined platinum production for the full year is maintained at
between 1.45 and 1.55 million ounces.

Impala
Milled production at Impala Rustenburg was impacted by lower ore volumes from 1 Shaft (173 000
tonnes) as plans to potentially extend production from this shaft through an outsourced contractor mining
arrangement were progressed. As a result, tonnes milled decreased by 4.2% to 3.02 million tonnes,
compared to 3.15 million tonnes in the previous comparable quarter. The mill grade (6E) deteriorated by
3.6% to 3.88 g/t (FY2019 Q1: 4.03 g/t) primarily as a result of increased off-reef mining at 11 and 20
shafts and higher stoping widths associated with rolling UG2 reef at 10, 11 and 14 shafts. Platinum in
concentrate production was stable at 186 000 ounces supported by good performances across all mining
operations and improved processing recoveries. Refined platinum production, however, was impacted
by constrained Group smelting capacity due to the previously mentioned planned maintenance at
Zimplats' smelter and Impala Rustenburg's acid plant. Consequently, refined platinum production was
83 000 ounces, compared to 180 000 ounces in the prior comparable quarter.

Zimplats
After a disappointing safety performance in the final quarter of FY2019, Zimplats' safety performance has
stabilised with only one lost-time injury reported during the quarter. Zimplats sustained its operational
performance with mill throughput and grade largely unchanged at 1.71-million tonnes and 3.49 g/t (6E)
respectively. As a result, platinum in concentrate produced at the operation during the quarter was
maintained at 70 000 ounces. Some concentrates were sent to Impala Refining Services (IRS) for
processing during the quarter under review as the Zimplats smelter underwent routine maintenance. The
refurbishment has since been completed with the smelter being commissioned from October 2019.

Marula
Marula continues to deliver an improved operational performance. While tonnes milled decreased by
4.5% to 488 000 tonnes, focused mining resulted in a reduced stoping width and delivered a 4.8%
increased grade of 4.43 g/t. As a result, platinum in concentrate production improved by 2.6% to 24 000
ounces during the period under review. Management continues to focus on securing a lasting resolution
to intermittent community disruptions at the operation.

Mimosa
Mining production at Mimosa was maintained during the quarter. However, concentrate production was
impacted by extended repairs to one of the milling circuits. Consequently, mined volumes were stockpiled
during the period and only 589 000 tonnes were milled, 16.1% down on the previous comparable quarter.
Despite the improvement in grade to 3.85 g/t (FY2019 Q1: 3.80 g/t), platinum in concentrate production
decreased by 16.4% to 25 000 ounces (FY2019 Q1: 30 000 ounces) due to lower milled tonnage.

Two Rivers
Challenging operating conditions continue to impact Two Rivers. Tonnes milled decreased 3.3% to
798 000 tonnes (FY2019 Q1: 825 000 tonnes). Accelerated deepening into the neighbouring Kalkfontein
block impacted mill grade which declined by 2.9% to 3.40 g/t. Extended maintenance and metallurgical
challenges at the concentrator during the quarter impacted platinum in concentrate production, which
decreased by 23.4% to 29 000 ounces.

Impala Refining Services (""IRS"")
IRS's refined platinum production increased by 4.1% to 197 000 ounces (FY2019 Q1: 189 000 ounces)
as higher deliveries from third-party customers were received during the period under review. Mine-to-
market production decreased by 3.2% to 149 000 ounces, reflecting lower receipts from the Group's joint
venture operations. Third-party volumes increased by 36.4% to 48 000 ounces (FY2019 Q1:
35 000 ounces).

GROUP STRATEGY
At Impala Rustenburg, plans are being progressed to outsource mining operations at 1 Shaft and
complete the closure of 9 Shaft. As previously announced, a ""contracted out"" mining model was found
to provide the best protection of employment at 1 Shaft during the planned ramp-down of the shaft in the
context of higher than expected rand PGM pricing. A Section 189 (Labour Relations Act) notice was
issued in July 2019 to initiate this phase of the restructuring plan. The original Section 52 notices covering
1, 9, 12 and 14 shafts, which were issued in August 2018, remain in place.

As reported previously, Implats launched a successful conversion invitation to holders of its 2022 US$250
million bond in July 2019. Together with the cancellation of the Groups' cross-currency interest rate swap
(CCIRS), the conversion reduced the carrying value of Group debt by some R3.0 billion, while removing
the associated annual interest liability of R319 million. A total of 64.3 million new Implats shares were
issued in August 2019 with a total cost of the offer of R524 million, representing an incentive premium of
R510 million and accrued interest of R14 million settled from existing cash balances.

ACQUISITION OF NORTH AMERICAN PALLADIUM
Post the end of the quarter, Implats entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding
shares in Canadian PGM miner, North American Palladium Limited (NAP). Brookfield Business Partners
LP, NAP's majority shareholder with 81.0%, was offered C$16.00 per share in cash, while the minority
shareholders will receive C$19.74 per share, in a deal worth C$1 008 million (US$758 million), resulting
in an average total offer price of C$16.77 per share. The deal enterprise value is estimated at
US$708 million (R10.4 billion at US$1:R14.66). The offer will be settled via a combination of existing
cash of US$288 million, cash raised through a metal prepayment of excess inventory of US$120 million
and a loan of US$350 million.

NAP is a Canadian-based primary PGM producer listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the US
OTC market and the Borse Frankfurt. NAP wholly owns and operates the Lac des Iles Mine northwest
of Thunder Bay, Ontario, and has a shareholding in two exploration properties, the Sunday Lake project
and the Shebandowan Joint Venture. In the 12 months to end June 2019, NAP produced 262 000 ounces
of 6E PGM at a cash cost of R8 550 per ounce and achieved a revenue basket of R18 272 per ounce.

CATEGORY 2 TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENT: ACQUISITION OF NORTH AMERICAN PALLADIUM LIMITED

1.   Introduction

     Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (""Implats"" or the ""Group"") is pleased to announce it has
     entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares in North
     American Palladium Limited (TSX: PDL, OTC: PALDF) (""NAP"") for cash consideration of
     C$1,008 million (US$758 million1 or R11,396 million1) (""Total Offer Consideration"") (the
     ""Transaction""). The Total Offer Consideration is comprised of:

       (i) an offer price of C$19.74 per share in cash consideration to shareholders other than
           Brookfield (defined below) (the ""Minority Consideration""); and

       (ii) an offer price of C$16.00 per share in cash consideration to the majority shareholder
            of NAP, an affiliate of Brookfield Business Partners LP (collectively with its institutional
            partners, ""Brookfield""), whose holding of 47,689,128 shares represents c. 81.0% of
            NAP's common shares outstanding (the ""Brookfield Consideration"").

       (iii) The Total Offer Consideration implies a blended offer price of C$16.77 per share.

     The Minority Consideration represents a premium of 15% to NAP's 30-day volume-weighted
     average price and 23% to NAP's 60-day volume-weighted average price as of
     4 October 2019. The Transaction represents an enterprise value of C$942 million
     (US$708 million1 or R10,647 million1)2.

     The Transaction will be implemented pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Canada
     Business Corporations Act (the ""Plan of Arrangement"") according to an Arrangement
     Agreement (the ""Arrangement Agreement"") entered into between NAP, Implats, and
     Implats' wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary 11638050 Canada Inc. (""BidCo"").
     The board of directors of NAP have unanimously approved the Transaction and will
     recommend to NAP shareholders that they vote in favour of the Transaction. In addition,
     Brookfield and all directors and officers of NAP which, in aggregate, beneficially own or
     control c. 81% of the outstanding common shares of NAP, have entered into voting
     agreements with Implats and BidCo to support and vote in favour of the Transaction.

     The board of directors of NAP has received a fairness opinion from BMO Capital Markets
     that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to the assumptions, limitations, and
     qualifications on which such opinion is based, the aggregate consideration to be received by
     shareholders as a whole pursuant to the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to
     the shareholders as a whole.

2.   Overview of North American Palladium

     NAP is a Canadian-based primary platinum group metals (""PGM"") producer listed on the
     TSX and the US OTC market. NAP wholly owns and operates the Lac des Iles Mine
     (""Lac des Iles"") northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada and also has an ownership in
     two Canadian exploration properties, the Sunday Lake Project and Shebandowan Joint
     Venture.

     Lac des Iles, in operation since 1993, is an established PGM producer located in a stable
     and attractive mining jurisdiction. In CY2018, it produced 237,461 ounces of palladium at an
     All-In Sustaining Cost (""AISC"") of US$690 per palladium ounce produced, generated
     c. C$147 million (c. US$111 million)1 in EBITDA and c. C$45 million (c. US$34 million)1 in
     free cash flow. The operation is on track to meet its CY2019 production guidance of 220,000
     to 235,000 ounces of palladium at an AISC of US$785 to US$815 per palladium ounce
     produced.

     The operation comprises an underground mine, surface mining activities, and a 13,500 tpd
     (c. 400,000 tpm) concentrator plant, and benefits from year-round road access and low-cost
     power from the provincial grid. As of 2 October 2018, Lac des Iles has measured and
     indicated mineral resources inclusive of mineral reserves of c. 5 million ounces of palladium
     at a grade of 2.14 g/t, and proven and probable reserves of c. 3 million ounces of palladium
     at a grade of 2.31 g/t3. Platinum and gold together with nickel and copper are the primary
     co-products at Lac des Iles.

     Implats and NAP have an existing relationship dating back to June 2017 through the
     prospective Sunday Lake Project, located 60 kilometers south of Lac des Iles. In 2019, NAP
     exercised its earn-in option to acquire a 51% interest in the project from Implats, reducing
     Implats' ownership to 24%.

3.   Rationale for the Transaction

     Implats' strategy prioritises value over volume and strongly articulates the Group's ambitions
     of reducing its exposure to high-cost, deep-level conventional mining. The Group is
     advancing its repositioning into a high-value, profitable and competitive PGM producer with
     a strong focus on low-risk, shallow, mechanised, palladium-rich assets. This strategy is
     expected to improve the Group's competitive industry position, result in sustained
     profitability, strengthen financial returns and rebalance its commodity mix.

     Implats has already made material strides in implementing the restructuring of its Impala
     Rustenburg operation to achieve a smaller and more productive mining footprint. In parallel,
     the Group has delivered enhanced efficiencies and sustained operational momentum across
     the remainder of its producing assets resulting in a strong performance during the 2019
     financial year. This, together with a significantly improved PGM price environment, resulted
     in strong free cash flow generation and a material strengthening of the Group's balance
     sheet, which has enabled Implats to assess opportunities which have the attributes to
     accelerate delivery on its strategic imperatives.

     It is Implats' view that medium-term palladium demand will be underpinned by a structural
     shift in automotive requirements. This is largely due to the expected and continued
     dominance of gasoline fueled vehicles in the global light duty fleet and tightening emissions
     legislation in China, India, Europe and North America.

     Medium-term supply is expected to remain constrained due to the depletion of reserves at
     producing assets and the rationalisation of both replacement and stay-in-business spend. In
     addition, the process of bringing potential new sources of palladium-rich supply to market
     faces substantial hurdles due to financing requirements and the lack of downstream
     processing capacity.

     Future secondary supply is set to expand on the back of growth in primary auto demand
     over the past decade. However, it is Implats' view that the palladium market will remain in a
     structural deficit in the medium-term, which supports the Group's expectations for stronger-
     for-longer palladium pricing.

     The Transaction will align Implats' production mix output to more closely match the expected
     composition of both current and forecast 3E (platinum, palladium and rhodium) demand and
     increase Implats' participation in global primary palladium supply, while not contributing to
     the further expansion of supply.

     Implats' believes the Transaction provides a compelling opportunity for the Group to:

     (i) Further reposition its portfolio and strengthen its competitive positioning in line with its
         stated strategy by acquiring a palladium-rich, operating asset in an established mining
         jurisdiction:

         -   Lac des Iles is a low-cost PGM producer and generated cash margins of 53%
             in the 12 months to June 2019;

         -   The mine is fully mechanised with a low labour complement and leading safety
             statistics, which further reduces the risk profile of asset;

         -   Total resource base which Implats believes has the potential to support a mine
             life well beyond the current c. 9 year LOM;

         -   The operation leverages modern infrastructure and advanced underground
             mining technologies to capitalise on its resource endowment; and

         -   The geological setting presents highly prospective future exploration
             opportunities.

    (ii) Acquire a strongly cash-generative asset at a competitive price:

         -   Accretive to Implats' net asset value and cash flows;

         -   Conservatively financed to optimise returns for shareholders and maintain
             comfortable levels of gearing; and

         -    Strengthens cash flow generation to advance the Group's journey towards
              delivering sustainable shareholder returns.

    (iii) Develop a competitive global portfolio of producing, processing and exploration assets:

         -    Diversifies Implats' production base geographically and operationally with
              assets on the Western and Eastern limbs of the Bushveld Complex, on the north
              and south of the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe and now North America;

         -    Enhances the mix of Implats' attributable mine production which is sourced from
              a diverse range of PGM-bearing reef types; and

         -    Reduces dependence on any single mining complex.

4.     Salient terms of the Transaction

       Implats, through BidCo, will acquire 100% of the outstanding common shares of NAP by
       way of the Plan of Arrangement for the Total Offer Consideration. Payment will be made to
       NAP shareholders on implementation of the Plan of Arrangement as described in paragraph
       5.2 below.

4.1.    Arrangement Agreement

        The Plan of Arrangement will be implemented by, and subject to, the Arrangement
        Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement contains terms and conditions which are
        customary for a transaction of this nature, including:

        (i) representations and warranties given by NAP, BidCo and Implats;

        (ii) an undertaking that NAP will conduct its business in the ordinary course until closing
             of the Transaction;

        (iii) non-solicitation provisions and a right to match any superior proposals; and

        (iv) a break fee that is payable by NAP if the Arrangement Agreement is terminated under
             specific circumstances.

4.2.    Financing

        Implats intends to finance the cash offer utilising a combination of existing cash of US$288
        million, proceeds raised from a metal prepayment of excess inventory of US$120 million
        and a loan of US$350 million advanced under a bridge facility agreement (the ""Bridge
        Facility"") to be entered into between BidCo as borrower and Morgan Stanley Senior
        Funding, Inc. (the ""Bridge Facility Lender"").

        The terms on which the Bridge Facility commitments will be provided to BidCo by the
        Bridge Facility Lender are set out in a commitment letter dated 7 October 2019 which
        encloses a term sheet under which the key commercial terms of the Bridge Facility have
        been agreed.

        There are various alternative re-financing mechanisms available to Implats, and it will
        ultimately replace the Bridge Facility with the most competitive and value enhancing source
        of financing. At this stage, Implats anticipates refinancing the Bridge Facility through a
        combination of internally generated cash from operations, term debt at BidCo level and a
        potential placement of its 16,233,994 Treasury shares by way of a vendor consideration
        placing in terms of paragraph 5.62 of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements
        (""JSE Listings Requirements"") as partial payment.

        The Transaction is conservative, representing c. 14% of Implats' market capitalisation. The
        increase in Rand PGM pricing, together with the step-change in operational momentum at
        Impala resulted in considerable free cash generation and substantial strengthening of the
        Group balance sheet in FY2019. This has allowed Implats' to pursue the Transaction through
        a prudent and efficient financing structure and in doing so, is expected to be strongly value
        accretive to shareholders on both spot and market consensus prices, generating returns
        above the Group's internal cost of capital with attractive payback periods.

5.     Transaction implementation

5.1.    Conditions precedent

        The Transaction is subject to standard conditions precedent as are customary in a
        transaction of this nature which are contained in the Arrangement Agreement, including:

        (i) regulatory conditions precedent which include merger notification and any subsequent
            approval by the Canadian and German competition authorities, to the extent required;

        (ii) exchange control approval from the South African Reserve Bank in terms of the
             Exchange Control Regulations of South Africa;

        (iii) adoption of the Plan of Arrangement resolution by two thirds of the shareholders of
              NAP present at a meeting of the shareholders;

        (iv) court approval of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice having been obtained in relation
             to the Plan of Arrangement;

        (v) all representations and warranties given by NAP, BidCo and Implats remaining true
            and correct; and

        (vi) no material adverse event having occurred.

5.2.    Plan of Arrangement process

        The acquisition will proceed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to
        the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Transaction remains subject to the approvals
        and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out above. Full details regarding the
        Transaction will be provided in NAP's management proxy circular for the special meeting
        of shareholders and in the Arrangement Agreement, both of which will be available on
        SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The NAP shareholder meeting to vote on the Plan of
        Arrangement is expected to be held on or before 13 December 2019. Following this, court
        approval from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice is expected to be granted in December
        2019.

        Once the Plan of Arrangement is complete, NAP will be delisted and become a wholly
        owned subsidiary of Implats through the amalgamation of NAP and BidCo.

 6.   Closing date

      If the aforementioned approvals are obtained and the conditions precedent are fulfilled, the
      Transaction is expected to be completed in late December 2019 or January 2020. Implats
      will issue a further announcement on the timing of the Transaction in due course.

 7.   Net value of assets and net profit after tax of NAP

      NAP's reported net value of assets and its net profit after tax, as disclosed in its reviewed
      interim results, prepared in accordance with IFRS, were C$609 million as at 30 June 2019
      and C$66.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019.

 8.   Categorisation of the Transaction

      The Transaction is classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of Section 9 of the JSE
      Listings Requirements and as such, will not require Implats' shareholder approval. As NAP
      will, through BidCo, become a wholly owned subsidiary of Implats, Implats will, in terms of
      paragraph 10.21 of Schedule 10 of the JSE Listings Requirements, ensure that (i) the
      provisions of NAP's memorandum of incorporation does not frustrate Implats in any way
      from compliance with its obligations in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, and (ii)
      nothing contained in NAP's memorandum of incorporation shall relieve Implats from
      compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements.

 9.   Additional information

      Implats will host a conference call for investors at 18:15 (CAT) / 12:15 (EST) on Monday,
      7 October 2019. For dial-in details please refer to the Implats website at www.implats.co.za.

NAP with various covenants contained in the Arrangement Agreement; statements with respect to
the effect of the Transaction on Implats and its strategy going forward; statements with respect to
the anticipated benefits associated with the acquisition of NAP; and NAP's financial outlook for
estimated net and gross revenues from the sale of palladium for fiscal 2020.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions regarding Implats and NAP,
including the completion of the Transaction, anticipated benefits from the Transaction, and
expected growth, results of operations, performance, industry trends and growth opportunities.
While Implats and NAP consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information
currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements.

The factors and assumptions contained in this news release, which may prove to be incorrect,
include, but are not limited to: the completion of the Transaction on the terms detailed above; NAP
will be able to continue normal business operations at Lac des Iles Mine; palladium prices and
exchange rates between the Canadian and United States dollar will be consistent with NAP's
expectations; there will be no significant disruptions affecting operations; and that prices for key
mining and construction supplies, including labour, will remain consistent with NAP's expectations.
The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

The assumptions of Implats and NAP, although considered reasonable by them at the time of
preparation, may prove to be incorrect. In addition, forward-looking statements necessarily involve
known and unknown risks, including, without limitation, risks associated with general economic
conditions; adverse industry events; future legislative, tax and regulatory developments; inability to
access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, and/or inability to access sufficient
capital on favourable terms; the ability of NAP to implement its business strategies; competition;
currency and interest rate fluctuations and other risks. Among other things, there can be no
assurance that the Transaction will be completed or that the anticipated benefits from the
Transaction will be achieved.

Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive. Readers are further cautioned not
to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as there can be no assurance that the plans,
intentions or expectations upon which they are placed will occur. Such information, although
considered reasonable by management at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect and
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated.

Forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this
cautionary statement and reflect our expectations as of the date hereof, and thus are subject to
change thereafter.

Notice to U.S. Holders. Both Implats and NAP have been formed outside of the United States. The
Transaction will be subject to disclosure requirements of Canada that are different from those of
the United States. Financial statements included in the documents, if any, will be prepared in
accordance with Canadian accounting standards and may not be comparable to the financial
statements of United States companies. It may be difficult for a securityholder in the United States
to enforce his/her/its rights and any claim a securityholder may have arising under U.S. federal
securities laws, since the companies are located in Canada, and some or all of their officers or
directors may be residents of Canada or another country outside of the United States. A
securityholder may not be able to sue a Canadian company or its officers or directors in a court in
Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States for violations of U.S. securities laws. It may be
difficult to compel a Canadian company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's
judgment.

Commentary
Implats achieved stellar results in FY2019.  A strong operational performance in key areas allowed the Group
to harness the benefit of improving market conditions and rising rand PGM pricing during the year and deliver
a substantially improved financial result with healthy free cash flow generation and a return to a closing
net cash position at year-end. 

Safety remains a key business imperative for the Group.  The 28% improvement in the achieved fatal injury
frequency rate and a 12% improvement in the lost time injury frequency rate are a testament to the step-change
in safety performance during the year.  Despite this, Implats mourns the loss of five employees at managed
operations.  The Board and management team extend their sincere condolences to the families and friends of our
late colleagues.  The loss of life is extremely disappointing, especially considering the noteworthy safety
improvements over the past two years.

The Group's strategic imperative to re-position the business as a high-value, profitable and competitive PGM
producer was meaningfully advanced through an operational and financial turnaround at Impala Rustenburg. 
Gains in productivity, safety and efficiency at the Impala Rustenburg complex significantly boosted Implats'
financial performance, clearly demonstrating the considerable value still to be derived from this operation.   

The Group delivered stable mine-to-market platinum concentrate volumes of 1.31 million ounces, despite a
challenging operating environment which included community disruptions at Marula, the impact of split-reef mining
at Two Rivers, intermittent load shedding by Eskom and continued political and economic uncertainty in
Zimbabwe.  Mined volumes were further bolstered by a partial processing pipeline reduction and Group refined PGM
production increased by 5% to 3.10 million ounces - refined platinum and palladium production increased by 4% and
7% to 1.53 million ounces and 0.91 million ounces respectively. 

Costs were well controlled with unit costs increasing by 4% on a stock-adjusted basis to R23 942 per
platinum ounce.  Volume gains helped offset persistent inflationary pressures from rising labour and utility 
costs and the translation impact of a weaker rand on costs from the Zimbabwean subsidiaries. 

Higher sales volumes were delivered into stronger rand PGM pricing and resulted in a significantly improved
Group financial performance.  Revenue improved by 36% to R48.6 billion, gross profit increased five-fold to
R6.8 billion and headline earnings of R3.0 billion or 423 cents per share compared to losses of R1.2 billion 
or 171 cents per share in the prior year.

Net cash generated from operating activities improved to R10.7 billion, yielding R7.7 billion in positive
free cash flow after capital investments of R3.9 billion.  Implats made debt repayments of R2.2 billion 
during the year and ended the reporting period with gross cash of R8.2 billion, a net cash position of some 
R1.1 billion and liquidity headroom of R12.2 billion. 

Strong cash generation during the year, together with the outperformance of Implats equity, allowed the
Group to successfully induce early conversion of its US$250 million convertible bonds in July 2019, further
strengthening the balance sheet in line with guided capital allocation priorities. 

Given an uncertain and volatile local and global economic outlook and the ongoing restructuring underway at
Impala Rustenburg, the board resolved not to declare a dividend for the full year ended 30 June 2019.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

Implats will release results for the year ended 30 June 2019 (""the period"") on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange News Service (""SENS"") on or about 5 September 2019.

Implats issued a trading statement on SENS on 8 July 2019 indicating that it was expecting to report both
positive basic and headline earnings per share for the period. At that time, there was insufficient certainty to
provide guidance ranges, as required by the JSE Listings Requirements. Implats now has reasonable certainty
on its earnings and therefore advises shareholders of the following:

Implats' headline earnings and headline earnings per share (""HEPS"") for the period are expected to be
between R2 915 million and R3 160 million and between 406 cents and 440 cents per share, respectively.
The headline loss and headline loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2018 (""comparative period"") were
R1 228 million and 171 cents per share, respectively.

Expected earnings increased due to:
   • a higher realised rand PGM basket price, due to a weaker rand and stronger dollar pricing for
     rhodium and palladium, partially offset by a weaker dollar platinum price;
   • improved operational performance, particularly at the Impala Rustenburg operations; and
   • higher sales volumes which have increased by 12% to 1 515koz platinum and by 21% to 929koz
     palladium compared to the comparative period.

As a result, gross profit for the period is expected to increase from R1.1 billion in the comparative period to
R6.8 billion in the current period. The gross profit for the comparative period was restated from R1.6 billion
to R1.1 billion, a reduction of R440 million, due to a reclassification of certain expenses to cost of sales.

The increase in earnings was partially offset by a non-cash expense of R1 560 million, or 217 cents per share
(no tax impact), relating to the mark to market of the conversion option on the US$ convertible bonds at year
end. The valuation of the conversion option was impacted by the significant increase in the Implats share
price, which exceeded the conversion price of the US$ convertible bonds. As announced on 24 July 2019,
99.9% of the US$ convertible bondholders elected to exercise their option to convert their bonds to Implats
ordinary shares following the payment of a cash consideration of $37.6 million (R524 million). As a result,
64.2 million Implats ordinary shares were issued on 1 August 2019.

Basic earnings and basic earnings per share (""EPS"") for the period are expected to be between R1 300 million
and R1 650 million and between 181 cents and 230 cents per share, respectively. This includes the adverse
impact of R1 656 million, or 230 cents per share (post-tax), relating to the impairment of the remaining
carrying value of the Group's investment in Afplats.

The basic loss and a basic loss per share for the comparative period were R10 679 million and 1 486 cents,
respectively. This loss was impacted by impairments of R9 699 million, or 1 350 cents per share (post-tax).
Impairments are non-cash and have been excluded from headline earnings.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

 On 24 July 2019, Implats announced that, in total, 64,204,365 ordinary shares in Implats
 (""Ordinary Shares"") were expected to be issued by Implats as a result of the conversion of 99.9
 per cent of its U.S.$250,000,000 3.25 per cent. convertible bonds due 2022 (the ""Bonds"").

 Implats hereby announces that the expected conversion of the Bonds has taken place and the
 new 64,204,365 Ordinary Shares have been issued and admitted to trading on the Main Board of
 the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's Equity Market with effect from 1 August 2019.

 The issued new Ordinary Shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares.
 Following the issue of the new Ordinary Shares, Implats' enlarged issued share capital comprises
 798,982,743 Ordinary Shares. As at the date hereof, Implats holds 16,233,994 Ordinary Shares
 in treasury.

 U.S.$200,000 (representing less than 0.1 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount) of the
 Bonds originally issued remains outstanding. As 15 per cent. or less of the aggregate principal
 amount of the Bonds remains outstanding, Implats intends to elect to exercise its option to redeem
 such Bonds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds. A separate announcement
 will be made regarding such redemption.

U.S.$250,000,000 3.25 PER CENT. CONVERTIBLE BONDS DUE 2022

On 23 July 2019, Implats announced the final results from its invitation (the ""Invitation"") to holders
(""Bondholders"") of its U.S.$250,000,000 3.25 per cent. convertible bonds due 2022 (the
""Bonds"") to offer to exercise their Conversion Rights as defined in, and in accordance with, the
terms and conditions of the Bonds (the ""Conditions"") in order to convert the Bonds into ordinary
shares in Implats (the ""Ordinary Shares"") and receive an Invitation Consideration.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Invitation Term Sheet dated 17 July 2019, as amended on 18 July 2019
and 22 July 2019 (the ""Invitation Term Sheet"").

Implats announced that, during the Invitation period, it had received indications of interest from
Bondholders representing a further U.S.$29,800,000 in principal amount of the Bonds
(""Indications of Interest""), who Implats understood were unable to submit Invitation Conversion
Notices prior to the Expiration Deadline for administrative reasons. Implats is pleased to
announce that such Bondholders have offered their Bonds for conversion and Implats has
accepted these Bonds for conversion in accordance with the Conditions and has agreed to pay
such Bondholders an amount equal to the Invitation Consideration in respect of such Bonds in
consideration of agreeing to convert their Bonds.

As U.S.$29,800,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in accordance with the
Indications of Interest have been accepted for conversion, U.S.$249,800,000 in aggregate
principal amount of the Bonds (or 99.9 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount originally
issued) will be converted.

Implats will make reasonable endeavors to accept for conversion the outstanding Bond on the
above terms if a Conversion Notice is received by the Agent in respect of such Bond prior to 5.00
p.m. (London time) on 31 July 2019 in accordance with the Conditions.

Immediately following conversion of the Bonds, as described above, U.S.$200,000 (representing
0.1 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds originally issued) is expected to
remain outstanding. As 15 per cent. or less of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
originally issued will remain outstanding, Implats may elect to exercise its option to redeem
any such Bonds in accordance with the Conditions. A separate announcement will be made
regarding any such redemption.

In total, 64,204,365 Ordinary Shares are expected to be issued by Implats as a result of the
conversion of the Bonds, as described above, resulting in the total number of Ordinary Shares in
issue increasing to 798,982,743. As at the date hereof, Implats holds 16,233,994 Ordinary Shares
in treasury.

RESULTS OF INVITATION TO HOLDERS TO OFFER TO CONVERT OUTSTANDING

Implats announces, further to its announcements on 17 July 2019, 18 July 2019 and 22 July 2019,
the final results from its invitation (the ""Invitation"") to holders (""Bondholders"") of its
U.S.$250,000,000 3.25 per cent. convertible bonds due 2022 (the ""Bonds"") to offer to exercise
their Conversion Rights as defined in, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the
Bonds (the ""Conditions"") in order to convert the Bonds into ordinary shares in Implats (the
""Ordinary Shares"") and receive an Invitation Consideration.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Invitation Term Sheet dated 17 July 2019, as amended on 18 July 2019
and 22 July 2019 (the ""Invitation Term Sheet"").

Results of the Invitation

Following expiration of the Invitation at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 22 July 2019, Implats had
received offers to convert in relation to U.S.$220,000,000 in principal amount of the Bonds.
Implats has decided to accept all such Bonds for conversion in accordance with the terms and
conditions set out in the Invitation Term Sheet.

During the Invitation period, Implats also received indications of interest from Bondholders
representing a further U.S.$29,800,000 in principal amount of the Bonds (""Indications of
Interest""), who Implats understands were unable to submit Invitation Conversion Notices prior to
the Expiration Deadline for administrative reasons. Implats intends to contact such Bondholders
or their representatives with the aim of accepting their Bonds for conversion in accordance with
the Conditions and paying such Bondholders an amount equal to the Invitation Consideration in
respect of such Bonds in consideration of agreeing to convert their Bonds.
If U.S.$249,800,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds subject to the Indications of
Interest is accepted for conversion as part of this process, U.S.$249,800,000 in aggregate
principal amount of the Bonds (or 99.9 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount originally
issued) will be converted (when taking into consideration the Bonds subject to the Indications of
Interest and those Bonds converted pursuant to the Invitation).

Implats will make reasonable endeavors to accept for conversion any other outstanding Bonds
on the above terms if Conversion Notices are received by the Agent in respect of those Bonds
prior to 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 31 July 2019 in accordance with the Conditions.

Invitation Consideration of U.S.$30,069.48 will be paid to Bondholders for each U.S.$200,000 in
principal amount of the Bonds accepted for conversion by Implats pursuant to the Invitation,
comprising of:

    -   an Invitation Premium of U.S.$29,220.87 in respect of each U.S.$200,000 in principal
        amount of the Bonds, calculated as described in the Invitation Term Sheet; and

    -   an Accrued Interest Amount of U.S.$848.61 in respect of each U.S.$200,000 in principal
        amount of the Bonds, being the accrued but unpaid interest on such principal amount of
        Bonds from and including 7 June 2019 to but excluding the expected Invitation
        Consideration Payment Date.

Immediately following the conversion of the Bonds accepted for conversion pursuant to the
Invitation, U.S.$30,000,000 in principal amount of the Bonds (representing 12 per cent. of the
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds originally issued) is expected to remain outstanding. If
all Bonds in respect of which Indications of Interest have been made are also converted,
U.S.$200,000 (representing 0.1 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
originally issued) is expected to remain outstanding. As, in either case, 15 per cent. or less of the
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds originally issued will remain outstanding, Implats may
elect to exercise its option to redeem any such Bonds in accordance with the Conditions. A
separate announcement will be made regarding any such redemption.

In total, 56,545,076 Ordinary Shares are expected to be issued by Implats as a result of the
conversion of the Bonds accepted for conversion pursuant to the Invitation, representing, on
issue, 7.15 per cent. of the issued ordinary shares of Implats post conversion of the Bonds and
resulting in the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue increasing to 791,323,454. In the event
that all Indications of Interest result in offers to convert the relevant Bonds, a further 7,659,289
Ordinary Shares are expected to be issued by Implats as a result of the conversion of these
Bonds accepted for conversion, resulting in the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue
increasing to 798,982,743. A further announcement will be made regarding the Indications of
Interest and resultant issue of ordinary shares. As at the date hereof, Implats holds 16,233,994
Ordinary Shares in treasury.

Settlement of the Invitation

Payment of the Invitation Consideration is expected to occur on 24 July 2019 and settlement of
the Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Invitation is expected to occur on 1 August
2019. Application will be made by Implats to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (""JSE"") for the
Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Invitation to be listed on the JSE and admitted to
trading on the main board of JSE's Equity Market with effect from the settlement date for the
Invitation. The new Ordinary Shares to be issued will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary
Shares.

The Invitation

Any Bondholder (i) who delivers a valid Invitation Conversion Notice prior to the Expiration

Implats hereby announces that the Invitation Premium will be increased from the amount stated
in its announcement dated 17 July 2019 relating to the Invitation. The amended Invitation
Premium will be as follows:

Invitation Premium:         For each U.S.$200,000 in principal amount of the Bonds accepted
                            for conversion by Implats pursuant to the Invitation an amount
                            calculated as follows (and rounded to the nearest U.S.$0.01, with
                            U.S.$0.005 being rounded upwards):
                            U.S.$27,485.08 + ((U.S.$5.35 – VWAP) x (51,404.6316 per
                            U.S.$200,000 in principal amount of the Bonds x (1 – Reference
                            Delta))
                            where:
                            VWAP = the arithmetic mean of the volume weighted average price
                            of an Ordinary Share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (the
                            ""JSE"") from 12.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the
                            prevailing ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as
                            observed on Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 17 July 2019,
                            from 8.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the prevailing
                            ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as observed on
                            Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 18 July 2019, and from 8.00
                            a.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the prevailing
                            ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as observed on
                            Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 19 July 2019 as further
                            described in the Invitation Term Sheet.

                            Reference Delta = 85 per cent

All Bondholders whose Bonds are converted pursuant to the Invitation, regardless of the date on
which their instructions to participate were received by a relevant intermediary or the Conversion
Agent, will receive the amended Invitation Premium. All other terms of the Invitation announced
on 17 July 2019 remain unchanged.

Bondholders are requested to read the Invitation Term Sheet in full before making any decision
with respect to the Invitation. Bondholders may wish to obtain independent professional advice
before making any such decision.

The Invitation is expected to expire at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 19 July 2019 (the ""Expiration

INVITATION TO HOLDERS TO OFFER TO CONVERT OUTSTANDING U.S.$250,000,000 3.25
PER CENT. CONVERTIBLE BONDS DUE 2022


Introduction

Implats announces that it invites the holders (""Bondholders"") of its U.S.$250,000,000 3.25 per
cent. convertible bonds due 2022 (ISIN: XS1623614572) (the ""Bonds"") to offer to exercise their
Conversion Rights as defined in, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Bonds
(the ""Conditions"") in respect of any or all of their Bonds (""Invitation""). Pursuant to the Invitation,
Bondholders who offer to convert their Bonds will, if such offer is accepted by Implats, receive by
way of consideration a cash incentive payment as described below.

The Invitation is made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the invitation term
sheet dated 17 July 2019 (the ""Invitation Term Sheet""). Capitalised terms used but not otherwise
defined in this announcement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Invitation Term Sheet.

Rationale

The optimisation of Implats' balance sheet through a reduction and restructuring of existing debt
is a key pillar of Implats' strategy to reposition Implats as a profitable, sustainable and competitive
business with clear capital allocation priorities and ultimately, a return to a dividend paying
position. To this end, the Bonds have been identified as a priority given the higher relative costs
associated with the Bonds when combined with Implats' USD 250 million Cross-Currency Interest
Rate Swap (the ""CCIRS"").

The increase in the rand platinum group metals basket price has been a welcome tailwind to
Implats' profitability and free cash flow generation. In the six months between 30 June 2018 and
31 December 2018, Implats achieved a reduction in net debt from R4.4 billion to R976 million.
During this period, gross cash balances increased by R2.7 billion to R6.4 billion, while total debt
(excluding finance leases) was reduced by R1.7 billion to R7.3 billion.
Improved operational and financial performance has resulted in substantial share price
appreciation, such that Implats' equity has traded above the prevailing Conversion Price for the
Bonds of USD3.8907.

The Invitation is expected to enable Implats to extinguish a material debt liability and issue
additional equity through the payment of the Invitation Consideration (as defined below) and the
issuance of up to 64,255,789 million Ordinary Shares. This is expected to improve the flexibility
of Implats' capital structure through reduced levels of gearing, improve free cash flow generation
through lower interest costs and provide Implats with additional headroom on certain of its existing
covenants in its revolving credit facility. The Invitation Consideration will be funded from existing
cash resources.

The future interest burden of Implats will be reduced by lower coupon payments, while the
average borrowing cost of Implats will also benefit from the unwind of the CCIRS. The CCIRS
hedges the foreign exchange risk on the Bonds and swaps the USD 3.25% coupon for a fixed
ZAR interest rate of 9.8%. The residual value in this instrument will be used to reduce the costs
associated with the Invitation.

A reduction in the quantum of the Bonds is expected to result in reduced market volatility through
a decrease in existing hedge fund involvement which may have resulted in implied future equity
holdings covered by proportionate short positioning.

The required accounting treatment of the Bonds has also increased the variability of reported
earnings at Implats due to the requirement to account for the impact of fair valuing both the CCIRS
and equity component of the Bonds, together with the translation impact of changes in the USD
foreign exchange rate on the face value of the Bonds. This variability will also be reduced going
forward.


Invitation

Any Bondholder (i) who delivers a valid Invitation Conversion Notice (as defined below) prior to
the Expiration Deadline (as defined below) and (ii) whose offer is accepted for conversion by
Implats, will be eligible to receive by way of consideration a cash sum (the ""Invitation
Consideration"") equal to the aggregate of:

   -   the Invitation Premium (as defined below); and
   -   the Accrued Interest Amount (as defined below).

Any Bondholder whose Bonds are accepted for conversion pursuant to the Invitation, shall in
addition receive, in accordance with the Conditions and subject to all applicable laws, the
Ordinary Shares comprising the relevant Bondholder's entitlement under the Conditions as a
result of the exercise of the Conversion Rights.

Each Bondholder who wishes to participate in the Invitation must validly offer to exercise
Conversion Rights in relation to at least U.S.$200,000 in principal amount of Bonds.


Invitation Premium:          For each U.S.$200,000 in principal amount of the Bonds accepted
                             for conversion by Implats pursuant to the Invitation an amount
                             calculated as follows (and rounded to the nearest U.S.$0.01, with
                             U.S.$0.005 being rounded upwards):
                             U.S.$25,485.08 + ((U.S.$5.35 – VWAP) x (51,404.6316 per
                             U.S.$200,000 in principal amount of the Bonds x (1 – Reference
                             Delta))
                              where:
                              VWAP = the arithmetic mean of the volume weighted average price
                              of an Ordinary Share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (the
                              ""JSE"") from 12.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the
                              prevailing ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as
                              observed on Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 17 July 2019,
                              from 8.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the prevailing
                              ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as observed on
                              Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 18 July 2019, and from 8.00
                              a.m. to 4.00 p.m. (London time) converted at the prevailing
                              ZAR:USD mid-spot rate at 4.00 p.m. (London time) (as observed on
                              Bloomberg page ZAR Curncy BFIX) on 19 July 2019 as further
                              described in the Invitation Term Sheet.

                              Reference Delta = 85 per cent

Accrued Interest Amount:      An amount equal to the accrued but unpaid interest on each
                              U.S.$200,000 in aggregate principal amount of Bonds accepted for
                              conversion pursuant to the Invitation from and including 7 June 2019,
                              being the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to
                              the Bonds, to but excluding the Invitation Conversion Payment Date
                              (as defined below). The Accrued Interest Amount, based on an
                              expected Invitation Consideration Payment Date of 24 July 2019 is
                              U.S.$848.61 per U.S.$200,000 in aggregate principal amount of
                              Bonds.

 The final acceptance amount will be the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds which Implats
 agrees, in its sole and absolute discretion, to accept for conversion pursuant to the Invitation
 (""Final Acceptance Amount""). If Implats accepts any valid offer for conversion received from
 Bondholders pursuant to the Invitation, then Implats currently intends to accept all valid offers for
 conversion received from Bondholders pursuant to the Invitation, subject to applicable law and
 the conditions of the Invitation set out in the Invitation Term Sheet.

 In the event that 15% or less of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds originally issued
 remain outstanding after the Invitation Conversion Date, Implats may elect to exercise its option
 to redeem any Bonds outstanding following settlement of the Invitation in accordance with the
 Conditions.

 The Invitation is expected to expire at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 19 July 2019 (the ""Expiration
 Deadline""). Holders of the Bonds must validly submit or instruct a relevant intermediary to submit
 on their behalf, the information required by the invitation conversion notice annexed to the
 Invitation Term Sheet (""Invitation Conversion Notice"") prior to the Expiration Deadline in order
 for such Bonds to be eligible for conversion. Invitation Conversion Notices may be submitted in
 relation to the Bonds, to the Conversion Agent via Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, S.A.
 Bondholders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through
 which they hold Bonds whether such intermediary would require receipt of instructions to
 participate in or revoke their instructions to participate in the Invitation before the Expiration
 Deadline.

 Announcement of the final Invitation Premium and Final Acceptance Amount will be made as
 soon as reasonably practicable after the Expiration Deadline (which is expected to be before
 7.00 a.m (London time) on 22 July 2019) by publication of such information by (i) delivery of a
 notice to the ICSDs for communication to direct participants; (ii) announcement on the Stock
 Exchange News Service of the JSE (""SENS""); and (iii) announcement on the Bloomberg

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2019

Implats will release its results for the year ended 30 June 2019 (""the period"") on or about 5 September 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading statement on
SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that the financial results for the period to be reported on
will differ by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Operational performance

The Group's refined platinum production for the period is expected to increase by 4% to 1 526 koz compared
to 1 468 koz for the year ended 30 June 2018 (""the comparative period""). The increase in refined platinum
production is primarily due to improved performance from Impala Rustenburg and a stock release of
platinum compared to a build-up in the comparative period.

Platinum sales volumes for the period are expected to increase by 12% to 1 515 koz from 1 355 koz in the
comparative period. Sales volumes for the period are higher due to the increase in refined production. Sales
volumes in the comparative period were lower than refined metal, primarily due to toll metal of 140 koz
returned to a third party customer.

Expected headline and basic earnings per share

Due to an improved Rand PGM basket price and improved operational performances, Implats is expecting to
report both positive basic and headline earnings per share for the period, compared to the comparative
period which reported a basic and headline loss per share of 1 486 cents and 171 cents, respectively. This
improved operational performance is consistent with positive earnings reported by the Group for the half-
year ended 31 December 2018. This represents a significant improvement in the Group performance for the
period. Basic earnings in the comparative period were impacted by impairments of R9.7 billion (or 1 350
cents per share) (after-tax).

Implats will publish a further trading statement closer to the release of its annual financial results on or about
5 September 2019, once it has a reasonable degree of certainty on the expected basic and headline earnings
per share ranges for the period.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

CHANGE IN EXTERNAL AUDITOR WITH EFFECT FROM 2020

The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (""IRBA"") published the rule on Mandatory Audit Firm Rotation
in 2017. Consequently, Public Interest Entities are now required to rotate their audit firms with effect from
financial years commencing after 1 April 2023.

The board of Implats wishes to inform shareholders that it has decided to early adopt IRBA's Mandatory Audit
Firm Rotation requirements. The Audit Committee, after following a comprehensive formal tender process, as
well as due process as set out in paragraph 3.84(g)(iii) of the JSE Listings Requirements (""LR""), has recommended
the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's external auditor with Mr Mandisi Mantyi as the designated lead
audit partner. The appointment of Deloitte as the new external auditor will take effect from the financial year
ending 30 June 2020. This appointment will be recommended to shareholders for approval at the Annual General
Meeting scheduled for 22 October 2019.

PwC, the Company's current external auditor, will continue in their role in respect of the current financial year
ending 30 June 2019 to complete the 2019 audit.

The board wishes to thank PwC for their services to the Implats group over the years.

Third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2019

Implats' Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: ""The Group achieved a record safety
result during the quarter, which underpinned sustained operational delivery, despite a traditionally
weak production quarter for Implats. Metal prices for our primary products remain buoyant,
allowing us to sustain profitability in FY2019, year to date. Along with the rest of South Africa we
were faced with interruptions to our operations caused by Eskom power disruptions: while we
could manage this at Impala Rustenburg due to the flexibility offered by our integrated mining and
processing operations, our other South African operations elsewhere fared less well. In Zimbabwe,
the operational excellence at both Zimplats and Mimosa has endured, despite continued in-
country economic and social pressures, and we are encouraged by the ongoing initiatives led by
the government of Zimbabwe to restore economic growth.""

SAFETY
The safety of our employees remains a priority at Implats. The Group's safety strategy remains
firmly centred on inculcating an inherently safe production culture. This has seen a step-change
in safety performance, resulting in the Group recording its lowest fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR)
of 0.013 per million man hours worked in the financial year to 31 March 2019. No fatal injuries
were recorded during the quarter under review. Zimplats achieved the milestone of 10-million
fatality free shifts worked during the third quarter, while Impala Rustenburg worked five-million
shifts without a fatality. These were new safety records for both operations.

Regrettably, both Zimplats and Impala Rustenburg recorded fatal incidents post the end of the
quarter. Mr Richard Mapuranga passed away at Zimplats' Mupfuti Mine on 5 April 2019 and
Mr Martin Ludick was fatally injured at the Impala Rustenburg UG2 Plant on 18 April 2019. The
Implats board and management team extend their sincere condolences to the families, friends and
colleagues of Mr Mapuranga and Mr Ludick.

PRODUCTION
Group tonnes milled (excluding associates) during the quarter were slightly lower at 4.53 million
tonnes, compared to 4.59 million tonnes in the prior comparable quarter. A stronger mining
performance at Impala Rustenburg was offset by lower tonnage at Marula and Zimplats. Overall,
mill grades were steady at 3.81g/t (6E) during the quarter and mine-to-market platinum in
concentrate production was maintained at 307 000 ounces, compared to 309 000 ounces in the
prior corresponding period.

In the nine-month period ended 31 March 2019, tonnes milled excluding production from
associates was marginally higher at 14.77 million tonnes. The average mill grade was 1.0% lower
at 3.84g/t (6E) and platinum in concentrate production was maintained at 985 000 ounces,
compared to 987 000 ounces produced in the prior corresponding nine months.

Platinum in concentrate received by IRS from third-party and toll customers during the third quarter
increased by 16.2% from the prior comparable period to 43 000 ounces due to higher contractual
deliveries. However, in the nine months ended 31 March 2019 platinum in concentrate production
from third-party and toll customers declined by 38.3% to 140 000 ounces due to elevated deliveries
from a large, once-off toll refining customer in the prior comparable nine months.

Total platinum in concentrate production during the quarter was slightly higher at 350 000 ounces,
however refined platinum production increased by 5.4% to 333 000 ounces, compared to 316 000
ounces in the prior corresponding period. The Number 3 furnace at Impala Rustenburg was taken
off-line in January 2019 for a full scheduled rebuild. As a result, available smelter capacity was
constrained during the quarter, resulting in no further reduction in excess accumulated pipeline
stocks during the period.

In the nine months ended 31 March 2019, refined platinum production benefitted from higher
available smelter capacity at the Group, which was impacted by extensive maintenance work
performed in the prior comparable period. This facilitated higher refined volumes at Impala in the
nine-month period (549 000 ounces versus 342 000 ounces). Conversely, refined volumes at IRS
were lower due to the once-off toll contract in the previous comparable period (584 000 ounces
versus 700 000 ounces). Gross refined platinum production increased by 8.7% to 1.13 million
ounces, compared to 1.04 million ounces during the prior corresponding period.

The Number 3 furnace is expected to be recommissioned in the coming weeks and return to full
production during May 2019, following which the Zimplats furnace will be taken down for scheduled
maintenance in June 2019. At 31 March 2019, 138 000 ounces excess platinum in concentrate
remained in stock, which together with associated PGMs, equates to approximately R4.75 billion
in revenue at prevailing rand PGM pricing. The majority of this inventory is expected to be
processed and sold in FY2020 once the Zimplats furnace maintenance work is completed.

Impala Rustenburg
Despite the challenges presented by a slow post-Christmas start-up, Eskom load shedding and
unscheduled shaft maintenance at 16 Shaft, Impala Rustenburg delivered an improved
operational performance.

Tonnes milled during the quarter increased by 3.5% to 2.58 million tonnes, compared to
2.49 million tonnes in the prior comparable period. Higher volumes were delivered across the
operation, with the exception of 1 Shaft, where production declined in line with guided closure
plans. Changes in the operational mix as the restructuring plan is effected impacted the mill grade,
which declined by 3.9% to 3.95g/t (6E) from 4.11g/t (6E) in the corresponding period.

The lower grade was more than offset by improved concentrator recoveries and the treatment of
additional surface sources. Consequently, platinum in concentrate production increased by 6.0%
to 160 000 ounces, compared to 151 000 ounces in the previous corresponding period.

In the nine months ended 31 March 2019, tonnes milled increased by 4.7% to 8.55 million tonnes.
The mill grade decreased by 2.2% to 3.97g/t (6E), but the higher tonnage throughput and improved
recoveries resulted in a 3.8% increase in platinum in concentrate production to 518 000 ounces,
compared to 499 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period, (which also benefitted from a
c.12 000 ounce contribution from the now-closed 4 Shaft).

Refined platinum production during the quarter increased significantly to 144 000 ounces from
71 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. This was due to the increased processing
capacity available to process Impala production, which was displaced by IRS ounces in the prior
comparable period as a result of IRS contractual delivery terms and constrained processing
capacity.

In the nine-months ended 31 March 2019, refined platinum production increased by 60.5% to
549 000 ounces from 342 000 ounces during the previous comparable period, benefitting from
higher available processing capacity. On a stock-adjusted basis, refined platinum production
increased by 4.8% to 520 000 ounces, compared to 496 000 ounces in the previous corresponding
reporting period.

The Group continues to make strides towards delivering a safer and more profitable Impala
Rustenburg operation, centred on assets accessing a higher-quality, long-life orebody with lower
operating costs and capital intensity. A multitude of stakeholder engagements were undertaken
during the reporting period principally focused on the planned closure/divestment from 1 Shaft,
which is nearing the end of available mine life. These are expected to be concluded over the next
four to six months.

Zimplats
Zimplats sustained its operational performance during the quarter under review. Tonnes milled
decreased by 3.3% to 1.60 million tonnes, compared to 1.66 million tonnes in the prior
corresponding period, largely due to a shortened operating period and the impact of contributions
from open-cast operations in the third quarter of FY2018. The mill grade was maintained at 3.48g/t
(6E). Consequently, platinum in concentrate production decreased by 4.4% to 66 000 ounces,
compared to 69 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period.

Mill throughput in the nine months ended 31 March 2019 decreased by 1.5% to 4.92 million tonnes,
compared to 4.99 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. Platinum in concentrate
produced similarly declined by 1.9% to 204 000 ounces from 208 000 ounces in the first nine
months of FY2018.

Marula
Operational continuity at Marula was hampered by community disruptions, which resulted in a
seven-day work stoppage at the mine. This, together with power interruptions caused by Eskom
load shedding, resulted in tonnes milled during the quarter decreasing by 20.8% to 349 000 tonnes
from 441 000 tonnes in the third quarter of FY2018. Notwithstanding a 4.1% improvement in mill
grade during the quarter to 4.29g/t (6E), platinum in concentrate production decreased by 25.0%
to 15 000 ounces, compared to 20 000 ounces in the prior comparable period.

Mill throughput over the nine months ended 31 March 2019 decreased by 5.7% to 1.30 million
tonnes, compared to 1.38 million tonnes in the previous corresponding period. Consequently,
platinum in concentrate production deteriorated by 4.8% to 60 000 ounces, compared to
63 000 ounces in the prior nine month period.

Mimosa
Mimosa delivered another good performance during the quarter under review. Tonnes milled
improved marginally to 678 000 tonnes, while the mill grade was sustained at 3.83g/t (6E).
Platinum in concentrate production was impacted by lower concentrator availability, which
impacted metal recoveries and decreased platinum production to 29 000 ounces from 30 000
ounces in the prior corresponding period.

Mill throughput over the nine months ended 31 March 2019 was maintained at 2.09 million tonnes,
compared to 2.08 million tonnes in the prior comparable period. Platinum in concentrate
production, however, declined to 91 000 ounces from 93 000 ounces in the prior corresponding
period on the back of lower metal recoveries.

Two Rivers
Operational performance at Two Rivers was impacted by continued lower-grade split-reef mining
during the period under review, which was further exacerbated by Eskom load shedding and an
overland belt failure. Tonnes milled during the quarter decreased by 5.0% to 834 000 tonnes,
compared to 878 000 tonnes in the prior comparable period. Despite a slight improvement in mill
grade to 3.59g/t (6E) from 3.56g/t (6E), platinum in concentrate production declined by 10.0% to
36 000 ounces, compared to 40 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period.

Mill throughput in the nine months ended 31 March 2019 decreased by 3.5% to 2.50 million tonnes,
while the mill grade decreased by 2.7% to 3.55g/t (6E). Consequently, platinum in concentrate
production during the period decreased by 8.9% to 112 000 ounces, from 123 000 ounces in the
prior comparable period.

IRS
Refined platinum production of 189 000 ounces from both mine-to-market operations (Zimplats,
Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa) and IRS third-party and toll customers was 22.8% lower than
the previous period (245 000 ounces) when constrained processing capacity and IRS contractual
delivery terms boosted IRS refined production at the expense of Impala metal.

Over the nine months ended 31 March 2019, refined platinum production decreased by 16.6% to
584 000 ounces, compared to 700 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. This was largely
as a result of once-off toll treatment of third-party material in the previous period, with mine-to-
market refined volumes also reflecting lower receipts from Two Rivers and Marula.

Outlook and guidance
The third quarter historically remains a challenging period for Implats, largely as a result of the
Christmas holiday break. This situation was further aggravated this year by the unexpected Eskom
power supply issues, which impacted the South African operations, and the community disruptions
experienced at Marula. During the final quarter of the financial year, against the backdrop of South
African National Elections, the business will focus on concluding extensive maintenance on Impala
Rustenburg's Number 3 furnace, progressing the closure/divestment from Impala 1 Shaft, initiating
wage negotiations with AMCU and endeavouring to secure operations from further Eskom power
disruptions.

Notwithstanding all these challenges, market guidance for the 2019 financial year is maintained
as per the guidance provided in the FY2019 half-year results. However, both Marula mined
volumes and gross Group refined volumes are likely to be towards the lower end of the guided
range.

Commentary
Introduction 
The Implats Group has delivered a strong safety and operational performance for the half-year ended 31 December 2018.
Good progress was made on implementing key outcomes of the Impala Rustenburg strategic review. The performance,
together with a higher PGM rand basket price, which was boosted by significant increases in palladium, rhodium and
nickel, and further aided by a weaker US$ exchange rate, resulted in a significantly improved Group financial
performance. 

This was characterised by positive cash flow contributions from all Group operations, yielding a headline profit of
R2.23 billion compared to losses of some R150 million in the previous comparable period. Consequently, Group cash 
balances increased significantly to R6.36 billion, reducing net debt (before leases) from R5.33 billion at the start 
of the reporting period to R976 million by financial half-year-end.

Regrettably, Implats mourns the loss of an employee through a work-related incident during the period under review.
The board and management are encouraged, however, by the significant improvement in safety performance achieved in the
reporting period, with improvements in lost time injuries and a record low fatal injury frequency rate (FIFR) for the
Group.

Tonnes milled from managed operations (Impala Rustenburg, Zimplats and Marula) increased 2.9% to 10.24 million tonnes.
Together with contributions from our joint ventures (JVs) at Mimosa and Two Rivers, this sustained mine-to-market
platinum production in concentrate at 678 000 ounces (H1 FY2018: 678 000 ounces). Gross platinum in concentrate reduced 
by 10.7% to 775 000 ounces, largely due to a large once-off toll-refining contract concluded in the prior comparable period. 
Gross refined platinum production for the six months improved by 10.1% to 799 800 ounces (H1 FY2018: 726 700 ounces) as
processing availability increased following scheduled maintenance, which resulted in the build in inventory in the previous 
comparable period. 

Sales volumes for platinum and palladium increased by 19.2% and 31.3% respectively, as sales in the comparable period
were impacted by both scheduled furnace maintenance and the required return of metal to the tolling customer. Improved
sales volumes, together with higher received rand basket pricing saw revenue improve by R6.24 billion to R23.52 billion
(H1 FY2018: R17.28 billion). Despite a 21% increase in cost of sales to R20.29 billion for the period (H1 FY2018: 
R16.72 billion), this was in line with increased production and sales volumes and the impact of stronger pricing on the 
cost of metals purchased in concentrate at IRS. As a result, gross profit improved by R2.68 billion to R3.23 billion and 
headline earnings per share rose to 310 cents versus the 21 cent loss in the comparable six months.

Group safety review 
The safety and health of our employees remains our most critical priority. 

Regrettably, one employee at Impala Rustenburg 16 Shaft suffered fatal injuries in September 2018. The Implats board
and management team express their sincere condolences to Mr Semoko Mokhethi's families and friends, and will continue 
to provide support to the Mokhethi family.

Notwithstanding this tragic incident, the Group has effected a step change in safety performance, which was maintained
during the reporting period. Fatal injuries reduced from six in the prior comparable six-month period, to one in the
period under review. The recent incident followed a seven-month continuous fatality-free work period, which was an
all-time record for the Group. The improvement also resulted in the organisation recording the lowest fatal injury 
frequency rate (FIFR) of our peer group for the 2018 calendar year. 

Many individual business units across the Group continue to deliver exceptional safety performances, setting a number
of new records. Currently, 11 of 15 Group operations have achieved 'millionaire' or 'multi-millionaire' status in terms
of fatality-free shifts (units which have operated more than a million shifts without a fatality). The FIFR of 0.019
per million man hours worked is an all-time low for the Group, and the lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) has also
improved 14.8% over the six months to 5.12 per million man hours worked.

We believe collaboration with our key stakeholders will continue to drive further improvements in safety through
awareness, education, and by implementing appropriate systems and best practice.

Group operational review 
The Group achieved encouraging period-on-period operational improvements in key areas over the past six months.

Tonnes milled from managed operations (Impala Rustenburg, Zimplats and Marula) increased 2.9% to 10.24 million tonnes
(H1 FY2018: 9.94 million tonnes), which together with contributions from our JVs at Mimosa and Two Rivers sustained
mine-to-market platinum production in concentrate at 678 000 ounces. Notwithstanding, gross platinum in concentrate
production reduced by 10.7% to 775 000 ounces, principally as a result of a 49.1% reduction in third-party receipts,
in line with market guidance, and as a result of a large once-off toll-refining contract concluded in the prior
comparable period. 

Gross refined platinum production for the six months improved by 10.1% to 799 800 ounces, compared to 726 700 last
year assisted by the drawdown of some processing inventory during the period, compared to a build-up following scheduled
furnace maintenance in the comparable period a year ago. Group operating costs were well controlled during the reporting
period with unit costs per tonne milled to concentrate flat at R1 049 per tonne, and unit costs per platinum ounce refined,
on a stock-adjusted basis, reducing by 0.7% to R22 715 per ounce. Unit cost per platinum ounce refined, discounting the
change in processing inventories, benefited from the increased refined metal production, and retraced by 23.4% to 
R21 298 per ounce (H1 FY2018: R27 818 per ounce), as the previous comparable period was impacted by a pipeline 
stock build-up.

Capital expenditure at our managed operations reduced from R1.90 billion in the previous comparable period to 
R1.71 billion, in line with market guidance.

Managed operations 
Impala
A vastly improved safety performance at the Impala Rustenburg operations facilitated a stable and productive operating
period. Tonnes milled increased by 5.3% to 5.97 million tonnes (H1 FY2018: 5.67 million tonnes), with higher production
from eight of the shafts, including the development shafts. These improvements more than offset the loss of production
from 4 Shaft, which closed in January 2018, lower volumes from 1 Shaft (where a planned ramp-down in production is
underway) and 11 Shaft (where poor geology impacted volumes in the period). 

The PGE mill head grade deteriorated by 1.5% to 3.98g/t (6E) (H1 FY2018: 4.05g/t), and was impacted by lower grade in
the areas mined, but platinum production in concentrate increased by 2.9% to 358 000 ounces (H1 FY2018: 348 000 ounces)
as a result of the higher milled throughput. Refined platinum production increased by a significant 49.0% to 405 000
ounces (H1 FY2018: 272 000 ounces), bolstered by a release of pipeline stock during the reporting period, and as a
result of a stock build-up, which impacted refined metal volumes in the prior period.

The improved production, coupled with strict cost containment, resulted in the stock-adjusted cost per ounce remaining
flat at R23 519 per platinum ounce refined (H1 FY2018: R23 354). Capital expenditure decreased by 29.5% to R1.02 billion
(H1 FY2018: R1.44 billion), of which R207 million was spent on the two major replacement shafts, 16 and 20 Shafts.
An improved rand basket price further boosted financial performance, leading to a significant improvement in profitability
compared to the previous period, with free cash flow further augmented by a R1.06 billion forward sale of excess inventory.

Execution of the Impala Rustenburg strategic review
The Group continued to make strides towards eliminating loss-making production, which culminated in the decision to
restructure Impala Rustenburg.

The implementation of the Impala Rustenburg plan is being phased in over two years to ensure the transition occurs in
a socially responsible way. The key outcomes of the restructuring, which is expected to be concluded by the end of the
2021 financial year, include: a reduced mining 'footprint' from 11 to six operating shafts as operations cease at
end-of-life and uneconomical shafts; production reducing from 750 000 platinum ounces to 520 000 platinum ounces a
year; and a total labour complement (employees and contractors) of 27 000 from 2021. 

This plan is expected to deliver a safer and more profitable Impala Rustenburg centred on assets accessing a higher
quality, long-life orebody with lower operating costs and capital intensity.

The implementation of the restructuring is governed by the overriding imperative to ensure forced job losses are
minimised through various avoidance measures. These include the transfer of employees to vacant positions at the 
16 and 20 growth Shafts, natural attrition, reskilling, voluntary separation, business improvement initiatives 
and exploring commercial options to exit shafts that do not fit the long-term portfolio.

By the end of January 2019, the own employee headcount at Impala Rustenburg decreased by approximately 1 500 people -
with forced retrenchments affecting only 110 employees. A disposal and outsourcing process has been initiated on 1 Shaft
through solicitation of expressions of interest and is expected to conclude in June 2019.

A multitude of stakeholder engagements were undertaken during the reporting period, all of which were constructive. 
We continue to engage with the union, government and community leadership to safeguard employment opportunities as far 
as possible through the restructuring process.

Impala Refining Services (irs)
IRS once again contributed significantly to the Group's bottom line, despite higher concentrate receipts in the
previous comparable period. Platinum receipts from mine-to-market operations (Zimplats, Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa)
remained essentially flat at 313 900 ounces (H1 FY2018: 318 300 ounces), while third-party receipts decreased 49.1% to
96 800 ounces, due to the once-off toll treatment of third-party material in the previous interim period.

Refined platinum production was 13.2% lower at 395 000 ounces (H1 FY2018: 455 000 ounces).

Zimplats 
Zimplats sustained its operational performance for the period under review and achieved a safety milestone of 
9.75 million fatality-free shifts, working for over five and a half years without a fatal incident.

Tonnes milled of 3.31 million tonnes was consistent with the prior period, (H1 FY2018: 3.33 million tonnes), with all
mining units delivering to plan. Notwithstanding a marginally lower PGE head grade of 3.48g/t (H1 FY2018: 3.49g/t),
platinum in matte production was sustained at 135 400 ounces (H1 FY2018: 136 200 ounces).

Unit costs decreased by 3.2% in dollar terms to US$1 293 per platinum ounce in matte (H1 FY2018: US$1 336 per platinum
ounce in matte), on strong cost controls and sustained volumes.

Capital expenditure increased 43.8% to US$46 million, mainly to fund the redevelopment of the Bimha Mine, which has
returned to full production, and additional spend on the development of Mupani Mine (the replacement for Ngwarati 
and Rukodzi mines), which remains ahead of schedule.

The current political and economic challenges in the country are being monitored closely with the intention of
minimising any impact on the operations, employees, and their ability to operate at a sustained profit margin.

Implats supports and shares Zimbabwe's aspirations to grow and diversify its PGM industry and continues to actively
engage with the government of Zimbabwe regarding its plans.

Marula 
Marula continues to deliver an improved operational performance after business restructuring and ongoing efforts to
sustain operational continuity.

Tonnes milled increased by 1.5% to 955 000 tonnes (H1 FY2018: 941 000 tonnes), while the PGE head grade improved
marginally to 4.37g/t (H1 FY2018: 4.36 g/t). Consequently, platinum in concentrate production improved to 44 900 
ounces (H1 FY2018: 43 200 ounces).

Unit costs increased below inflation to R25 657 per platinum ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2018: R24 954 per platinum
ounce), while capital expenditure was well below budget at some R33 million (H1 FY2018: R29 million) with spend 
expected to accelerate in the second half of FY2019 on the planned tailings storage expansion. 

The benefit of a stable and improved operational performance, good cost controls and an improved basket price 
allowed Marula to deliver a strong cash contribution to the Group during the reporting period.

Non-managed operations
Mimosa 
Mimosa sustained a strong production performance in line with its design capacity.

Tonnes milled were maintained at 1.41 million tonnes. The PGE head grade declined marginally to 3.83g/t 
(H1 FY2018: 3.85 g/t) due to planned mining in lower-grade areas, which resulted in platinum in concentrate 
dipping slightly to 61 700 ounces (H1 FY2018: 63 000 ounces). 

Inflationary pressures and slightly lower production volumes saw unit costs rise 7.0% to US$ 1 582 per platinum
ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2018: US$ 1 479). Capital expenditure increased 25.0% to US$25 million to fund 
scheduled fleet replacement and development into the Mtshingwe block to sustain mining flexibility.

Mimosa continues to consult with the government of Zimbabwe on a range of important investment and regulatory
considerations and remains confident that mutually beneficial outcomes can be secured. 

Two Rivers 
Two Rivers' mill grade continued to be impacted by mining low-grade split-reef areas. However, production and 
mill grade was also impacted during the review period by community disruptions. This necessitated a draw-down 
of ore stockpiles to ensure continued plant operations and resulted in slower milling rates and lower-grade feed.

Tonnes milled during the first half decreased 2.7% to 1.67 million tonnes (H1 FY2018: 1.71 million tonnes).
The treatment of lower-grade stockpiled material as a result of community disruptions and mining in split-reef
areas resulted in a 4.6% drop in the PGE head grade to 3.53g/t (H1 FY2018: 3.70 g/t). Consequently, platinum in
concentrate production declined 9.4% to 75 600 ounces (H1 FY2018: 83 400 ounces).

Lower volumes impacted unit costs, which increased 12.0% to R16 455 per platinum ounce in concentrate 
(H1 FY2018: R14 688).

Due to limited flexibility, lower-grade mining is expected to persist for the next two to three years, with an
alternative mining cut being trialled in the worst affected area to maintain platinum production, while development
into higher grade future mining areas continues.

Key projects 
Due to their important future contribution to sustain profitability at Impala Rustenburg, progress on the 16 and 20
Shaft replacement projects remains critical. During the strategic review, the capital programmes for these shafts 
were revised and optimised. This has resulted in the earlier forecast completion dates and a reduction in estimated 
cost to complete 20 Shaft.

16 Shaft
During the period under review, the impact of a fatality in August 2018 saw the 16 Shaft project fall marginally
behind the revised capital plan due to slower than planned progress on the C ore pass rehabilitation programme, 
which remains critically important to reach full production. Notwithstanding, mining flexibility has improved, 
production levels have been restored and raise lines were holed on target. This provides reasonable assurance 
that enough panels will be established to accommodate the planned increase in production crews scheduled over 
the rest of the financial year. 

20 Shaft
The 20 Shaft ramp-up is still being hampered by geological complexities. No further teams will be mobilised 
to 20 Shaft during the remainder of the year, while recently improved development is converted into mineable
face length. Additional technical and management resources have been mobilised to the shaft to oversee the 
planned ore ramp up programme.

Progress on the capital build programme is better than planned as the completion of the monorail, electrical/
instrumentation installation and settler are well ahead of schedule. The full capital infrastructure installation
is expected to be completed during the second half of the financial year. Rehabilitation of some of the level
ore passes require imminent attention, but are not included in the current capital plan.

Mupani Mine
The development of Mupani Mine (the replacement for Ngwarati and Rukodzi mines) is running well, targeting ore contact
three months ahead of schedule by August 2019, and full production in August 2025. A total of US$51 million had been
spent as at 31 December 2018 against planned expenditure of US$53 million and a total project budget of US$264 million.
The project was 22% complete at the end of the reporting period. 

Waterberg project 
As reported previously, Implats purchased a 15% participation in the Waterberg project for US$30 million and is now
actively participating with the other JV partners in a definitive feasibility study (DFS). All geological information 
from the exploration phase is now available in a resource model and the team is completing the mine design and 
scheduling.

The JV has applied for a mining right while power and water resources are being secured. All the work done on the study
to date has confirmed our confidence in the project and supported the rationale for the investment. The DFS study will
be SAMREC and NI43-101 compliant and is expected to be complete before calendar year-end, after which Implats has the
option to increase the 15% stake to 50.01%, alternatively maintain or sell the current 15% interest, or enter into a
concentrate offtake agreement only. 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
There has been no material change to the technical assumptions, assessment criteria, and information relating to the
Group's Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, as disclosed in the integrated report for the financial year
ended 30 June 2018. The revised Implats Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve statement, as at 30 June 2019, will 
provide the detailed updated estimates. 

Financial review 
Revenue at R23.52 billion was R6.24 billion or 36.1% higher than the comparative six months as a result of:
- Sales volumes resulted in an increase of 17.5% or R3.02 billion as a result of the release of material locked-up
  during the comparable period due to the scheduled No 5 furnace rebuild
- Overall, the improvement in dollar metal prices increased revenue by 11.5% or R2.00 billion. The increase in 
  dollar metal prices was due to higher rhodium, palladium, ruthenium, nickel and iridium prices, partially offset 
  by a lower platinum price. Dollar revenue per platinum ounce sold was 9.8% higher at US$2 124 (H1 FY2018: US$1 935)
- The average exchange rate achieved of R14.18 was 5.7% weaker than the R13.42 achieved for the comparable period
  increasing revenue by R1.23 billion  

The resultant rand revenue per platinum ounce increased by 16.0% to R30 118 from R25 968.

Cost of sales at R20.29 billion increased by R3.57 billion from the comparable six months. The main contributors to
this increase were:
- A R2.70 billion lower credit to cost of sales arising from the movement in inventory in the comparative period,
  costs of R2.90 billion were deferred into inventory on the balance sheet as a result of the significant stock 
  build-up following the scheduled rebuild of the No 5 furnace at Impala Rustenburg. In the current period, the 
  increase in inventory only resulted in a R202 million credit to cost of sales
- An increase of R503 million in the cost of IRS metal purchases due primarily to higher rand metal prices

As a result of the above, the Group generated gross profit for the period of R3.23 billion compared to R556 million
gross profit in the previous period. The gross profit for the comparable period was restated and reduced by 
R177 million following the change in classification of certain items to cost of sales. This change in classification 
has been discussed in note 16 in the interim financial statements. 

The R3.35 billion profit before tax was an improvement from the comparable period's pre-tax profit of R193 million,
due primarily to the increase in gross profit of R2.70 billion, an increase in other income of R519 million, a 
decrease in other expenses of R417 million, all of which were partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange 
losses of R414 million.

Other income increased due to the refund of customs' duties penalties to Zimplats of R136 million, receipt of export
incentives by Zimplats which were R342 million higher in the current period, and proceeds of R150 million in respect 
of the interim payments on the insurance claim on the No 5 furnace in Rustenburg. Other expenses decreased mainly due 
to a reallocation of fair-value adjustments on purchased metal which had been hedged and included in cost of sales in 
the current period, and which were reflected as a loss of R296 million in other expenses in the comparable period.

The R414 million increase in foreign exchange losses, was due mainly to the impact of the weaker rand on the
conversion of the US$ bond and the revaluation of certain foreign currency balances.

The increased tax charge of R895 million (H1 FY2018: R357 million) was largely due to the improved profitability of
the operations, partially offset by lower tax charges from Zimplats following the conversion from a Special Mining 
Lease (SML) to two Mining Leases (ML). Despite the higher statutory tax rate, the additional profits tax associated 
with the SML is no longer payable under the ML.

Basic earnings were up to R2.31 billion from a loss of R163 million in the comparable period. The major adjustments 
in headline earnings for the year compared to the previous six months was an after-tax profit on the sale of property
plant and equipment of R35 million and the after-tax impact of R43 million relating to the asset damage portion of 
the insurance claim on No 5 furnace.

Net cash from operating activities increased by R7.16 billion, from a cash outflow of R1.14 billion during the
comparable period to a cash inflow of R6.02 billion. The improved cash flow was due to improved earnings for the 
current period, and the R1.12 billion impact of positive working capital movements which comprised a decrease in 
inventories of R264 million (H1 FY2018: outflow of R2.96 billion) and an increase in net movement of payables and 
receivables to R1.38 billion, which included the receipt of R1.06 billion from a forward sale of excess metal 
inventory in the current period.

During the past six months, metal inventories increased by R151 million from June 2018 and by R628 million since
December 2017.

The R151 million increase in inventory since June 2018 is due to the following movements:
- Increase in inventory of R1.31 billion largely due to the higher rand cost of metals purchased, particularly
  palladium and rhodium, by Impala's IRS business 
- Increase of R389 million (H1 FY2018: R431 million) due to changes in engineering estimates 
- A R272 million increase in metal inventories arising from a change in estimate following the reclassification of
  nickel from a by-product to a main product and consequently, adopting a different cost allocation method among 
  the main products, as discussed in note 7 of the interim financial results 
- All of which were largely offset by lower stock quantities in the pipeline, which resulted in a reduction in the
  value of inventory by R1.47 billion

Capital expenditure, amounted to R1.71 billion (H1 FY2018: R1.90 billion), of which R207 million (H1 FY2018: 
R345 million) was spent on 16 and 20 Shafts and R151 million and R183 million spent on Bimha and Mupani 
respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents the end of the period under review amounted to R6.36 billion after repayment of 
R1.86 billion (H1 FY2018: R341 million) of borrowings. Net debt excluding finance leases of R1.19 billion, 
after taking into consideration the Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap asset of R213 million, amounted to 
R976 million at 31 December 2018 (June 2018: R5.33 billion).

The balance sheet remains strong with unutilised revolving credit facilities of R4.00 billion, available until 
7 June 2021. Therefore, at 31 December 2018, the group had liquidity headroom of R10.36 billion, comprising cash 
of R6.36 billion (30 June 2018: R3.71 billion) and undrawn banking facilities of R4.00 billion (30 June 2018: 
R2.49 billion), compared to the R6.20 billion available at the end of June 2018.

In addition, at 31 December 2018, R941 million was available on the metal prepayment facility. Therefore, the 
Group has access to sufficient liquidity and flexibility to address upcoming debt maturities, as well as to fund 
the ongoing needs of the business.

Given the volatility in the local and global economy, as well as the continued implementation of the Rustenburg
review, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the six months to 31 December 2018.

Market review (calendar years unless otherwise stated) 
The platinum market recorded a surplus of 580 000 ounces during 2018, with the palladium market experiencing a
fundamental deficit of 270 000 ounces. Expectations for palladium demand continue to be revised upwards as 
tightening emission standards result in increasing and sustained fundamental deficits. 

While the near term for platinum remains uncertain, strong industrial demand, coupled with the introduction of
heavy-duty legislation in both India and China and growth from the nascent fuel cell sector, indicate a tightening 
market in the medium term. 

Platinum ended 2018 at US$788 per ounce, 15% weaker than the opening LBMA trade price, and on average traded at 
US$880 per ounce over the year, 7% lower than the previous year (2017: US$948 per ounce). Investor sentiment was 
weak, with rising short speculative positioning and ETF outflows. The rand softened, as did the gold price, adding 
further negative price pressure. Western European diesel market share continued to fall and Chinese jewellery 
demand was also lower. Industrial demand was robust, however, and debate on the likely reintroduction of platinum 
into gasoline autocatalysts gained momentum.

In contrast, palladium ended the year at US$1 270 per ounce, 19% higher than the opening LBMA trade price, and on
average traded at US$1 031 per ounce over the year, 19% higher than the previous year (2017: US$870 per ounce). 
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) continued to release metal to the market as the implications of tighter Chinese 
legislation increased demand from a rising European gasoline market share and the advent of 'real driving' testing 
regimes all combined to support demand, sentiment and pricing for palladium. 

The rhodium price increased by US$745 per ounce in 2018 closing the year at US$2 460 per ounce and registering a 
gain of 43% over the year. The metal traded at US$2 219 per ounce, double the average price of the year before 
(2017: US$1 109 per ounce). Tightening nitrogen oxide (NOx) standards have driven a step-change in anticipated 
rhodium requirements in China, while palladium's price strengthened and relative 'value in use' was also supportive 
of steady, but persistent rhodium price gains. 

Automotive 
2018 was a mixed year for the automotive industry. Geopolitical uncertainties, including the potential impact of
Brexit and US-China trade tensions, have led to a cautious view on prospects for volume growth in 2019. Global 
light-duty vehicle sales are estimated to have reached 94.8 million units in 2018, down 0.5% from 2017, with the 
Chinese market contracting by 3.1% and Western European sales slipping 0.7%. Modest growth was recorded in both 
the US and Japanese markets with sales volumes increasing by 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.

Western European light-duty vehicle sales of 14.2 million units were marginally lower in 2018, with a particularly
weak fourth quarter (8% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017) weighing on annual metrics. Sales in the United 
Kingdom fell 6.8% during 2018 and offset the impact of growth in France and Spain and reasonably stable volumes in 
Germany. The introduction of the new emissions-testing regime disrupted the availability of new vehicles and the 
outlook for diesel continued to weigh on consumer sentiment and fleet sales. Gasoline market share of 57% (2017: 50%) 
increased at the expense of diesel, which experienced a further decline in market share to 36% in 2018 (2017: 44%). 
While headline battery electric vehicle growth figures were impressive, rising 48% from 2017, at c. 201 000 units, 
these 'catalyst free' vehicles comprised 1.3% of the sales mix and we expect the carbon dioxide (CO2) average of the 
Western European fleet to have increased for the second consecutive year as a result.

Chinese light-duty vehicle sales fell 3.1% year-on-year in 2018 to 27.7 million units. However, the impact on PGM
demand was more than offset by the impact of higher loadings to meet tightening emissions standards with the 
nationwide implementation of 'China 5' for both gasoline and diesel vehicles. Japanese sales grew for a second 
consecutive year, rising 0.8% to 5.2 million units. 

As fabricators and OEMs finalise catalyst formulations to meet upcoming legislation changes in China, Europe and
India, expectations for loadings have increased resulting in tighter forecast markets for both palladium and rhodium.
Availability of supply and price differentials between the three major PGMs has highlighted the need to reconsider 
the mix of metals used to meet expected gasoline derived demand. 

We expect research and development efforts to increase in pace and assume switching of platinum for palladium in both
diesel and gasoline catalysts to become an imperative in the medium term. 

Jewellery
Demand for platinum from the jewellery sector was mixed, with continued, albeit slowing weakness in the key Chinese
market, where changing consumer tastes and the resultant shrinking in sales of generic products have yet to be 
compensated by growth in sales of higher-margin branded collections. In India, a recovery in demand following the 
impact of demonetisation and the jewellers strike is likely to have led to growth in the mid-teens, while the US 
market has also enjoyed strong growth due to opportunities created by healthy consumer confidence, competitive 
metal prices and several initiatives spearheaded by the Platinum Guild International (PGI).

In Japan, platinum remains the 'white metal of choice', however, total sales have been impacted by the current fashion
dominance of yellow gold and a modest retreat in sales is expected. Overall, both platinum jewellery retail sales and
net metal demanded by manufacturers is expected to have recorded modest declines in 2018.

Industrial, physical, ETF and paper 
Industrial demand for PGMs continues to be robust, with platinum benefiting from growth in estimates for non-road
mobile machinery, the nascent fuel cell industry and continued demand from the chemical and electrical sectors. 
Platinum is also likely to benefit at the margin from changes in alloys used in the glass industry, where rhodium 
is being thrifted as the price is driven higher by increased automotive demand.

While physical investment in small platinum bars and coins saw positive growth in 2018, the impact of this was largely
offset by redemptions from ETF funds, which continued to return platinum, palladium and rhodium to the market during
the year.

Platinum ETFs contracted by 260 000 ounces, driven by lower prices and a rotation by South African investors into 
equities, while palladium ETFs liquidated some 565 000 ounces as record prices prompted profit taking and high lease 
rates created opportunities in the lending market. Low residual palladium ETF stocks are now considered entirely 
insufficient to meet expected market deficits. 

Paper markets (NYMEX/TOCOM) for platinum and palladium charted different courses in 2018. While gross open interest 
in platinum remained elevated, the market was net-short for the first time in 15 years. In palladium, open interest
contracted substantially as forward hedging activities declined on rising prices and the market remained in 
backwardation - a situation in which the spot or cash price of a commodity is higher than the forward price.

At year-end, net paper length in platinum had declined by 373 000 ounces, to 1.24 million ounces as long positions
were trimmed. In palladium, a reduction of 1.18 million ounces saw closing net length of 1.4 million ounces as long
positions were cut by 1.2 million ounces.

Fundamentals
The market fundamentals for palladium and rhodium strengthened in 2018 and are expected to remain robust in 2019 and
beyond as emerging markets apply stricter legislation and the impact of real-world driving test regimes is felt on 
auto demand. Conversely platinum continues to face near-term challenges including the residual level of light-duty 
diesel market share and the re-basing of the Chinese jewellery market. 

In the medium term, an increasing focus on the need to add platinum to gasoline autocatalyst formulations, together
with expected demand growth from impending heavy-duty diesel legislation in China and India, offer opportunities for
meaningful structural growth.

We expect the platinum market to remain in surplus in 2019 before tightening thereafter. Fundamental deficits in
palladium are expected to persist and expand, while increasing rhodium use should drive a narrowing of the market 
balance.

Prospects and outlook 
The headwinds facing the South African PGM industry are expected to remain largely unchanged in 2019: rand volatility,
wage negotiations, national elections, along with the operational and financial crisis at Eskom are all well-recognised
challenges for the domestic producers. While the near-term outlook for platinum remains suppressed, the medium-term
outlook has improved. The current strength in both palladium and rhodium fundamentals are expected to persist for the
foreseeable future.

Robust iridium and ruthenium pricing, due to growing industrial demand, has also resulted in pricing tailwinds. The
Group believes we are in a combined 3E PGM deficit and, more recently, industry discussions and debates have shifted 
from the need for supply rationalisation to potential areas of growth.

As such, we expect dollar metal prices to remain well supported for palladium, rhodium and the minor metals, while 
the near-term outlook for platinum remains more muted. Despite an improved market outlook, we remain committed to our
long-term strategic intent to favour value over volume. We will therefore proceed with the steps outlined in our strategic
review, premised on producing safely, productively and profitably from our key assets, while taking account of the changes
in our operating environment.

The full-year refined production for the Group is maintained and is estimated at 1.5 to 1.6 million platinum ounces.
Given the scheduled refurbishment of furnaces at Impala Rustenburg and Zimplats later in this financial year, limited
inventory is expected to be released through the refinery during the second half of FY2019, with the remainder to be 
released across the group during FY2020.

The Group's operating cost is expected to be between R23 900 and R24 800 per platinum ounce on a stock-adjusted basis
for the full financial year, with Group capital expenditure forecast at R4.1 billion to R4.3 billion. 

Full-year production estimates for the operational entities are as follows:
- Impala Rustenburg 650 000 to 690 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Zimplats 270 000 to 280 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Two Rivers 160 000 to 170 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Mimosa 115 000 to 125 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Marula 80 000 to 90 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- IRS (third party) 170 000 to 180 000 platinum ounces in concentrate

Notes to the financial information for the six months ended 31 December 2018

1.   General information
     Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (""Implats"", ""the Company"" or ""the Group"") is one of the world's foremost 
     producers of platinum and associated platinum group metals (PGMs). Implats is currently structured around 
     five main operations with a total of 20 underground shafts. The mining operations are located on the 
     Bushveld Complex in South Africa and the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, the two most significant PGM-bearing 
     ore bodies in the world.

     The Company has its listing on the securities exchange operated by JSE Limited in South Africa, the Frankfurt 
     Stock Exchange (2022 US$ convertible bonds) and a level 1 American Depositary Receipt programme in the United 
     States of America.

     On 1 July 2018 Impala Platinum and Impala Refining Services (IRS), subsidiaries of the Group, entered into a 
     sale of business agreement in terms of which IRS becomes a division of Impala and Impala acquired the metal 
     purchase and toll refining operations of IRS as a going concern, utilising the group roll-over relief 
     provisions of sections 45 and 47 of the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962.

     This transaction had no financial impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

     The condensed consolidated interim financial information was approved for issue on 28 February 2019 by the 
     board of directors.

2.   Basis of preparation
     The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
     Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides 
     as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
     Reporting Standards Council, requirements of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, and the Listings Requirements 
     of the JSE Limited.

     The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual 
     consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2018, which have been prepared in accordance 
     with IFRS, and the commentary included in the interim results.
     
     The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
     except for certain financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments which are 
     measured at fair value and some equity and liabilities for share-based payment arrangements which are measured 
     using a binomial option model.
     
     The condensed consolidated interim financial information is presented in South African rand, which is the 
     Company's functional currency.

     The following US dollar exchange rates were used when preparing these condensed consolidated interim 
     financial statements:
     - Closing rate: R14.38 (December 2017: R12.38) (June 2018: R13.73)
     - Average rate: R14.18 (December 2017: R13.40) (June 2018: R12.85)

     Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected 
     total annual earnings.

3.   Accounting policies
     The principal accounting policies used by the Group are consistent with those of the previous year, except for 
     changes due to the adoption of new or revised IFRSs, for which the first time disclosure is more comprehensive 
     than would otherwise be done on interim and includes the once-off transition impact. Further, the transition 
     impact and accounting policies have been disclosed in the relevant notes.

     The following standards became effective on 1 January 2018 and were adopted by the Group on 1 July 2018:
     -   IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, refer note 9;
     - IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, refer note 15.

4.   Segment information
     The Group distinguishes its segments between the mining operations (Mining), processing and refining 
     (Impala Refining Services), chrome processing (Impala Chrome) and ""all other segments"".

     Management has defined the operating segments based on the business activities and management structure 
     within the Group.

     Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment (note 5).

     The reportable segments' measure of profit or loss is profit after tax. This is reconciled to the 
     consolidated profit after tax.

     Impala mining segment's two largest sales customers amounted to 11% and 9% of total revenue 
     (December 2017: 13% and 8%) (June 2018: 11% and 8%).

     # Refer note 15 : During the current year, the fair value exposure on purchased metal and resultant stock has been 
       designated as a hedged item on adoption of IFRS 9 and is included in the calculation of the cost of inventories. 
       The fair value exposure relates to adjustments made to commodity prices and US$ exchange rates from the date of 
       delivery until the final pricing date as per the relevant contract. 

     The net realisable value (NRV) adjustment included in inventory  at the end of December 2018 comprised R39 million 
     (December 2017: R82 million) (June 2018: R250 million) for refined mined metal and R180 million (December 2017: 
     R1 124 million) (June 2018: R1 268 million) for in-process metal.

     Included in refined metal is ruthenium on lease to third parties of 45 000 (December 2017: 40 000) 
     (June 2018: 45 000) ounces.

     Purchased metal consists of IRS inventory. Inventory includes 50 000 ounces of platinum and 35 000 ounces of 
     palladium, which were forward sold and which will be delivered to the counterparty on 29 March, 30 April 
     and 31 May 2019.

     Change in engineering estimate
     Changes in engineering estimates of metal contained in-process resulted in a R389 million (December 2017: 
     R431 million) (June 2018: R435 million) (pre-tax) increase of in-process metal.

     Change in accounting estimate
     Due to the increase in the value of nickel, relative to total revenue for the Group, management has changed 
     the classification of nickel from a by-product to a main product with effect from 1 July 2018. In terms of 
     IFRS by-products, by nature, should be immaterial. Total by-product revenue, including nickel, would be in 
     excess of 10% of total revenue and therefore, should no longer be considered immaterial and a by-product.

     Following the reclassification of nickel as a main-product, the metal inventory cost allocation methodology 
     was re-assessed and amended to allocate production costs, net of by-product revenue, based on relative sales 
     value. In the previous years, production costs, net of by-product revenue was allocated on the basis of 
     ounces. However, given that nickel is measured in tonnes, a different basis of cost allocation was required.

     This change in cost allocation methodology resulted in an overall increase in inventory value of R272 million.

     Note 4 contains additional disclosure of revenue per operating segment

9.1  Adoption of IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Transition)
     This standard replaces IAS 18, Revenue.

     In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the new rules were adopted retrospectively, to open, 
     unfulfilled customer contracts on 1 July 2017, and the effect of the adoption reflected in current year opening 
     retained earnings. The financial impact of the application of the revenue recognition adjustments to opening 
     retained earnings was Rnil.

     The Group's accounting policy has been revised to align with IFRS 15, and additional disclosures have been 
     introduced, particularly on the disaggregation of revenue as per this note.

9.2  Revenue (Accounting policy)
     Sales revenue
     The Group generates revenue from the mining, concentrating, refining and the sale of platinum group metals (PGMs) 
     and associated base metal. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the customer contract.

     The Group recognises revenue on inventory sold to a customer on delivery to the contractually agreed upon 
     delivery point. This is the point at which the performance obligation is satisfied and a receivable is 
     recognised as the consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment 
     is due. No element of financing is present due to the short term nature of Group contracts and credit 
     terms are consistent with market practice. The total sales consideration in the sales contract is allocated 
     to each product based on the contractually agreed-upon metal prices. Metal sales prices are determined based 
     on observable spot prices when revenue is recognised.      

     Toll income
     The Group derives toll income revenue from processing and refining of metal concentrate and matte. Income is 
     recognised when the refined metals have been produced, are contractually due to be returned to the customer and 
     have passed through the value creating stages of production. Total income is measured at the transaction price 
     agreed under the contract.

     Due to the nature of the Group's revenue streams and contractual terms with customers, no significant judgement 
     in respect of accounting for contracts with customers was necessary.

13.  Contingent liabilities and guarantees
     As at the end of December 2018, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees. No material liabilities 
     are expected to arise from other matters in the ordinary course of business. Guarantees of R105 million (December 2017: 
     R114 million) (June 2018: R109 million) have been issued to Friedshelf by the Group. Guarantees of R1 477 million 
     (December 2017: R1 396 million) (June 2018: R1 477 million) have been issued by third parties and financial institutions 
     on behalf of the Group consisting mainly of guarantees to the Department of Mineral Resources in respect of future 
     environmental rehabilitation amounting to R1 355 million (December 2017: R1 277 million) (June 2018: R1 355 million).

     At 31 December 2018, the Group had certain unresolved tax matters. SARS has issued additional assessments relating to 
     the matters covering the 2013 year of assessment. The Group is in the process of preparing an objection to this assessment 
     after consultation with external tax and legal advisors. The Group believes that no provision is required at this stage.

14.  Related party transactions

     # Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included as other financial assets on the statement of
       financial position
     1 Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy - Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument
     2 Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy - Significant inputs are based on observable market data with the rand-dollar
       exchange rate of R14.38/US$ and metal prices being the the most significant. These instruments are valued on a
       discounted cash-flow basis.

     The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values with the exception of the 
     US$ convertible bond (carrying amount R3 062 million) which has a fair value of approximately R2 714 million, and 
     the ZAR convertible bond (carrying amount R2 697 million) which has a fair value of approximately R2 407 million. 
     These fair values are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. A discounted cash-flow valuation 
     technique was used, using a 12% discount rate on the US$ Convertible bond and 16.4% discount rate on the 
     ZAR Convertible bond.

     Cash and cash equivalents include Zimbabwean bond notes of $88 million (R1 265 million). Bond notes were disclosed 
     as part of cash and cash equivalents since it conforms to this definition. At the reporting date bond notes were 
     pegged at a 1:1 value compared to the US$ and all of the bond notes will be utilised to settle current obligations 
     in the form of statutory payments, local taxes and other local creditors. Subsequent to the reporting period, the 
     central bank of Zimbabwe established an interbank foreign-exchange market in which the bond notes will be denominated 
     as electronic money known as RTGS dollars, and will be traded at a floating exchange rate.

15.1 Fair value hedge accounting
     Market risk
     The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including foreign currency exposure, and commodity 
     price risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and 
     seeks to minimise potentially adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group, from time to time, 
     uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.

     In the current year, management adopted a hedging strategy and accounting policy to manage the fair value risk 
     (commodity price and foreign currency exchange risk) to which purchased metal, the hedged instrument, is exposed. 
     The financial instrument used to hedge this risk is trade payables, related to metal purchases, measured at fair 
     value through profit or loss. The fair value movements on this financial liability have been designated to hedge 
     the price and foreign currency exchange risk on purchased metal inventory.

     To the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, that is, when the fair value gains and losses on both 
     the hedged item and hedged instrument are offset against each other, the gains and losses on trade payables 
     (R121 million loss) and purchased metal inventory (R121 million gain) respectively are recognised in profit 
     or loss in other income and expenses. Due to the high correlation between the fair value movements in trade 
     payables and inventory, no source of hedge ineffectiveness is expected  to affect this hedging relationship 
     during its term.

15.2 Adoption of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (Transition)
     This standard replaces IAS 39 - Financial Instruments. 

     The adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 July 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and 
     resulted in an adjustment to opening ""other reserves"". The adjustment of R94 million is as result of the 
     valuation of the equity investment in Rand Mutual Assurance (RMA) which was previously measured at cost (Rnil) 
     in accordance with IAS 39 and has now been measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group 
     has not restated comparatives on transition because the Group was not able to meet the requirement in the 
     standard to do so without the use of hindsight. IFRS 9 adoption has impacted both the classification and 
     impairment requirements of financial assets. The Group now classifies former loans and receivables and held-
     to-maturity financial assets as measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments and availabe-for-
     sale financial assets have now been classified as measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) and 
     fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) respectively.

     The following table indicates the reclassifications and adjustments recognised for each individual line item 
     as per the statement of financial position as at 1 July 2018:

     The reclassification detailed in the table on the previous page was informed by the following Implats business 
     models and financial asset characteristics:
     Reclassify equity instruments previously classified as available-for-sale to FVOCI
     The Group elected to present changes in the fair value of all its equity investments previously classified as 
     available-for-sale in other comprehensive income. The cumulative fair value gains and losses on these instruments 
     were not reclassified and will continue to be recognised in ""other reserves"" in equity. These gains and losses on 
     these investments will not be reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition.  

     Reclassification to amortised cost
     Held-to-maturity financial assets and loans and receivables (including cash and cash equivalents) carried at 
     amortised cost were reclassified to financial assets at amortised cost. The Group intends to hold the assets 
     to maturity, to collect contractual cash flows that consists solely of payments of principal and interest 
     on the outstanding amount.

     Impairment of financial assets
     The Group has five types of financial assets that are subject to IFRS 9's new expected credit loss model (ECL):
     - Trade receivables for sales of inventory and tolling refining services;
     - Other receivables, which consist mainly of employee receivables;
     - Interest-free housing loans to employees;
     - Debt investments carried at amortised cost, and
     - Cash and cash equivalents. 

     The Group was required to revise its impairment methodology under IFRS 9 for each of these classes of assets. 
     The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime 
     expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.
     
     The expected credit loss model was applied to the outstanding trade receivable balances at 1 July 2018 which 
     resulted in a negligible amount of impairment. All trade receivable balances have been recovered in full for 
     the past 5 years.
     
     The 12 month expected credit loss model has been applied to the following financial assets as credit risk is 
     considered to be low:
     - Housing loans
     - Employee receivables;
     - Debt instruments held at a financial institution.
     - Cash and cash equivalents.
     
     Employee housing loans consist of housing loans advanced to Implats employees in terms of Implats housing 
     scheme. These loans are secured by a second bond over residential properties. An impairment rate of 0.5% was 
     applied to housing loans. This impairment assumption is based on historical default rates on the overdue loans, 
     employees showing signs of financial distress and expected changes in macro economic circumstances that could
     affect employees.
     
     Employee receivables consist of short term advance. These receivables are generally recovered within 30 day 
     and due to their short term nature are consider to have a low credit risk.
     
     Debt investments at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk and are mostly held with investment 
     grade entities and the loss assessments was therefore limited to 12 months expected losses.
     
     The Group's cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9. The Group's 
     cash is held at investment grade financial institutions, which are considered to have a low credit risk and 
     the expected credit losses was immaterial.
     
     The outcome of the 12 month expected credit loss model assessments on the above financial assets was immaterial 
     at 1 July 2018, therefore no adjustment was made to opening retained earnings.

     At 31 December 2018 the expected credit loss was reassessed and no provisions were required.

     Financial liabilities
     All non-derivative financial liabilities will continue to be measured at amortised cost with the exception of
     metal purchase trade payables. On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group elected to classify and measure trade payables 
     relating to metal purchases at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative financial liabilities will also 
     continue to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.

15.3 Financial Instruments (Accounting policy)
     Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a
     party to the contract. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. 
     Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial
     liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are 
     added to, or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
     on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and 
     financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

     15.3.1 Financial assets
     Classification
     The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories on the basis of both the Group's business 
     model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets:
     - financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,
     - financial assets at amortised cost and
     - financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.

     Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, being the date on which the Group commits 
     to purchase or sell the asset. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
     from the financial asset expire, or when the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
     of the financial asset, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
     assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients.
     
     15.3.1.1 Debt instruments
     Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and 
     the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There is currently only one measurement category to which the 
     Group classifies its debt instruments:
    
     Financial asset measured at amortised cost
     Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows where those cash flows are comprised solely of 
     payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial 
     assets is included in finance income on the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on 
     derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses), together with 
     foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented separately in the statement of profit or 
     loss. These assets are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months 
     after the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets.    
    
     15.3.1.2 Equity instruments
     Implats subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value.
    
     Financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
     Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, 
     there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the 
     derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss 
     as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

     15.3.1.3 Other financial assets
     Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss
     Financial assets that are not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 
     are classified as measured at fair value through profit and loss. These include the cross-currency interest 
     rate swap (CCIRS).

     The cash flow received and paid in terms of the CCIRS interest rate swap is included in finance cost paid and 
     received in the statement of cash flows.

     15.3.2 Impairment of financial assets
     The expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost are assessed by the 
     Group on a forward looking basis. The impairment methodology applied is determined by whether there has been a 
     significant increase in credit risk.

     For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected 
     lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Trade receivables are written off 
     when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of 
     recovery, among others, include the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment agreement with the Group.

     The 12 month ECL model is applied to other receivables and financial assets at amortised cost. The expected 
     credit loss allowance recognised during the period is therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. These 
     instruments are considered to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has a 
     strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.

     When financial assets at amortised cost (other than trade receivables) have an increase in credit risk, the 
     lifetime ECL model, which is the result of all possible default events over the expected life of the financial 
     instrument, is used to impair the asset.

     The calculation of the loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default 
     and expected loss rates. The Group applies judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to 
     the impairment calculation, based on the Group's historical information, existing market conditions and forward 
     looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.

     15.3.3 Financial liabilities
     All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair 
     value through profit or loss. These liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, are subsequently 
     measured at fair value.

     The Group has also made an irrevocable election to measure trade payables relating to metal purchases at fair 
     value through profit or loss. Trade payables contracts host two embedded derivatives, namely fluctuations in 
     PGM prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. This financial liability is used as a hedging instrument in 
     the fair value hedge of a recognised asset, being purchased inventory.

     15.3.4 Financial instruments used for hedge accounting
     The Group uses the fair value movements in metal purchase trade payables measured at fair value through profit 
     or loss, to manage the exposure of purchased metal inventory to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
     rates and commodity prices.

     At inception of a qualifying hedging relationship, the Group documents the relationship between hedging 
     instrument, being trade payables, and inventory, the hedged item, as well as its risk management objective 
     and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. At hedge inception and on an on-going basis, the Group 
     assesses whether the instrument used in hedging transaction is expected to be, and has been, highly effective 
     in offsetting changes in the fair value of inventory. The fair value of the trade payable used for hedging 
     purposes is disclosed in this note.

     The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising on remeasurement of the financial instrument 
     used for hedging is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged, which is fair value movements on 
     inventory. The Group has designated trade payables measured at fair value through profit or loss as a fair 
     value hedge of inventory. Changes in the fair value of this financial liability that are effective to the 
     hedging relationship are recorded in the income statement in other income and expenses, along with changes 
     in the fair value of inventory that are attributable to the hedged risk.

     Hedge accounting is discontinued from the date when the qualifying criteria are no longer met. This is when 
     the commodity prices on the trade payables designated as the hedging instrument is reliably determined. 
     Subsequent gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations will be recognised in other operating 
     income and expenses.

     Both the royalty expense of R179 million (June 2018: R350 million), which was previously disclosed separately 
     in the ""Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income"" and the movement in the 
     rehabilitation provision, an income of R2 million (June 2018: R90 million expense), previously included in 
     other operating expenses was reclassified to cost of sales.

     These items were reclassified due to their nature, which is directly related to cost of production.

     The residual other operating income and expense items were not directly related to cost of production 
     and were therefore reclassified to other income and other expenses respectively.

FURTHER TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

Implats will release results for the half year ended 31 December 2018 (""the period"") on 28 February 2019.

Implats issued a trading statement on 4 February 2019 indicating that both headline earnings and basic
earnings were expected to be at least R2.100 billion for the period. Implats indicated that headline earnings
per share (HEPS) and basic earnings per share (EPS) for the period would be at least 292 cents per share. At
that time, there was not sufficient certainty to provide specific guidance ranges, as required by the JSE Listing
Requirements, for the expected results. Implats now has reasonable certainty about the earnings and
therefore advises shareholders of the following expected earnings ranges.

Implats' headline earnings and HEPS for the period are expected to be between R2.213 billion and R2.243
billion and between 308 cents and 312 cents per share, respectively. Headline loss and headline loss per
share for the six months ended 31 December 2017 (""comparative period"") were R150 million and 21 cents
per share, respectively.

Basic earnings and EPS are expected to be between R2.290 billion and R2.322 billion and between 319 cents
and 323 cents per share, respectively, compared to a basic loss and a basic loss per share of R163 million or
23 cents for the comparative period, respectively.

As indicated in the trading statement issued on 4 February 2019, the improvement in safety and operational
performances, particularly at the Impala Rustenburg operations, higher sales volumes and higher rand
platinum group metals basket prices - due primarily to the weakening of the rand - were the major reasons
for the increase in earnings.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

Implats will release results for the half year ended 31 December 2018 (""the period"") on 28 February 2019.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading statement on
SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that financial results for the next reporting period will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Operational performance

The Group's refined platinum production for the period is expected to increase by 10% to 800 koz from
727 koz for the half year ended 31 December 2017 (""the comparative period""). The increase in refined
platinum production is primarily due to a stock release of circa 44 koz platinum and improved performance
from Impala Rustenburg. During the comparative period, refined production was impacted by an inventory
build-up following furnace maintenance undertaken during that period.

Platinum sales volumes are expected to increase by 19% to 773 koz from 649 koz. In the comparative period,
sales volumes were lower than refined metal, primarily due to toll metal of 116 koz returned to a third party.

Expected headline and basic earnings

Due to an improved rand PGM basket price, as well as improved safety and operational performances,
Implats is expecting to report both positive basic and headline earnings for the period, compared to losses in
the comparative period.

Shareholders are advised that Implats has reasonable certainty that headline earnings and headline earnings
per share for the period are expected to increase to at least R2.1 billion or 292 cents per share. Headline loss
and headline loss per share for the comparative period were R150 million and 21 cents per share,
respectively.

Similarly, basic earnings and basic earnings per share for the period are also expected to increase to at least
R2.1 billion or 292 cents per share compared to a basic loss and basic loss per share for the comparative
period of R163 million and 23 cents per share, respectively.

There is not sufficient certainty at this stage to enable Implats to provide specific guidance ranges on its
expected results. Implats will publish a further trading statement closer to the release of its interim financial
results.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

First quarter production report for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 September 2018


Key highlights

   - Improved safety performance: 9% improvement in lost-time injury frequency rate from the end
     of FY2018

   - Strong operational performance at Impala Rustenburg: Achieved its highest first quarter mill
     tonnage of 3.15-million tonnes since FY2013

   - Improved Group operational performance: 1.9% improvement in tonnes milled across the
     Group compared to the previous comparable quarter

   - Implementation of strategic review continues: Section 189 restructuring process for 1 500
     employees progressing according to plan and outsource/disposal process for 1 Shaft commenced

   - Revenues benefit from weaker rand and improved palladium and rhodium prices: 14.2%
     improvement in revenue per platinum ounce received during the quarter (R28 355 per platinum
     ounce) compared to the previous comparable quarter as a result of a weaker ZAR:US$ exchange
     rate and higher US$ metal prices


Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: ""I am pleased to report improved safety and
operational performances during the quarter, particularly at Impala Rustenburg, which has reported its
highest first-quarter mill tonnage for the past six years. Tonnes milled at Impala Rustenburg increased by
5.6% compared to the previous corresponding quarter, reflecting the positive outcomes of various
initiatives implemented at the operation to improve safety, production and cost performance. We remain
steadfast in our resolve to eliminate high-cost production at this business, aligned with our lower future
metal prices outlook. To this end, we have progressed the Section 189 restructuring process for 1 500
employees and engaged with parties interested in potentially acquiring the 1 Shaft operation, which is
scheduled to be put on care and maintenance in April 2019 as per our restructuring plan.""

SAFETY
The safety and health of employees remains a priority for the Group. Improvements achieved in the
previous financial year have continued into FY2019, particularly at Impala Rustenburg and Marula. The
Group recently achieved seven months without a fatal accident – a record for Impala Rustenburg and the
Group. In addition, the lost-time injury frequency rate improved 9% from the end of FY2018 to 5.05 per
million man hours worked.

Regretfully, Impala Rustenburg recorded an employee fatality at 16 Shaft in September 2018. The
Company has provided support to the family of the deceased, while the board of directors and
management team have extended their very sincere sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues.

Implats’ safety strategy is premised on providing an inherently safe work environment, maintaining
leading safety practices and inculcating safe behaviour at all times. Management remains resolute in
leading this imperative through direct engagement with all our stakeholders, including each employee in
the organisation, and the leadership of our representative unions and government.

PRODUCTION
Gross tonnes milled (including joint venture operations) during the quarter increased by 1.9% to 6.87-
million tonnes, compared to 6.74-million tonnes achieved in the prior comparable period.

The increase was largely due to a much stronger operational performance at Impala Rustenburg.
Platinum in concentrate produced during the quarter across all mining operations (managed and joint
venture) was maintained at 349 000 ounces as increased production from Impala Rustenburg was offset
by lower volumes from Two Rivers and Mimosa.

Gross refined platinum production during the quarter increased by 8.2% to 369 000 ounces, compared to
341 000 ounces achieved in the prior comparable period, which was impacted by scheduled furnace
maintenance at both the Impala and Zimplats operations during the first quarter a year ago.

Impala
Impala delivered a much improved operational performance compared to the previous comparable
period. Tonnes milled increased by 5.6% to 3.15-million tonnes, compared to 2.98-million tonnes in the
previous comparable quarter, while the mill grade (6E) improved by 2.0% to 4.03g/t. Good performances
across all mining operations, supported by increased production from the development shafts, was
partially offset by the loss of production from 4 Shaft, which was closed in January 2018. Consequently,
platinum in concentrate increased by 2.8% to 186 000 ounces, compared to 181 000 ounces in the prior
comparable period. Refined platinum production increased by 35.3% to 180 000 ounces from 133 000
in the prior comparable quarter, which was impacted by planned furnace maintenance.

Zimplats
Zimplats sustained its operational performance with mill throughput and grade largely unchanged at 1.68-
million tonnes and 3.48 g/t (6E) respectively. As a result, platinum in concentrate produced at the
operation during the quarter was maintained at 70 000 ounces. However, platinum in matte increased
by 42.9% to 70 000 ounces, compared to 49 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period, which was
impacted by scheduled furnace maintenance.
Marula
Marula continues to deliver an improved operational performance following prior business restructuring
initiatives and ongoing multi-stakeholder engagements to sustain business continuity. Tonnes milled
during the period increased by 2.6% to 511 000 tonnes, compared to 498 000 tonnes in the prior
corresponding period. However, the grade declined by 4.5% to 4.23g/t (6E) due to a planned increase in
development volumes and an increase in stoping width. Consequently, platinum in concentrate
production was maintained at 23 000 ounces during the period under review.

Mimosa
Mimosa sustained production in line with design capacity. Tonnes milled during the period decreased by
2.1% to 702 000 tonnes, compared to 717 000 tonnes in the previous comparable quarter, impacted by
planned mill maintenance during the reporting period. Platinum production in concentrate decreased by
6.3% to 30 000 ounces from 32 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period as a result of the lower
milled tonnage and mill grade.

Two Rivers
Two Rivers’ mill grade continued to be impacted by mining into split reef areas. Performance during the
period was also impacted by community disruptions not aimed specifically at Two Rivers, but which
necessitated processing material from the lower-grade ore stockpile. Consequently, tonnes milled
decreased 3.2% to 825 000 tonnes, compared to 852 000 tonnes in the previous comparable quarter,
and the mill grade (6E) deteriorated by 5.1% to 3.51g/t. This impacted platinum in concentrate production,
which decreased by 9.5% to 38 000 ounces, compared to 41 600 ounces in the prior comparable period.

Impala Refining Services (""IRS"")
IRS’s refined platinum production during the period decreased by 9.6% to 189 000 ounces, compared to
209 000 ounces in the prior comparable quarter. This was largely due to higher deliveries from a third-
party customer during the previous comparable period. Mine-to-market production increased by 2.0% to
154 000 ounces in the quarter under review, while third-party toll refining volumes decreased from 57 000
ounces in the prior corresponding period to 35 000 ounces this quarter.

UPDATE ON IMPALA RUSTENBURG STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING
Consistent with our strategic review announcement on 2 August 2018 and our FY2018 financial results
presentation, Implats is progressing the implementation of its Impala Rustenburg strategic restructuring
plan. This includes consideration being given to alternative commercial outcomes which, as
communicated to the market, could include the sale of identified shafts and/or full-contract mining
provisions.

Implats has commenced a process to identify and engage with parties who may have an interest in, or
have already expressed an interest in, acquiring Impala Rustenburg’s 1 Shaft (""1 Shaft Disposal
Process""), which, as per the restructuring plan, is scheduled to be put on care and maintenance from
April 2019. In parallel to the 1 Shaft Disposal Process, Implats is continuing to engage with parties who
may have an interest in, or have already expressed an interest in, the 100% outsourcing of 1 Shaft to a
third-party contractor.

Implats will update the market, as and when appropriate, on any further developments related to the
1 Shaft Disposal Process.
The above information has not been reviewed and reported on by the Group’s external auditors.

Consolidated Annual Results 2018

Key features for the year

IMPALA PLATINUM HOLDINGS LIMITED (IMPLATS) IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S FOREMOST PRODUCERS OF PLATINUM AND 
ASSOCIATED PLATINUM GROUP METALS (PGMS). IMPLATS IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AROUND FIVE MAIN OPERATIONS 
WITH A TOTAL OF 20 UNDERGROUND SHAFTS. OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE BUSHVELD COMPLEX IN 
SOUTH AFRICA AND THE GREAT DYKE IN ZIMBABWE, THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT PGM-BEARING ORE BODIES 
IN THE WORLD.

Financial
Gross profit improved by R2.1 billion to R1.6 billion. Earnings were impacted by impairments of R13.6 billion, mainly
due to the restructuring of Impala Rustenburg. The Group's funding strategy is supported by the forward sale of up to 
R2 billion of the pipeline stock, which provides sufficient liquidity during the two year restructuring period.

Operational
Tonnes milled rose 5.6% and platinum in concentrate ounces were 1% higher following strong operational performances
across the Group. Refined platinum ounces declined by 4% and were impacted by the 77 000 platinum ounce build-up in
pipeline stocks, following the rebuild and fire at Impala Rustenburg's No. 5 furnace. 

Market
The platinum market remains over-supplied, with good demand for palladium and rhodium. 

Prices achieved
A 4% decline in the US dollar platinum price and a stronger ZAR:US$ exchange rate was offset by a 35% increase in the
US dollar palladium price and a 90% increase in the rhodium price, yielding a net 5% increase in the rand basket price
per platinum ounce.

Safety
Seven fatalities in the earlier part of the year were regrettable and unacceptable. Corrective measures taken
contributed to a seven-month fatality-free record for Implats.

Strategic response
Strong advances were made towards the stated policy of eliminating loss-making production, demonstrated by the
dramatic turnaround of Marula and the restructuring decision at Impala Rustenburg. The Group strategy to rebalance 
its portfolio toward lower-cost, shallow, mechanisable assets was progressed through the acquisition of a 15% interest 
in the Waterberg project.

Introduction 
The past year was pivotal for Implats as it embraced and advanced key strategies to align with the Group's 
evolving geopolitical and macro-economic landscape. Both jurisdictions in which the company operates have 
witnessed encouraging political changes, which will positively influence the industry and the Group's 
business interests in the future.

In Zimbabwe, Zimplats successfully concluded the release of ground north of portal 10, which does not 
form part of its 30-year mine plans. In addition, the special mining lease (SML) was successfully 
converted into two new mining leases, which, combined with partial relief on export levies, will 
enable the Zimbabwean assets to sustain and grow future financial returns.

Uncertainty in the South African policy and regulatory framework remains. However, a more collaborative 
and trusting environment is being established, which enhances the likelihood of constructive outcomes 
that will attract investors back to the mining sector. The Group remains committed to collaboration 
with all stakeholders to ensure an attractive and sustainable industry.

While platinum group metal (PGM) rand basket pricing has remained depressed, the increase in US dollar 
palladium and rhodium prices during the past year has been encouraging. 

Implats remains confident in the long-term fundamentals for PGM demand with future opportunities for 
palladium back-substitution with platinum in the manufacture of catalytic converters. However, platinum 
price support is not expected in the near term and the Group has aligned company strategies accordingly.

Current market fundamentals require much improved industry discipline, particularly in discontinuing 
unprofitable production. Implats cannot, and will not, support loss-making production and the remarkable 
return to positive Group contributions from Marula, as well as the restructuring decisions announced at 
Impala Rustenburg are therefore very pleasing. In addition, the acquisition of a 15% interest in the 
Waterberg development project is a significant step in advancing the Group strategy towards lower-cost, 
shallow, mechanisable assets.

Internally, the Group is reprioritising and rescheduling capital allocation decisions and focusing on 
effective cash management to protect the balance sheet. Key business focus areas include improved 
organisational effectiveness through enhanced accountability, performance management and effective 
strategic decision making. Social responsibility, elimination of harm to the health and safety of 
employees and preventing negative impact on the environment underpins the Group's operating philosophy 
and remain key imperatives.

In addition, other initiatives have been progressed this past year, including:
- A much improved safety performance during the second half of FY2018
- Higher output at most operations
- A pleasing operational and financial turnaround at Marula
- Securing profitable third-party PGM toll treatment through Impala Refining Services (IRS) by 
  positioning the business within Impala where the processing assets are housed

The most significant step in the transformation of the Group, however, was announced after year-end when 
the findings and recommendations of the Impala Rustenburg strategic review were released. Taking account 
of the current operating environment and macro-economic realities, the outcome concluded that a radical 
and urgent transition into a leaner, more concentrated and profitable operation is critical to support 
the future success of the Group. 

The implementation of the Impala Rustenburg plan will be phased in over the next two years to ensure 
the transition occurs in a socially responsible manner. The key outcomes of the restructuring, which 
is expected to be concluded by the end of the 2021 financial year, include:
- A reduced mining 'footprint' from 11 to six operating shafts as operations are stopped at end-of-life 
  and uneconomical shafts
- Production reducing from the previously guided 750 000 platinum ounces to 520 000 platinum ounces a year
- The total labour complement (employees and contractors) reducing from approximately 40 000 to 27 000 
  from 2021

This plan is expected to deliver a safer and profitable Impala Rustenburg centred on its best assets with 
higher quality, long-life orebodies, lower operating costs and capital intensity. Importantly, it secures 
employment for 27 000 employees and surrounding communities can continue to participate in Implats' 
procurement, training and local economic development activities. 

To initiate the restructuring process, Impala Rustenburg commenced a formal Section 189 labour reduction 
process in early August 2018 that could affect 1 500 jobs. Of this, approximately 300 employees have already 
exited the organisation due to natural attrition. It is expected that the total number of employees affected 
by the Section 189 will reduce further as the normal and ongoing process of natural attrition continues. 
Despite this, and throughout the implementation, there will be an overriding imperative to ensure that 
forced job losses are minimised through various avoidance measures. These include the transfer of workers 
to vacant positions at the 16 and 20 growth shafts, reskilling, voluntary separation, business improvement 
initiatives and exploring commercial options to exit shafts that do not fit the long-term portfolio.

In addition to the structural changes, Impala Rustenburg will continue to look at ways to improve safety, 
productivity and cost efficiency. Any material changes in the operating and business performance, or the 
pricing environment, will be considered as management seeks alternatives to further optimise the business. 
The phased approach to the implementation of the Impala Rustenburg restructuring plan will allow for 
further options to be explored and afford each shaft the opportunity to improve profitability, while 
allowing time to consult with government, unions and other stakeholders before any final decision is 
made to close or exit an unprofitable shaft.

Safety and sustainability
The safety and health of employees remains a priority and it is with deep sadness and regret that the Group 
reported seven work-related fatalities during the year – six of the fatalities occurred at Impala Rustenburg 
and one at Marula. The Implats Board and management team extend their sincere condolences to families and 
friends. The Group will continue to provide support to the dependants of the deceased.

Over the year, safety measures were tested, enhanced and altered, where necessary. Safety communication to 
employees has been improved and the emphasis remains on ensuring effective leadership, responsible behaviour, 
and driving a culture of personal accountability and interdependence. Ongoing collaboration with key 
stakeholders and a shared vision of zero harm will continue to drive further improvements through awareness, 
education, and the implementation of appropriate systems and best practice.

This renewed level of focus on safety resulted in a better performance during the second half of the year 
and the Group operated for seven months without a fatal accident, which is an Implats record. Regrettably, 
a fatal accident occurred at the Impala Rustenburg 16 Shaft in September 2018, which remains the subject 
of an investigation.

The continued effort and focus on improving safety conditions has resulted in a 6.3% improvement in the 
Group lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) and 9.2% improvement in the Group total injury frequency 
rate (TIFR). At year end, 11 of the 17 operations had achieved 'millionaire' fatality-free shifts status.

The operating philosophy at Implats is underpinned by a value system centred on long-term sustainability. 
Interventions to reduce the impact of TB and HIV/Aids on our employees have had positive results, with a 
43% reduction in new pulmonary TB cases recorded over the past five years and a 51% decline in Aids-related 
deaths since 2014. No major environmental incidents were recorded during the past year and minor incidents 
reduced by 13% from 35 to 31 incidents. Water recycling exceeded Group targets and ended the year on a 
record high of 45% of total consumption. 

Host communities remain vital stakeholders and social investment expenditure has escalated by nearly 
30% year on year at the South African operations, despite the challenging financial conditions. Implats' 
focus remains on housing, education, health and training. The Group is cognisant of the economic 
challenges faced in most of the platinum producing areas and recognise the importance of a continued 
contribution during these times.

The Implats Board and management team are also aware that shareholders, who own and have invested in the 
Company, have received scant reward over the past five years. Decisive action has been taken in this 
financial year to reposition the organisation, return it to profitability in a low-price environment 
and better reward all stakeholders.

Operational review
The Group achieved encouraging operational improvements over the year. Platinum ounces in concentrate 
were 1% higher at 1.57 million platinum ounces (FY2017: 1.56 million). This was mainly due to improved 
operational performances from Impala, Marula, Mimosa and IRS, while Zimplats and Two Rivers reported 
lower contributions. 

Refined platinum production was impacted by a temporary stock build up of some 77 000 platinum ounces 
at Impala Rustenburg, which remains available for sale in the next financial year. This inventory was 
built up following furnace maintenance undertaken during the first half of the financial year and an 
electrical failure at No. 5 furnace in February 2018. 

Costs were well contained and, on a stock-adjusted basis, were largely unchanged at R22 931 per 
platinum ounce. The Group spent R4.6 billion (FY2017: R3.4 billion) on capital projects during 
the year, which is 34% higher than last year. This was largely due to higher spend on 16 and 
20 Shafts and Zimplats' Mupani mine. 

Impala Refining Services (IRS) maintained its significant cash generation to the Group, delivering 
more than R1 billion.

Impala Rustenburg
Operational performance was negatively impacted in the first half of the year by mine stoppages following 
five fatal incidents during September and October 2017. Mill throughput increased by 8% to 10.95 million 
tonnes (FY2017: 10.12 million) from the previous year largely due to the 14 Shaft recovery after the 
2016 fire (+725 000 tonnes), the 16 Shaft ramp-up (+455 000 tonnes) and performance improvements at 
1, 11 and 12 Shafts (+200 000 tonnes). This was offset to some extent by lower volumes from 9 and 10 
Shafts and the closure of 4, 7 and 7A Shafts (-670 000 tonnes). 

The PGE milled head grade improved marginally due to an increase in the stoping to development ratio, 
offset to some extent by the ore pass rehabilitation at 16 Shaft that resulted in some waste dilution. 
The higher tonnage and grade resulted in a 3% improvement in platinum in concentrate production to 
669 000 ounces (FY2017: 651 000). 

A major furnace rebuild was undertaken on one of the three operating furnaces at the smelting complex 
in the first half of the year. In February 2018, an electrical failure triggered a fire at the No. 5 
furnace transformers. Owing to these events, a stock build-up of approximately 77 000 platinum ounces 
occurred at the smelter, and refined platinum production for the year decreased by 11% to 581 000 ounces 
(FY2017: 654 600). 

Cash costs increased by 2.4% to R15.8 billion (FY2017: R15.4 billion). However, the build-up of in-process 
stock and consequent lower refined metal output resulted in refined unit costs increasing by 15% to 
R27 183 per platinum ounce (FY2017: R23 543). On a stock-adjusted basis, unit costs increased by only 
1% to R24 005 per platinum ounce (FY2017: R23 856) on the back of higher production and a strong focus 
on cost management. 

Capital expenditure increased by 12% to R2.77 billion (FY2017: R2.47 billion) mainly due to increased 
spend at 16 and 20 Shafts, as well as refurbishment and repair work at the No. 5 furnace. The cash 
outflow of R4 billion, before financing and working capital movements, was 19% higher than the previous 
year and included employee separation costs of R525 million, finance charges that were higher by 
R159 million and increased capital spend of R295 million. Impala made a gross loss of R2.79 billion 
in FY2018, a 4% improvement from the R2.91 billion loss for FY2017.

The 16 and 20 Shaft projects are critical to returning Impala Rustenburg to profitability. Both projects 
were assessed as part of the strategic review process. As a result, some duplicate shaft ore pass systems 
at 16 Shaft, as well as the upper 2 levels at 20 Shaft, were removed from the respective projects, without 
materially impacting the build-up of these shafts to full production. The capital cost profile for 20 Shaft 
has been optimised and will reduce by R445 million. 

In assessing production readiness, the rehabilitation of the C-pass and construction of the lower section 
of D-pass at 16 Shaft still need to be completed to achieve full production. Some construction work at 
20 Shaft remains outstanding and the project is now approaching completion in terms of the redefined 
project scope. Production at 16 Shaft has ramped up significantly during the year as increased face 
becomes available. Although the initial ramp-up was limited to the Merensky Reef, development access 
to the UG2 has now made concurrent mining on most horizons possible. As previously reported, the
20 Shaft ramp-up is still being hampered by challenging geological conditions, which impacts face 
availability. The mining plan is limited to the Merensky horizon and opening sufficient pit room to 
provide mining flexibility is taking longer than anticipated. This has resulted in an increased focus 
on development at the shaft. The future profitability and strategic optionality of the shaft will be 
further evaluated and optimised in FY2019. 

IRS
Impala Refining Services (IRS) continues to deliver a significant financial contribution to the Group. 
During the year, IRS received a total of 889 000 platinum ounces in concentrate (FY2017: 890 000) from 
Implats Group operations and third-party sources. Treatment and final production were constrained due 
to the Impala Rustenburg smelter maintenance programme and transformer fire during the year. However, 
refined platinum output was maintained at similar levels to the previous year at 887 000 ounces 
(FY2017: 875 000). Cash flow of R1.23 billion (FY2017: R1.18 billion) was higher but was impacted 
by an increased taxation charge and lower finance income received. Gross profit at IRS improved by 
2% to R1.55 billion (FY2017: R1.52 billion) benefiting from a once-off toll contract – 140 000 ounces 
of platinum (FY2017: 14 500) was returned to third-party customers during the year under review. 

Post the end of the reporting period, and following Impala's acquisition of the metal purchase and toll 
refining operations of IRS, it became a fully integrated division of Impala, which already processes all 
the material acquired by IRS and conducts most of its regulatory and administrative duties. This secures 
IRS's business tenure through the precious metals refining licence held by Impala and simplifies the 
corporate structure and ongoing toll refining business model, with no adverse tax consequences for 
either IRS or Impala. IRS, as a division of Impala, is likely to benefit from the net value-added 
tax and income tax position of Impala. 

Marula 
The year under review saw a significant decline in community protests and disruptions. Continued 
engagement processes by the Marula team, and an intervention with the assistance of the Department 
of Mineral Resources to resolve the community chrome dispute, have been successful in mitigating 
protest action. Discussions with the various stakeholders are ongoing to secure a sustainable 
long-term resolution.

Consequently, Marula delivered an excellent operational performance. Tonnes milled increased by 
a significant 23% to 1.84 million tonnes, while PGE head grade improved marginally to 4.33g/t. 
Platinum production in concentrate rose 25% to 85 000 ounces (FY2017: 68 000), the highest annual 
production level achieved to date at this operation. The higher volumes, together with well 
contained costs, resulted in a 15% improvement in unit costs to R24 877 per platinum ounce 
(FY2017: R29 278). On the back of this strong performance, and further supported by a higher 
PGM price basket due to improved palladium and rhodium prices, Marula realised a substantial 
turnaround in cash flow before financing and working capital movements, delivering a R77 million 
cash contribution, reversing the outflow of R839 million in the previous year. Marula reported a 
R47 million gross profit in FY2018, significantly up from a gross loss of R586 million in the 
previous year. 

Zimplats
Zimplats sustained its excellent safety and production performance. Tonnes milled and PGE head 
grade were maintained at 6.6 million tonnes (FY2017: 6.7 million) and 3.48g/t (FY2017: 3.49g/t). 
Platinum production was down 4% to 271 000 platinum ounces in matte (FY2017: 281 000), impacted 
by a small lock-up in the smelter. Costs were well contained, increasing only 5% to US$1 313 per 
platinum ounce in matte (FY2017: US$1 249), affected by lower volumes, an increase in labour costs 
and the impact of a stronger rand on goods and services procured from South Africa. 

The re-establishment of Bimha Mine was completed and the operation returned to full production 
in April 2018. The Mupani decline development remains ahead of schedule and is targeting ore contact 
by April 2019. Capital expenditure rose significantly to US$135 million (FY2017: US$63 million) as 
the Bimha and Mupani developments advanced. Cash flows were lower due to the higher capital 
expenditure, but the operating entity remains cash generative. Gross profit improved on the back 
of higher US dollar metal prices and increased from R1.29 billion (US$95 million) in the previous 
year to R2.05 billion (US$160 million) in FY2018. Zimplats declared a dividend of US$65 million 
(R820 million), post the financial year-end. 

In June 2018, Zimplats agreed to release to the government of Zimbabwe land measuring 23 903 hectares 
within Zimplats' mining lease area. Following this release of ground, Zimplats now holds two separate 
and non-contiguous pieces of land measuring in aggregate 24 632 hectares. As part of this agreement, 
Zimplats' SML was converted into two new mining leases with effect from 31 May 2018, which are valid 
for the life of mine of Zimplats' mining operations. As a result, Zimplats' corporate tax rate changes 
from 15.45% to 25.75%. However, additional profits tax associated with the SML is no longer applicable. 
This secures the operating subsidiary's mining tenure, positioning it to sustain and grow future 
financial returns. 

Mimosa 
Mimosa remains a steady performer and once again delivered a strong operating result. 
Tonnes milled were 3% higher at 2.80 million (FY2017: 2.73 million), while PGE head grade was 
maintained at 3.84g/t (FY2017: 3.83g/t). Record production was achieved, and platinum production 
increased by 3% to 125 000 ounces in concentrate (FY2017: 122 000). Costs were flat at US$1 521 per 
platinum ounce in concentrate (FY2017: US$1 511). Capital expenditure increased significantly to 
US$44 million (FY2017: US$33 million) largely due to increased capital development and the extension 
of the conveyor belt system. Cash flows before financing and working capital were maintained at 
US$28 million. Gross profit of R751 million (US$60 million) (FY2017: R183 million) (US$14 million)
was underpinned by the increase in US dollar metal prices.

The envisaged export levy on unbeneficiated platinum has been lowered to 5% for exported concentrates 
and deferred by the government of Zimbabwe to 1 January 2019. Two expansion studies are being progressed 
as a potential alternative to the development of a smelter and Mimosa continues to consult with the 
government to secure a mutually beneficial outcome. 

Two Rivers
The planned mining of low-grade split-reef areas and consequential lower recoveries impacted Two Rivers' 
operational performance during the year. Tonnes milled were maintained at similar levels to the previous 
year at 3.46 million tonnes (FY2017: 3.50 million), given that 59 000 tonnes were toll-treated at a 
neighbouring mine during the previous financial year. The PGE head grade reflected split-reef mining 
and decreased by 7% to 3.63g/t (FY2017: 3.90g/t). As a result, platinum in concentrate declined by
11% from the previous year to 163 000 ounces (FY2017: 182 000). The lower production impacted operating 
costs, which rose by 12% to R14 517 per platinum ounce (FY2017: R12 925). 

The deepening of the main decline led to capital expenditure being 55% higher at R454 million 
(FY2017: R293 million). This, together with the lower volumes, affected cash flows, which were 
6% lower at R529 million. The lower volumes also affected gross profit, which was 9% lower at 
R989 million (FY2017: R1 081 million).

Waterberg 
Waterberg represents a large scale PGM resource with an attractive risk profile, given its shallow 
nature and high palladium content. This facilitates fully mechanised production with the potential 
for the project to have among the lowest operating costs in the PGM sector. The definitive feasibility 
study (DFS) is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed towards the end of this 
financial year. Implats will have 90 business days following approval of the DFS to determine whether 
it wishes to exercise its option to acquire control of the project, and a further 90 business days 
to confirm acceptable financing arrangements. 

Financial review
Revenue for the year declined by 3% to R35.9 billion (FY2017: R36.8 billion), despite higher rand 
basket prices, impacted by lower sales volumes. The lower sales volumes resulted in a negative variance 
of R3.4 billion as approximately 77 000 additional platinum ounces were built up in process stock in 
the year. Overall, dollar metal prices were 12% higher year on year resulting in a positive variance 
of R4.7 billion, but was partially offset by a negative variance of R2.3 billion arising on a 6% 
stronger rand. 

Cost of sales were well contained and reduced by 8% to R34.3 billion as costs were deferred due to 
the stock build-up. Gross profit improved by R2.1 billion to R1.6 billion (FY2017: loss of R529 million). 
Group unit costs on a stock-adjusted basis were well managed, increasing marginally from R22 838 to 
R22 931 per platinum ounce as approximately R1.0 billion was realised from various cost saving 
initiatives at Impala.

Despite the increase in gross profit, earnings for the year were adversely impacted by impairments 
of R13.6 billion, of which R13 billion relates to the impairments of assets at Impala Rustenburg 
following the outcome of the strategic review and R611 million relates to the Afplats assets. 
Earnings were further impacted by a once-off, non-cash, deferred taxation charge of R1.2 billion 
arising from a change in the Zimplats tax rate from 15.45% to 25.75% (following the conclusion of 
the conversion of the SML into new mining leases), separation costs of R525 million, increased net 
finance costs as a result of higher costs on the 2022 convertible bonds, as well as a reduction in 
the cash balances at Group level. Consequently, the loss after tax increased by 33% to a loss of 
R10.8 billion from a loss of R8.1 billion in the previous year.

Free cash outflow for the year was R4.2 billion, as an additional R3.2 billion was locked up in 
working capital, largely due to the inventory build-up, while capital expenditure increased by 
R1.2 billion. Capital expenditure at Impala increased by R295 million, while at Zimplats it 
increased by R875 million, which was mainly spent on the development of Mupani and Bimha. 
Impala Rustenburg used R6.6 billion of cash after funding the additional inventory build-up 
of R3.1 billion, separation costs and R2.8 billion of capital expenditure, of which R1.4 billion 
was in respect of 16 and 20 Shafts. 

At year-end, the Group had adequate headroom of R6.2 billion comprising gross cash on hand of 
R3.7 billion (FY2017: R7.8 billion) and R2.5 billion in unutilised bank debt facilities. 
The R4 billion revolving credit facilities and the convertible bonds mature in 2021 and 2022, 
respectively. The Group remains well within all its debt covenants.

Market review 
Since the global financial crisis, the platinum market has been fundamentally over-supplied for 
the most part, with only the period of the industry-wide strike of 2014 and subsequent recovery 
being the exception. The Volkswagen scandal that broke in September 2015 has accelerated the 
erosion of diesel passenger car demand in Western Europe and there has been rapid contraction 
of the Chinese jewellery market since 2015, leaving demand off its peak and still falling. 
Combined with steady increases in recycling, these developments have driven the platinum price 
down over the past three years. There is market consensus for softer platinum demand for at 
least the next three years.

Lower prices have triggered shaft and mine closures across South Africa's Bushveld region, removing 
almost 1.5 million ounces of annual capacity to date. It is widely acknowledged that at least 
one million ounces of platinum have been produced at a loss in South Africa every year since 2012. 

Producers have been adapting to a sustained low-price environment through significant restructuring 
and streamlining of portfolios to the lowest-cost, most efficient assets. Implats' peers have shed 
high-cost assets, diversified regionally and sought to become more vertically integrated. Similarly, 
this necessitated Implats taking the bold action to address inefficiencies and limit cash burn and a 
rising cost base at Impala Rustenburg, all aimed at reinstating profitability to secure longevity 
in this increasingly competitive industry. 

The fundamentals for both palladium and rhodium remain strong, premised on forecast growth of the 
global automotive sector, coupled with tighter emissionss with palladium, forecasts for the rhodium 
market are for strengthening fundamentals. In what is currently a close-to-balanced market, forecasts 
now see this moving into relatively deep deficits sooner than previously anticipated.

Implats' rand basket PGM pricing forecast has consequently been revised further downwards. The 
pdated price forecasts are, however, conservative when benchmarked against the latest consensus 
data, with real prices in the updated forecast appreciating at a compound annual growth rate of 
2.5% over a six-year forecast period.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
There have been material changes in the attributable Group Mineral Resource estimate, which reduced 
by 57.8 million platinum ounces. The change is dominated by the release of land at Zimplats. The 
strategic decision to exit certain prospecting rights at Imbasa and Inkosi and the Impala/Royal 
Bafokeng Resources Platinum (Pty) Ltd Unincorporated Joint Venture also contributed notably to 
the reduction. The estimate as at 30 June 2018 is dominated by Zimplats and Impala Rustenburg, 
which together contribute some 74% of the total attributable Group Mineral Resources.

Overall the attributable Group Mineral Reserve estimate did not change significantly and decreased 
by 1.2 million platinum ounces to 21.2 million platinum ounces. The resultant estimate as at 
30 June 2018 is based on a material reduction at Impala Rustenburg following the detailed strategic 
review, and a material increase at Zimplats due to the conversion of some Upper Ores (>11-degree slope) 
to Mineral Reserves. Furthermore, the addition of the RE portion of Kalkfontein at Two Rivers had a 
positive impact on the combined Group Mineral Reserves. Some 47% of the attributable Group Mineral 
Reserves (platinum) is located at Zimplats and a further 36% at Impala.

Prospects and outlook 
The South African PGM industry continues to face unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. 
Consensus forecasts remain for softer platinum demand for at least the next three years, with 
the introduction of stricter heavy-duty diesel emission regulations and a recovering global 
economy presenting upside for platinum, but only over the longer term. The immediate fundamentals 
for both palladium and rhodium remain strong, largely due to expected growth in the global 
internal combustion engine automotive market and tighter emissions regulations. 

Sustained lower metal prices and a weak rand have had a significant impact on the PGM industry. 
It is imperative that Implats becomes a viable concern at current PGM prices and it has, therefore, 
been bold in its actions to create and share value sustainably with all stakeholders in a lower 
platinum pricing environment.

Implats' focus in the short to medium term is to continue its strategic journey to transform into 
a PGM producer mining mechanised, low-cost orebodies with more appropriate metal mixes. This includes 
the determined and necessary repositioning of Impala Rustenburg to ensure the operation can contribute 
to the long-term success of the Group and its local communities. Prudent management of Implats' 
financial and cash resources during the two-year restructuring process remains a key priority. The 
implementation of the strategic review will not only strengthen Impala Rustenburg's position in the 
prevailing price environment but will also significantly improve the strategic position of the Implats 
Group to sustainably deliver improved returns to all stakeholders in the medium to long term.

Both South Africa and Zimbabwe have seen positive changes in political leadership, which have resulted 
in meaningful dialogue with the regulators. Signals of greater policy consistency have provided confidence 
in decision making, and opportunities for capital growth and expenditure plans. 

In South Africa, the most recent revision of the Mining Charter has been released for public comment. 
In our view, the principles outlined in the charter are, in the main, conducive to the growth and 
development of the minerals industry and we will continue to engage constructively to contribute 
towards a satisfactory outcome of the process.

Longer-term, the minority interest we acquired in the Waterberg project, with the option to acquire 
majority ownership, provides additional geographic and commodity diversity for the Group – away from 
deep, labour-intensive conventional operations. 

For the next financial year, platinum production estimates are as follows:
- Group refined platinum production – between 1.50 and 1.60 million ounces
- Impala – between 650 000 and 690 000 ounces
- Zimplats – between 270 000 and 280 000 ounces
- Two Rivers – between 160 000 and 170 000 ounces
- Mimosa – between 115 000 and 125 000 ounces
- Marula – between 85 000 and 95 000 ounces
- IRS third-party toll refining – between 170 000 and 180 000 ounces

The Group's operating cost, excluding the cost of retrenchment, is expected to be between R23 900 
and R24 800 per platinum ounce. Capital expenditure is planned at between R4.1 billion and R4.3 billion.

Our approach to maintaining a social licence to operate will remain underpinned by the Group's belief 
that sustainable businesses operate in a harmonious, supportive and beneficial manner for all key 
stakeholders. Implats will continue to deliver effectively on the social and labour plan commitments 
in South Africa and the targeted corporate social investments in Zimbabwe.

The financial information on which this outlook is based has not been reviewed and reported on by 
Implats' external auditors.

    Implats entered into a CCIRS amounting to US$250 million to hedge the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible 
    bond, being: exchange rate risk on the dollar interest payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds 
    at a rand-dollar exchange rate weaker than R13.025/US$. US$250 million was swapped for R3 256 million on which Implats 
    pays a fixed interest rate to Standard Bank of 9.8%. Implats receives the 3.25% coupon on the US$250 million on the 
    same date which Implats pays-on externally to the bond holders and the interest thereon. In June 2022, Implats will 
    receive US$250 million for a payment of R3 256 million.
    
    The CCIRS is carried at its fair value of R21 million asset (2017: R49 million liability). No hedge accounting has 
    been applied.

(“Implats” or “the Group”)

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2018

Implats will release results for the year ended 30 June 2018 (“the period”) on 13 September 2018.

With reference to the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, issuers must publish a trading statement on
SENS as soon as they become reasonably certain that financial results for the next reporting period will differ
by at least 20% from those of the previous corresponding reporting period.

Operational performance

The Group’s refined platinum production for the period is expected to decrease by 4% to 1.468 Moz from
1.530 Moz for the year ended 30 June 2017 (“the comparative period”). The reduction in refined platinum
production is primarily due to a stock build-up of circa 77 000 oz platinum, which remains available for sale
in the next financial period. Inventory was built up following furnace maintenance undertaken in the first
half of the financial year and an electrical failure at the Number 5 furnace in February 2018.

Concentrate platinum production for the period is expected to increase by 1% to 1.574 Moz from 1.557 Moz
in the comparative period. The increase in concentrate production was principally as a result of improved
operational performances from Impala, Marula, Mimosa and Impala Refining Services (“IRS”) (third party),
partially offset by lower production from Zimplats and Two Rivers.

The Group’s stock adjusted unit costs were well-managed, increasing by approximately 3% from the
comparative period.

Expected headline and basic loss

Shareholders are advised that Implats is expecting a headline loss of between R1 164 million and R1 336
million, with headline loss per share of between 162 and 186 cents per share. Headline loss and headline
loss per share for the comparative period were R983 million and 137 cents per share, respectively. The
expected headline loss per share will therefore reflect an increased loss of between 18% and 36% when
compared with the headline loss per share for the comparative period.

Basic loss for the period is expected to be a loss of between R10 167 million and R11 676 million, with the
basic loss per share of between 1 415 and 1 625 cents per share. Basic loss and basic loss per share for the
comparative period were R8 220 million and 1 145 cents per share, respectively. The expected basic loss per
share will therefore reflect an increased loss of between 24% and 42% when compared with the basic loss
per share for the comparative period.

The difference between basic and headline losses is primarily due to the impairment of property, plant and
equipment as a consequence of the outcome of the Impala Rustenburg strategic review. During the period,
the Group recognised impairments of R9 699 million or 1 350 cents per share (post tax) primarily in respect
of its Impala Rustenburg assets. In the comparative period, an impairment of R7 365 million or 1 026 cents
per share (post-tax) was recognised in relation to the prepayment of royalties to the Royal Bafokeng Nation.
Despite the increase in gross profits year on year, headline and basic earnings for the period decreased due
to a once-off, non-cash, deferred taxation charge of R1 227 million or 171 cents per share, and retrenchment
costs of R378 million or 53 cents per share (post-tax). The additional tax charge arose on the change in the
mining tax rate of Zimplats following the conclusion of the new mining leases. In addition, losses in the
comparative period included proceeds on a once-off insurance claim of R584 million or 81 cents per share
(post tax).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

STRATEGIC UPDATE 
Impala Rustenburg review
2 August 2018

Summary
The Impala Rustenburg strategic review has been completed 

- Optimisation measures in the prevailing low platinum price environment are not sufficient to secure the 
  economic viability of the operation
- Structural changes are required to restore the operation to long-term profitability
- The Implats board has approved a turnaround strategy that will transition Impala Rustenburg to long-term 
  economic viability in a low price environment, over the period FY2018 to FY2021:                        
  - Mining footprint to contract from 11 to six operating shafts as operations are ceased at depleted, 
    end-of-life and uneconomical shafts                                                                   
  - Platinum group elements (PGE) mill grade to increase from 4.09g/t to 4.25g/t and the Merensky:UG2 ratio 
    to increase from 42% to 50%                                                                      
  - Production guidance revised from 750 000 to 520 000 ounces platinum per annum, removing non-profitable 
    platinum production from an over supplied market                                                   
  - Total labour complement (employees and contractors) to reduce from 40 000 to 27 000
  - Real operating costs to decrease from R25 100 per platinum ounce in FY2017, to less than R22 000 per 
    ounce in FY2021 (2018 terms)                                                                         
  - Real stay-in-business (SIB) capital expenditure to reduce from R2 800 per platinum ounce in FY2017, 
    to less than R2 000 per platinum ounce (2018 terms), due to infrastructure efficiency improvements      
  - Replacement capital to reduce from R820 million per annum in FY2018, to R120 million in FY2021 and 
    thereafter to zero in FY2023 in line with the completion of the 16 and 20 shafts replacement projects      
  - Once-off restructuring costs of approximately R2.7 billion expected during FY2019 and FY2020
- The restructuring plan will be funded from internal cash, current facilities and the monetisation of some 
  inventory stocks
- A staged implementation over a two-year period mitigates implementation risks and socio-economic impacts 
- Implats will execute the transition in a socially responsible manner and engage with all key stakeholders  
  to mitigate the potential social impact as far as practically possible. This will include consideration  
  and development of potential commercial options to minimise job losses
- Impala Rustenburg in its new form will remain a key asset within the Group with two modern shafts and 
  strategic processing assets

Introduction

To sustainably improve its competitive position, profitability and financial returns, Implats has committed to a
value-focused strategy. The Group intends to reduce its exposure to higher-cost and less flexible, labour-intensive
operations to improve flexibility, capacity and sustainably generate attractive returns in a changing market and 
operating environment.

This change in strategic orientation has been impacted by a significant and sustained decline in the US dollar 
platinum price and continued high mining cost inflation. Cost pressure is particularly acute in older, deeper 
labour-intensive conventional Platinum Group Metals (PGM) mines located on the Western Limb of the Bushveld 
Complex. Implats has therefore placed a clear emphasis on developing a portfolio of long-life, low-cost, shallow, 
modern mechanised mining assets to sustainably deliver improved returns to all its stakeholders. 
Implats has previously highlighted several key strategic focus areas, including:
- A commitment to responsible and ethical business conduct and to achieving its zero harm goals
- Enhancing the competitive position of the asset portfolio by:
  - Eliminating loss-making production
  - Enhancing shareholder returns from Zimbabwean operations
  - Growing exposure to low-cost mechanised and palladium-focused operations
- Prudent capital allocation
- Improving organisational effectiveness

Good progress has been made on many of these key focus areas, notably:
- Delivering a much improved safety performance during the second half of FY2018
- Effecting an operational and financial turnaround at Marula
- Converting the special mining lease at Zimplats into two new mining leases, and placing the assets in a stronger
  position to sustain and grow future financial returns
- Securing the profitable third-party PGMs toll treatment business and seeking new opportunities to grow the 
  business by leveraging the Group’s available processing capacity
- Acquiring a 15% interest, with an option to move to a control position, in the potential low-cost, mechanised,
  palladium-focused Waterberg project, which could provide additional geographic and commodity diversity for 
  the Group
- Issuing new 2022 convertible bonds to maintain a strong liquidity position

The Group’s portfolio is now well positioned and profitable at current metal prices, with the clear exception of
Impala Rustenburg. A strategic review of this operation was undertaken with the aim of restoring the business to
profitability as soon as practically possible. 

The strategic review considered a range of measures to optimise and reposition the business. Taking account of 
the current operating environment and macro-economic realities, the strategic review concluded that a fundamental 
business restructuring was the only viable option to secure a long-term future for the operation. A radical and 
urgent transition into a leaner, more focused and profitable operation is critical to support the future success 
of the Group.

MARKET AND INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
The platinum market has been in a sustained industrial oversupply for some time. The price of the metal has been
further impacted by a recent unrelated but concurrent erosion in diesel passenger car sales and contraction in 
Chinese jewellery demand. Discounting a concerted return to platinum in gasoline auto-catalyst systems, the 
market is not expected to shift into a fundamental industrial deficit until 2022, when demand is again expected 
to outpace supply.

In contrast to platinum, the fundamentals for both palladium and rhodium remain strong. This is largely premised 
on the sustained preference for gasoline-based passenger cars and ever tightening global emission regulations. 
However, platinum as the dominant revenue contributor in the South African PGM industry has inhibited rand basket 
price growth offsetting palladium and rhodium price increases. Operating costs, on the other hand, have increased 
markedly due to above-inflation increases in labour and electricity costs, and declining productivity largely as 
a result of more stringent mining designs, methods and procedures to achieve the critical improvements required 
in industry safety performance. Lower prices and rising costs have had a devastating impact on the PGM industry’s 
profitability, triggering significant reductions in capital expenditure and shaft/mine closures. The PGM industry 
has removed some 1.5 million ounces of platinum capacity since 2008. Western Limb producers have been most 
severely impacted, driven by the costs associated with operating deep, labour-intensive, conventional mines 
with older infrastructure, whereas shallow, mechanised mining operations located in other areas have largely 
managed to sustain profitability.

The only option for conventional producers is to fundamentally restructure loss-making operations to address cash 
burn and create lower-cost profitable businesses that can sustain operations and secure employment as far as 
possible. 

IMPALA RUSTENBURG STRATEGIC REVIEW
Business optimisation
Impala Rustenburg has implemented a range of business improvement and cost reduction programmes over the past 
few years to mitigate losses from a sustained low platinum price and escalating costs, including the Phakamisa 
Rustenburg project initiated in January 2017. 

Key operational improvements realised during the 2018 financial year include:
- A much improved safety performance during the second half of the year
- Year-on-year operational performance improvements, including a 5% increase in tonnes milled per total 
  employee costed, a 1% improvement in PGE mill grade and a 2% increase in platinum ounces produced in concentrate
- A cost saving of R330 million, a 4% improvement in the real cost per platinum ounce produced in concentrate
  (excluding once-off restructuring costs), a net reduction of 2 100 employees and the removal of R2.8 billion 
  from the business plans for the next two financial years
- A six-year extension to the life of mine of 6 Shaft and improved shaft economics at 14 Shaft through ceasing 
  UG2 production and growing mechanised Merensky mining

However, notwithstanding the ongoing operational improvements achieved, Impala Rustenburg has continued to incur
significant cash losses. Substantial structural changes are therefore required to restore Impala Rustenburg to 
sustainable economic viability.

Transformational restructuring measures
To determine the most effective structural changes required to return Impala Rustenburg to profitability in the
prevailing platinum price environment, a strategic review was initiated in FY2018 and concluded that Impala 
Rustenburg must transition into a smaller, more focused operation positioned around its best assets. 
Operations will therefore cease at depleted, end-of-life and uneconomic shafts and future mining activity 
will be focused on profitable, lower-cost, high-value, longer-life assets.

In order to achieve this, key operational actions will be implemented: 
- 6, 10 and 11 shafts and E&F will continue to operate
- 16 and 20 shafts will be ramped up to design capacity and continue to operate at steady state thereafter
- 4 Shaft reserves have been depleted and mining operations ceased in FY2018
- 1 and 9 shafts are in decline with limited reserves remaining and will be harvested to reduce costs until 
  they are closed or sold in FY2019
- 12 and 14 shafts will continue to operate while disposal alternatives are investigated
- In the absence of viable commercial options, mining operations at 12 and 14 shafts will terminate in FY2020
- Underutilised mine infrastructure, utilities and services such as fridge plants and ventilation fans will be
  suspended to match the reduced production profile
- The number of operating milling circuits at the concentrator complex will reduce in line with lower 
  production volumes and one of the three furnaces at the smelting facility will be placed on care-and-maintenance 
  from FY2021
- Minor modifications will be effected to the acid plant circuit to maintain smelting efficiencies and continued
  treatment of planned toll-refining material
- Shared services and overhead labour will be reduced by a further 1 500 positions to achieve a fit-for-purpose
  lower-cost operating model

Restructuring impact and benefits
The structural changes at Impala Rustenburg will fundamentally reposition the business:
- Smaller focused operating footprint around the best shafts
  - Operating shafts reduce from 11 during FY2018 to six in FY2021
  - Operating shafts include the new generation 16 and 20 shafts, which will result in increased infrastructure
    efficiency and overall productivity
  - Production will decline to 520 000 ounces platinum per annum from FY2021, down from the previous guidance 
    of 750 000 ounces per annum
  - Full time employees and contractors will decline from 40 000 at the end of FY2018 to 27 000 from FY2021

- Robust life-of-mine plan
  - Targeting better areas of the ore body, PGE mill grade at selected shafts will increase from 4.09g/t 
    in FY2018 to 4.25g/t in FY2021, and the Merensky:UG2 ratio from 42% to 50%
  - Significant future optionality to extend the life of mine
  - Commercial transactions will be explored that could provide further upside potential

- Lower-cost operation
  - Real operating costs are expected to reduce from R25 100 per platinum ounce in FY2017, to less than 
    R22 000 per ounce in FY2021 (2018 terms) creating a more robust, lower-cost, cash-generating business 
    by FY2021
  - Cost improvement principally achieved through realising structural improvements in mining efficiency as 
    a result of discontinuing mining activity at high-cost operations and concentrating future activity at 
    more efficient lower cost operations
  - Realising a 25% increase in tonnes milled per total employee costed, a 5% improvement in PGM(6E) mill 
    grade and a 25% increase in Merensky ore content in FY2021 compared to FY2017
  - Further aided by the planned ramp-up at 16 and 20 shafts and additional cost-saving initiatives
  
- Reduced capital intensity
  - SIB capital expenditure expected to reduce from R2 800 per platinum ounce in FY2017 to less than 
    R2 000 per ounce in FY2021 (2018 terms)
  - Principally achieved through a significantly reduced operational footprint and newer future mining 
    infrastructure, which requires less ongoing SIB capital expenditure
  - Aided by the replacement capital expenditure programme at 16 and 20 shafts, which ends in FY2023

In its revised form, Impala Rustenburg will remain a key asset in the Group’s portfolio. Continual improvement 
in safety, productivity and cost efficiency will be pursued in addition to the structural changes. Any material 
changes in operating and business performance, or the pricing environment will be considered to further 
optimise the transformation strategy.

Mitigating social impact
As a southern African producer, Implats is fully committed to a socially responsible ethos and is sensitive to 
the potential impact of the strategic restructuring process at Impala Rustenburg on employment, local economic 
development and host communities. 

The restructuring process may potentially have an impact on 9 000 direct jobs and 4 000 contractor positions 
over the implementation period. While labour rationalisation is inevitable in a restructuring process of this 
nature, due care will be taken to ensure that forced job losses are minimised as far as possible through a range 
of job loss avoidance measures. These include the transfer of skills to vacant positions at the 16 and 20 growth 
shafts, reskilling, voluntary separation, business improvement and exploring commercial options to dispose of 
shafts that do not fit the long-term portfolio.

Where job losses are unavoidable, Impala Rustenburg remains committed to implementing the required changes in 
consultation with all its social partners. Discussions are already underway with key stakeholders, including 
government, relevant trade unions and community representatives with regard to this difficult transition to 
secure the future viability of the operation and preserve jobs as far as possible.

Successfully transforming the Impala Rustenburg operation will result in a cash-generating business by FY2021 in 
the current low metal price environment and the sustainable delivery of benefits to all its key stakeholders, 
including securing 27 000 jobs for the long term. 

GROUP FINANCIAL IMPACT
A material consequence of the declining profitability of the Impala Rustenburg operation has been the negative impact
on the Group’s balance sheet, which has weakened over the last year. This was further impacted by the inventory lockup 
following the fire at Number 5 furnace. Negative cash flows recorded at the operation in recent years and the capital 
investment to develop 16 and 20 shafts, have been funded from cash flows from other Group operations as well as 
external sources, including an equity raise and convertible bond issue totalling more than R10 billion. The Group’s 
cash position at the end of FY2018 has been further eroded by ongoing losses and once-off events, reducing the 
liquidity position of the Group and its ability to fund the operations in a sustained low platinum price environment. 
Returning Impala Rustenburg to profitability is critical for the Group to remain economically viable, to honour its 
obligations to providers of external capital and sustainably deliver benefits to all its stakeholders.

Funding plan
It is anticipated that the strategic review will take two years to implement, returning Impala Rustenburg to
profitability by FY2021 and resulting in approximately R2.7 billion once-off restructuring costs. Impala Rustenburg 
is expected to deliver ongoing negative operating cash flows over this period totalling some R4.0 billion. In addition 
to this funding requirement, the Group also has an obligation to settle the Marula BEE debt of R875 million, which 
falls due in FY2020. 

Implats has reviewed its existing financial resources to ensure the Group remains fully funded throughout the
implementation of the strategic review. Additional liquidity and headroom have been addressed through three components: 
- Forward sale
  Liquidity has been reduced by a build-up of approximately R3.8 billion in excess pipeline stocks following the
  Number 5 furnace fire. To address this, excess pipeline stock from FY2020 will be monetised early by means of 
  a forward sale to release approximately R2.0 billion in cash in FY2019, without impacting contractual deliveries 
  to customers.
- Revolving credit facilities
  Implats has revolving credit facilities (RCF) with its lender group totalling R4.0 billion, which are available 
  until FY2021. Implats has engaged with its lender group and they are supportive of the strategic review 
  implementation plan. (Discussions are under way to convert the existing bilateral facilities into a single 
  R4.0 billion RCF to further enhance headroom and flexibility).
- Group cash
  The Group is expected to have a positive cash balance in FY2018 and FY2019, supported by cash flow from other 
  Group operations. The cash position considers the payment of all debt obligations during this period, including 
  the repayment of the Marula BEE debt. Remaining Group debt is either serviced by operational cash flow at 
  subsidiary level (Zimplats) or is long-dated beyond the strategic review implementation period.
 
The combination of the forward sale, R4.0 billion in RCFs and Implats’ existing cash on hand of approximately 
R2.2 billion will be sufficient to fund the implementation of the strategic review. As the market and operating 
environment evolves, Implats will continue to review its funding strategy to ensure an efficient and effective 
capital structure is maintained. 

Following the implementation of the strategic review, all Group operations are anticipated to be profitable 
within the prevailing low platinum price environment. The Group is therefore expected to be in a fundamentally 
better position to deliver sustainable returns to all stakeholders over the long term.

CONCLUSION
The implementation of the strategic review outcomes will create a more focused Impala Rustenburg business centred
around its best assets with higher quality long-life ore bodies and lower operating costs and capital intensity. 
This will return the operation to profitability in a lower platinum price environment. 

In addition, the strategic review provides the following outcomes:
- Removes unprofitable platinum production from a well-supplied market
- Secures future optionality in a more positive pricing environment
- Provides value accretive commercial opportunities for Impala Rustenburg
- Secures 27 000 jobs at the operation in a low platinum price environment
- Ensures that local communities continue to participate in procurement, employment and other socio-economic
  opportunities over the long term
- Produces a more robust cash-generating business by 2021

The implementation of the strategic review will not only strengthen Impala Rustenburg’s position in the prevailing 
low platinum price environment, but will also significantly improve the strategic position of the Implats Group to
sustainably deliver improved returns to all stakeholders in the medium to long term.

IRS / IMPALA SALE OF BUSINESS

Introduction and rationale

Shareholders are advised of the sale of business between Implats’ subsidiaries Impala
Refining Services Limited (“IRS”) and Impala Platinum Limited (“Impala”), with effect from
1 July 2018.

IRS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Implats.

Implats holds 96% of the shares in Impala. Impala conducts mining operations, operates a
smelting plant near Phokeng, Rustenburg and a refinery for base and precious metals in
Springs. IRS does not own or operate any processing and/or refining assets, but have
agreements in place with Impala to process material acquired by IRS under contract through
their processing and refining facilities.

IRS’ principal business comprised the acquisition of platinum group metals for the extraction
and refining into deliverable products through a combination of metal purchase and toll
refining agreements.

In the furtherance of its business, IRS held a beneficiation licence in terms of the Precious
Metals Act, No 37 of 2005 (“the PMA”), which governs the acquisition, possession, smelting,
refining, beneficiation, use and disposal of precious metals in South Africa, as well as an
import permit to procure unwrought precious metals from its international customers.
During 2007 IRS engaged extensively with the Department of Minerals and Energy (the
“Regulator”) to obtain an understanding of the licences for which IRS should apply in terms
of the PMA, as it does not own or operate any precious metal mining, processing or refining
assets (a Precious Metals Beneficiation Licence versus a Precious Metals Refining Licence). It
was agreed with the Regulator that IRS should obtain a Precious Metals Beneficiation Licence
for its toll contracting business.

The Regulator informed IRS during 2016 that it would need to replace its Precious Metals
Beneficiation Licence with a Precious Metals Refining Licence. The requirements for the
submission and approval of a Precious Metals Refining Licence application include inter alia
compliance with the Mining Charter. IRS unsuccessfully applied for a Precious Metals Refining
License in December 2016 under the prevailing operating model where IRS utilised Impala’s
facilities, which company operates with a fully compliant Precious Metals Refining License.
Following extensive consultation, it was agreed that the most efficient manner in which IRS
could commercially meet the requirements to obtain a Precious Metals Refining Licence,
given its unique operating model, was to become a fully integrated division of Impala, which
already processes all the material acquired by IRS and conducts most of the regulatory and
administrative duties required in terms of the PMA. Not securing the required regulatory
approvals would preclude IRS from continuing to conduct its business as it would not be able
to secure the necessary permits to purchase material containing precious metals from its
customers.

The benefits of IRS becoming a division of Impala include:

-   Securing IRS business tenure through the Precious Metals Refining Licence held by Impala,
    subject to compliance to the terms and conditions of the PMA (including the Mining
    Charter requirements);
-   Simplifying the corporate structure and ongoing toll refining business model by combining
    IRS’ contract administration function and the processing/refining function through
    Impala’s facilities under the same corporate entity (Impala).
-   The Transaction does not have any adverse tax consequences for either IRS or Impala and
    will ensure efficient administration as IRS is currently administered by Impala;
-   IRS, as a division of Impala, is likely to benefit from the net Value-Added tax and income
    tax position of Impala thereafter.


Terms of the Transaction

Impala and IRS entered into a sale of business agreement (the “Transaction”) in terms of
which Impala acquired the metal purchase and toll refining operations of IRS as a going
concern, utilising the group roll-over relief provisions of sections 45 and 47 of the Income Tax
Act No. 58 of 1962.

The purchase consideration is payable by the creation of a loan account by Impala in favour
of IRS in an amount equal to the net purchase consideration and the assumption of certain
business liabilities of IRS by Impala.

Effective Date

The effective date of the Transaction is 1 July 2018.
Purchase Consideration

The total purchase consideration of the Transaction is R8 billion.

Conditions Precedent

The Transaction is no longer subject to the approval and/or waiver of any suspensive
conditions.

Value of the Transaction for the Group

At the end of June 2017 Impala had an assessed loss of circa R6.4 billion and unredeemed
capex of circa R9 billion which resulted in a tax shield of approximately R4.3 billion to Impala.
Where allowable, these benefits would be available for offset against future IRS profits.

Other Significant Terms

Warranties and other terms that are standard for transactions of this nature were agreed
amongst the parties to the Transaction.

The Transaction does not classify as a categorised transaction in terms of the JSE Listings
Requirements.

ZIMPLATS’ MINING LEASE AREA AND SECURITY OF TENURE - UPDATE
 
Implats has regularly kept the market informed of developments with regard to the Government of 
Zimbabwe’s (“Government”) intention to compulsorily acquire land measuring 27 948 hectares within 
its subsidiary Zimplats’ special mining lease area.   
 
Implats is pleased to advise that Zimplats has agreed to release to the Government land measuring 
23  903 hectares within Zimplats’ mining lease area in support of the Government’s efforts to enable 
participation by other investors in the platinum mining industry in Zimbabwe. Following this release 
of ground, Zimplats now holds two separate and non-contiguous pieces of land measuring in 
aggregate 24 632 hectares. Consequently, the operating subsidiary applied for and was granted with 
effect from 31 May 2018, two separate mining leases over the two pieces of land measuring 6 605 
hectares and 18 027 hectares, respectively. The smaller area hosts the historical Hartley mining area 
and Selous Metallurgical Complex, while the other hosts the Ngezi mining operations, including the 
future portal 10 mining area. These mining leases replace the special mining lease held by Zimplats, 
which was due for renewal in August 2019.  
 
The two mining leases issued to Zimplats’ operating subsidiary are valid for the life of mine of Zimplats’ 
mining operations and secure the operating subsidiary’s mining tenure.

Third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2018

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented: “Group tonnes milled improved by 17%
this quarter against the prior comparable period, and by 10% for the nine-month period ended 31
March 2018. Following operational issues affecting the smelter at Impala Rustenburg, which
resulted in lower refined volumes and the stockpiling of metal in concentrate, all Group furnaces
are now operational and making steady progress in processing the inventory build-up. Impala
Rustenburg and Marula have delivered encouraging results over the last quarter. Steps
implemented at the operations to improve production and cost performance are starting to deliver
positive results. However, the elimination of high-cost production at Impala Rustenburg remains
our key imperative and I am happy to report that good progress is being made with this operation’s
strategic review to align the business with our lower future metal prices outlook. The Zimplats,
Mimosa Two Rivers and Impala Refining Services (“IRS”) again delivered outstanding
performances during the period under review.”

SAFETY
Implats’ safety strategy remains firmly centred on inculcating a zero harm safe production culture.
This transformational journey to realise and sustain safe production across all operations is
supported by various initiatives targeting effective leadership and unwavering compliance by all to
our safe production practices. While many individual business units have made significant
progress, and continue to deliver exceptional safety performances, Impala Rustenburg remains a
key focus area.

Regrettably, during the quarter ended 31 March 2018, Impala Rustenburg recorded a winch
related fatal injury. Mr Kelebone Molikoe passed away at 10 Shaft on the 19 January 2018 after
having been struck by a return-rig snatch block. The Implats board and management team extend
their sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Molikoe.
PRODUCTION
Tonnes milled across the Group during the quarter ended 31 March 2018 increased by 17% to
4 593 000 tonnes, compared to 3 939 000 tonnes in the prior corresponding period. This increase
was largely as a result of a much stronger mining performance at Impala Rustenburg and Marula,
supported by sustained excellent mining contributions from all other operations.

In addition to the significantly increased mining volumes from Impala (16%) and Marula (100%),
both operations also improved mill grades, which increased by 4% and 12% respectively. This
increase in mill grade more than compensated for a planned lower mill grade from the Two Rivers
operation, which decreased by 6% period-on-period as a result of ongoing split-reef mining. As a
result, the mill grade across all the mining operations (managed and joint venture) increased by
3% to 3.87g/t (6E) during the quarter ended 31 March 2018.

Consequently, platinum in concentrate produced during the quarter across all the mining
operations increased by 7% to 309 000 ounces, compared to 290 000 ounces in the prior
corresponding period. Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018, the combined tonnes
milled for all operations increased by 10% to 14 537 000 tonnes. The average mill grade was
unchanged at 3.88g/t (6E) and platinum in concentrate increased by 4% to 987 000 ounces,
compared to 948 000 ounces produced in the prior corresponding period.

Platinum in concentrate received during the quarter ended 31 March 2018 from IRS third-party
and toll customers decreased by 26% to 37 000 ounces, but for the nine-month period ended 31
March 2018 there was an increase of 43% to 227 000 ounces.

Notwithstanding a much-improved operational performance, refined platinum production during
the quarter decreased by 5% to 316 000 ounces, compared to 331 000 ounces in the prior period.
This was a direct consequence of a temporary pipeline stock build-up at the Impala smelting
operation due to an electrical failure at the Number 5 furnace in February 2018.

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018, refined platinum production was similarly
impacted by furnace maintenance work commissioned during the first half of the financial year,
which was further impacted by the electrical failure experienced during February 2018.
Consequently, Group refined platinum production during the period decreased by 6% to 1 042 000
ounces, compared to 1 110 000 ounces during the prior corresponding period. The temporary
build-up in accumulated pipeline stocks over the nine-month period amounted to 153 000 ounces
at 31 March 2018.

Furnace 5 was successfully recommissioned during April 2018 and is expected to be back at full
production from May 2018. Despite having all three furnaces back in operation during the fourth
quarter of the financial year, it is now estimated that some 100 000 platinum ounces of
accumulated pipeline stocks will not be refined within the current financial year. In an effort to
moderate the negative cash flow impact, management has sold forward some accumulated stock
during January 2018 and will consider further mitigating measures on an ongoing basis.
Impala Rustenburg
Impala Rustenburg delivered an improved operational performance compared to the previous
corresponding period, which was negatively impacted by the 14 Shaft decline fire and 1 Shaft fall-
of-ground incident.

Tonnes milled during the quarter ended 31 March 2018 increased by 16% to 2 493 000 tonnes,
compared to 2 151 000 tonnes in the previous comparable period. The mill grade, which remains
impacted by ongoing rehabilitation work at 16 Shaft’s ore-pass system, nonetheless improved by
4% to 4.11g/t (6E).

Notwithstanding an aggregate 20% improvement in core mining performance (16% tonnes and
4% mill grade) during the quarter under review, platinum produced in concentrate only increased
by 6% to 151 000 ounces, compared to 143 000 ounces in the previous corresponding period.
This is largely because 15 000 ounces were produced from non-mining activities during the
previous comparable period (smelter reverts and other materials).

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018, tonnes milled increased by 14% to 8 163 000
tonnes. The mill grade decreased by 1% to 4.06g/t (6E) and platinum produced in concentrate
increased by 8% to 499 000 ounces, compared to 461 000 ounces in the prior corresponding
period.

Although there was an improvement in fundamental mining performance, refined platinum
production during the quarter ended 31 March 2018 decreased by 56% to 71 000 ounces from
160 000 ounces in the prior period. This was as a consequence of a temporary concentrate stock
build-up during the period as a result of an electrical failure at the Number 5 furnace.

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018, refined platinum production was similarly
impacted by furnace maintenance work commissioned during the first half of the financial year,
which was further impacted by the electrical failure experienced during February 2018.
Consequently, refined platinum production during the period under review decreased by 29% to
342 000 ounces, compared to 479 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. The temporary
build-up in accumulated pipeline stocks over the nine-month reporting period amounted to 153 000
ounces at 31 March 2018.

All three transformers at the Number 5 furnace were successfully replaced during the quarter
ended 31 March 2018 and the furnace was safely recommissioned during April 2018. It is now
estimated that, although the furnace will be back at full production during May 2018, some 100 000
platinum ounces of pipeline stocks accumulated before the April 2018 recommissioning will not be
refined within the current financial year.

As a result, the full-year refined platinum guidance for Impala Rustenburg is revised to
approximately 560 000 ounces platinum.
Zimplats
Zimplats delivered a pleasing operational performance during the period under review. Tonnes
milled increased by 6% during the quarter to 1 659 000 tonnes, compared to 1 567 000 tonnes in
the prior corresponding period. The mill grade was largely maintained during the period at 3.48g/t
(6E), which resulted in platinum produced in concentrate increasing by 5% to 69 000 ounces,
compared to 65 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018 increased by 2% to 4 992 000
tonnes, compared to 4 872 000 tonnes in the prior corresponding period. Platinum produced in
concentrate during this period similarly improved by 2% to 208 000 ounces from 204 000 ounces
in the previous comparable period.

The full-year production guidance for the operation is maintained at 255 000 to 265 000 ounces
platinum in concentrate but is expected to be near the top end of the guided range.

Marula
Marula delivered a strong operational turnaround following a restructuring process implemented
at the end of the 2017 financial year. The period under review saw a notable decline in community
disruptions compared to the prior comparable period, which was significantly impacted by protest
action. As a consequence, tonnes milled during the quarter ended 31 March 2018 were almost
double compared to the previous corresponding period, increasing to 441 000 tonnes from
221 000 tonnes. The mill grade improved by 12% during the quarter to 4.12g/t (6E), which resulted
in platinum produced in concentrate increasing by 122% to 20 000 ounces, compared to 9 000
ounces in the prior period.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018 increased by 22% to 1 382 000
tonnes, compared to 1 131 000 tonnes in the corresponding period. Platinum produced in
concentrate improved by 21% to 63 000 ounces, compared to 52 000 ounces in the prior period.

The full-year production guidance for the operation is maintained at 80 000 to 90 000 ounces
platinum in concentrate.

Mimosa
Mimosa delivered another good performance during the period under review. Tonnes milled
during the period improved by 1% to 675 000 tonnes, while the mill grade reduced by 1% to 3.82g/t
(6E) and platinum produced in concentrate remained unchanged at 30 000 ounces.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018 increased by 2% to 2 081 000
tonnes, compared to 2 036 000 tonnes in the prior period. Platinum produced in concentrate
similarly improved by 2% to 93 000 ounces, compared to 91 000 ounces in the prior period.

The full-year production guidance for the operation is maintained at 115 000 to 120 000 ounces
platinum in concentrate.
Two Rivers
Operational performance at Two Rivers was impacted by continued lower-grade split-reef mining
during the period under review. Tonnes milled during the quarter increased by 1% to 878 000
tonnes, compared to 868 000 tonnes in the prior comparable period. However, mill grade was
significantly impacted and decreased by 6% to 3.56g/t (6E). This, in turn, resulted in platinum
produced in concentrate declining by 7% to 40 000 ounces, compared to 43 000 ounces in the
prior corresponding period.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018 decreased by 1% to 2 592 000
tonnes, while the mill grade during the period decreased by 8% to 3.65g/t (6E). Consequently,
platinum produced in concentrate during the period decreased by 12% to 123 000 ounces, from
140 000 ounces in the prior comparable period.

The full-year production guidance for the operation is maintained at 165 000 to 175 000 ounces
platinum in concentrate, and is expected to be at the lower end of the guided range.

IRS
Platinum in concentrate received during the quarter from IRS third-party and toll customers
decreased by 26% to 37 000 ounces, which was in line with planned lower deliveries over the
Christmas period. Notwithstanding, receipts for the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018
increased by 43% to 227 000 ounces.

Refined platinum production for the quarter was 43% higher than the previous period at 245 000
ounces. Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2018, refined platinum production increased
by 11% to 700 000 ounces, compared to 631 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period. This
was largely as a result of increased toll refining receipts during the period.

The full-year production guidance for the operation is maintained at 250 000 to 260 000 ounces
platinum receipts in concentrate from third party customers, and is expected to be near the top
end of the guided range.

OUTLOOK
While Implats’ operational performance has shown good improvement over the nine-month period
ended 31 March 2018, furnace challenges experienced during the period will unfortunately inhibit
all the platinum produced in concentrate during the period from being fully refined before the
financial year-end. Consequently, refined platinum guidance for the Group is revised to 1 460 000
ounces from 1 500 000 ounces previously guided, with accumulated above normal pipeline stocks
projected to be some 100 000 ounces platinum at the end of the current financial year.

The Group’s operating cost is expected to be between R23 600 and R24 200 per platinum ounce
on a stock-adjusted basis for the full financial year, with Group capital expenditure forecast at
R4.6 to R4.8 billion for the current financial year.
The third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2018 has not been
reviewed and reported on by the external auditors of Implats.

Commentary

INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Introduction
The Implats Group has delivered an improved performance at most operations for the half-year ended 31 December 2017,
but regrettably mourns the loss of six employees through work-related incidents.

Gross platinum in concentrate production for the Group increased by 13.3%, supported by a 7.4% increase in run-of-mine
tonnes milled and higher deliveries from third-party toll refining customers. After toll treated material was returned
to third-party customers, concentrate production was unchanged. Refined metal production was impacted by extensive
maintenance to the number 5 furnace at the Impala Rustenburg smelting complex. As a result, gross refined platinum 
production decreased by 6.7% to 726 700 ounces, relative to 778 500 ounces in the comparable period.

The reduction in refined platinum ounces produced, combined with metal returns to third-party toll refining customers,
resulted in a decline of 11.2% in platinum ounces sold to 648 800 ounces, compared with 730 700 ounces in the previous 
comparable period. This was offset by a 4.2% increase in the rand basket price, lower third-party concentrate purchases 
by Impala Refining Services (IRS), and a modest 4.2% inflationary increase in cash operating costs resulting in a total 
revenue of R17.28 billion, cost of sales of R16.55 billion, and a gross profit of R733 million for the period, compared 
to a gross loss of R139 million for the prior comparable period.

A significantly higher ""additional profits tax"" provision by Zimplats increased the tax charge period-on-period by
R250 million, which was largely responsible for the Group recording a R164 million loss after tax compared to a profit 
before tax for the six months ended 31 December 2017. Cash generated from operations before changes in working capital 
improved from R2.0 billion in the comparable period to R2.9 billion for the period under review. However, net cash 
decreased by some R3.5 billion during the period under review, largely due to R1.9 billion used in investing 
activities and a R3.5 billion inventory cash outflow.

Gross cash at the end of the period amounted to R4.2 billion. In addition, the Group has committed (unutilised)
banking facilities of R4.0 billion available until June 2021.

Market fundamentals for platinum remain muted. An industrial market deficit of some 230 000 platinum ounces recorded
in calendar year 2017 is expected to revert in the short term to a balanced market due to lower requirements from the
automotive, jewellery and investment sectors. However, fundamentals for both palladium and rhodium are robust with
significant demand growth expected over the next few years from the automotive sector. The rand revenue per platinum 
ounce sold for the period under review benefited from the improved palladium and rhodium fundamentals, recording a 
4.2% increase from the prior corresponding period to average R25 968 per platinum ounce. 

The first half of the year was characterised by an ongoing focus on the Group's strategic response to the persistently
low PGM prices with a view to improving business performance, with a particular emphasis on Impala. To this end, a
strategic review of the operation was announced at the Group's full-year results in September 2017, which is actively
advancing measures to refocus or close unprofitable areas and rebase the overhead cost structure as soon as practically
possible. Through this process, the Group aims to return Impala to profitability in a sustained low PGM price environment. 

In addition, the Group succeeded in effecting a strong operational turnaround at Marula and acquired a 15% interest in
the Waterberg project during the period under review with an option to increase its stake to 50.01%.

Group safety review
Regrettably, five employees at Impala Rustenburg and one at Marula suffered fatal injuries at our operations during
the six months ended 31 December 2017. Following the end of the reporting period, another employee was fatally injured at
Impala Rustenburg during January 2018. The Implats board and management team express their sincere condolences to their
families and friends.

The Company will continue to provide support to the dependants of the deceased. Management, in collaboration with
officials from the representative union (AMCU), the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and the board health and safety
sub-committee instituted a number of leadership workshops and independent assessments to determine the root causes of each
incident as well as the overall decline in safety performance.

Safe production remains our top priority. Many individual business units across the Group continue to deliver
exceptional safety performance, setting new records. Currently, Implats has nine ""safety millionaire"" shafts and units 
(units which have operated more than a million shifts without a fatality). Seven have operated for more than two years 
without a fatal incident, five have achieved more than four years, and two have worked for more than 15 years without 
a fatal incident. Our strategic focus will be on an improved safety performance at Marula and Impala Rustenburg in 
particular.

Group operational review
The Group achieved encouraging period-on-period operational improvements over the past six months. Tonnes milled
increased by 7.4% from 9.3 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period to 9.9 million tonnes. Increased production
volumes from operations were supported by higher deliveries from third-party toll refining customers yielding an 13.3%
increase in platinum in concentrate from 766 200 ounces to 867 800 ounces. Very pleasing in particular was a 9.4% increase 
in platinum in concentrate contribution from Impala Rustenburg, which produced 348 300 ounces compared to 318 400 ounces 
in the prior corresponding period.

The unscheduled maintenance at Impala number 5 furnace resulted in a significant build-up of pipeline stock and a 6.7%
decline in refined platinum ounces produced to 726 700 ounces, compared to 778 500 ounces in the comparable period.

Managed operations
IMPALA 
Improved operational efficiencies achieved during the first quarter of the financial year were negatively impacted by
mine stoppages emanating from five fatal incidents recorded at the operation during September and October 2017.
Notwithstanding, mill throughput increased by 12.4% to 5.7 million tonnes from the previous comparable period (H1 FY2017: 
5.0 million), which was impacted by the temporary closure of the 14 Shaft decline section due to an underground fire and 
a reduction in some UG2 panel lengths following a fall-of-ground incident at 1 Shaft. The higher milled production is 
largely as a result of 14 Shaft ramping up after the fire (+480 000 tonnes), the 16 Shaft ramp-up (+255 000 tonnes), and
performance improvements at 11, 12 and 1 Shafts (+191 000 tonnes). This was offset to some extent by declining production 
from old shafts (-392 000 tonnes) and weaker performances at 10 and 20 Shafts following safety incidents (-19 000 tonnes).

The PGE mill head grade deteriorated to 4.05 g/t (H1 FY2017: 4.15 g/t), largely due to planned rehabilitation work on
the ""C"" ore pass system at 16 Shaft and a 2.9 kilometre (25%) increase in lower-grade reef development to increase
mining face length. Rehabilitation of the ""C"" ore pass system necessitated dilution of reef with waste feed in the 
remaining reef passes. The reduction in grade partially offset the increase in mill throughput, resulting in a net 
9.4% increase in platinum ounce in concentrate production to 348 300 ounces (H1 FY2017: 318 400 ounces).

During the period, a major unscheduled furnace rebuild was undertaken on one of the three operating furnaces at the
smelting complex, which was necessitated by excessive wear. The build-up of pipeline stocks at Impala, amounting 
to some 75 000 ounces of platinum, was directly as a result of the furnace maintenance and resulted in refined platinum
production declining 14.7% to 271 900 ounces (H1 FY2017: 318 700 ounces).

The increased production volumes, together with inflation, resulted in cash costs increasing by 11.3% to R8.27 billion
(H1 FY2017: R7.43 billion). However, the increase in pipeline stocks and consequent lower refined metal output resulted
in unit costs increasing by 30.5% to R30 405 per platinum ounce refined (H1 FY2017: R23 304). On a stock-adjusted
basis, unit costs increased by only 2.2% to R23 822 per platinum ounce refined, supported by higher levels of production. 

Capital expenditure increased by 20.5% to R1.44 billion (H1 FY2017: R1.20 billion), of which R345 million was spent on
the two major replacement shafts, 16 and 20 Shafts. Combined, these two shafts are scheduled to produce approximately
310 000 ounces of platinum from 2022.

Project progress at 16 Shaft remains largely on schedule. However, immediately mineable face length at the end of the
reporting period was 1 085 metres, 22% below plan. Underground development is being accelerated to address this
shortfall. The number of stoping teams has increased to 59 against a plan of 63 and stoping team productivity averaged 
331 m2 per team against a planned rate of 334 m2 per team. The rate of production at the end of the period was in line 
with the project plan at 1.38 million tonnes per annum.

Challenging geological conditions and safety interruptions following a fatal incident at 20 Shaft have impacted the
project. Immediately mineable face length at the end of the reporting period was 1 599 metres, 15% below plan. The number
of stoping teams has increased to 54 against a plan of 58 and stoping team productivity averaged 251 m2 per team against
a planned rate of 327 m2 per team. Geological conditions resulted in an abnormally high panel loss ratio (26%) during
the period, which, together with the impact of the safety stoppage, affected team productivity. Consequently, the overall
rate of production at the end of the period was 8% below the plan of 1.2 million tonnes per annum.

Impala is focused on returning the business to profitability in a sustained low PGM price environment. To this end 
a number of initiatives have been implemented to improve productivity and lower costs, including a Section 189 labour
restructuring process as announced in September 2017. The labour restructuring resulted in a reduction of 1 400 employees 
by the end of the reporting period and will realise an annual saving of R350 million. In addition, a strategic review of
all the business units and overhead structures at Impala was initiated and is interrogating the investment case and
sustainability of individual shafts across the operation. The review includes a specific focus on optimising the cost 
base, which may lead to further responses, such as harvesting and/or closing certain shafts.

The leadership team has been strengthened with the appointment of Mark Munroe as Chief Executive of this operational
unit. He has been specifically tasked to lead the strategic review at Impala Rustenburg and drive performance
improvements in safety, efficiencies, cost and capital project execution at the operation.

Subsequent to the end of the period under review, in February 2018, an electrical failure at the Impala Rustenburg
smelting complex triggered a fire at the number 5 furnace transformers. Repairs to the transformers are well advanced 
and it is anticipated the production interruption will be approximately 10 weeks. In the interim, furnaces 3 and 4 are
treating Impala's run-of-mine production. However, with the number 5 furnace not available for some time, contingency 
capacity is constrained and, as a result, approximately 60 000 platinum ounces of pipeline stocks are not expected 
to be refined within the financial year, which will impact cash flow in this financial year.

IMPALA REFINING SERVICES (IRS) 
IRS once again contributed significantly to the Group's bottom line, despite persistently low PGM prices. Refined
platinum production was maintained at 454 800 ounces (H1 FY2017: 459 800 ounces). 

Platinum receipts from mine-to-market operations, at 317 000 ounces, were lower than the prior comparable period 
(H1 FY2017: 330 000 ounces), on the back of lower receipts from Two Rivers. Third-party purchased receipts decreased 
from 108 000 platinum ounces in the prior period to 86 000 ounces. A further 104 000 ounces were toll refined for 
a customer.

ZIMPLATS 
Tonnes milled remained consistent with the prior comparable period at 3.3 million tonnes (H1 FY2017: 3.3 million
tonnes) with all mining units sustaining exceptional operational performances. Platinum in matte production, 
inclusive of concentrates sold to IRS, was similarly in line with the prior performance at 136 200 ounces 
(H1 FY2017: 137 100 ounces).

Unit costs increased by 8.4% in dollar terms to US$1 336 per platinum ounce in matte (H1 FY2017: US$1 233), while 
in rand terms unit costs increased by only 3.4% to R17 900 per platinum ounce in matte (H1 FY2017: R17 316), due 
to a stronger rand exchange rate over the period. 

The redevelopment of the Bimha Mine remains on schedule to reach full production in April 2018, while development 
of the 2.2 million tonnes per annum Mupani Mine is progressing according to plan and is targeting ore contact by 
May 2020, and full production from August 2025.

The new political dispensation in Zimbabwe is regarded as a positive development. Implats supports and shares
Zimbabwe's aspirations to grow and diversify its PGM industry and continues to engage with the Government of 
Zimbabwe regarding its plans.

MARULA 
Marula delivered a strong operational turnaround following a restructuring process implemented prior to the start of
the financial year. The period under review saw a significant decline in community disruptions, mitigated by continued
engagement processes by the Marula team and an intervention with the assistance of the DMR seeking to resolve the
community chrome dispute. Agreement was secured from all stakeholders through this process to restart the chrome 
project in January 2018.

The operational recovery was impacted by safety stoppages following a fatal incident at the main underground operation
during the second quarter of the financial year. Tonnes milled increased by 3.5% to 941 000 tonnes (H1 FY2017: 909 000
tonnes), while the PGE head grade deteriorated marginally to 4.36 g/t (H1 FY2017: 4.42 g/t). As a consequence, platinum
in concentrate production was maintained at 43 200 ounces (H1 FY2017: 43 100 ounces), despite a reduction in total
employees of some 800 people following the restructuring process.

On the back of this performance, unit costs were contained to a 3.7% increase at R24 954 per platinum ounce in
concentrate (H1 FY2017: R24 060). Capital expenditure amounted to some R29 million for the period under review 
(H1 FY2017: R58 million).

Although the overall improvement in production and financial performance at Marula is encouraging, continued
uninterrupted and profitable production is necessary to secure the future of the operation.

Non-managed operations 
MIMOSA 
Mimosa delivered another strong operational performance. Tonnes milled improved by 2.9% to 1.41 million tonnes 
(H1 FY2017: 1.37 million tonnes), and the PGE head grade was maintained at 3.85 g/t. This resulted in platinum in 
concentrate production increasing by 3.4% to 63 000 ounces (H1 FY2017: 60 900 ounces). Unit costs decreased by 3.9% 
in dollar terms to US$1 479 per platinum ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2017: US$1 539).

The envisaged export levy on ""unbeneficiated"" platinum has been restructured and deferred by the Government of
Zimbabwe to 1 January 2019. Mimosa continues to consult with the Government of Zimbabwe on a range of important 
investment and regulatory considerations and remains confident that a mutually beneficial outcome can be secured. 

TWO RIVERS 
The operational performance at Two Rivers was impacted by the planned mining of low-grade split-reef areas during the
period under review. Tonnes milled during the first half of the financial year decreased by 1.9% to 1.71 million tonnes,
compared to 1.75 million tonnes milled during the prior comparable period, which included 58 700 tonnes milled at a
neighbouring mine.

The PGE head grade was significantly lower at 3.70 g/t (H1 FY2017: 4.03 g/t) and platinum in concentrate production
consequently reduced by 13.8% to 83 400 ounces (H1 FY2017: 96 700 ounces). As a result of the lower concentrate
production, unit costs increased by 20.7% to R14 688 per platinum ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2017: R12 172). The 
operation has initiated a project to secure improved capacity to maintain its platinum production profile while 
mining split reef.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
There has been no material change to the technical assumptions, assessment criteria, and information relating to the
Group's Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, as disclosed in the integrated report for the financial year
ended 30 June 2017. 

The revised Implats Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve statement, as at 30 June 2018, will provide the detailed
updated estimates.

Financial review
Revenue, at R17.3 billion for the half-year ended 31 December 2017, was R1.2 billion or 6.5% lower than the
comparative six months as a result of: 
- A negative volume variance of R2.1 billion. Sales volumes declined due to the full rebuild of the number 5 furnace.
  Smelter stocks increased significantly period-on-period, but were offset to some extent by a draw down of the refinery
- A positive dollar metal price variance of R1.7 billion resulting from the average dollar revenue per platinum ounce
  sold, of US$1 935, being US$160 or 9.0% higher than the previous comparative period. The average prices achieved for
  palladium, rhodium and nickel were 38.0%, 72.0% and 4.1% higher. Platinum was 6.8% lower. 
- A negative R765 million exchange rate variance resulting from the average rand-dollar exchange rate of 
  R13.42/US$ being approximately 4.4% stronger than the R14.04/US$ achieved during the prior comparable period. 

The resultant rand revenue per platinum ounce sold rose by 4.2% to R25 968. 

Cost of sales, at R16.5 billion, decreased by R2.1 billion from the comparable six months. The main contributors to
this decrease were: 
- The full rebuild of number 5 furnace at Impala Rustenburg resulted in a significant build-up of stock in the 
  period under review. The impact was a R2.4 billion additional decrease in cost of sales due to higher inventory levels. 
- A R702 million decrease in the cost of metals purchased was due to lower volumes purchased by IRS from third-party
  concentrate customers.
- The decreases described above were partially offset by an increase in cash operating costs of R1.1 billion to 
  R12.5 billion. After taking into account higher levels of production at Impala Rustenburg (9.4%) and once-off 
  voluntary separation costs, the increase in cash operating costs was contained at mining inflation of 4.2%, comprising 
  South African operations mining inflation of 6.2%, and Zimplats rand deflation of 3.3%. 

As a result of the above, the Group generated a gross profit for the period of R733 million (H1 2017: R139 million
gross loss). 

The Group made a R193 million profit before tax, an improvement on the comparable period's pre-tax loss of 
R238 million. The improvement was achieved despite a negative impact from a fair value adjustment on IRS creditors 
of R296 million due to an increase in metal prices at the end of the period, and once-off insurance proceeds of 
R330 million in the prior period. 

Significantly higher ""additional profits tax"" payable by Zimplats increased the tax charge period-on-period by 
R250 million, which was largely responsible for the R164 million loss after tax compared to a profit before tax 
for the six months ended 31 December 2017 (H1 2017: R328 million after tax loss). 

Cash generated from operations (before changes in working capital) improved from R2.0 billion to R2.9 billion. 
An increase in the value of inventories of R3.5 billion was largely responsible for the negative cash from operations 
of R249 million (after changes in working capital). The increase in inventories, as reflected on the balance sheet, 
was affected by net realisable value adjustments. 

Taking into account further planned smelter maintenance, and the extra build-up in the pipeline post period end due to
the transformer fire referred to in the Impala operational review, it is expected that the build-up of inventory will
be realised over the next 18 months. To alleviate constraints on cash, given that the bulk of the cash operating costs
have been incurred, it was deemed prudent to forward sell some of the metals in the pipeline. In this regard, the Group
realised almost R1 billion in January 2018. 

Some R400 million was spent during the period to acquire a 15% stake in the Waterberg project. 

Capital expenditure amounted to R1.9 billion, of which R345 million was spent on 16 and 20 Shafts. 

Gross cash at the end of the period under review amounted to R4.2 billion. Debt (excluding leases but including the
cross currency interest rate swap) amounted to R8.0 billion resulting in net debt at 31 December 2017 of R3.8 billion
(June 2017: R332 million net debt). 

In addition, the Group has committed (unutilised) banking facilities of R4.0 billion which are available until June
2021. This excludes the Zimplats-specific facilities. 

Given the continued cash conservation strategy, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the 
six months ended 31 December 2017. 

Market review (calendar years unless otherwise stated).
The platinum and palladium markets experienced fundamental industrial deficits of approximately 230 000 ounces and 
720 000 ounces respectively during 2017. However, the outlook and sentiment for these metals are profoundly different. 
The platinum deficit is expected to revert in the short term to a balanced market due to lower requirements from the
automotive, jewellery and investment sectors. Significant deficits for palladium are expected to be sustained over 
this period on the back of increased usage in the automotive sector.

Platinum ended 2017 at US$927 per ounce, 2% higher than the opening LBMA trade price, and on average traded at 
US$946 per ounce over the year, which was 4% lower than in 2016 (2016: US$987 per ounce). This was largely in response 
to a fall in Chinese jewellery demand, lower Japanese investment demand, and growing negative diesel sentiment in 
the important Western European automotive sector, which was partially offset by growing industrial demand.

In contrast, palladium ended the year at US$1 056 per ounce, 54% higher than the opening LBMA trade price, and 
on average traded at US$869 per ounce over the year, which was 42% higher than in 2016 (2016: US$613 per ounce). 
Despite further exchange traded fund (ETF) liquidations, persistently strong fundamentals from the North American 
and Chinese automotive sector continue to support palladium's price performance, while speculative purchasing in 
China is also likely to have played a part.

The rhodium price more than doubled in 2017, increasing by US$945 per ounce during the year. The price closed the 
year at US$1 715 per ounce, some 123% higher than it opened on Johnson Matthey London trade. The metal traded at 
US$1 109 per ounce on average over the year, 60% higher than in 2016 (2016: US$694 per ounce). Rhodium prices were 
driven by strong fundamentals, especially from the automotive sector (in response to ""real driving"" emissions testing 
in Western Europe, as well as China 5 emission standards) and the chemical industry. 

2017 was another positive year for the automotive industry, with global light-duty vehicle sales estimated to have
reached 95.3 million units (up 2.4% from 2016) on the back of growth in Western Europe, China, Eastern Europe and Latin
America. This offset a slight loss in the United States (US) where light-duty vehicle sales reached 17.2 million units, 
a 1.9% decline from 2016. Even though US sales were lower, automakers sold more sport-utility vehicles, crossovers and
pick-ups, which are more heavily loaded with palladium and rhodium. However, concerns remain that rising interest rates
could restrict credit availability this year, and a further decline in the US market to below 16 million units is
anticipated for 2018. 

Western European light-duty vehicle sales held up better than expected during 2017, reaching 14.3 million units, a
2.5% increase from 2016. However, the news was not positive for platinum, as the diesel share in this market continues to
decline due to sustained anti-diesel sentiment. Nonetheless, battery electric vehicles have yet to make any significant
inroads into the gap created by the decline in diesel, as consumers in this region are switching to gasoline, thereby
compounding CO2 compliance issues and palladium deficits.

Chinese light-duty vehicle sales recorded 1.5% year-on-year growth, reaching 24.7 million units, a positive for both
palladium and rhodium demand. Japanese auto sales topped 5 million units for the first time in two years and increased
for the first time in three years. New auto sales in Japan rose by 5.3% during 2017 to 5.23 million units, led by new
minicar models. 

Stronger vehicle sales favoured palladium as more gasoline engines were sold. Historically, lower palladium prices,
coupled with abundant Russian stocks, encouraged automakers and coaters to significantly engineer platinum out of gasoline
and some diesel catalyst systems. However, the market is beginning to seriously consider the overreliance on palladium,
and there is increasing research by both automakers and coaters into the reverse substitution of platinum in gasoline
three-way catalysts. There is already evidence that platinum is being reintroduced into some diesel systems, where it 
had been partially engineered out. 
 
The Chinese platinum jewellery market remains challenged. Retail sales dropped by approximately 5.5% last year, 
after an 8.3% decline in 2016. However, the latest data from the Platinum Guild International (PGI) indicates that the
quarter-on-quarter contraction during 2017 is slowing and some PGI partner stores have started to show growth again. 
The Indian market was particularly strong during 2017 with sales growing by approximately 35% during the year. The 
latest figures from the US market show healthy sales on the back of ongoing PGI initiatives. Retail sales growth 
in the US is expected to surpass the PGI's upper forecast of 7% for 2017. The Japanese market continues to be 
challenged by the currently fashionable yellow gold trends, and the market may not reach the 2% PGI growth forecast 
for 2017. Overall, platinum jewellery demand is expected to be flat year-on-year.

As in 2016, the low prices of platinum and rhodium during the first half of 2017 generated additional industrial
interest in these metals. The main drivers for this growth were the glass and chemical sectors. In contrast, 
increasing palladium prices affected industrial requirements, with substitution and thrifting resulting in lower 
palladium demand in the sector during the year. 

Physical investment in small platinum bars was down in Japan year-on-year, but still accounted for net sales of 
some 150 000 platinum ounces in 2017.

The platinum and palladium ETFs followed different paths during 2017. Platinum ETFs grew by 107 000 ounces, driven 
by lower prices, while palladium ETFs liquidated 376 000 ounces, mainly due to profit taking. This was the third
consecutive year in which palladium ETFs experienced large liquidations, with the aggregate holding now becoming 
constrained in supporting future market deficits. 

The platinum paper markets (NYMEX/TOCOM) declined by 142 000 ounces during 2017, highlighting a bearish price outlook
for the metal. In contrast, palladium was the beneficiary of renewed speculative interest, with signs of growing
physical market tightness supporting a 1.13 million ounce increase in long positions during 2017.

The market fundamentals for palladium and rhodium were particularly strong during 2017 and are projected to remain
robust during 2018. In contrast, market fundamentals for platinum remain muted, with new heavy-duty diesel emission
regulations and South African supply cuts only anticipated to materially impact market fundamentals from 2020. We 
expect the platinum market to be balanced during 2018, with a significant deficit of more than 1 million ounces in 
the palladium market underpinned by greater usage in gasoline catalyst systems and lower ETF liquidations. The rhodium 
market is forecast to be in a declining surplus, moving into a fundamental deficit, as both the automotive and 
industrial sectors consume more metal.

Strategic response
The Implats strategy is aimed at improving the Group's competitive position and profitability in a sustained 
low metal price environment.

Key focus areas include:
- Improved operational performance at Impala Rustenburg and an ongoing strategic review to assess optimal future
  positioning in a low price environment.
- Ensuring profitability of the Marula mine or the suspension of operations.
- Enhancing the relative industry cost position of the Group's conventional mining operations.
- Optimised performance and profitability at low-cost Group assets.
- Developing a long-term portfolio of lower-cost, shallow, mechanisable assets.

To this end, measures to enhance improvements and strengthen the Group's strategic response have been introduced,
specifically at Impala Rustenburg where the transition to a more concentrated, lower-cost operation remains our 
most pressing priority. The strategic review, which was announced at the Group's full-year results in September 
2017, is critically assessing the investment case of each shaft within the prevailing metal price environment, 
with the intention of refocusing or closing unprofitable areas and rebasing the overhead cost structure as soon 
as practically possible. This may lead to some shafts being closed or harvested sooner than originally planned.
Through this process, Impala remains focused on returning the business to profitability in a low PGM price 
environment.

Actions taken at Impala in the period under review include:
- 4 Shaft suspended from January 2018.
- 1 Shaft, 9 Shaft and 12 Shaft being harvested with effect from January 2018.
- 10, 11 and 14 Shaft optimisation projects initiated during the review period.
- Section 189 restructuring process announced in September 2017.

As a result of these actions, it is estimated the operation will improve cash flow by more than R1 billion over the
next two years. However, the production outlook for 2018 will be negatively impacted by both early closure and harvesting
of some shafts, as well as the slower ramp up of 20 Shaft. Full-year guidance has reduced from approximately 700 000
platinum ounces to between 650 000 and 670 000 platinum ounces for the financial year. Further work over the next few
months will prioritise additional cost and efficiency improvements and longer-term life-of-mine (LOM) profiles for each 
shaft in line with the revised operating mandate. There will be an intense focus on rebasing the support infrastructure 
and associated cost base to sustain the resulting LOM profile at the operation.

At Marula, restructuring processes implemented prior to the start of the financial year have already delivered an
improved cost and operational performance. Tonnes milled per employee costed, has improved significantly from 392 tonnes 
per annum during the prior corresponding period to 485 tonnes for the period under review. Similarly, the operation has
recovered from a gross loss of some R173 million in the prior corresponding period, to record a gross profit of 
R68 million during the half year ended 31 December 2017. Further work over the next few months will prioritise: measures 
to bed down improvements; securing operational continuity; and acquiring additional tailings deposition capacity 
(required from 2020).

Longer term, the acquisition of a minority interest in the Waterberg development project, with the option to acquire
majority ownership on completion of the feasibility study, has advanced the Group's stated strategy to diversify the
asset portfolio from deep, labour-intensive conventional operations. In addition, the changing political dispensation 
in Zimbabwe is being assessed and may offer further opportunities to the Group.

IRS remains an important strategic advantage and the Group will continue to seek further opportunities to build on its
successful business model, leveraging spare processing capacity within the Group. 

Prospects 
The challenges and uncertainties confronting the South African PGM industry remain significant. The market fundamentals 
for platinum are only expected to strengthen materially from 2020 onwards, with the introduction of stricter heavy-duty 
diesel emission regulations, and with supply from South Africa starting to taper off. However, the market fundamentals 
for palladium and rhodium remain robust, supported by growing gasoline automotive demand, and the introduction of real 
driving emissions in Western Europe and China 5 emission standards. The Group, therefore, expects large fundamental 
deficits for palladium to be sustained well into the future, with platinum trading in a balanced market near term, and
rhodium availability becoming increasingly constrained.

As a consequence, dollar metal prices should remain positive for palladium and rhodium, while platinum is likely to
remain muted. This view will support near-term rand metal prices, but political changes in South Africa are likely to
support the local currency (ZAR), which in turn will impact on rand metal basket prices. We are therefore working on 
the premise that the PGM rand basket could remain flat over the remainder of 2018 and 2019.

With the rand basket price expected to remain low, Implats will continue to prioritise measures to achieve safe
production, lower operating costs, preserve cash, enhance productivity, and restore profitability at all operations. 
The new 2022 convertible bond, listed in late July 2017, will enable the redemption of the old 2018 bond and will 
provide approximately R2 billion in additional liquidity.

Further measures to bed down improvements and strengthen the Group's strategic response have been introduced, 
specifically at Impala Rustenburg where the transition to a more concentrated, lower-cost operation remains 
our most pressing priority. The strategic review, announced at the Group's full-year results in September 2017, 
is actively advancing measures to refocus or close unprofitable areas, and rebase the overhead cost structure at 
the operation as soon as practically possible. This may lead to shafts being harvested and/or closed sooner than 
originally planned. Through this process, a return to profitability in a low metal price environment is being 
targeted for both the managed South African operations. 

Full-year production estimates are revised as follows:
- Rustenburg        650 000 - 670 000 platinum ounces in concentrate

The directors of the Company are responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and the preparation of
the interim financial statements and related information in a manner that fairly presents the state of the affairs of
the Company. These interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and incorporate full and responsible disclosure in line with the accounting policies of the Group which are 
supported by prudent judgements and estimates.

The interim financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the chief financial officer, 
Ms B Berlin, CA(SA).

The directors are also responsible for the maintenance of effective systems of internal control which are based on
established organisational structure and procedures. These systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance as 
to the reliability of the financial statements, and to prevent and detect material misstatement and loss.

The interim financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis as the directors believe that the Company
and the Group will continue to be in operation in the foreseeable future.

Independent Auditor's Review Report On Interim Financial Statements

To the Shareholders of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited in 
the accompanying interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 
31 December 2017 and the related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows for the six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

Directors' Responsibility for the Interim Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial
Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review in
accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed 
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance 
with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical 
requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and
applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these
interim financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited for the six months ended 31 December 2017 
are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 
34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the 
Companies Act of South Africa.

1.  General information
    Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (""Implats"", ""the Company"" or ""the Group"") is one of the world's leading producers of
    platinum and associated platinum group metals (PGMs). Implats is structured around five mining operations and a toll
    refining business in Springs in the Gauteng province. The mining operations are located on the Bushveld Complex in 
    South Africa and the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, the two most significant PGM-bearing ore bodies in the world.
    
    The Company has its listing on the securities exchange operated by JSE Limited in South Africa, the Frankfurt Stock
    Exchange (2022 US$ convertible bonds) and a level 1 American Depositary Receipt programme in the United States of
    America.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial information was approved for issue on 1 March 2018 by the board of
    directors.

2.  Basis of preparation
    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
    Reporting Standard (IFRS), IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the
    Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council,
    requirements of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, and the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated
    financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, and the 
    commentary included in the interim results.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
    except for certain financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments which are measured at 
    fair value and some equity and liabilities for share-based payment arrangements which are measured using a binomial 
    option model.

    The condensed consolidated interim financial information is presented in South African rand, which is the Company's
    functional currency.

    Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total
    annual earnings.

3.  Accounting policies
    The principal accounting policies applied are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those of the annual
    consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017.

4.  Segment information       
    The Group distinguishes its segments between the mining operations, refining services, chrome processing and an 
    ""all other segment.""

    Waterberg
    During the period Implats acquired a 15% interest in Waterberg for $30 million (R408 million). Waterberg's 
    asset is a large scale platinum group metal (""PGM"") resource with an attractive risk profile given its shallow 
    nature. 

    Implats exercises significant influence through board representation and therefore applies the equity method to

    Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) (2022)
    Implats entered into a CCIRS amounting to US$250 million to hedge the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible
    bonds, being: exchange rate risk on dollar interest payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds at 
    a rand-dollar exchange rate weaker than R13.025/US$. US$250 million was swapped for R3 256 million on which Implats 
    pays a fixed interest rate to Standard Bank of 9.8%. Implats receives the 3.25% coupon on the US$250 million from 
    Standard Bank on the same date which Implats pays bond holders and the interest thereon. In June 2022, Implats will 
    receive $250 million for a payment of R3 256 million.

    The CCIRS is carried at its fair value of R299 (June 2017: R49) million. Hedge accounting has not been applied.

    Conversion option - US$ convertible bond (2022) 
    The US$ bond holders have the option to convert the bonds to Implats shares at a price of $3.89. The conversion
    option is carried at its fair value of R377 (June 2017: R547) million.
          
    Conversion option - ZAR convertible bond (2022) 
    The ZAR bond holders have the option to convert the bonds to Implats shares at a price of R50.01. At the general
    meeting held by shareholders on 24 July 2017, the approval to settle this option by means of Implats shares was 
    obtained. This option meets the definition of equity and an amount of R625 million (R450 million after deferred 
    tax) was therefore accounted within equity as from 24 July 2017.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Shareholders are advised that Implats’ headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the half year ended 31
December 2017 is expected to be a loss of between 17 and 26 cents per share compared to the half year
ended 31 December 2016 HEPS loss of 71 cents, representing an improvement of between 76% and 63%
respectively.

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be a loss of between 19 and 28 cents per share compared to the
year ended 31 December 2016 EPS loss of 52 cents, representing an improvement of between 63% and 46%
respectively.

The major reason for the increase in HEPS from the comparative period is that the Group made a gross profit
in the current period compared to a gross loss in the comparable six months ended 31 December 2016. A
significant amount of metal was tied up in the pipeline at 31 December 2017 due to an unscheduled re-build
of one of the furnaces. This negatively affected sales but was more than offset by a reduction in cost of sales.

The Group also made a profit before tax compared to a loss before tax in the comparable six months
notwithstanding a negative impact from a fair value adjustment on Impala Refining Services’ creditors due
to an increase in metal prices at the end of the period.

Higher “additional profits tax” payable by Zimplats increased the tax charge period on period, which resulted
in the anticipated loss after tax for the six months ended 31 December 2017 being between 46% and 63%
less than the loss incurred in the prior comparable period.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats. The Group’s reviewed financial results for the period ended 31 December
2017 will be released on 1 March 2018.

RESIGNATION OF DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT CHANGES

In compliance with paragraph 3.59(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders
are advised that Brenda Berlin has resigned as Group Chief Financial Officer and as Executive Director
of Implats, with effect from 28 February 2018. Additionally, Mark Munroe has assumed the role of

Following an extended career in in the mining sector, Ms Berlin, has made a decision to take-up a new

She joined Implats in 2004 to head up the corporate finance activities for the Group, and later assumed
the position of Group Executive: Strategy and Business Development. She was appointed Group Chief
Financial Officer in 2011.

Mr Munroe will join Implats in January 2018 and will have responsibility for the optimisation of the
Impala Rustenburg operations. In previous roles, Mr Munroe made significant contributions to the
strategic and mining transformation, and the extension of life at various mining operations in southern
Africa, as well as in other regions. His immediate priority at Impala Rustenburg is a return to cost
competitiveness and consistency, leading to sustained profitability.

Ms Samuel joined in October 2017 and is providing strategic direction across the Group with regard
to the human resource discipline, human resource policies and managing external trends and other
impacts on the human resources function.

The Chairman of the board of directors of Implats (“Board”), Dr Mandla Gantsho, expressed the
Board's full appreciation and thanks to Ms Berlin: ""On behalf of the Board, we would like to thank
Brenda for her tremendous commitment, guidance and influence over the last 13 years. Her
leadership of the financial function has ensured that the Group has a robust and sustainable balance
sheet, which is well equipped to meet the funding demands of Implats’ current and future growth
projects. We are extremely grateful for her unstinting leadership and direction, and thank her for her
significant contribution.”

Nico Muller added: “I have known and respected Brenda for many years and finally managed to team
up with her this year here at Implats. I am particularly sad to see her leave our team because we will
lose, not only a hugely talented and consummately professional team member, but also a very
supportive and dear friend. Brenda’s contribution and influence will remain entrenched in the Group
for years to come. She leaves a finance department that is well equipped with a strong and capable
team in place to continue the excellent management of the function, which has been a feature over
many years. The Implats team wishes Brenda well in her new role, and thanks her for her support and
determination.”

The Board will immediately implement a process to identify a suitable successor. In the meantime,
and until her departure, Ms Berlin will continue to work on implementing various strategic initiatives
and assist in ensuring a smooth transition for her successor.

COMPLETION OF FIRST PHASE OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE WATERBERG DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Further to the announcement on 16 October 2017, Implats announces that it has today closed the first
phase of its investment in the Waterberg development project (“Waterberg”) by acquiring a 15%
shareholding in Waterberg for US$30 million from Platinum Group Metals Ltd and Japan Oil, Gas and
Metals National Corporation. As set out in the previous announcement Implats also now has an option to
acquire majority ownership of the project following completion of a definitive feasibility study, as well as a
right of first refusal to smelt and refine Waterberg concentrate.

Located in Limpopo on the northern limb of the Bushveld complex, Waterberg represents a large scale
platinum group metal (“PGM”) resource with an attractive risk profile, given its shallow nature and ability
to support a fully mechanized operation with the potential for the project to have amongst the lowest
operating costs in the PGM sector.

The transaction falls below the categorisation threshold in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, Nico Muller, commented, “Safety remains an issue at Impala
Rustenburg and Marula. This is being dealt with at all levels within the Group to receive the
necessary support and resources to reverse these poor safety performances. We are pleased to
note early signs of improvement in efficiencies and production levels at the Impala Rustenburg
operations in line with planned interventions. Zimplats, Mimosa and Two Rivers delivered another
strong operating performance during the quarter, while Marula, which has undergone an
organisational restructure recently, delivered a pleasing turnaround and an increase in
concentrate production.”

SAFETY
Implats remains committed to ensuring zero harm and the Group’s safety strategy is premised on
providing an inherently safe work environment, maintaining leading safety practices and
inculcating safe behaviour at all times. Management remains resolute in leading this imperative
through direct engagement with all our stakeholders, including each employee in the organisation,
the leadership of our representative unions and government.


Regretfully, Implats has experienced a disappointing safety performance over recent months, with
Impala Rustenburg recording two incidents during the quarter in which three employees suffered
fatal injuries. Post the end of the quarter, another two employees sadly passed away at Impala
Rustenburg after extended medical treatment following incidents which occurred during the period
under review. Regretfully, Marula also experienced a fatal incident during October 2017. The
company has provided support to the families of the deceased, while the board of directors of
Implats and the management team have extended their very sincere sympathies to the family,
friends and colleagues of these employees.

Following these incidents, management has worked closely with the safety directorate of the
Department of Mineral Resources (“DMR”) and the worker representative structures of the
Association of Mine Workers and Construction Union (“AMCU”) to effect corrective measures to
arrest the decline in safety performance and agree on initiatives to prioritise safe production,
particularly at the Impala Rustenburg operations.
                                             
PRODUCTION
Tonnes milled across the Group during the quarter increased by 9.6% to 6 741 000 tonnes,
compared to 6 149 000 tonnes achieved in the prior corresponding period.

The increase was largely as a result of a much stronger operational performance at Impala,
compared to a poor first quarter performance in the prior corresponding period. Consequently,
platinum in concentrate produced during the quarter across all mining operations (managed and
Joint Venture), increased by 6.7% to 349 000 ounces, compared to 327 000 ounces in the prior
corresponding period.

Notwithstanding the strong performance from all operations across the Group, final refined metal
output was significantly impacted by a concentrate stock build-up following scheduled furnace
maintenance at both the Impala and Zimplats operations. Consequently, gross refined platinum
production during the quarter decreased by 6.6% to 341 200 ounces, compared to
365 200 ounces achieved in the prior period.

Planned maintenance was undertaken during the quarter at the Impala number 3 and number 5
furnaces and at the Zimplats furnace. During the maintenance of the Impala number 5 furnace,
excessive wear in some areas became apparent and a decision was taken to completely refurbish
it. As a result, the furnace is now only scheduled to come back on-line from December 2017,
which will impact planned pipeline stocks at half-year and year-end, given that capacity constraints
at the base metal refinery will not allow all the accumulated smelter matte stocks to be fully
processed during the 2018 financial year. Consequently, notwithstanding mined production being
in line with guided levels, gross refined platinum production for the Group is now expected to be
between 1.51 and 1.56 million ounces of platinum in 2018.

Impala
Impala delivered a much improved operational performance compared to the previous comparable
period, which was negatively impacted by the 14 Shaft decline fire and 1 Shaft fall-of-ground safety
incident. During the current quarter, in line with FY2018 guidance, improved efficiencies have
started to materialise, resulting in higher output, following the introduction of various initiatives at
the operation. Consequently, tonnes milled during the quarter increased by 22.6% to 2 984 000
tonnes, compared to 2 433 000 tonnes in the previous comparable quarter. The mill grade (6E),
which deteriorated by 5.3% to 3.95g/t, was impacted by ore pass rehabilitation work at 16 Shaft
and an increase in lower grade reef development compared to the prior corresponding period.
This resulted in platinum in concentrate produced at Impala increasing by 16.0% to 181 000
ounces, compared to 156 000 ounces in the prior period.
                                                  
Zimplats
Zimplats sustained operational performance at above design capacity with mill throughput and
grade largely unchanged at 1.69 million tonnes and 3.49 g/t (6E) respectively. As a result,
platinum in concentrate produced at the operation during the quarter remained unchanged at
71 000 ounces. However, platinum in matte was again impacted by scheduled furnace
maintenance during the quarter. The furnace was switched off for a planned 49-day sidewall reline
at the end of August 2017. Metal produced from the concentrators during the shutdown period
will be exported as concentrate during the quarter ending December 2017. Consequently, matte
production during the quarter reduced by 7.8% to 47 000 ounces, compared to 51 000 ounces in
the prior corresponding period.

Marula
Marula delivered an improved operational performance, in line with the performance conditions
set by the Implats board of directors and market guidance for the 2018 financial year. Tonnes
milled during the period increased by 11.7% to 498 000 tonnes, compared to 446 000 tonnes in
the prior corresponding period. This increase was achieved following business restructuring
initiatives completed in the prior financial year and ongoing multi-stakeholder interventions to
prevent community protest action and business interruptions. As a result, platinum in concentrate
production improved 9.4% to 23 200 ounces compared to the 21 200 ounces in the prior
corresponding period.

Mimosa
Mimosa sustained its strong operational performance with tonnes milled during the period
increasing by 3.9% to 717 000 tonnes, compared to 690 000 tonnes in the previous comparable
quarter. Platinum production in concentrate increased 5.6% to 32 200 ounces from 30 500 ounces
in the prior corresponding period on the back of the improved tonnage and a 1.8% higher mill
grade.

Two Rivers
Two Rivers’ mill throughput and head grade were impacted, as expected, by split reef areas
currently being mined before further high-grade areas can be accessed. Consequently, tonnes
milled decreased 2.8% to 852 000 tonnes, compared to 877 000 tonnes in the previous
comparable quarter, and the mill grade (6E) deteriorated by 10.2% to 3.70g/t. This impacted
platinum in concentrate production, which decreased by 15.6% to 41 600 ounces, compared to
49 300 ounces in the prior comparable period.

Impala Refining Services (“IRS”)
Increased deliveries from third-party customers during the period were more than offset by the
build-up in concentrate stocks as a result of scheduled furnace maintenance at both the Impala
and Zimplats operations. As a result, IRS refined platinum production during the period decreased
2.7% to 208 700 ounces, compared to 214 500 ounces in the prior comparable quarter.

The above information has not been reviewed and reported on by the Group’s external auditors.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE WATERBERG DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Implats today announces that it has entered into definitive agreements with Platinum Group Metals Ltd
(“PTM”), Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (“JOGMEC”) and Mnombo Wethu Consultants Pty
Ltd (“Mnombo”) to acquire a minority interest in the Waterberg development project (“Waterberg”), with
an option to acquire majority ownership of the project following completion of a definitive feasibility study
(""DFS"").

Located in Limpopo on the northern limb of the Bushveld complex, Waterberg represents a large scale
platinum group metal (“PGM”) resource with an attractive risk profile given its shallow nature. This
facilitates fully mechanised production with the potential for the project to have amongst the lowest
operating costs in the PGM sector.

Under the terms of the relevant agreements Implats, subject to various conditions precedent, will pay
US$30 million in cash to acquire a 15% shareholding in the project from PTM and JOGMEC. Implats will
then be closely involved with the DFS process, which is intended to examine alternative options to establish
a preferred development path for the project.

Implats will have 90 business days following approval of the DFS to determine whether it wishes to exercise
its option to acquire control of the project, and a further 90 business days to confirm acceptable financing
arrangements. Subject to any necessary adjustments, Implats would obtain a 50.01% shareholding by
purchasing an additional 12.195% equity interest from JOGMEC for US$34.8 million and by contributing
US$130.0 million into Waterberg in return for an additional 22.815% equity interest. This capital will be
contributed as required in order to fund the development of the project, which would be managed by
Implats. The parties have also reached agreement to ensure there will be participation by appropriately
broad-based empowerment groupings in the Waterberg project.

Nico Muller, CEO of Implats, commented “We have made it a priority to increase Implats’ strategic
optionality and this investment represents an important step to create the potential to develop a
significant, lower cost, lower risk resource. We look forward to working with PTM, JOGMEC and Mnombo
on the feasibility study process.”

The transaction falls below the categorisation threshold in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

Implats to implement employee consultative process at its Impala Rustenburg operation 
  
Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats) has issued a notice to relevant employee representative groups, 
government authorities and other stakeholders at its Impala Rustenburg (Impala) operation, indicating that 
it has initiated a Section 189 consultation process, in terms of the Labour Relations Act, 66 of 1995 (LRA), 
that may lead to staff reductions. 
 
The consultation process is specifically aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the Impala operations, which 
currently employ some 31 000 people.  
 
The Company is currently experiencing severe financial pressures at Impala, largely as a result of persistently 
low metal (Rand) prices and continued production cost increases. Labour productivity rates have also 
declined over the last few years and production levels at Impala Rustenburg have reduced from a historical 
base of some 1 000 000 platinum ounces per annum, to the 680 000 to 720 000 ounces forecast for the 2018 
financial year.  
 
Nico Muller, Implats’ Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The financial sustainability of Impala has 
deteriorated significantly over recent years.  We have implemented ongoing cost saving and optimisation 
initiatives in an attempt to restore profitability and secure continued employment as far as possible. 
Unfortunately, we are now left with no further option in the prevailing operating environment, but to 
consider further restructuring processes that may lead to a reduction in the number of employees.” 
 
It is expected that some 2 500 people could be affected near term, but this does not preclude further 
optimisation processes that may be required in future to ensure the continued sustainability of the operation. 
  
Nico Muller added, “It must be emphasised that no final decision has been taken as regards the proposed 
restructuring, and no final decision will be taken prior to full and proper consultation with affected

Commentary

SUMMARISED CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

Introduction
Implats' focus during the 2017 financial year has remained firmly on the continued implementation of its strategic
response plan to succeed in a low-price environment. Our view is that the current metal price environment could 
conceivably stay lower for even longer and could be viewed as 'the new normal'.

The plan encapsulates overall cost optimisation, reprioritising and rescheduling capital expenditure, productivity 
improvements at Impala Rustenburg, strengthening the Group balance sheet and retaining its social licence to operate 
in an ethical manner. While this plan is advancing, further considerable change initiatives are needed to ultimately 
ensure the sustainability and profitability of the Group.

There has been good progress in some areas with excellent operational performances from many operations. Group platinum 
production reached 1.53 million platinum ounces for the year (2016: 1.44 million). Sub-optimal performances were 
delivered by Impala Rustenburg and Marula, while all other operations performed at or above expectation, supplemented 
by a 35% increase in tolling throughput at Impala Refinery Services (IRS).

While Impala produced 654 600 ounces of platinum for the year (as guided at the half year), it nonetheless incurred a
headline loss after tax of R2.68 billion. This was largely a result of sustained low rand basket prices, a cost base
that is structured for a higher level of production and persistently low operational efficiencies. It is clear that we
cannot accept it being business as usual for Impala. A comprehensive strategic review of this operation is planned to 
ensure that it will operate at a cash neutral level in what is perceived to be the new normal pricing environment. 
The review will be focused on returning the mine to profitability by prioritising profitability and value, over volume.

Similarly, Marula made a headline loss after tax of R737 million. This was largely due to disruptions to its
operations by surrounding communities. A comprehensive stakeholder engagement process has been initiated to mitigate 
against further disruptions and, in addition, the mine undertook a section 189 retrenchment process to restructure its 
cost base. The target for Marula to be cash positive at Group level in 2018 has been set, and will be strictly 
monitored each quarter throughout the coming year.

Safety and sustainability 
While there has been Group-wide progress in terms of its safety performance, it is with deep sadness and regret that
Implats reports nine work-related fatalities during the year. Safe production is vital to Implats' sustainability. Human
behaviour continues to contribute to many safety incidents and the emphasis is on ensuring effective leadership, responsible
behaviour, and driving a culture of personal accountability and interdependence. 

During the year, Zimplats completed a consecutive 365 days without a single lost-time injury - a safety milestone well
worth highlighting. Several other operations also reached significant safety achievements during the year. 

The LTIFR improved 8.8% from the previous year to 5.92 per million man-hours worked (including contractors) compared
to 6.49 per million man-hours last year.

The Group recognises that its ability to enhance delivery and sustain Group-wide operational efficiencies depends on
the skills, safety, well-being and motivation of employees. Pleasing progress has been made in enhancing the
relationships with unions, communities and other key stakeholders. 

Implats continued to deliver against commitments in terms of the Group's social and labour plans (SLPs) at its South
African operations, and targeted corporate social investments in Zimbabwe. Phase 2 of the Platinum Village, a home
ownership project in Rustenburg, is almost complete and 321 houses have been built this year, taking the total units 
to 849 at this complex. There is strong ongoing demand for these houses and approval for phase 3 is being motivated. 

Year in review 
Group headline earnings per share decreased from 12 cents per share to a loss of 137 cents per share. 

Revenue was assisted by a marginally improved rand basket and rose to R36.8 billion from R35.9 billion. Overall, 
production from the Group's operations increased year-on-year, but this benefit was more than offset by planned 
higher levels of refined stock at year end. 

Increases in Group unit costs, year on year, were contained at 4.4% and cost of sales increased by 4.0%. However, 
revenue only increased by 2.5% as all production was not sold. This combination, largely resulted in the decline in 
gross profit from R4 million to a loss of R529 million.

In 2007, Impala prepaid the estimated contractual Royal Bafokeng royalty and the Royal Bafokeng used this prepayment 
to subscribe for shares in Implats. The prepayment was raised on the balance sheet and is amortised annually based 
on units of production. Our current view of the estimated value of what would have been the royalty payments has 
changed materially since 2007 given unexpected persistently low metal prices and depressed levels of production.  
A decision was therefore taken by management to impair the full amount of R10.2 billion, which after deferred tax 
amounts to R7.3 billion.

The income tax credit for the current year includes deferred tax of R2.8 billion on the impairment of the prepayment.
This is excluded from the headline earnings. Current tax (on headline earnings) increased compared to 2016 as a result
of a non-recurring tax credit on a bad debt in 2016 and an increase in additional profits tax for Zimplats in the 
current year.

The Group's mine-to-market output was 1.28 (2016: 1.25) million platinum ounces. Lower deliveries from Marula and 
Two Rivers were offset by higher volumes from Impala and Zimplats. Third-party platinum production increased by 
35% to 246 700 ounces. Consequently, gross refined platinum production increased by 6.4% to 1.53 million ounces. 

The cash preservation programme has continued. Capital expenditure of R3.43 billion was maintained at similar 
levels to the previous year (2016: R3.56 billion). Over the last year, R1.14 billion was spent on the two development 
shafts, 16 and 20, at Impala Rustenburg. In other areas, additional capital was deferred as a response to the ongoing 
low-price environment. Cost containment has also been successful with the Group recording cost savings in excess of 
R1 billion over the last two years.  

Importantly, Implats has further strengthened its balance sheet through the conclusion of the R6.5 billion new
convertible bond issue, which was raised mainly to early refinance the 2018 convertible bonds of R4.5 billion. 
At 30 June 2017, R300 million and US$29 million of the 2018 convertible bonds remain unredeemed and will be settled 
on maturity in February 2018. 

Cash generated from operations reduced to R1.0 (2016: R2.7) billion mainly as a result of the operating challenges
at Impala Rustenburg. At year end, the Group had gross cash of R7.8 (2016: R6.8) billion on hand and R4 billion in 
unutilised bank debt facilities, which remain available until 2021.
 
Impala Rustenburg: Impala Rustenburg was impacted by two extraordinary events that reduced output during the year. 
The first event was the fire at 14 Shaft in January 2016, resulting in the temporary closure of the decline section 
at this shaft to effect repairs. The second event was the collapse of ground incident at 1 Shaft in May 2016, resulting 
in the introduction of reduced UG2 panel lengths in certain areas. The required work at both the shafts has progressed 
well. The rehabilitation work at the 14 Shaft decline was completed ahead of schedule in April 2017. Production from 
1 Shaft will be back at steady state from July 2017.   

During the first half of the financial year, the Impala Rustenburg operations were significantly impacted by Section 54 
safety stoppages. Following close engagement between management, employees and government authorities, there has been a 
notable reduction in all stoppages, including Section 54 stoppages.  It is hoped that the relentless pursuit of compliance 
with safety policies will result in further reductions in Section 54s and internal stoppages.   

During May 2015, Implats raised R3.9 billion in equity for the purpose of completing construction of the new 16 and 
20 shafts in order for those shafts to ramp up to steady state production. At the end of June 2017, R2.4 billion of 
the money raised had been spent, leaving a balance of R1.5 billion.
 
At 30 June 2017, the work anticipated at the time of raising the money was 98% complete for 16 Shaft and 92% for 20 Shaft. 
Both projects have been thoroughly reviewed to determine their ability to deliver 310 000 platinum ounces sustainably. 
The tonnage and grade expectations from the mine layout have been re-affirmed, but logistic studies have revealed that 
additional ore and men/material capacity will be required at full production. At both the shafts it also became necessary 
to line ore passes that experience excessive scaling. At 16 Shaft, the third phase of the refrigeration requirements 
has now been added to the scope to complete the project as it will now be required in the medium-term. Collectively, 
a total of R2.2 billion remains to be spent on these projects over the next five years. Given the R1.5 billion 
remaining from the equity raise, there is a shortfall of R700 million to complete the projects. The inclusion of 
these items above have now reduced the project completion percentages to 86% and 88% for 16 and 20 shafts, respectively. 

An Impala Rustenburg mining optimisation project was initiated in January 2017, one of several initiatives being 
implemented to ensure that Impala returns to profitability. A priority target of returning Impala to a cash neutral 
position by 2019 has now been set assuming the current low platinum price environment remains as is. This incorporates 
an assessment of each shaft and production area and will result in a mining complex that is likely to be somewhat 
different to the large and intricate operation that is known today. This may lead to the disposal or suspensions or 
harvesting of marginal and loss-making shafts. Such decisions, will be made in the best interests of all stakeholders, 
the sustainability of the Group and with restoration of shareholders returns.

Impala's leadership has been strengthened and realigned to ensure that a fit for purpose team is in place to drive 
performance, to increase production volumes, and improve efficiencies and productivity.

Marula: Mining activities at Marula were severely disrupted by community protest action resulting in the operation 
producing only 67 900 (2016: 77 700) ounces of platinum in concentrate. Community members are dissatisfied with 
the way their 50% interest in the Makgomo Chrome project is being managed by the community's appointed leaders, 
leading to the suspension of all chrome operations from February 2017 to date.

Prior to the end of the financial year, an organisational restructuring was successfully completed to better position 
the mine for future profitability in the prevailing low-price environment. Overall staff complement has reduced by 
some 980 people, including retrenchments of 268 own employees through a Section 189 process through the closure of 
the unprofitable hybrid section at Clapham. Operations are now focused on the low cost footwall section at Clapham. 
Production levels have improved over recent months and the focus is on retaining this momentum.

While ongoing engagement with all stakeholders to address community concerns and external disruptions show progress, 
it is imperative the operation become cash generative within the immediate short-term. If Marula does not meet the 
stated objective of being cash neutral at Group level for whatever reason, there will be no other option but to 
suspend operations.

Zimplats: The redevelopment of Bimha Mine has progressed as planned and the mine is successfully ramping up to reach
full production in April 2018. By utilising additional material mined from the temporary opencast section, platinum 
production was maintained at 281 100 ounces in matte for the year. The development of the US$264 million Mupani Mine 
(Portal 6) was approved in November 2016 and the new underground mining complex, with a design capacity of 2.2 million 
tonnes per annum, is targeted to reach full production in 2025. Mupani, a replacement portal for the Rukodzi and 
Ngwarati Mines, will sustain the mining operation well into the future. 

The focus is now on generating cash for the Group and to this end a dividend policy of 3.5 time headline earnings has
been approved by the Zimplats board.

Mimosa: Regrettably, Mimosa incurred one fatality during the year. Operations were sustained through the low-price
environment to record another exceptional year. The operation produced a record, 121 600 ounces of platinum in concentrate,
its highest production level ever. The feasibility study for the construction of a smelter at Mimosa has been completed, 
to align with the Zimbabwean Government's beneficiation ambitions, but which is unaffordable in the new normal pricing
environment. Mimosa is continuing to consult government with regard to the proposed implementation of a 15% export levy
on unbeneficiated platinum, which has been deferred to 1 January 2018. It has been communicated that neither the
smelter nor the export levy is affordable and could result in mine closure. 

Two Rivers: Two Rivers posted another outstanding year in terms of safety and production. This operation has been
fatality free for more than five years and produced 181 900 ounces of platinum in concentrate. Two Rivers is Implats'
lowest-cost producer and has now secured optionality to maintain and potentially increase its production levels through 
access to the Tamboti mineral rights. When these rights are transferred into Two Rivers, Implats' interest in Two Rivers 
will decrease from 49% to 46%.

IRS: IRS remains an important Group asset. Over the last year, the unit delivered platinum production of 875 200 
(2016: 811 500) ounces from a combination of mine-to-market operations, third-party purchases, and toll volumes. 
One of the major opportunities for the Group is IRS's access to spare smelting and refining capacity from Impala 
to ensure the processing of planned production from other operations and contracted third-party material, as 
well as additional material from new customers. 

Market review
Overall demand for PGMs from major demand sectors remained stable during 2016 and into the first half of 2017. 
Demand for platinum was supported by a combination of rising vehicle sales and higher loadings in Western Europe, 
as well as increased industrial requirements in both North America and China. Palladium demand remained healthy on 
the back of increasing vehicle sales in China and the US. Increased demand from the automotive and chemical industries
underpinned rhodium.

On the other hand, the primary supply of PGMs remained constrained, while secondary supply was muted, recovering only
in the last months of the 2016 calendar year on the back of higher steel and palladium/rhodium prices. The secondary
supply of platinum, however, experienced an unusual hike as Chinese jewellery stocks were recycled. 

The supply environment remains under continued risk largely due to a lack of capital investment. The low rand prices
continue to place unprofitable shafts at risk, along with challenges related to safety incidents and associated
operational stoppages, as well as increasing production costs. 

Market performance 
The platinum and palladium markets remained in fundamental deficit for most of the year, and there was a small surplus
in the rhodium market. The platinum price ended this financial year 11% lower at US$922 per ounce, compared to the
start of the financial year (US$1 033 per ounce). The average price for the year was 4% higher at US$988 per ounce, 
compared to the previous financial year. 

Platinum price movements during the year continued to show a disconnect to market fundamentals, which made platinum
pricing susceptible to investor sentiment around global risk. Additionally, anti-diesel sentiment in Europe/India and 
the fall in Chinese jewellery demand continue to weigh on platinum prices.

Negative sentiment towards the internal combustion engine, and diesel in particular, has increased over the last 
12 months. Much is being made of battery electric vehicles as the solution to effective carbon dioxide and NOx reduction.
However, to be truly effective, these will require a significant increase in renewable energy generation, which is
potentially decades away. It is interesting to note that the reduction in diesel vehicle share in the Western European 
market has been offset by an increase in sales of gasoline vehicles, not battery. Growth in the electric vehicle space 
has been via hybrid vehicle sales, which do provide a more immediate answer to emissions reductions. Given the introduction 
of Real Driving Emissions (RDE) testing, these will require higher loadings of PGM's to negotiate the more frequent
'stop-start' conditions.

In contrast, palladium prices were 42% higher at US$841 per ounce, compared to the start of the financial year 
(US$593 per ounce). Palladium prices reached a high of US$900 per ounce during June 2017, while the average price 
for the year was US$737 per ounce. Support for palladium was driven by robust demand from autocatalyst fabricators, 
positive sentiment towards the automobile sector and expectations of further palladium price gains. 

Rhodium performed exceptionally well, showing the largest rally in the PGM basket for the year. Rhodium prices closed
the financial year 60% higher at US$1 018 per ounce after opening at US$638 per ounce. The average price for the year
was US$803 per ounce, largely on the back of the absence of liquidity and the increasing demand from both the automotive
and industrial sectors.

The gradual recovery of the global economy, with the anticipated revival in industrial production and consumer demand,
is expected to be the biggest driver of increased PGM demand in the medium to long-term. The platinum and palladium
markets are expected to remain in a fundamental deficit in 2017, while rhodium is expected to remain in a small surplus. 

Implats expects a slight decline in the use of platinum in the automotive industry in 2017, in favour of palladium and
driven by an increasing share of gasoline vehicle sales. However, with increasing palladium prices, it is forecast that
research into the back substitution of platinum in three-way catalysts will result in increased usage of platinum in
gasoline engines in the coming years. 

Current environment 
The mining industry in both South Africa and Zimbabwe, the two jurisdictions where the Group operates, is characterised 
by rapidly increasing uncertainty. This is evidenced by the gazetting and then suspension of the new Mining Charter in 
South Africa and increased calls for beneficiation as well as a potential 15% export levy on un-beneficiated platinum 
in Zimbabwe. Community activism continues to escalate and poses a material risk to sustainable mining operations. 
These are risks that require considerable attention at executive level. To supplement the Group's existing executive 
capability, action has been taken to develop strength in and across the leadership team.  

Internally, progress has been made over the last two years to ensure cost saving and optimisation throughout the
Group, while advancing commitments related to our social licence to operate, which continue to benefit Implats' 
wide-ranging group of stakeholders. Increased organisational effectiveness is, however, required to improve the 
delivery of cost effective ounces. Senior leadership changes have been made and will continue across the Group 
with the primary objective being improved role clarity and accountability. Systems are being introduced to improve 
interdivisional relationships so that these are more collaborative and value adding. 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
There is no material change in Implats' total attributable Mineral Resource estimate at 30 June 2017, which reduced by
2.4 million ounces of platinum to 191.6 million from that reported previously in June 2016. This can mainly be ascribed
to mining depletion. The grouping of platinum ounces per reef shows that the Zimplats Mineral Resource makes up 49% of
the total Implats inventory.

Overall the total attributable Group Mineral Reserve estimate did not change significantly and increased by 0.8 million 
ounces of platinum to 22.4 million as at 30 June 2017 compared to 21.6 million platinum ounces in the previous financial 
year. Some 54% of the total attributable Mineral Reserves are located at Impala and a further 33% is hosted within the 
Main Sulphide Zone at Zimplats.

Prospects and outlook
One of the core pillars of Implats' strategy has been to strengthen the balance sheet and this has necessitated an
enhanced focus on capital allocation and cash management. This is continuing as a focused priority. Implats has one of the
best-in-sector balance sheets and this strength is, and will be, a critical element of its ambition to develop strategic
optionality. The enforcement of strict capital allocation will be equally important as management re-examines the
Impala Rustenburg's investment case. 

It is imperative to continue developing the Group's strategic agility. Market dynamics are being re-examined,
specifically long-term price forecasts, and an assessment aimed at enhancing strategic optionality is also being completed,
within and beyond the current portfolio. The assessment is reviewing all operations and will result in the elimination of
loss-making production, while interrogating future dependence on high-cost, deep, conventional mining operations. Implats
is intent on securing assets that provide optionality for cheaper, shallower and mechanised resources. 

The Group has made some progress in delivering its strategic response to the current price environment. The operational 
strategy and planning is directed toward the expectation of ongoing price constraints and all operations are being
adapted to this reality. Implats remains committed to the strategic nature and future fundamentals of the PGM market. 
While short-term volatility in the demand and pricing of these rare and unique metals is recognised, they remain critical 
to the ever growing needs and requirements of a global economy, with increasing demands for cleaner air.

Given our view that current PGM prices may be the new normal, the board has decided to maintain 17 Shaft on care and
maintenance until there is more confidence in a rising metal price environment. 

The transition to a more concentrated, low cost operation at Impala Rustenburg continues. However, a slower build-up
at 16 and 20 Shafts, lower production levels at the mature shafts and the earlier closure of the end-of-life shafts will
impact on the production profile over the next five years. It is now expected that 750 000 ounces of platinum will be
achieved in 2022. This may be further affected by the strategic review being conducted. 

A tremendous amount of excellent work has been done to facilitate acceptance within the Group's host communities and
to secure relationships with government and other authorities. This will remain a key focus area as commitments to
responsible environmental stewardship and the wellbeing of employees are unwavering. 

For the next financial year, production estimates are as follows:
- Rustenburg - between 680 000 and 720 000 ounces
- Marula - 85 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Zimplats - 260 000 platinum ounces in matte
- Two Rivers - 175 000 platinum ounces in concentrate
- Mimosa - 115 000 - 120 000 platinum ounces in concentrate.

The Group's operating cost is expected to be less than R23 100 per platinum ounce for the next financial year.

    Implats pays-on externally to the bond holders. During June 2017, Implats cancelled the CCIRS and paid an amount of

7.2 Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) (2022)     
    Implats entered into a CCIRS amounting to $250 million to hedge the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible bond, 
    being: exchange rate risk on the dollar interest payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds at a 
    rand-dollar exchange rate weaker than R13.025/US$. US$250 million was swapped for R3 256 million on which Implats 
    pays a fixed interest rate to Standard Bank of 9.8%. Implats receives the 3.25% coupon on the US$250 million on the 
    same date which Implats pays-on externally to the bond holders and the interest thereon. In June 2022, Implats will 
    receive $250 million for a payment of R3 256 million.                                         

    The CCIRS is carried at its fair value of R49 million. No hedge accounting has been applied.    

7.3 Conversion option - US$ convertible bond (2022) (note 9.5) 
    The US$ bond holders have the option to convert the bonds to Implats shares (subject to shareholders' approval) at a 
    price of $3.89. The value of this conversion option was R559 million at initial recognition. The conversion option is 
    carried at its fair value of R547 million, resulting in a R12 million profit for the period. At the general meeting 
    held by shareholders' on 24 July 2017, the approval to settle this option by means of Implats shares was obtained. 
    Given this option is US$ denominated it does not meet the definition of equity (fixed number of shares for fixed 
    amount) and will continue to be accounted for as a derivative financial instrument in future.    

7.4 Conversion option - ZAR convertible bond (2022) (note 9.4)
    The ZAR bond holders have the option to convert the bonds to Implats shares (subject to shareholders' approval) at 
    a price of R50.01. The value of this conversion option was R676 million at initial recognition. The conversion option 
    is carried at its fair value of R637 million, resulting in a R39 million profit for the period. At the general meeting 
    held by shareholders' on 24 July 2017, the approval to settle this option by means of Implats shares was obtained. 
    This option meets the definition of equity and will therefore be accounted within equity from 24 July 2017.

    The write-down to net realisable value comprises R78 million (2016: R106 million) for refined mining metal and 
    R948 million (2016: R558 million) for in-process mining metal.                                

    Included in refined metal is metal on lease to third parties of 36 000 ounces (2016: 36 000 ounces) ruthenium.

    Quantities of recoverable metal are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore to the quantities of metal actually 
    recovered (metallurgical balancing). The nature of this process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor 
    recoverability levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and the engineering 
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Changes in engineering estimates of metal contained in-process 
    resulted in an increase of in-process metal of R376 (2016: R384) million.                                
    Non-mining metal consists mainly of inventory held by Impala Refining Services. No inventories are encumbered.

9.1 Standard Bank Limited - Zimplats term loan
    US $ denominated revolving credit facility of R1 111 (US$85) million bears interest at three-month London Interbank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 700 (2016: 700) basis points. During the year the facility was decreased from US$95 million  
    to $85 million and the loan repayments were renegotiated. The facility will now be repaid in two equal annual payments
    commencing in December 2018. Previously it commenced in December 2017 with final maturity in December 2018. At the end 
    of the period, the US dollar balance amounted to US$85 (2016: US$85) million.

9.2 Convertible bonds - ZAR (2018)
    The ZAR denominated bonds have a par value of R2 672 million and carry a coupon of 5% (R133.6 million) per annum. 
    The coupon is payable semi-annually for a period of five years ending 21 February 2018. The bond holder has the option 
    to convert the bonds to Implats' shares at a price of R214.90. The value of this compound instrument's equity portion
    relating to conversion was R319 million (before tax) on issue. In May 2017, Implats made an offer to all bond holders to
    re-purchase their bonds at face value, which offer was conditional on the issue of the ZAR and US$ 2022 bonds. 89% of the
    bonds holders accepted the offer. This resulted in R79 million being accounted for within equity, being the deemed cost for
    89% of the conversion option. The effective interest rate on the remaining balance of the bond is 8.5% (2016: 8.5%).
            
9.3 Convertible bonds - US$ (2018)
    The US$ denominated bonds have a par value of US$200 million and carry a coupon of 1% (US$2 million) per annum. The
    coupon is payable semi-annually for a period of five years ending 21 February 2018. The bond holder has the option to
    convert the bonds to Implats' shares at a price of US$24.13. The value of this conversion option derivative was R106
    million at initial recognition. Implats also offered to re-purchase these bonds at face value and 85% of the bond holders
    accepted. The effective interest rate on the remaining balance of the bond is 3.1% (2016: 3.1%). (Refer note 9 for
    information regarding the CCIRS entered into to hedge foreign exchange risk on this bond.)

9.4 Convertible bonds - ZAR (2022) (note 7.1)
    The ZAR denominated bonds have a par value of R3 250 million and carry a coupon of 6.375% (R207.2 million) per annum.
    The coupon is payable semi-annually for a period of five years ending 7 June 2022. The bond holder has the option to
    convert the bonds to Implats' shares at a price of R50.01. The value of this conversion option derivative was R676 million
    on issue. Subsequent to year end, at the general meeting held by shareholders, shareholders approval to settle this
    option by means of Implats shares was obtained, which will result in the bond being accounted for as a compound instrument
    which will result in the derivative being transferred into equity. Implats has the option to call the bonds at par plus
    accrued interest at any time if the aggregate value of the underlying shares per bond for a specified period of time is
    130% or more of the principal amount of that bond. The effective interest rate of the bond is 12.8%.

9.5 Convertible bonds - US$ (2022) (note 7.3)
    The US $ denominated bonds have a par value of US$250 million and carry a coupon of 3.25% (US$8.1 million) per annum.
    The coupon is payable semi-annually for a period of five years ending 7 June 2022. The bond holder has the option to
    convert the bonds to Implats' shares at a price of US$3.89. The value of this conversion option derivative was 
    R559 million at initial recognition. Implats has the option to call the bonds at par plus accrued interest at any time 
    if the aggregate value of the underlying shares per bond for a specified period of time is 130% or more of the principal 
    amount of that bond. The effective interest rate is 8.38%. (Refer note 7 for additional information regarding the conversion 
    and the CCIRS entered into to hedge foreign exchange risk on this bond.)

    Facilities 
    At 30 June 2017, the Group had signed committed facility agreements for a total of R4.0 (June 2016: R4.0) billion.

    In addition, Zimplats has a US$34 (2016: $24) million revolving credit facility of which US$24 (June 2016: US$24) million 
    was drawn at the end of the year.

13. Contingent liabilities and guarantees
    As at the end of June 2017 the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and other matters arising 
    in the ordinary course of business from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise. The Group  
    has issued guarantees of R118 (2016: R152) million. Guarantees of R1 396 (2016: R1 268) million have been issued by 
    third parties and financial institutions on behalf of the Group consisting mainly of guarantees to the Department of 
    Mineral Resources for R1 277 (2016: R 1 149) million.

14. Related party transactions
    The Group entered into PGM purchase transactions of R3 745 million (June 2016: R3 693 million) with Two Rivers Platinum, 
    an associate company, resulting in an amount payable of R1 034 million (June 2016: R958 million) at year end. It also

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017

Shareholders are advised that Implats’ headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year ended 30 June 2017
is expected to be a loss of between 125 and 150 cents per share compared to the year ended 30 June 2016
HEPS of 12 cents.

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be a loss of between 1 030 and 1 235 cents per share compared
to the year ended 30 June 2016 EPS loss of 10 cents.

The difference between EPS and HEPS for the year ended 30 June 2017 is due to the impairment of a royalty
prepayment at year end.

The major reason for the decline in HEPS from the comparative period is that the prior year gross profit
declined to a gross loss in the current year. In addition, the income tax credit was significantly negatively
affected by both an increase in additional profits tax for Zimplats in the current year and a non-recurring tax
credit on a bad debt in the prior year.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats. The Group’s reviewed financial results for the period ended 30 June 2017
will be released on 14 September 2017.

RESULTS OF GENERAL MEETING

Introduction

registered office on Monday, 24 July 2017 (“General Meeting”) and to the circular to
shareholders dated 22 June 2017 relating to the proposed approval of the following
resolutions:

- the conversion of the Company’s entire authorised and issued share capital from par value
  shares to no par value shares (the “Conversion of share capital”);
- an increase in the Company’s authorised share capital from 844 008 000 Ordinary Shares
  to 944 008 000 Ordinary Shares (the “Increase of authorised share capital”);

  to the bondholders on the exercise of the conversion rights, (ii) increase the number of

GUIDANCE REGARDING VOTING AT THE GENERAL MEETING

Implats shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 22 June 2017 in
relation to the distribution of a circular to Implats’ shareholders (dated 22 June 2017), including a
notice (the “Notice”) of general meeting (the “General Meeting”) and amongst others a resolution
to grant the board of directors of Implats a specific authority to issue Implats’ ordinary shares in the
future (Ordinary Resolution – Approval of Conversion Issue per the Notice, the “Resolution”), if
required, in accordance with the terms of the recently issued US$ and ZAR convertible bonds
maturing in 2022 (collectively the “2022 Convertible Bonds”).

Following further discussions with the JSE, it has been agreed that because the Implats’ ordinary
shares nominally held by Allan Gray are beneficially held by the clients of Allan Gray and not Allan
Gray itself, Allan Gray will not be treated as a “material shareholder” of Implats and therefore will
not be regarded a “related party” in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. Allan Gray was the only
potential related party in relation to Implats. Allan Gray clients or entities that are the beneficial
owners of the Implats’ ordinary shares will be entitled to vote on the Resolution, whether in person
or by proxy, subject to the restriction below.

Voting at the General Meeting

Voting at a General Meeting in relation to resolutions regarding a specific issue of shares for cash are
governed by the JSE Listings Requirements. Shareholders are advised that any votes cast on the
Resolution by any specific beneficial holder of Implats ordinary shares that is also a holder of the
2022 Convertible Bonds during the period commencing on the last day to trade to be eligible to vote
at the General Meeting, being Friday, 17 July 2017, up to and including the date of the General
Meeting, being Monday, 24 July 2017 (“Relevant Period”), cannot be counted. Accordingly, any
shareholder entitled to vote at the General Meeting should be satisfied that they were not also a
holder of the 2022 Convertible Bonds during the Relevant Period before either casting their vote at
the General Meeting or, if voting by proxy, submitting their proxy form ahead of the deadline for
submission at 11:00 South Africa time on Friday, 21 July 2017.

DISTRIBUTION OF CIRCULAR TO SHAREHOLDERS AND NOTICE OF GENERAL
MEETING

1. Introduction

Implats shareholders (“Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement released on the Stock
Exchange News Service (“SENS”) of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) on 25 May 2017 relating to the
invitation in terms of which Implats offered to purchase, for cash, the 2018 US$ and ZAR
convertible bonds (the “2018 Convertible Bonds”) (the “Invitation”) and the simultaneous
launch of a dual offering of the 2022 US$ and ZAR convertible bonds (collectively the “2022
Convertible Bonds” or the “Convertible Bond Offerings"").

Subsequent announcements were released on 26 May 2017 regarding the pricing of the 2022
Convertible Bonds Offering and on 1 June 2017 giving the results of the Invitation and details of
the settlement of the 2018 Convertible Bonds.

The 2022 Convertible Bonds are currently cash-settled instruments. In order for Implats to settle
the 2022 Convertible Bonds through the issue of new Implats ordinary shares (“Ordinary
Shares”) for bondholders exercising their conversion rights, a general meeting of Shareholders
will be convened on Monday, 24 July 2017 at 11:00 (the “General Meeting”) for Shareholders
to vote on the following resolutions, which propose to authorise:

- the conversion of the Company’s entire authorised and issued share capital from par value
  shares to no par value shares (the “Ordinary Share Conversion”);
- an increase in the Company’s authorised share capital from 844 008 000 Ordinary Shares to
  944 008 000 Ordinary Shares (the “Authorised Share Capital Increase”);
- the amendment of the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation (“MOI”) to take account of
  the Ordinary Share Conversion and Authorised Share Capital Increase (the “MOI
  Amendment”); and
- the specific authority to issue a maximum of new 175 million Ordinary Shares upon conversion
  of the 2022 Convertible Bonds, including to parties classified as related parties (the “Specific
  Authority”) in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements (the “Listings Requirements”);

(collectively the “Proposed Resolutions”).

2. Use of proceeds and rationale for the issue of 2022 Convertible Bonds

Prior to the Invitation, the full principal amount of the 2018 Convertible Bonds was US$200
million and ZAR2 672 million. The proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Bond offerings were utilised
in the repurchase of ZAR2 429 million 2018 ZAR Convertible Bonds and US$170 million 2018
US$ Convertible Bonds. A total of US$30 million 2018 US$ Convertible Bonds remain in issue
and listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and a total of ZAR243 million 2018 ZAR Convertible
Bonds remain in issue and listed on the JSE. The residual proceeds from the 2022 Convertible
Bond issue will be used to fund the redemption of the remainder of the 2018 Convertible Bonds
in February 2018 and otherwise for general corporate purposes.

3. Rationale for the Proposed Resolutions

A General Meeting will be held in order for Shareholders to approve the Proposed Resolutions.
If Shareholders do not approve the Proposed Resolutions, the 2022 Convertible Bonds will
remain subject to cash settlement.

Cash settlement of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will require significant cash reserves, which
could constrain Implats’ ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new
projects, fund ongoing business activities, retire or service outstanding debt and pay dividends,
all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.

Subject to the approval of the Specific Authority, each 2022 Convertible Bond will be convertible
into one (1) Ordinary Share at an initial conversion price of US$3.8907 and ZAR50.0092 for the
2022 US$ and 2022 ZAR-denominated Convertible Bonds respectively, representing a 32.5%
premium to the reference share price of US$2.9364 and ZAR37.7428, respectively. At the initial
conversion price, the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon the conversion of the 2022
US$ Convertible Bonds and the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds will be 129 243 832 Ordinary
Shares, representing 17.6% of the number of existing Ordinary Shares in issue (the “Specific
Issue”).

4. Related party transaction

Allan Gray Proprietary Limited (“Allan Gray”) is regarded as a related party (“Related Party”)
in terms of the Listings Requirements as it held, directly or indirectly, more than a 10%
beneficial interest in the Ordinary Shares on the launch date of the offering of the 2022
Convertible Bonds, being 25 May 2017. Allan Gray participated in the 2022 ZAR Convertible
Bond offering, on the same terms as all other participants, and were allocated 2022 ZAR
Convertible Bonds with a nominal amount of ZAR270 million following a bookbuilding process.

In terms of the Listings Requirements, an independent fairness opinion is required given the
potential issue of Ordinary Shares to a Related Party as a result of the conversion of the 2022
ZAR Convertible Bonds. Furthermore, any Related Party that was allocated and issued bonds
pursuant to the 2022 Convertible Bond offering is excluded from voting on the Ordinary
Resolution to be proposed at the Shareholders’ Meeting.

5. Independent fairness opinion and recommendation

PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Finance Proprietary Limited was appointed by the board of
directors of Implats (the “Board”) as the independent professional expert (the “Independent
Professional Expert”) to determine whether the terms and conditions of the Specific Issue are
fair to Shareholders. The Independent Professional Expert has considered the terms and
conditions, including the allocation of 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds to the Related Party, and is
of the opinion that such terms and conditions are fair to Shareholders on the basis set out in the
fairness opinion included in the circular to Shareholders dated 22 June 2017 (the “Circular”).

The Board has considered the terms and conditions, including the participation of the Related
Party, together with the opinion of the Independent Professional Expert and is of the opinion that
the Specific Issue is fair insofar as Shareholders are concerned.

A copy of the Independent Professional Expert’s opinion is included in Annexure 1 of the
Circular as mentioned below.

6. Pro forma financial effects

The pro forma financial information of Implats as set out in this Circular consists of the pro forma
financial effects, the pro forma consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December
2016 and the pro forma consolidated statement of profit and loss and comprehensive income for
the six months ended 31 December 2016. The pro forma financial information is the responsibility
of the Directors and has been prepared to illustrate the effects of:
(i) the Invitation and the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds; and
(ii) the subsequent approval for the issue of Ordinary Shares upon conversion of the 2022
Convertible Bonds,

assuming that the Invitation, the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and the subsequent
approval for the issue of Ordinary Shares upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds took
place on 1 July 2016 for purposes of the pro forma consolidated statement of profit and loss and
comprehensive income and on 31 December 2016 for purposes of the pro forma consolidated
statement of financial position.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not
give a fair reflection of the financial position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash
flows of Implats following the Invitation, the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and the
subsequent approval for the issue of Ordinary Shares upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible
Bonds.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared using accounting principles that are
consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the accounting policies
adopted by Implats in the reviewed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months
ended 31 December 2016. The pro forma financial information is presented in accordance with the
Listings Requirements and the Guide on Pro Forma Financial Information issued by the South
African Institute of Chartered Accountants.

The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the Independent
Reporting Accountant’s assurance report presented in Annexure 2 of the Circular.
The pro forma financial effects illustrate the effects accounting for both the 2022 US$ and
the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds as cash-settled instruments versus accounting for the
2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds as a compound instrument. (Refer t o notes 4, 5 and 7 to
the pro forma consolidated statement of financial position below set out in the Circular.)

Shares on conversion.

2. The “Pro forma after Invitation and issue of 2022 Convertible Bonds” column reflects the pro
   forma impact of the purchase by Implats of the 2018 Convertible Bonds and the issue of the
   2022 Convertible Bonds prior to shareholder approval for the issue of Implats Shares upon
   conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

The effects on basic earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, headline earnings per
share, and diluted headline earnings per share are calculated on the basis that the Invitation
and the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds took place on 1 July 2016, while the effects on
net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share are calculated on the basis that
the Invitation and the issue of 2022 Convertible Bonds took place on 31 December 2016 for
purposes of presenting the pro forma financial effects thereof on Implats, based on the
following assumptions:
 - 88.6% of the 2018 ZAR Convertible Bonds and 85.3% of the 2018 US$ Convertible Bonds are
    settled in terms of the Invitation.
- The 2022 Convertible Bonds are cash-settled instruments.
- At initial recognition, the embedded derivative is valued using option pricing methodologies
    with fair value movements recognised through profit and loss.
- The balance of the cash received is classified as a financial liability at amortised cost.

It should be noted that the pro forma financial effects do not include the earnings effect of the
application of the proceeds from the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds in excess of the cash
required to settle the 2018 Convertible Bonds.

3. The “Pro forma after Invitation and approval for the issue of Implats Shares on conversion”

   Bonds and the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and subsequent approval for the issue
   of Implats Shares upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

The effects on basic earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, headline earnings per
share, and diluted headline earnings per share are calculated on the basis that the Invitation,
the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and the subsequent approval for the issue of Implats
Shares upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds took place on 1 July 2016, while the
effects on net asset value per share and net tangible asset value per share are calculated on
the basis that the Invitation, the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and the subsequent
approval for the issue of Implats Shares upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds took
place on 31 December 2016 for purposes of presenting the pro forma effects thereof on

Implats, based on the following assumptions:
 - The 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds constitutes a compound financial instrument of which the
     liability component is initially recognised at amortised cost.
 - The balance of the cash received is classified as equity.
 - The 2022 US$ Convertible Bonds remain cash-settled instruments with the embedded
   derivative valued using option pricing methodologies with fair value movements recognised
   through profit and loss and the liability component recognised and subsequently measured
   at amortised cost.

 The diluted earnings per share and headline diluted earnings per share does not decrease with
 the issue of the approved 130 million Implats Shares, as the impact is antidilutive on the loss
 per share.

 statement of profit and loss and comprehensive income for the detailed notes and assumptions

IMPLATS ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF INVITATION TO HOLDERS TO OFFER TO SELL
2018 CONVERTIBLE BONDS

Further to its announcement on 25 May 2017, Implats announces that it has concluded its
invitation to holders of its outstanding 2018 Convertible Bonds (as defined below). The Invitation
(as defined below) was made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
invitation term sheets dated 25 May 2017 (the “Invitation Term Sheets”). Capitalised terms
used but not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meaning ascribed to them in the
Invitation Term Sheets.

   -   Outstanding U.S.$200 million 1% convertible bonds with a maturity date of 21 February
       2018 (ISIN: XS0891408469/Common Code:089140846 (the “2018 U.S.$ Convertible
       Bonds”); and

   -   Outstanding ZAR2,672 million 5% convertible bonds with a maturity date of 21 February
       2018 (ISIN: ZAE000175873) (the “2018 ZAR Convertible Bonds” and together with the
       2018 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds, the “2018 Convertible Bonds”).

Implats had invited the holders of the 2018 Convertible Bonds to sell to Implats for cash any and
all of their 2018 Convertible Bonds (the “Invitation”). The purchase price per U.S.$200,000
principal amount of 2018 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds offered and accepted for purchase was
U.S.$200,000. The purchase price per ZAR10,000 minimum denomination of 2018 ZAR
Convertible Bonds offered and accepted for purchase was ZAR10,000. Implats will also make
payment of an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the 2018
Convertible Bonds accepted for purchase, as further described in the Invitation Term Sheets.

The Invitation expired at 4.00 p.m. (London time) on 31 May 2017 (the “Expiration Deadline”).
As of the Expiration Deadline, U.S.$170 million in aggregate principal amount of 2018 U.S.$
Convertible Bonds and ZAR2,429 million in aggregate principal amount of 2018 ZAR
Convertible Bonds have been validly tendered pursuant to the Invitation.

Implats has accepted for purchase all such validly tendered 2018 Convertible Bonds in
accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Invitation Term Sheets subject, without
limitation, to, and conditional upon, the issuance by Implats of ZAR Denominated Senior
Unsecured Convertible Registered Bonds due 2022 and U.S.$ Denominated Convertible Bonds
due 2022 in a combined aggregate principal amount equivalent to approximately U.S.$400
million (the “Financing Condition”). On 26 May 2017, Implats announced the pricing of ZAR
3,250 million 6.375 per cent. Senior Unsecured Convertible Registered Bonds due 2022 and
U.S.$ 250 million 3.25 per cent. Convertible Bonds due 2022 (together, the “2022 Convertible
Bonds”). The 2022 Convertible Bonds are expected to be settled on 6 June 2017 and, as such,
the Financing Condition is expected to be satisfied on such date.

Following settlement of the Invitation, 2018 Convertible Bonds in the aggregate principal
amounts of approximately U.S.$30 million and ZAR243 million will remain outstanding, subject
to the Company’s intention to redeem the 2018 Convertible Bonds that remain outstanding after
the settlement date in full at their principal amount due to 85% or more of the applicable
aggregate principal amount of such bonds originally issued having been purchased pursuant to
the Invitation. Implats will make a separate announcement regarding such redemption of the
2018 Convertible Bonds.

Settlement of the Invitation is expected to occur on or around 6 June 2017. All 2018 Convertible
Bonds repurchased pursuant to the Invitation will be cancelled.

Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited are acting as Joint Dealer Managers in
relation to the Invitation. Lucid Issuer Services Limited is acting as Tender Agent for the 2018

IMPLATS ANNOUNCES FINAL TERMS OF 2022 CONVERTIBLE BOND OFFERINGS

Implats today announces the final terms of a dual offering of ZAR 3,250 million unsecured
convertible bonds due 2022 (the “2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds”) and U.S.$250 million
unsecured convertible bonds due 2022 (the “2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds” and together with
the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds, the “2022 Convertible Bonds” or the “2022 Convertible
Bond Offerings”).

The 2022 Convertible Bonds will be issued and repayable at par. The 2022 ZAR Convertible
Bonds will bear interest at an annual rate of 6.375% and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds will
bear interest at an annual rate of 3.25%. The 2022 Convertible Bonds, subject to the approval of
Implats’ shareholders, will be convertible into ordinary shares of the Company (the “Ordinary
Shares”) in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the 2022 Convertible
Bonds. Absent such approval, holders of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will on conversion receive
a cash amount equal to the value of the underlying Ordinary Shares. The respective initial
conversion prices of U.S.$3.8907 and ZAR 50.0092 were set at a premium of 32.5% above a
reference share price of ZAR 37.7428, being the volume weighted average price of an Ordinary
Share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) between launch and pricing.

Each of the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds will permit
Implats to call such bonds at par plus accrued interest at any time on or after the fourth (4th)
anniversary +21 days of the settlement date, if (i) in the case of the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible
Bonds, the aggregate value of the underlying Ordinary Shares for a specified period of time is
130% or more of the principal amount of the relevant bonds or (ii) in the case of the 2022 ZAR
Convertible Bonds, if the volume weighted average price of an Ordinary Share exceeds 130% of
the conversion price for a specified period of time.
Implats intends to use the net proceeds from the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings to refinance
its outstanding U.S.$200 million 1% convertible bonds due 2018 and ZAR2,672 million 5%
convertible bonds due 2018, thereby significantly enhancing Implats’ short-to-medium term
liquidity in line with its strategy to maintain a strong financial position.

In 2016, Implats put in place four bilateral bank facilities with aggregate capacity of ZAR4.5
billion, which each mature in June 2021. These facilities were structured to allow Implats to be
able to refinance the 2018 Convertible Bonds and are not currently drawn. As originally
structured, , these facilities would not be able to be drawn following the issue of the 2022
Convertible Bonds, however, in line with the strategy to retain a robust liquidity position, Implats
is seeking to retain all or a portion of these facilities. Discussions are therefore well underway
with relationship banks, with ZAR4.0 billion of these facilities already amended to allow them to
remain in place following the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

It is expected that settlement of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will take place on or about 6 June
2017. Implats intends to apply for admission of the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds for trading on
the Main Board of the JSE and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds for trading on a European
stock exchange, in each case within 90 days following settlement of the 2022 Convertible
Bonds.

Following settlement, Implats shareholders will be requested to grant specific authority for the
Board of Implats to issue Ordinary Shares to satisfy conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds
and for certain amendments to be made to the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation to
implement the foregoing. If the shareholder authority has not been granted by 30 November
2017, Implats may, by giving notice no later than 15 dealing days after such date, elect to
redeem all but not some of the 2022 Convertible Bonds at the greater of (i) 102% of the
principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and (ii) 102% of the fair bond value of the 2022
Convertible Bonds, as defined in the terms and conditions of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Finance (Proprietary) Limited (""PwC"") has been appointed
by the Board of Implats as an independent expert to consider the fairness of the relevant
transaction in relation to any related party participation in the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings.

Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch are acting as Sole Global Co-ordinator in relation to the
2022 Convertible Bond Offerings. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited are acting as
Joint Bookrunners and Nedbank Limited, acting through its division, Nedbank CIB and The
Standard Bank of South Africa Limited are acting as Co-Bookrunners. Basis Points Capital
Proprietary Limited is acting as Local Partner to the Joint Bookrunners and Centerview Partners

LAUNCH OF 2022 CONVERTIBLE BOND OFFERINGS AND INVITATION TO HOLDERS TO
OFFER TO SELL 2018 CONVERTIBLE BONDS

Introduction

Implats announces the launch of a dual offering of up to ZAR2,600 million unsecured
convertible bonds due 2022 (the “2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds”) and up to U.S.$300 million
unsecured convertible bonds due 2022 (the “2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds” and together with
the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds, the “2022 Convertible Bonds” or the “2022 Convertible
Bond Offerings”).

Implats intends to use the net proceeds from the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings to refinance
the 2018 Convertible Bonds (as defined below) thereby significantly enhancing Implats’ short-to-
medium term liquidity in line with its strategy to maintain a strong financial position.

The 2018 Convertible Bonds
  -   Outstanding U.S.$200 million 1% convertible bonds with a maturity date of 21 February
      2018 (ISIN: XS0891408469/Common Code:089140846 (the “2018 U.S.$ Convertible
      Bonds”); and
  -   Outstanding ZAR2,672 million 5% convertible bonds with a maturity date of 21 February
      2018 (ISIN: ZAE000175873) (the “2018 ZAR Convertible Bonds” and together with the
      2018 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds, the “2018 Convertible Bonds”).

In conjunction with the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings, Implats is inviting the holders of the
2018 Convertible Bonds to sell to Implats for cash any and all of their 2018 Convertible Bonds
(the “Invitation”). The purchase price per U.S.$200,000 principal amount of 2018 U.S.$
Convertible Bonds offered and accepted for purchase will be U.S.$200,000. The purchase price
per ZAR10,000 minimum denomination of 2018 ZAR Convertible Bonds offered and accepted
for purchase will be ZAR10,000. Implats will also make payment of an amount in respect of
accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the 2018 Convertible Bonds accepted for purchase, as
further described in the Invitation Term Sheet (as defined below).

The acceptance for purchase of the 2018 Convertible Bonds validly tendered pursuant to the
Invitation is subject, without limitation, to, and conditional upon, the issuance by Implats of the
2022 Convertible Bonds in a combined aggregate principal amount equivalent to approximately
U.S.$400 million, as discussed below.

The 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings

The 2022 Convertible Bonds are expected to be issued and repayable at par. The 2022 ZAR
Convertible Bonds are expected to bear interest at an annual rate of between 6.00% and 6.75%
and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds are expected to bear interest at an annual rate of
between 2.875% and 3.625%. The 2022 Convertible Bonds, subject to the approval of Implats’
shareholders, will be convertible into ordinary shares of the Company (the “Ordinary Shares”)
in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.
Absent such approval, holders of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will on conversion receive a cash
amount equal to the value of the underlying Ordinary Shares. The respective initial conversion
prices are expected to be set at a premium of between 30% and 35% above the reference
share price, being the volume weighted average price of an Ordinary Share on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange (“JSE”) between launch and pricing.

Each of the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds will permit
Implats to call such bonds at par plus accrued interest at any time on or after the fourth (4th)
anniversary +21 days of the settlement date, if (i) in the case of the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible
Bonds, the aggregate value of the underlying Ordinary Shares for a specified period of time is
130% or more of the principal amount of the relevant bonds or (ii) in the case of the 2022 ZAR
Convertible Bonds, if the volume weighted average price of an Ordinary Share exceeds 130% of
the conversion price for a specified period of time.

The aggregate issue size of the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings is not expected to exceed
approximately U.S.$450 million, with the Ordinary Shares underlying the 2022 Convertible Bond
Offering not expected to exceed approximately 15% of the Ordinary Shares currently
outstanding.

The 2022 Convertible Bonds will be offered through an accelerated book-building process to
qualifying institutional investors only. The final terms of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will be
announced after pricing, which is expected to be tomorrow.

In 2016, Implats put in place four bilateral bank facilities with aggregate capacity of ZAR4.5
billion, which each mature in June 2021. These facilities were structured to allow Implats to be
able to refinance the 2018 Convertible Bonds and are not currently drawn. As originally
structured, these facilities would not be able to be drawn following the issue of the 2022
Convertible Bonds, however, in line with the strategy to retain a robust liquidity position, Implats
is seeking to retain all or a portion of these facilities. Discussions are therefore well underway
with relationship banks, with ZAR4.0 billion of these facilities already amended to allow them to
remain in place following the issue of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

It is expected that settlement of the 2022 Convertible Bonds will take place on or about 6 June
2017. Implats intends to apply for admission of the 2022 ZAR Convertible Bonds for trading on
the Main Board of the JSE and the 2022 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds for trading on a European
stock exchange, in each case within 90 days following settlement of the 2022 Convertible
Bonds.

Following settlement, Implats shareholders will be requested to grant specific authority for the
Board of Implats to issue Ordinary Shares to satisfy conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds
and for certain amendments to be made to the Company’s Memorandum of Incorporation to
implement the foregoing. If the shareholder authority has not been granted by 30 November
2017, Implats may, by giving notice no later than 15 dealing days after such date, elect to
redeem all but not some only of the 2022 Convertible Bonds at the greater of (i) 102% of the
principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and (ii) 102% of the fair bond value of the 2022
Convertible Bonds, as defined in the terms and conditions of the 2022 Convertible Bonds.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Finance (Proprietary) Limited (“PwC”) has been appointed
by the Board of Implats as an independent expert to consider the fairness of the relevant
transaction in relation to any related party participation in the 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings.

The Invitation

The Invitation is being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
invitation term sheet dated 25 May 2017 (the “Invitation Term Sheet”). Copies of the Invitation
Term Sheet may be obtained from the relevant Tender Agent, whose contact details are set out
at the end of this announcement. Bondholders are requested to read the Invitation Term Sheet
in full before making any decision with respect to the Invitation. Bondholders may wish to obtain
independent professional advice before making any such decision. Capitalised terms used but
not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Invitation
Term Sheet.

The Invitation is expected to expire at 4.00 p.m. (London time) on 31 May 2017 (the “Expiration
Deadline”). Holders of 2018 Convertible Bonds must validly submit tender instructions prior to
the Expiration Deadline in order for such Bonds to be eligible for purchase. Tender instructions
may be submitted (i) in relation to the 2018 U.S.$ Convertible Bonds, to the relevant Tender
Agent via Euroclear Bank SA/NV or Clearstream Banking, S.A. and (ii) in relation to the 2018
ZAR Convertible Bonds, to the relevant Tender Agent and, if such bonds are held in
uncertificated form, to participants of Strate Proprietary Limited in addition to submission to the
Tender Agent. Bondholders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other
intermediary through which they hold 2018 Convertible Bonds whether such intermediary would
require receipt of instructions to participate in or revoke their instructions to participate in the
Invitation before the Expiration Deadline.

Tender instructions will be irrevocable, except in the limited circumstances described in the
Invitation Term Sheet. Any 2018 Convertible Bonds that are not successfully offered for
purchase pursuant to the Invitation will remain outstanding, subject to the Company’s right to
redeem such bonds at their principal amount, at any time, if 85% or more of the applicable
aggregate principal amount of such bonds originally issued shall have been previously
redeemed, exchanged or purchased. Any 2018 Convertible Bonds repurchased pursuant to the
Invitation will be cancelled.

Subject to applicable law and as provided in the Invitation Term Sheet, the Company may, in its
sole discretion, extend, reopen, amend, waive any condition of, or terminate the Invitation at any
time. Details of any such extension, reopening, amendment, waiver or termination will be
announced as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant decision is made and as
required by applicable law.

The acceptance for purchase of the 2018 Convertible Bonds validly tendered pursuant to the
Invitation is subject, without limitation, to, and conditional upon, the issuance by Implats of the
2022 Convertible Bonds in a combined aggregate principal amount equivalent to approximately
U.S.$400 million. Please see “The 2022 Convertible Bond Offerings” above.

Third quarter production report for the period 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017

Johannesburg, 26 April 2017: Implats has today released its third quarter production results for
the period 1 January to 31 March 2017.

Implats’ acting Chief Executive Officer, Gerhard Potgieter, commented, “I am pleased to report
that there has been encouraging progress across the Group in meeting our strategic objectives,
despite persistently low metal prices and a challenging operating environment, including further
community disruptions at our Marula operation. Regrettably, the ongoing community
disruptions and low metal prices have resulted in a further restructuring process at Marula that
could result in large scale job losses at this operation. This is something the business and
economy can ill afford, but remains imperative if we are to protect the financial viability of our
business and preserve jobs as far as possible”.

SAFETY
Implats’ safety strategy remains centred on transforming our safety culture.              This
transformational journey to realising zero harm is supported by various initiatives targeting
effective leadership and compliance with leading safety practices. Regrettably, during the
quarter ended 31 March 2017 the Group experienced three fatal incidents, two at Impala
Rustenburg and one at Marula. This brings the total number of fatalities for the 2017 financial
year to seven. The board of directors of Implats and the management team have extended their
sincere sympathies and support to the families, friends and colleagues of the deceased.

Safe production demands the resolve and commitment of every person in the organisation, as
well as the support and leadership of our representative trade unions and government officials.
Our management team continue to lead this process to transform our safety culture and realise
our safe production objectives. Despite the regrettable loss of life in the quarter under review,
management remains resolute in their endeavours and engagements with all stakeholders to
ensure every work place is free from serious and fatal incidents.


PRODUCTION
Gross refined platinum production for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 decreased by 6.2% to
331 000 platinum ounces, compared to 353 000 platinum ounces in the prior comparable period.
The decline in production during the quarter under review, compared to the prior corresponding
period, is largely as a result of Zimplats material that was released from processing inventory
during the quarter ended 31 March 2016. In addition, community disruptions were experienced
at Marula and Two Rivers during the current quarter, which affected production.

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017, gross refined platinum production increased
by 6.2% to 1.11 million platinum ounces, compared to 1.05 million platinum ounces reported in
the prior comparable period. This increase in production is principally as a result of higher
Impala Refining Services (‘IRS’) production compared to the prior corresponding period, driven
by higher third party receipts in the period under review and some material that was locked-up at
the Rustenburg smelters in the prior comparable period.


Impala
Tonnes milled at Impala Rustenburg increased by 4.5% to 2.15 million tonnes during the quarter
ended 31 March 2017 compared to the previous comparable period. Both quarters were
severely impacted by an underground fire at the 14 Shaft complex, which occurred in January
2016 and caused extensive damage to the decline shaft infrastructure. Repair work was
completed during the current quarter, which will allow the decline section to be recommissioned
during April 2017, with full production expected to be restored from June 2017. Refined platinum
production during the quarter ended 31 March 2017 increased by 12.7% to 160 000 platinum
ounces, benefitting from a release of material that was locked-up in processing inventory during
the first half of the financial year.

Tonnes milled over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 decreased by 9.5% to 7.20
million tonnes, compared to 7.95 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. This decrease
was largely as a result of the temporary closure of the 14 Shaft decline section to effect repairs
after the January 2016 fire, an extended delay in operations at 1 Shaft following a fall-of-ground
fatal incident in May 2016, which resulted in some UG2 panel lengths being resized based on
assessed rock engineering risks and other ongoing regulatory safety stoppages. Refined
platinum production for the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 increased by 2.4% to
479 000 platinum ounces, compared to 468 000 platinum ounces reported for the corresponding
period ended 31 March 2016, which was impacted by some material being locked-up in
processing inventory during the first nine months of 2016 financial year.


Marula
Operational performance at Marula has been severely disrupted by community protest action
during the quarter under review and for the first nine months of the 2017 financial year. The
protest action is directly related to certain community members being dissatisfied with the way in
which the community’s 50% interest in the Makgomo Chrome project is being managed by their
appointed/elected representatives. Production performance during the quarter ended 31 March
2017 was also impacted by the closure of the hybrid mining section at the Clapham shaft during
the review period. As a consequence, tonnes milled decreased by a significant 43.3% to 221
000 tonnes for the quarter ended 31 March 2017, compared to 390 000 tonnes reported in the
prior corresponding period. Platinum in concentrate for the quarter consequently decreased by
47.0% to 9 000 platinum ounces (17 000 platinum ounces in the quarter ended 31 March 2016).
Tonnes milled over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 decreased by 11.4% to
1.13 million tonnes, compared to 1.28 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. In line
with this, platinum in concentrate for the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 declined
11.9% to 52 000 platinum ounces (59 000 platinum ounces in the nine-month period ended 31
March 2016).

Despite ongoing engagement with all stakeholders to restore operational continuity and secure
the financial sustainability of the operation, continued community protest action and persistently
low metal prices have now necessitated a fundamental restructuring of the business in order to
secure the financial viability of the operation in the current operating environment. As a result,
Marula has given notice to the regulator and representative trade union in terms of Section 189A
of the Labour Relations Act of its intention to restructure the operation in a process that may
impact more than 1,000 job opportunities. The formal engagement process commenced on 28
March 2017 and will jointly explore initiatives that seek to minimise job losses as far as possible,
this process is envisaged to be concluded before the end of the 2017 financial year.


Zimplats
Tonnes milled during the quarter ended 31 March 2017 decreased by 4.8% to 1.57 million
tonnes compared to 1.65 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. Platinum production
in matte for the quarter under review was 25.8% lower at 66 000 ounces platinum, compared to
89 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period, which was abnormally high as a result of a
release of stockpiled material during the quarter ended 31 March 2016 following a furnace
outage in May 2015.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 increased by 2.2% to
4.87 million tonnes, compared to 4.77 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. Platinum
in matte for the nine months ended 31 March 2017 was 7.7% lower at 203 000 ounces,
compared to 220 000 platinum ounces in the prior comparable period, due to the stockpiled
material released during the quarter ended 31 March 2016.


Mimosa
Tonnes milled at Mimosa during the quarter ended 31 March 2017 was largely unchanged at
670 000 tonnes (676 000 tonnes in the prior corresponding period). Consequently, platinum in
concentrate production for the quarter was maintained at 30 000 ounces platinum.

Tonnes milled during the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 increased by 2.5% to 2.04
million tonnes, compared to 1.99 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. The increased
throughput yielded 1.1% higher platinum in concentrate production of 91 000 platinum ounces,
compared to 90 000 platinum ounces reported in the prior corresponding period.
Two Rivers
Tonnes milled decreased 5.9% to 868 000 tonnes for the quarter ended 31 March 2017
(922 000 tonnes in the prior corresponding period) due to community protest action in the area,
unrelated to the mine, but which unfortunately prevented employees from reporting for duty.
Platinum in concentrate production for the quarter consequently declined by 12.2% to 43 000
ounces platinum (49 000 ounces in the prior corresponding period).

During the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017 tonnes milled were maintained at 2.62
million tonnes, compared to the prior comparable period. Consequently, platinum in concentrate
production remained largely unchanged at 140 000 ounces platinum when compared to 141 000
platinum ounces reported in the prior comparable period.



IRS
Refined platinum production for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 was 18.6% lower at 171 000
ounces platinum compared to the prior corresponding period. This was a direct result of lower
receipts during the quarter from Zimplats, Marula and Two Rivers.

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2017, production increased by 9.4% to 631 000
platinum ounces, compared to 577 000 ounces in the prior comparable period. This increase is
largely attributed to higher receipts from third-party customers.



LEADERSHIP
Nico Muller joined the organisation and assumed his role as new Group Chief Executive Officer
from 3 April 2017.



OUTLOOK
Implats’ full year production guidance is maintained at 1.50 million refined platinum ounces and
unit cost is expected to be approximately R22 600 per platinum ounce (previously guided at
R22 200 per platinum ounce). The increase in unit cost guidance is principally informed by
lower than expected production from Marula as a result of further community disruptions and the
costs associated with the Section 189A process at this operation. There is also an additional
impact from a weaker projected rand/dollar exchange rate which will influence the rand unit cost
guidance at Zimplats.
The third quarter production report for the period 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017 has not been
reviewed and reported on by the external auditors of Implats.

Commentary
Introduction
The first half of financial year 2017 was characterised by an ongoing focus on the Group’s strategic response to
succeed in the continued low price environment and challenging operating conditions. Increased production and good cost
management were a feature at most operations over the past six months, with Impala Refining Services again delivering robust
cash flows. Safety remains our first priority and given the difficult 12 months experienced by Impala Rustenburg,
significant efforts continue to transform the safety culture at this operation.

Market review (all references to years in this section refer to calendar years unless otherwise stated)
The platinum market experienced a fifth consecutive fundamental deficit in 2016. The deficit this year was an
approximate 700 000 ounces and a further deficit of around 450 000 ounces is expected in 2017 provided investment demand is
maintained. The reduced deficit expected in 2017 is largely due to a modest decrease in industrial demand and declining
platinum jewellery demand in China, moderated by primary supply constraints from South Africa. 

We estimate that by the end of 2017, supply deficits experienced since 2012 will have consumed approximately four
million ounces of platinum from above-ground stocks. Sustained demand in key market sectors, together with a more muted
supply outlook from the South African producers should support improved market fundamentals into the future.

Platinum, palladium and rhodium all showed positive gains in 2016, closing 3.3%, 23.5% and 16.6% higher at US$907,
US$676 and US$770 per ounce, respectively. This is in stark contrast to 2015, where platinum, palladium and rhodium traded
28%, 31% and 41% lower respectively. The average platinum price realised during the period under review was 7.1% higher
at US$1 015 per ounce compared to the previous comparable period, while palladium increased by 11.4% to US$680 per
ounce. Support for platinum came from a combination of rising vehicle sales in Western Europe, which grew for the third
consecutive year in 2016, investment demand in Japan and constrained PGM output from South Africa. 

Palladium performed well on the back of increasing vehicle sales in China and the US. The rhodium price traded 16.3%
lower during the period under review averaging US$672 per ounce, despite increased demand from the automotive and
chemical industries.

Calendar year 2016 was positive for the automotive industry, with global light duty vehicle sales estimated to have
reached 93 million units on the back of continued growth in the US, Western Europe and China, despite a slowdown in sales
in Japan, Eastern Europe and Latin America. US light duty vehicle sales, which were largely sustained at 17.51 million
units, continue to be driven by low gasoline prices, widespread credit availability, an increase in leasing and
employment gains. Western European light duty vehicles demand was better than expected after the Brexit vote. Sales in this
region reached 13.95 million units, a 5.8% increase from 2015. Chinese light duty vehicle sales recorded a 14.9% year-on-year
growth reaching 24.38 million units. This was stimulated, in part, by tax cuts on small-engine vehicles. The Japanese
market was the exception with a decline of 1.5% to 4.97 million units in 2016. However, there are signs that this market
may be recovering demonstrated by 7.4% and 7.6% improvements in sales during November and December 2016 respectively. 

Despite strong growth in the automotive sector and the continued adoption of stricter emission legislation globally,
the continued preference for palladium over platinum in catalyst systems remains a concern and is not sustainable in our
view. The automotive sector needs to align long-term use with the ratio in which the metals are mined to ensure
sustainable supply, which will require automakers to switch back to platinum in the near future. Current platinum/palladium
price differentials are at a six year high, providing strong financial impetus for such switching. 

The Chinese market remains the major consumer of platinum jewellery globally. Structural changes in the Chinese
economy have impacted consumer behaviour and indications are that platinum jewellery retail sales may have dropped by as 
much as 9% during 2016. However, other markets have offset some of the declines from China, particularly in India, which 
has grown by 23%. In Japan, platinum jewellery continues to recover market share from white gold and is expected to have
grown by 1% during 2016. The US market experienced strong growth, capitalising on the low platinum price, and is estimated
to have grown by approximately 6% in 2016.

We continue to support the Platinum Guild International (PGI). Its stated strategy aims to arrest the decline in Chinese 
jewellery demand by aligning its marketing efforts to the changing socio-economic landscape in China. Initiatives include
among others, targeting gem set, branded collections and higher sales volumes. 

The platinum and palladium Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) both experienced liquidations during 2016. Palladium liquidations were 
significant at 640 000 ounces, largely due to strong market fundamentals and rising metal prices, which incentivised profit 
taking. Platinum experienced strong investment demand for small bars and coins in Japan, with accumulative investment of 
approximately 425 000 ounces during 2016, offsetting a modest 9 000 ounce ETF liquidation during the year. The World Platinum 
Investment Council (WPIC) continues to prioritise strategic partnerships and investment products that will incentivise and 
sustain future investment demand.
 
The platinum paper markets (NYMEX/TOCOM) remained relatively stable during 2016, with a modest 65 000 ounce decline.
Palladium, however, followed its strong physical supply/demand fundamentals and recorded an increase of 710 000 ounces
during the year.

The market fundamentals for platinum, palladium and rhodium remain well supported by resilient global demand and constrained 
primary supply. Near-term, growing and unsustainable deficits in palladium will further underpin this market, and also support 
platinum and rhodium as consumers seek to optimise their metal mix into the future. Fundamental deficits for both platinum and 
palladium are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 

Safety review
The realisation of zero harm remains the Group’s key priority and the strategic focus is centred on a cultural transformation 
among employees, supported by effective leadership, supervision and compliance with leading safety practices to create an 
inherently safe working environment. Success demands a strong resolve from every employee and the leadership of representative 
unions and government. To this end, management continues to engage with all stakeholders and is leading the process with the 
ultimate goal of having every workplace free from serious injury and fatal incident. 

Over the past five years, the Group has invested significantly in safety initiatives, resulting in significant improvements in 
safety performance across all operational units - with many setting new safety records. Currently, Implats has 13 safety 
""millionaire"" sites, 12 of which have operated for more than two years without a fatal incident, including four with over four 
years and three who have worked for over 15 years without a fatal incident.

Despite a keen focus on safe operational performance, safety remains a significant challenge for some of the Rustenburg mining 
operations. In particular, multiple fatalities at 14 Shaft and 1 Shaft during the past 12 months had a significant impact on our 
safe production efforts. While no fatal incidents were recorded across other Group operations, regrettably four employees 
suffered fatal injuries at Impala Rustenburg during the six months ended 31 December 2016 (three in the first quarter and one in 
the second). The board of directors and the management team express their sincere condolences to the friends, families and 
colleagues of the deceased.

Targeted behaviour change programmes continue to be implemented across the Rustenburg operation and training in high
risk occupations including rock drill operators (RDO), scraper winch operators, panel operators, loco operators and TMM
operators has been completed. The desired safe work behaviours are now being entrenched. In addition, a comprehensive
multi-stakeholder health and safety awareness campaign was conducted at the Rustenburg operation. Management will continue
to boost safe production compliance and drive the change from a dependent to an interdependent culture, where every
employee looks after their own safe behaviour and the safety of others. In addition, employees who have an elevated risk of
experiencing a safety incident due to ill health, emotional and financial concerns or are compromised are identified,
monitored and assisted to mitigate against further safety incidents.

Strategic response
Several initiatives were announced in February 2015 in response to persistently low US dollar metal prices. Key
strategic objectives included cost optimisation, reprioritising and rescheduling capital expenditure, implementing the Impala
lease area strategy, which aims to transform Rustenburg into a more concentrated mining operation, and strengthening the
Group balance sheet. 

The reduction in operating costs realised a saving of about R1.4 billion in 2016. Further initiatives are being
pursued to contain costs below inflation. Despite the impact on production as a result of the 14 Shaft fire and other
safety-related incidents, Group unit costs benefited from increased production volumes, as well as cost containment in response
to low dollar metal prices, increasing by only 1.9% to R22 797 per platinum ounce in the period under review from R22 380 in 
the prior comparable period.

Capital expenditure remains a focus area and the estimated spend for financial year 2017 is R4.0 billion. In the first
six months R1.6 billion was spent, a 15.9% reduction from the previous comparable period (H1 FY2016: R1.9 billion). The
majority of the capex was spent at Impala (R1.2 billion) - mainly on the completion of 16 and 20 shafts in Rustenburg -
and projects at Zimplats (R353 million). The new shafts at the Rustenburg operations still require R2.0 billion to
complete, of which some R1.2 billion is expected to be spent in the current financial year.

Operational review
Zimplats, Two Rivers, Mimosa and Impala Refining Services (IRS) all delivered good operational performances. Difficult
operating environments challenged the performance at both Impala Rustenburg and Marula. Gross refined platinum production 
during the six months to 31 December 2016 increased by 12.5% to 778 500 ounces, compared to 692 100 ounces in the previous 
comparable period. This was largely due to a lock-up of platinum to accommodate planned furnace maintenance at the
Rustenburg smelters in the previous comparable period. 

Managed operations
IMPALA PLATINUM
Mill throughput decreased by 14.4% to 5.0 million tonnes (H1 FY2016: 5.9 million). This was largely due to the temporary 
closure of the decline section at 14 Shaft to effect repairs after the January 2016 fire, a delay in operations at 1
Shaft following the fall-of-ground incident in May 2016, reduced UG2 panel lengths and ongoing regulatory safety stoppages. 
Re-establishing the decline section at 14 Shaft has progressed well and full infrastructure capacity is expected by
March 2017. The resizing of the UG2 conventional panel lengths across the operation in line with assessed ground conditions 
and to significantly reduce the operational risk, has been completed. 
 
Approximately 39 000 ounces of platinum (600 000 mined tonnes) were lost due to repair work at 14 Shaft during the six
months under review. The number of Section 54 safety stoppage instructions issued by the Department of Mineral Resources 
(DMR) posed a significant challenge for the Rustenburg team. During the period under review, Impala recorded 58 Section 
54 safety stoppages, which led to a direct loss of some 25 000 platinum ounces (400 000 mined tonnes), equating to
about R570 million in lost revenue. While Impala remains mindful of the safety issues that have affected its operations
over recent months, it continues to engage with the DMR to minimise the negative impacts of these stoppages on its safety
risk profile and operational performance. 

Mill head grade was maintained at 4.15 g/t, despite a higher percentage of UG2 material treated during the period
under review. The additional Merensky Reef tonnage from the recommissioned 14 Shaft decline section, as well as the ongoing
ramp-up of production volumes from 16 and 20 shafts, will contribute to increasing mill head grades in the near future.

Refined platinum production decreased by 2.2% to 318 700 ounces (H1 FY2016: 325 900), due to a higher build-up of
processed material in the previous comparable period. The material built up in the period under review is expected to be
released by the fourth quarter.

Cash costs were well contained increasing by only 2.1% to R7.43 billion compared to expected mining inflation of 7.2%.
Lower production volumes offset the beneficial impact of various cost saving initiatives and unit costs increased by
4.4% to R23 304 per platinum ounce refined (H1FY2016: R22 326). Capital expenditure was reduced by 19.3% to R1.20 billion
(H1 FY2016: R1.48 billion), of which R581 million was spent on 16 and 20 shafts. The overall reduction was mainly due to
the deferment of ongoing capital and 17 Shaft being on low cost care and maintenance.

16 and 20 shafts are still scheduled to deliver combined annual production of 310 000 platinum ounces.

Impala remains focused on meeting its build-up target on stoping teams and delivering planned team efficiencies, while
delivering safe production to minimise avoidable work stoppages. A mining optimisation project was initiated with
external support to interrogate the mining cycle, supervisory management skills, change management and the contractor
strategy with the goal of securing and/or enhancing production from the shafts. This work started in January 2017 and is
expected to continue for nine months.

IMPALA REFINING SERVICES (IRS)
IRS remains a strategic competitive advantage for Implats and it once again contributed significantly to the Group’s
bottom line, despite low PGM prices. Over the six months to 31 December 2016, production increased 25.6% to 459 800
ounces of platinum from 366 200 ounces.

Platinum production from mine-to-market operations increased by 7.4% to 310 800 ounces (H1 FY2016: 289 300), due to
higher deliveries from Zimplats and Two Rivers. Third-party purchases and toll volumes increased from 76 900 to 149 000
platinum ounces, largely as a result of a release of in-process metal, while there was also a build-up in the previous
comparable period. 

ZIMPLATS
Tonnes milled increased by 6% to 3.3 million tonnes (H1 FY2016: 3.1 million) as all mining units sustained outstanding
operational performances and benefited from increased production from the Mupfuti and Bimha mines. Platinum in matte
production (including concentrate sales to IRS) increased 5.2% to 137 100 ounces (H1 FY2016: 130 300). 

Unit costs increased 2.0% in dollar terms to US$1 233 per platinum ounce in matte (H1 FY2016: US$1 209). In rand terms
unit costs increased 6.6% to R17 316 per platinum ounce in matte (H1 FY2016: R16 247) impacted by a weaker rand over
the period. 

The redevelopment of the Bimha Mine is progressing well, with on-reef development offsetting re-establishment costs,
and full production, which will replace all current open pit operations, is expected from April 2018. The development of
the 2.2 million tonnes per annum Mupani mine was approved by the Zimplats and Implats Boards in November 2016. This
replacement portal for the Rukodzi and Ngwarati mines will access 4.65 million 4E ounces of reserves through
high-productivity, modern, mechanised mining methods at a total capital cost of US$260 million. 

Implats supports and shares Zimbabwe’s aspirations to grow and diversify its PGM industry. A bankable feasibility
study for a second furnace has been approved and construction will commence as soon as management believes the construction
can be funded from internal cashflows. 

Zimplats remains in discussions with the Government of Zimbabwe regarding its indigenisation implementation plan.
Zimplats has recently announced the implementation of an employee share ownership trust (ESOT), which now holds a 10% equity
stake in Zimplats’ operating subsidiary, Zimbabwe Platinum Mines (Private) Limited (Zimplats Pvt). The beneficiaries
are the permanent employees (excluding the executive directors and company secretary). The ESOT paid US$95 million for the
10% equity stake, vendor financed through an interest-bearing loan advanced by Zimplats Pvt to the ESOT. The ESOT will
repay the loan from a portion of dividends received from Zimplats Pvt.

MARULA
The operational performance at Marula was disrupted by members of the Winnaarshoek/Driekop community, who are
dissatisfied with the way in which their 50% interest in the Makgomo Chrome project is being managed by appointed/elected
community leaders. Members from the community applied to the DMR to intervene and, subsequent to the period under review, the
chrome operation has been suspended.

Despite these disruptions, which resulted in a loss of 5 600 ounces of platinum in concentrate, tonnes milled
increased 2.5% to 909 000 tonnes (H1 FY2016: 887 000). The head grade improved marginally to 4.42 g/t (H1 FY2016: 4.37 g/t)
benefiting from the optimisation initiative at Marula. Consequently, platinum in concentrate production increased 3.1% to 43
100 ounces (H1 FY2016: 41 800). 

Unit costs increased 7.3% to R24 060 per platinum ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2016: R22 416). Capital expenditure was
limited to R58 million (H1 FY2016: R42 million) in an effort to preserve cash.

The optimisation of Marula’s existing infrastructure enables the mine to increase its targeted output to 90 000 ounces
of platinum per annum. However, community disruptions continue to impact the successful implementation of the optimisation 
strategy. Stakeholder interventions to facilitate a resolution to the community disruptions are being prioritised by
management.

Non-managed operations
MIMOSA
Mimosa delivered another excellent operational performance. Tonnes milled improved 4.3% to 1.37 million tonnes (H1
FY2016: 1.31 million), while the head grade declined 2.4% to 3.83 g/t. This resulted in platinum in concentrate production
increasing to 60 900 ounces (H1 FY2016: 60 000). Unit costs increased 5.0% in dollar terms to US$1 539 per platinum
ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2016: US$1 466) due to higher mined tonnage that was not milled.

A further deferment of the 15% export levy on unbeneficiated platinum to 1 January 2018 has been regularised by the
Government of Zimbabwe. Mimosa continues to consult with the Government of Zimbabwe in this regard.

TWO RIVERS 
Two Rivers also had a first-rate six months. Tonnes milled increased 2.8% to 1.75 million tonnes (H1 FY2016: 1.70
million), of which 58 700 tonnes was milled by Modikwa. The head grade was marginally lower at 4.03 g/t (H1 FY2016: 4.09
g/t). Platinum in concentrate production increased by 5.3% to 96 700 ounces (H1 FY2016: 91 800). Unit costs increased 6.6%
to R12 172 per platinum ounce in concentrate (H1 FY2016: R11 416). 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
There has been no material change to the technical assumptions, assessment criteria, and information relating to the
Group’s Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves, or legal title to its mining and exploration activities, as disclosed in
the integrated report for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.

Main features relating to Implats’ Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as at 31 December 2016 relative to 30 June
2016 are:
- Estimated total attributable Mineral Resources decreased by 1% (3 Moz 4E) to 362Moz; the total attributable platinum
  ounces decreased by 1.5 Moz Pt to 193 Moz
- The attributable platinum Mineral Resources remain dominated by Zimplats and Impala; the Zimplats Mineral Resources
  make up the bulk of these (49%)
- Total attributable Mineral Reserves increased by 9% (4 Moz 4E) to 43 Moz; the attributable platinum ounces increased
  by 2 Moz to 23.6 Moz
- The main contributor to the variance in Mineral Reserves is the inclusion of Portal 6 (Mupani mine) at Zimplats.

The revised Implats Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve statement, as at 30 June 2017, will provide the detailed
updated assessment and reporting criteria. 

After the end of the period under review, on 13 January 2017, the Government of Zimbabwe issued, through a Government
Gazette Extraordinary, a preliminary notice in terms of which the Government has given fresh notice it intends to
compulsorily acquire land measuring 27 948 hectares within Zimplats’ special mining lease area. The new notice has repealed
all previous notices issued by the government in respect of its proposed compulsory acquisition of this portion of the
mining lease area. Zimplats lodged an objection on 10 February 2017 and is engaging positively with the Government of
Zimbabwe in this regard.

Financial performance
Revenue at R18.2 billion was R1.4 billion or 8.3% higher than the comparative six months as a result of:
- A negative volume variance of R75 million. The negative variance is due to an inventory draw down for the six months
  to December 2015, which was not repeated in the six months under review, partially offset by higher production volumes.
- A positive dollar metal price variance of R714 million resulting from the average dollar revenue basket per platinum
  ounce sold of about US$1 775, which was about US$151 or 9.3% higher than the comparative period. The average prices
  achieved for platinum and palladium were 4.8% and 6.6% higher, while rhodium and nickel dollar prices were 16.3% and 
  6.4% lower.
- A positive R749 million exchange rate variance was the result of the average rand-dollar exchange rate of R14.04/US$
  being approximately 4.5% weaker than the R13.45/US$ achieved during the prior comparable period. 

The average 4.5% depreciation in the value of the South African rand benefited the rand revenue basket per platinum
ounce, which rose 14.1% to R24 921.

Cost of sales at R18.5 billion increased by R1.7 billion from the comparable six months. The main contributors to this
increase were:
- An increase in operating costs of R546 million or 5.0% to R11.5 billion. The increase of 5.0% was contained below the
  mining inflation of 5.8%, comprising South African operations mining inflation of 7.2% and Zimplats rand inflation 
  which was at 0.9%;
- A share-based compensation expense of R79 million compared to a credit of R138 million in the previous comparable
  period;
- An increase in the cost of metals purchased of R717 million as a result of higher volumes purchased by IRS and higher
  rand metal prices.

As a result of the above, the Group generated a gross loss for the period of R318 million (H1 FY2016: R40 million
gross loss). 

The R411 million loss before tax was an improvement from the comparable period’s pre-tax loss of R552 million, largely
due to an impairment charge of R257 million in the prior period. The pre-tax loss for both periods was not materially
impacted by exchange rate movements on the dollar bond due to the effectiveness of the hedge.

The major reason for the decline in headline earnings (a loss of R508 million compared to profit of R347 million for
the period to December 2015), was a tax credit in the comparable period due to a previously written-off amount owed by a
debtor. 

Cash generated from operations (before changes in working capital) improved from R1.2 billion to R1.8 billion. An
increase in inventories of R1.2 billion and trade and other receivables of R230 million were largely responsible for the
reduction in cash from operations (after changes in working capital) to R446 million (H1 FY2016: R1 454 million). The
increase in inventories on the balance sheet was affected by an increased net realisable value adjustment of some R660
million. 

Capital expenditure, amounted to R1.6 billion, of which R581 million was spent on 16 and 20 shafts.

Gross cash at the end of the period under review amounted to R5.4 billion. Debt (excluding leases and net of the cross
currency interest rate swap) amounted to R6.5 billion resulting in net debt at 31 December 2016 of R1.1 billion (June
2016: R19 million cash net of debt).

The balance sheet remains strong with unutilised facilities of R4.75 billion, R4.0 billion of which is available until
2021. This liquidity provides security and flexibility to address upcoming debt maturities as well as to service the
ongoing needs of the business.

Given the continued cash conservation strategy, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend for the six
months to 31 December 2016.

Prospects
Looking ahead, the challenges and uncertainties confronting the southern African PGM mining industry remain
significant and will continue to constrain primary metal supply.

Aligned with the forecasts for strong global demand for these metals - supported by growing vehicle sales, tightening
emission standards and the growing unsustainable use of palladium in automotive catalytic systems - the Group expects
fundamental market deficits to persist. This, coupled with reduced above-ground stock liquidity, bodes well for much
healthier future supply/demand fundamentals. However, near-term metal prices could remain muted given persistent global
political and economic factors impacting investor sentiment. 

Against this outlook, the board recently approved the construction of the Mupani replacement mine at Zimplats, as well
as modernisation and detailed re-scheduling studies to restart the 17 Shaft replacement project at Impala Rustenburg in
two years’ time. 

Despite a more positive market outlook, the operating environment in southern Africa remains fluid and challenging,
particularly at the more labour-intensive South African mines where safety challenges and community disruptions continue
to impede optimum performance. 

Within this environment, Implats will continue to prioritise measures to achieve the Group’s safe production goals
(zero harm), preserve cash, enhance productivity and increase profitability. To this end, the Group will continue
implementing its strategic response plan, which has already yielded significant improvements, realised material cost 
savings and secured the Group’s balance sheet. Further measures to bed down improvements and strengthen our response to the
challenging operating environment have been introduced, specifically at Impala Rustenburg where external technical capacity 
has been secured to regain lost momentum after the recent safety incidents. The intervention targets safe production and
mining efficiencies to ensure the transition to a more concentrated, low-cost operation producing at least 800 000 platinum
ounces a year from 2020.

Given the severe impact of safety stoppages at Impala Rustenburg and the community disruptions at Marula in the first
half of the financial year, the full-year production estimates for these operations have been revised to 650 000 refined
platinum ounces and 80 000 platinum ounces in concentrate, respectively. The guidance for Zimplats, Two Rivers and
Mimosa remains unchanged at 260 000 ounces platinum in matte, and 175 000 and 115 000 ounces of platinum in concentrate,
respectively.

Gross refined platinum ounces for the Group is expected to reach 1.5 million ounces of platinum for the full financial
year.

Unit costs are expected to be approximately R22 200 per platinum ounce for the full financial year with Group capital
expenditure forecast at about R4 billion.

The financial information on which this outlook is based has not been reviewed and reported on by Implats’ external
auditors.

Change in leadership
The board of directors has expressed its appreciation to Terence Goodlace for his significant contribution and guidance 
to the Group. Terence resigned as chief executive and executive director with effect from 1 December 2016. Nico Muller
has been appointed as chief executive and an executive director of Implats with effect from 3 April 2017.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report On Interim Financial Statements

To the Shareholders of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited in the
accompanying interim report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December
2016 and the related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the
six months then ended, and selected explanatory notes.

Directors’ Responsibility for the Interim Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial
Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements. We conducted our review in
accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of interim financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform
procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and
applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures in a review are substantially less than and differ in nature from those performed in an audit conducted
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these
interim financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of Impala Platinum Holdings Limited for the six months ended 31 December 2016 
are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34
Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and

Capital commitment
Capital expenditure approved at 31 December 2016 amounted to R8 434 (December 2015: R8 139) (June 2016: R7 165)
million, of which R1 969 (December 2015: R1 611) (June 2016: R1 254) million is already committed. This expenditure 
will be funded from internal cash flows and, if necessary, from borrowings. 

Impairment

6. Derivative financial instrument 
Implats entered into a Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) amounting to US$200 million to hedge certain aspects
of the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible bonds (note 9), being: exchange rate risk on dollar interest
payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds at a rand-dollar exchange rate weaker than R9.24/US$. 
(US$200 million was swapped for R1 848 million on which Implats pays a fixed interest rate to Standard Bank of 5.94%. 
Implats receives the 1% coupon on the US$200 million from Standard Bank on the same date which Implats pays bond holders. 
In February 2018, Implats will repay the R1 848 million in return of the US$200 million.)

The CCIRS with Standard Bank is carried at its fair value of R907 (December 2015: R1 311) (June 2016: R1 137) million. 
No hedge accounting has been applied.

The write-down to net realisable value comprises R159 (December 2015: R233) (June 2016: R106) million for refined
mining metal and R1 167 (December 2015: R555) (June 2016: R558) million for in-process mining metal.

Included in refined metal is metal on lease to third parties of 36 000 (December 2015: 36 000) (June 2016: 36 000)
ruthenium ounces.

Changes in engineering estimates of metal contained in-process resulted in an increase in-process metal of R356
(December 2015: R379) (June 2016: R384) million.

Non-mining metal consists mainly of IRS inventory. No inventories are encumbered.

8. Discontinued operation
The Implats board resolved to attempt to dispose of the Group’s 65% stake in Impala Platinum Chrome Proprietary
Limited (Impala Chrome). At the end of the reporting period, an official process to secure a buyer had commenced and
management consider it highly likely that the sale will be concluded within the next 12 months. Impala Chrome is therefore
presented as a discontinued operation.

The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within Impala Chrome are as follows:

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

Shareholders are advised that Implats’ headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the half year ended 31
December 2016 is expected to be a loss of between 65 and 79 cents per share compared to the half year
ended 31 December 2015 HEPS profit of 53 cents.

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be a loss of between 48 and 58 cents per share compared to
half year ended 31 December 2015 EPS profit of 31 cents.

The difference between EPS and HEPS for the six months to 31 December 2016 is primarily due to the
insurance compensation received from the 14 Shaft fire incident in January 2016.

The major reason for the decline in HEPS from the comparative period is that the prior period included a
tax credit due to a write-off of an amount owed by a debtor. HEPS from continuing operations for the
current year will be further negatively affected by 10 – 15 cents a share when the Group’s share of profit
after tax from Impala Chrome (Pty) Limited is eliminated as “discontinued operations profit” due to the
Group’s stake in this entity being up for sale.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats. The Group’s reviewed interim financial results for the period ended
31 December 2016 will be released on 23 February 2017.

First quarter production report for the period 1 July to 30 September 2016

Johannesburg, 28 October 2016:

Implats’ CEO, Terence Goodlace, commented, “Our growth momentum in platinum production,
which started last year, has continued following a 20% increase in output over the last quarter.
Impala Rustenburg was, however, affected by safety stoppages, but the production for the
upcoming December quarter is expected to normalise due to the continued high level of focus on
improving safety through key initiatives and enhanced dialogue with the DMR and AMCU, as
well as the resumption of full production at 1 Shaft. Progress on the re-establishment of safe
production at Rustenburg’s fire-affected 14 Shaft is on plan and cold commissioning of the
conveyor belt and its associated infrastructure in the upper part of the decline section has
commenced. Zimplats has continued to excel from a health, safety and production perspective
and the bankable feasibility work for the development of portal 6 has been completed. The final
Implats Board submission for this project is planned for November 2016.”

SAFETY
Implats remains committed to ensuring zero harm and the Group’s safety strategy is premised
on safe behaviour, an inherently safe work environment and leading safety practices. During the
quarter ended 30 September 2016 all operations and business units other than three of the
shafts at Impala Rustenburg did not have any fatal incidents.

Safe production and zero harm requires the resolve and commitment of every person in the
organisation, the leadership of our representative unions and government. Management
remains resolute in their engagements with all our stakeholders and is leading this process in
pursuit of our goal to ensure every work place is free from serious and fatal incidents.

PRODUCTION
Gross refined platinum production during the quarter increased by 20.0% to 365 200 ounces,
compared to 304 100 ounces achieved in the prior corresponding period. This was primarily due
to sustained good operational performances from Zimplats, Marula, Mimosa, Two Rivers and
Impala Refining Services (IRS), and the impact of planned furnace maintenance at the Impala
Rustenburg smelters last year.
Impala Rustenburg
A five month long comprehensive multi-stakeholder, multimedia health and safety awareness
campaign was launched throughout Impala Rustenburg in July 2016. In addition the critical safe
behaviours programme continues to gain impetus for 17 000 employees employed in five key
occupations throughout the property. It was then with deep regret that even with all of this
health and safety focus Mr Lucas Chauke was fatally injured in a fall of ground incident at Impala
12 Shaft, Mr Ernesto Uainda sustained fatal injuries in an underground locomotive tramming
incident at Impala 20 Shaft, and Mr Joseph Kekgaretswa was fatally injured while doing shaft
maintenance work at Impala 7 Shaft. The Board of directors (‘the Board”) of Implats and the
management team have extended their very sincere sympathies and support to the family,
friends and colleagues of our departed employees.

Tonnes milled were 18.6% lower than the previous comparable quarter at 2.43 million tonnes,
largely as a result of production lost due to Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) safety
stoppages (approximately 300 000 tonnes), delayed production build-up at Impala 1 Shaft
following a fall-of-ground safety incident in May 2016, a decision to re-size the UG2 conventional
panel widths across the operation in line with assessed ground conditions to significantly reduce
the operational risk, and production lost from the Impala 14 Shaft decline section, which remains
closed after the conveyor infrastructure was damaged in an underground conveyor fire in
January 2016.

The production impact as a result of the build-up at Impala Rustenburg’s 1 Shaft and re-sizing
the UG2 conventional panel widths is anticipated to be limited to the first quarter’s performance
and is not expected to materially affect performance in the second quarter. Repair work at the
14 Shaft decline section is progressing according to plan with the first production section
expected to be recommissioned ahead of schedule by the end of October 2016, with full mining
capacity planned to be restored from March 2017.

Additional Merensky Reef tonnage from the recommissioned 14 Shaft decline system and
continued build-up from 16 Shaft and 20 Shaft will benefit full year planned production.

Refined platinum production at Impala Rustenburg increased by 22.0% to 150 600 ounces,
compared to 123 400 platinum ounces produced in the comparable quarter last year, which was
impacted by planned smelter maintenance.

Zimplats
Zimplats reported zero lost time injuries for the quarter and mill throughput increased by 5.5% to
1.70 million tonnes, compared to 1.61 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period, largely as
a result of increased production from the South open pit and Bimha Mine. Platinum in matte
production consequently increased by 3.6% to 68 400 ounces, compared to 66 000 ounces in
the prior corresponding period a year ago.
The bankable feasibility study for the development of a 2.2 million tonnes per annum
replacement portal system for the Rukodzi and the Ngwarati mines has been completed and this
project will be submitted to the Boards of Zimplats and Implats for their consideration in
November 2016. Once approved, the planned US$260 million project will access 4.65 million 4E
ounces of reserves through high productivity modern mechanised mining methods. Preliminary
early works related to accessing and excavating the box cut position commenced in the quarter.
Full project details will be released once the Implats Board approval processes have been
completed.

Marula
Marula reported zero fatal incidents for the quarter and tonnes milled increased by 1.4% to
446 000 tonnes, compared to 440 000 tonnes in the prior corresponding period. This increase
was achieved despite significant sporadic community protest disruptions during the quarter,
which resulted in a direct production loss of some 101 000 tonnes milled. There was a further
5 000 tonnes lost as a result of DMR safety stoppages. The management team continue to
focus on relationship-building initiatives with the local communities to arrest the community
disruptions and secure the planned build-up in production to 90 000 platinum ounces per annum.
Platinum in concentrate production was unchanged at 21 200 ounces compared to the prior
corresponding period.

Mimosa
Mimosa reported zero lost time injuries and tonnes milled during the period increased by 2.7% to
690 000 tonnes, compared to 672 000 tonnes in the previous comparable quarter. Platinum
production in concentrate of 30 500 ounces was largely unchanged from the prior comparable
period.

Two Rivers
Two Rivers reported 2 lost time injuries for the quarter and mill throughput increased by 6.7% to
877 000 tonnes, compared to 822 000 tonnes in the previous comparable quarter. Together
with higher grade and improved recoveries platinum in concentrate production increased by
11.4% to 49 300 ounces compared to 44 700 ounces in the prior comparable period.

IRS
IRS refined platinum production during the period increased by 18.7% to 214 500 ounces,
compared to 180 700 ounces in the prior quarter. This was principally as a result of higher
deliveries from third party customers during the quarter under review.

Commentary
Introduction
The platinum sector continues to be challenged by low US dollar metal prices. Implats’ strategic response to the
lower-for-longer PGM price environment, introduced in February 2015, has shown positive results during the year with 
specific focus on measures which enhance profitability and short-term cash preservation. In addition, the Group 
successfully executed a R4.0 billion equity placement in October 2015 through an accelerated book build process to 
secure the required capital for two advanced and strategic shaft replacement projects (16 and 20 Shaft) at the Impala 
Lease Area.

With the exception of Impala Rustenburg, all other operations delivered remarkable performance in an extremely
challenging operating environment, with many setting new safety and production records. At Impala Rustenburg full year
performance was impaired by two major safety incidents in the second half of the financial year. A conveyor belt fire at 
the 14 Shaft complex caused extensive damage to the bottom decline section infrastructure, with resultant loss of productive
capacity from the shaft complex, while a fall-of-ground incident at 1 Shaft and subsequent search and rescue operation for
two missing employees resulted in extended safety interruptions at the mine.

Implats remains cash generative, ending the period under review with R6.8 billion in cash despite persistently low US
dollar metal prices and extensive safety interruptions at the Lease Area. This performance was materially assisted by
significant financial contributions from Impala Refining Services (IRS).

Response plan update
The response plan was first communicated in February 2015 and targeted savings of R930 million in the 2016 financial
year. Key strategic objectives included cost optimisation, reprioritising and rescheduling capital expenditure,
implementing the Impala Lease Area strategy and strengthening the Group balance sheet.

Various initiatives to improve mining efficiencies and reduce operating costs (cost optimisation) realised a saving of
approximately R1.4 billion for the year, of which R930 million was realised at Impala. Key components included: 
R286 million from reduced staffing; R306 million from contract renegotiations and improved consumption; R97 million from
reduced overtime; and R241 million from higher efficiencies, deferred development and renewals.

The capital budget was reduced by R1.3 billion to R4.2 billion for 2016, following further curtailments at 17 Shaft
and targeted reductions at Impala Rustenburg, Marula and Zimplats. During the year, R1.3 billion was spent on 16 and 20
Shafts and R981 million at Zimplats. In total, R3.56 billion in capital was invested across the Group, resulting in a 
R1.9 billion deferment of capital expenditure.

The Impala Lease Area strategy aims to transform the operation into a more concentrated mining operation with access
to new, modern shaft complexes making better use of the invested fixed-cost base, with higher mining efficiencies and
lower unit costs. Aligned to this strategy, both 8 Shaft and the 12 Shaft mechanised section were closed as planned in
December 2015. Consequently, the overall labour complement at Impala Rustenburg was reduced by approximately 3 360 people
through the planned closures of these operations, and further initiatives targeting contractor efficiencies and labour
optimisation through natural attrition. Contractor employment reduced from 11 302 in the prior year to 9 531 at year-end
and own employees from 43 838 to 40 477. Further job losses were mitigated through transfers to 16 and 20 Shafts which are
in build-up and the reclassification of some employees to other occupations.

Implats continued to prioritise strategic capital investment through the cycle while maintaining balance sheet
strength and flexibility as far as possible. To this end, the Group successfully executed a R4.0 billion equity placement 
in October 2015 through an accelerated book build process, the proceeds of which are being used to complete Impala
Rustenburg’s 16 and 20 Shafts. Subsequent to year-end, the quantum and tenure of existing debt facilities from strategic
relationship banking institutions were also extended. Implats amended R3.25 billion of existing debt facilities, which were
previously available until December 2017, to a revised R4.0 billion available until 2021. The enhanced liquidity provides
security and flexibility to address upcoming debt maturities as well as to service the ongoing needs of the business.

Safety review
During the first half of the financial year, the Group achieved its lowest ever 12-month moving average fatal-injury
frequency rate of 0.024 per million man-hours worked. Between 13 April 2015 and 24 November 2015, the South African
operations reported zero fatal incidents resulting in 210 fatality-free calendar days, which equates to over eight 
million fatality-free shifts - a remarkable performance.

Other noteworthy achievements during the year include Springs Refinery which has worked more than 19 years (10.5
million shifts) without a fatal accident; 7a Shaft achieved 16 years (5.3 million shifts); Rustenburg Services achieved 
15 years (11.1 million shifts); Two Rivers, 7 Shaft and 4 Shaft all achieved four years; 6 Shaft, 9 Shaft and 20 Shaft
achieved more than three years; while Zimplats and Mineral Processes both worked more than two years without a fatal 
accident. Other safety millionaires and/or operations who have worked for more than a year without a fatal accident 
include the Marula Operation and Impala Rustenburg’s E&F, 10, 11, 12, and 16 shaft complexes.

Despite the remarkable safety achievements and sustained investment in safe production initiatives, our journey to
zero harm was tragically overshadowed by the loss of 11 lives during the year - two at Mimosa, three at 1 Shaft and 
six at 14 Shaft. The loss of life was a devastating blow that reverberated across the Group and touched everyone profoundly -
the board of directors has extended their sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of our departed
employees.

The fatal incidents at Mimosa and Impala Rustenburg this year were unprecedented and unusual - and has brought into
stark focus the risk around critical safe behaviours - and the need to inculcate an independent safety culture at every
level in the organisation. Expert third-party analysis consistently find human failure to be the most significant factor
in our safety related incidents. The Group is therefore enhancing its safety programmes to boost safe production
compliance in a dependent safety culture, but also driving change to an interdependent culture where every employee looks 
after their own safe behaviour and the safety of others. Implats remains resolute in our pursuit to achieve zero harm across
all our operations and will continue to work closely with all stakeholders including our own employees, organised labour
and the DMR.

Operational review
Mine-to-market output was 9.8% higher at 1.26 million platinum ounces following strong operational performance from
Zimplats and operational recovery at Impala Rustenburg post the strike impacted start-up in the prior year. Third-party
platinum production increased by 37% to 182 900 ounces as a result of improved deliveries from third-party customers.
Consequently, gross refined platinum production increased by 12.7% to 1.44 million ounces. Improved production volumes
coupled with stringent cost control benefited Group unit costs, which improved by 2.2% to R21 731 per platinum ounce 
(R22 222 - FY2015).

IMPALA RUSTENBURG
Production during the period under review was materially affected by unprecedented safety events, specifically the
underground fire at 14 Shaft and fall-of-ground incident at 1 Shaft. The fire at 14 Shaft caused extensive damage to
conveyor infrastructure in the decline shaft system. While stoping and development activities could resume in the upper
sections from February 2016, the lower mechanised and conventional mining sections remain closed. Mining activity from the
decline section is planned to recommence from November 2016 when the first conveyor segment and some associated ancillary
services will be restored. Full mining capacity in the decline section should be restored from March 2017 when all
rehabilitation activities are expected to be completed. Platinum production from 14 Shaft was impacted by approximately 
39 000 ounces during the financial year, with a further impact of approximately 45 000 platinum ounces expected in the 2017
financial year. To date, a total of R415 million has been received from our insurance providers, of which R120 million was
for property damage and the balance (R295 million) for business interruption.

At 1 Shaft, two employees were initially reported missing after a fall-of-ground incident. Tragically they were later
found fatally injured after a two day and two week respectively search and rescue operation. All mining activities at
the shaft were suspended during the search and rescue operation - and subsequently remained suspended for a further
prolonged period to re-establish and secure all related safety protocols.

Both 8 Shaft and the 12 Shaft mechanised section, which were identified as loss-making in the low metal price environment, 
were closed as planned at the end of December 2015 - collectively these areas contributed 22 600 platinum ounces in the 
first half of the financial year.

Despite these production impacts, good progress was made during the year with the commissioning and ramp-up of two
large new underground mining operations (16 Shaft and 20 Shaft). Together, these new shafts produced 82 900 platinum ounces
in 2016, with planned output of 310 000 platinum ounces per annum from 2020. Productivity improvements continue to
receive focus, specifically reducing under-performing mining teams and increasing available mining face length and
flexibility through ore reserve development and construction. Mineable face length for conventional mining crews has been a 
key focus over a number of years and has been maintained at 22km, despite the closure of 8 Shaft in December 2015 and further
depletion at the old shafts which will all be closed in the next few years.

Milled throughput improved by 12.1% to 10.32 million tonnes (9.21 million tonnes) and refined platinum production
increased by 9.0% to 626 900 ounces (575 200 ounces).

Measures to contain the operating cost base at Impala Rustenburg realised a combined saving of approximately R930 million in 
2016, principally through procurement and other cost saving initiatives. Despite this good performance, unit costs were severely 
impacted by the lower production volumes in the second half and improved by only 7.3% or R22 139 per platinum ounce refined 
(2015: R23 884).

Value-enhancing capital investment to sustain longer-term value creation continue to be prioritised despite the
current price environments. The principal focus in this regard remains the completion of 16 and 20 Shafts in line with our
strategy to transform the Impala Lease Area. In 2016, R1.3 billion was invested into these two projects, with a further
R2.6 billion to be invested over the next three years to complete both shaft complexes. The ramp-up of production at 16
Shaft is ahead of plan. Corrective action at 20 Shaft to address less than planned stoping targets has shown positive
results.

Project development work at 17 Shaft was stopped in February 2016 and placed on low cost care and maintenance, given
persistently low PGM metal prices. To maintain the profile of the Lease once 16 and 20 Shafts are at steady state 
(830 000 platinum ounces per annum), dewatering of 17 Shaft needs to commence in 2020.

The key focus at Impala Rustenburg is to meet its build-up target on stoping teams and deliver the planned team
efficiencies. Critical in all of this will be full delivery of our safe production strategy, ensuring that the exceptional
safety performance and zero harm standards already embedded at many of our operations, is replicated across all operations
to minimise avoidable work stoppages. Ongoing cost saving measures are being targeted though various identified
projects, such as procurement initiatives. An optimisation project has been initiated with external support to specifically
interrogate the mining cycle at Impala Rustenburg, with the goal of securing and/or enhancing production from the shafts.

IMPALA REFINING SERVICES (IRS)
During the year under review, IRS, which uses Impala’s excess processing and refining capacity to smelt and refine the
concentrate and matte produced by the Group’s other mine-to-market operations and third parties, generated R1.35 billion 
post tax, which is a significant contribution to the Group. This world-class refining business remains a strategic
competitive advantage for Implats.

Platinum production from mine-to-market operations increased by 10.7% from the previous year to 628 600 ounces 
(567 500 ounces) as all operations delivered higher volumes to IRS. Refined platinum production from third-party 
purchases and toll volumes increased from 133 200 ounces to 182 900 ounces, largely due to improved deliveries from 
third-party customers.

ZIMPLATS
Zimplats achieved five million fatality-free shifts in the year under review and the operation recorded only eight
(2015: 13) lost-time injuries in the year.

Measures to recover production losses as a result of the temporary safety closure of the Bimha Mine in August 2014,
including further open-pit mining and the redeployment of mining teams, together with increasing output from the new
Mupfuti Mine as it ramped-up production, fully compensated for lost tonnage at Bimha Mine in 2016.

Tonnes milled increased by 24.1% to 6.41 million (5.16 million). The remaining stockpiled material - 21 000 platinum
ounces - which resulted from the outage of Zimplats’ smelter in May 2015, was sold as concentrate during the 2016
financial year. Platinum in matte production increased by 52.5% from the previous year to 290 400 ounces (190 000 ounces) 
- a record level of production.

A new pillar layout introduced at the Mupfuti Mine following the ground collapse at Bimha is nearing completion. The
redevelopment of Bimha Mine remains on schedule to reach full production in April 2018. To ensure that the Phase 2
production levels are sustained beyond 2021, a bankable feasibility study on Portal 6 is near completion and this project 
will be considered by the board in November 2016. It is expected that US$148 million will be spent over the next five years
on this project.

Due to cash constraints, the refurbishment of the Selous-based base metal refinery has been put on hold. Studies into
various smelter options to mitigate the operational risk of a single furnace operation and to potentially treat other
concentrates in the country continue.

Platinum unit costs benefited significantly from increased production volumes as well as stringent cost containment
initiatives and declined by 32.9% to US$1 130 (2015: US$1 683) per platinum ounce in matte. In rand terms, unit costs only
improved by 15.2% to R16 291 (2015: R19 211) per platinum ounce in matte as the exchange rate weakened further.

Capital expenditure reduced to US$68 million (2015: US$85 million) due to the cash preservation initiative in response
to low metal prices.

Capital expenditure over the next few years will remain constrained by the low dollar price environment and is
prioritised for projects critical to sustaining production levels, improving safety and maintaining Zimplats’ licence 
to operate.

MARULA
Marula’s lost-time injury frequency rate improved from 18.20 to 9.56 per million man-hours worked. The mine had no
fatalities during the year and has currently reached the exemplary milestone of two million fatality-free shifts.

Marula has focused on improving operational performance and profitability and, during the first half of the year, the
operational performance improved by 13%. Production during the second half was disrupted by sporadic community unrest,
which had a direct negative impact of 55 500 tonnes or some 2 500 ounces. The last two months of the financial year were
uninterrupted and Marula achieved efficiencies that, on an annualised basis, would result in over 90 000 ounces of
platinum.

Overall, milled tonnage increased by 2.5% to 1.70 million tonnes (2015: 1.66 million tonnes) and platinum in
concentrate production rose by 5.6% to 77 700 ounces (2015: 73 600 ounces).

Unit costs per platinum ounce in concentrate increased by 6.9% to R24 149 (2015: R22 582) in line with mining
inflation. Costs were well controlled and on budget, but the unit cost was negatively affected by the loss of 
production due to community unrest.

Capital expenditure was contained to R89 million (2015: R145 million) due to cash preservation initiatives.

The optimisation programme focusing on Marula’s existing infrastructure over the past few years will provide the
necessary foundation for the mine to reach its targeted output of 90 000 ounces of platinum in 2017. It has adequate mineable
face length having doubled from 1.5km in 2013 to 3.2km currently. Moreover, the successful completion of the raisebore
ventilation hole at Clapham will enable increased development to further enhance mining flexibility. The Driekop
chairlift installation is progressing and is scheduled to be completed by December 2016. This will assist in generating
increased available face time and improved team productivity.

MIMOSA
Two separate fatalities occurred at the Mimosa operations during the period under review and were a devastating blow
to an excellent safety record. These unprecedented incidents followed the operation’s achievement of five million
fatality-free shifts and a fatal injury frequency rate of 0.13 per million man-hours worked.

Operationally, Mimosa achieved record production. Tonnes milled increased marginally to 2.64 million (2015: 2.59 million) 
and platinum in concentrate production to 119 700 ounces (2015: 117 400 ounces). Unit costs per platinum ounce in
concentrate decreased by 4.1% to US$1 463 (2015: US$1 525) driven largely by cost saving initiatives. Capital expenditure
of US$32 million was mainly spent on maintenance capital.

Mimosa plans to stringently manage costs in order to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures. Steady-state platinum in
concentrate production will be maintained at 115 000 ounces per annum. A feasibility study on a possible 30% expansion
of production has been completed subject to improved metal prices and the availability of capital. The government of
Zimbabwe deferred until 1 January 2017 the imposition of a 15% export levy on unbeneficiated platinum concentrates. Mimosa
continues to consult with the government on the export levy and has recently completed a bankable feasibility study for
the construction of a smelter at the operation.

TWO RIVERS
Two Rivers achieved three million fatality-free shifts during the year under review and has now operated for 53 months
without a fatality.

Tonnes milled increased from 3.36 million to 3.51 million due to additional toll milling through another facility.
Consequently, platinum in concentrate production increased by 7.1% to 185 900 ounces (2015: 173 500 ounces).

Unit costs per platinum ounce in concentrate were well contained and decreased by 1.4% to R11 775 (2015: R11 948) as a
result of the increased production volumes. Despite the low metal price environment experienced during the year, Two
Rivers generated R946 million in cash after tax. Capital expenditure at R282 million was at similar levels to the previous
year.

Two Rivers is expected to sustain the production at more than 150 000 platinum ounces per annum for at least 10 years. This 
will entail the exploitation of the remaining extension and portions 4, 5 and 6 of Kalkfontein. Capital to extend the
infrastructure into the adjacent Kalkfontein areas has been budgeted for. Two Rivers is investigating various strategic
alternatives to increase output beyond 2018.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
Implats’ total attributable Mineral Resources of 194 million platinum ounces at 30 June 2016 is 1% lower than the 
196 million platinum ounces reported previously in June 2015. This can mainly be ascribed to mining depletion. The grouping
of platinum ounces per reef shows that some 50% of the attributable Mineral Resource is hosted by the Great Dyke and the
Zimplats Mineral Resource makes up 49% of the total Implats inventory.

Total attributable Mineral Reserves decreased by 18% to 21.6 million platinum ounces as at 30 June 2016 compared to
26.4 million platinum ounces in the previous financial year. The main contributor to the decrease in Mineral Reserves is
the exclusion of the 17 Shaft Mineral Reserves at Impala. Some 62% of the total attributable Mineral Reserves are located
at Impala.

Financial performance
Revenue for the year increased by R3.5 billion rand from the previous year to R35.9 billion as a result of an increase
in sales volumes (R5.7 billion) and a positive exchange rate variance (R7.2 billion) but offset by lower dollar metal
prices (R9.4 billion).

Cash costs comprising on-mine, processing, refining and selling and administration benefited from stringent cost
control measures and increased by only 6.1% compared to a normalised 2015 cost after adjusting for once off ramp-up 
costs and savings after the strike in the 2014 financial year.

Production was negatively affected during the second half by the fire at 14 Shaft and the fall of ground at 1 Shaft.
Notwithstanding this, gross group platinum production increased by 12.7% to 1 438.3 million ounces.

Other once-off items include an impairment/scrapping charge of R413 million - mainly due to the impairment of the 12
Shaft mechanised section, which was closed in December 2015 and the scrapping of the 14 Shaft conveyor belt after the
fire. Insurance proceeds of R474 million is included in other operating income, which related mainly to the business
interruption and asset insurance on 14 Shaft.

Overall, headline earnings per share decreased from 36 cents per share to 12 cents per share mainly due to the lower
rand metal prices, which were offset to some extent by increased volumes and stringent cost control.

The Group’s cash position at end of the financial year improved from R2.6 billion to R6.8 billion mainly as a result
of the equity raise during the financial year of R3.9 billion (net of expenses) and net cash generated, after funding all
capital expenditure, of R291 million. At year-end, the Group had committed facilities of R4 billion until 2017.
Subsequent to year-end, R3.25 billion of these committed facilities were extended to 2021 and an additional R0.75 billion
facility was obtained also expiring in 2021 bringing the total committed facilities to R4.75 billion.

Capital expenditure for the year amounted to R3.6 (2015: R4.3) billion.

Capital expenditure of approximately R4.4 billion is planned for the 2017 financial year, of which R1.2 billion
relates to 20 and 16 Shafts at Impala. 17 Shaft has been placed on low-cost maintenance at some R6 million per annum. Of the
capital expenditure of R4.4 billion, R2.4 billion is planned at Impala and US$122 million is planned at Zimplats. Capital
expenditure will principally be funded from the opening cash balance, operating cash flows and borrowings if necessary.

Market review
Despite global macroeconomic uncertainty, overall demand for PGMs from major sectors remained healthy during 2015 and
continued to hold its ground during the first half of 2016. Secondary PGM supply was affected by the low PGM and steel
price environment, which led to some hoarding by collectors. Primary PGM supply continues to be at risk due to the
continued lack of capital investment and the challenging mining environment in southern Africa. The platinum and palladium
markets remained in a fundamental deficit during 2015, while the rhodium market showed a small surplus.

At the start of the financial year, the platinum price was US$1 085 per ounce, but declined to a low of US$814 per
ounce in January 2016 driven by pervasive negative sentiment towards industrial metals, rather than their fundamentals.
Prices bounced back after January 2016 to reach US$1 084 per ounce during May 2016 on the back of positive investor
sentiment, healthy demand and tight supply conditions from South Africa during the first quarter of calendar year 2016.
Palladium prices started the financial year at US$687 per ounce reaching a high of US$723 per ounce in September 2015 - a 
level not reached again during the period under review. Palladium closed the financial year at US$589 after reaching a low 
of US$465 per ounce in January 2016 and largely tracked macroeconomic factors throughout the year.

The 23% depreciation of the rand dollar exchange rate over the financial year and some restricted appreciation of
prices post January 2016 did support rand prices for PGMs, giving partial relief to cash-constrained South African platinum
miners.

Overall, 2015 was a relatively positive year for the global automotive industry, which achieved 1.8% growth for
light-duty vehicle sales, reaching 90 million units. While this was the slowest growth rate since 2009 - due to declines in
units sold in Japan, South America and Russia - these were offset by record sales in North America, Western Europe and
China. Concerns over the sustainability of diesel demand in Western Europe have proven to be largely unfounded and sales
remain robust. Despite the ongoing substitution of platinum with palladium in gasoline and some diesel autocatalysts,
platinum demand continued to benefit from growing use in light- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, which exceeded 3.2 million
ounces in 2015. The growth in vehicle sales and the substitution of platinum by palladium resulted in palladium demand
from the automotive sector reaching 7.7 million ounces in 2015.

The 2015 PGI retail barometer showed the economic slow-down in China affecting the jewellery industry, resulting in
Chinese platinum jewellery demand declining by 4% during 2015. This was partially offset by growth regions, such as India,
which benefited from a promotional programme and better market penetration. The 10% growth in the US was largely driven
by low platinum prices.

Industrial demand remained healthy in 2015 and into the first half of 2016, driven largely by chemical, electrical and
fuel cell applications. The selloff of platinum and palladium ETFs in the second half of 2015 continued during the
first half of 2016. Net liquidations of platinum amounted to 40 000 ounces as South African funds liquidating 160 000 ounces
during the first half of 2016 on the back of rand weakness, which prompted profit-taking. Net palladium ETF
liquidations of 130 000 ounces during the first half of 2016 were more pronounced than platinum due to concerns about the Chinese
economy and its effect on palladium demand. Changes in NYMEX/TOCOM positioning were divergent during the first half of
the year.

Growing demand for platinum and palladium from the automotive and industrial sectors is unlikely to be met by primary
and secondary supply. In the low price environment, recycling should remain sluggish. Primary South African producers
now have less flexibility to supplement supplies with metal from stocks as these have been depleted to supplement cash
flows. Diminishing above-ground stocks are expected to continue to satisfy fundamental deficits during 2016.

Prospects
Implats remains resolute in achieving zero harm goals to ensure the safety and well[###]being of every employee and will
continue to work closely with all stakeholders including employees, organised labour and the Department of Mineral
Resources (DMR) in pursuit of achieving safe production across all operations.

In the short term, PGM prices are expected to remain subdued. Implats will continue its cash preservation initiatives
as well as the drive to enhance productivity and profitability. The Group continues to invest in its operations and will
mechanise and optimise through the downturn to ensure it is well positioned for the future. All operations are
performing extremely well and efforts are apace to restore Impala Rustenburg to its full potential.

Given the impact of the 14 Shaft fire, the production estimate for Impala is between 700 000 and 710 000 platinum
ounces for 2017, after which the previous guidance of building up to 830 000 platinum ounces by 2020 remains. Production
guidance for the other operations remains unchanged for the coming year - Zimplats 260 000 platinum ounces in matte and
Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa 90 000, 175 000 and 115 000 platinum ounces in concentrate, respectively.

Unit costs are expected to be approximately R21 300 per platinum ounces and capital should be contained to R4.4 billion in 
2017.

Notes to the financial information
for the period ended 30 June 2016

1. General information
   Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Implats, Group or Company) is a primary producer of platinum and associated platinum
   group metals (PGMs). The Group has operations on the Bushveld Complex in South Africa and the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe,
   the two most significant PGM-bearing ore bodies globally.
   
   The Company has its listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
   
   The summarised consolidated financial information was approved for issue on 1 September 2016 by the board of
   directors.

2. Audit opinion
   This summarised report is extracted from audited information, but is not itself audited. The annual financial
   statements were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., who expressed an unmodified opinion thereon. The audited annual
   financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and 
   on the Company’s website.
   
   The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the summarised consolidated financial statements and
   that the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying annual financial statements.

3. Basis of preparation
   The summarised consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared in accordance with
   the JSE Limited Listings Requirements (Listings Requirements) and the requirements of the Companies Act, Act 71 of 2008
   applicable to summarised financial statements. The Listings Requirements require financial statements to be prepared in
   accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial
   Reporting Standards (IFRS), the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and
   Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Council, and contain the information 
   required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
   
   The summarised consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
   statements for the year ended 30 June 2016, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
   
   The summarised consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
   certain financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value and
   liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements which are measured using a binomial option model.
   
   Implats’ annual financial statements have historically been prepared based on an internal cut-off date for financial
   information on 21 June, in line with the metallurgical cut-off date each year. Implats has decided to align the internal
   cut-off and the date of the financial statements by moving the internal month end date of 21 June to 30 June.
   
   The current year consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income resultantly includes a
   period of one year and nine days. This had less than 0.1% impact on the gross margin of the Group.
   
   The summarised consolidated financial information is presented in South African rand, which is the Company’s
   functional currency.

4. Accounting policies

   summarised consolidated financial statements were derived, are in terms of IFRS. The following new standards and
   amendments to standards have become effective or have been early adopted by the Group as from 1 July 2015 without any
   significant impact:
   - Amendments to IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows
   - Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes 

5. Segment information
   The Group distinguishes its segments between mining operations, refining services (which include metals purchased and
   toll refined), chrome processing and other.
   
   Management has determined the operating segments based on the business activities and management structure within the
   Group.
   
   Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment (note 6), including additions resulting from
   acquisitions through business combinations.
   
   Impala mining segment’s two largest sales customers amounted to 10% each of total sales (June 2015: 13% and 10%).
   
   The statement of comprehensive income shows the movement from gross profit to total profit before income tax.

   Impairment
   12 Shaft mechanised section was impaired during the year. Due to the current PGM prices, the decision was taken to
   defer mining of this section. This will be mined in future if it becomes economically feasible. The asset was impaired in
   its totality. On the higher of fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use basis (being the method used), this asset is
   deemed to have a nil value for the time being resulting in the impairment of R257 million.
   
   Capital commitment
   Capital expenditure approved at 30 June 2016 amounted to R7.2 billion (June 2015: R15.5 billion), of which R1.3 billion 
   (June 2015: R2.1 billion) is already committed. This expenditure will be funded internally and, if necessary, from
   borrowings.

7. Derivative financial instrument
   Implats entered into a Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) amounting to US$200 million to hedge certain aspects
   of the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible bonds (note 9), being: exchange rate risk on dollar interest
   payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds at a rand-dollar exchange rate weaker than R9.24/US$. 
   (US$200 million was swapped for R1 848 million on which Implats pays a fixed interest rate to Standard Bank of 5.94%. 
   Implats receives the 1% coupon on the US$200 million from Standard Bank on the same date which Implats pays bond holders. 
   In February 2018 Implats will repay the R1 848 million in return of the US$200 million.)
   
   The CCIRS with Standard Bank is carried at its fair value of R1 137 (June 2015: R630) million. No hedge accounting has

   The write-down to net realisable value comprises R106 million (2014: R154 million) for refined mining metal and 
   R558 million (2015: R364 million) for in-process mining metal.
   
   Included in refined metal is metal on lease to third parties of 36 000 ounces (2015: 36 000 ounces) ruthenium.
   
   Quantities of recoverable metal are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore to the quantities of metal actually
   recovered (metallurgical balancing). The nature of this process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor
   recoverability levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and the engineering 
   estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Changes in engineering estimates of metal contained in-process 
   resulted in an increase of in-process metal of R384 million (2015: R325 million).
   
   Non-mining metal consists mainly of inventory held by Impala Refining Services. No inventories are encumbered.

    Subsequent to year-end, R3.25 billion of these committed facilities were extended to 2021, and an additional R0.75 billion
    facility was obtained expiring end of 2021. This resulted in the total committed facility being R4.75 billion after
    year-end.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016

Shareholders are advised that Implats’ headline earnings per share (“HEPS”) for the year ended 30 June
2016 is expected to be between 9 and 16 cents which is between 56% and 75% lower than that of the year
ended June 2015 (HEPS:36 cents). The main reason for the decrease in HEPS for the year to June 2016, is
lower rand metal prices which were offset to some extent by increased volumes and stringent cost control.

The basic loss per share is expected to be between 7 and 12 cents (June 2015: loss of 603 cents).

The difference between HEPS and basic loss per share for the year to June 2016 is primarily due to the
impairment of 12 mechanised shaft, which was closed in December 2015.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats.

Impala Rustenburg 1 Shaft Fall of Ground - Update

Following the fall of ground incident that occurred at Impala Rustenburg’s 1 Shaft on 17 May 2016, it
is with sincere and deep regret that the Board of Directors and management team announce the
discovery of the body of one of the missing employees. The body was found in an area with
extremely unstable ground conditions and has not yet been recovered. The search and rescue teams
are continuing with their relentless efforts to find the second miner.

The families of the two miners have been informed of the latest developments and continue to
receive support from the mine, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). The families have requested that we withhold the
names of both miners at this time.

Implats’ CEO, Terence Goodlace, commented, “This is a tragic loss for everybody and our heart-felt
condolences are with the families of our colleagues. We extend our sincere gratitude to the mine
rescue teams for their diligent and professional efforts in leading the search and rescue operation, as
well as senior officials from the DMR, AMCU and the industry for their unwavering support.”

Further announcements will be made as soon as additional information becomes available.

RESIGNATION OF MR TERENCE GOODLACE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Implats wishes to announce to shareholders that after six years on the Implats board of directors
(the “Board”), of which the initial two were as a non-executive director, Mr Terence Goodlace has
advised the Board that he will step down as Chief Executive and executive director of the Company

Mr Terence Goodlace said: “I am very pleased to have served this great company for more than half
a decade and depart with a sense of pride for leaving behind a great team of executives and a strong
board to lead Implats into the future.”

Dr Mandla Gantsho, the chairman of the Board said: ""It has been a great pleasure working with
Terence over the past six years, especially since becoming Chairman last year. I would like to thank
him for his outstanding contribution to Implats, at a difficult time for the platinum mining sector and
the mining industry generally. I wish Terence much success in the future. The Board is pleased that
he has given us a long notice period of his intention to step down and appreciate his commitment to
continue to support the company and the board on the important 'lower for longer commodity
prices' response initiatives, and in the leadership succession and handover.""

The Board is reviewing its leadership succession plans as well as embarking on a structured search
process to fill the vacancy.

IMPLATS SECURES US COURT ORDER AGAINST A1 SPECIALISED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES LIMITED

Implats wishes to report on a court order issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania on 26 April 2016, wherein the Court confirmed the award issued by the
London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) and ordered A1 Specialised Services and Supplies
Limited (“A1”) to pay to Implats a total amount of USD201 million.

The court order follows a dispute between Implats and A1 in which Implats asserted that A1
defaulted on amounts due to Implats. The parties agreed to have the matter heard by the LCIA
which duly heard the matter and issued a final award on 9 December 2015 in Implats’ favour for the
full amount claimed by Implats being USD201 million.

Implats will pursue all legal avenues available to it to collect the amount due.

SAFETY
Implats remains committed to ensuring zero harm and the Group’s safety strategy is premised
on achieving safe production and specifically demands safe behaviour, an inherently safe work
environment and leading safety practices. During the quarter ended 31 March 2016 the Group
regrettably experienced three fatal incidents, two of the incidents occurred at Impala Rustenburg
and one at Mimosa. Sadly, these three incidents resulted in a total of six fatalities. The board of
directors of Implats and the management team have extended their sincere sympathies and
support to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased.

In one of these incidents, four employees tragically lost their lives in an underground fire at
Impala Rustenburg’s 14 Shaft on 22 January 2016. The entire Rustenburg operation was
subsequently closed to engage employees on their safety readiness and emergency awareness,
and to significantly refocus efforts to achieving zero-harm. The investigations into the cause of
the fire are ongoing.

Following the fire in January 2016 and consequential safety stoppages, the Group has recorded
no further serious safety-related incidents. During the period Two Rivers achieved three million
fatality free shifts, a milestone which took four years and one month of safe production, while
10 Shaft in Rustenburg reached one million fatality free shifts, taking one year and six months to
achieve.

PRODUCTION
Gross refined platinum production for the quarter ended 31 March 2016 increased by 17% to
353 000 platinum ounces, compared to 301 000 platinum ounces in the prior comparable period.
The increase is largely as a result of increased output from Zimplats, good operational
performances from Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa, higher volumes from Impala Refining
Services (IRS), as well as the release of material stockpiled ahead of the smelter.

Over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2016, gross refined platinum production increased
by 12% to 1.05 million platinum ounces from 932 000 platinum ounces in the previous
comparable period.

Impala
Tonnes milled at Impala Rustenburg declined to 2.01 million tonnes during the quarter ended
31 March 2016 from 2.51 million tonnes in the previous comparable quarter ended
31 March 2015. This was largely as a result of the fire at 14 Shaft and safety-related stoppages.

Following the tragic fire, all operations at 14 Shaft were suspended until 15 February 2016 when
crews re-entered the upper conventional section of the mine. Stoping and development
activities in the upper sections re-commenced on 22 February 2016. The lower trackless and
conventional mining sections remain closed and all mining crews have been re-deployed to
other mining areas in Rustenburg or tasked with the clean-up and repair operation.
The investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing and the insured asset damage
(estimated to be R375 million) and business interruption (still to be determined) will be covered
by the Group’s insurance programme. Optimisation of the repair plan to return the shaft to full
production as soon as possible has shortened the timeline and it is now expected to be fully
completed by March 2017.

Despite the severe impact on production volumes, grade and ore mix, refined platinum
production for the quarter was maintained at 142 000 platinum ounces (143 000 platinum
ounces for the quarter ended 31 March 2015) as most of the material that was built up in the first
half of FY2016 due to the furnace rebuild, was treated in the period under review.

Tonnes milled over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2016 increased by 22% to 7.95
million tonnes, compared to 6.52 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period, which was
impacted by the operational re-start following the wage strike. Consequently, refined platinum
production for the nine months ended 31 March 2016 increased by 18% to 468 000 platinum
ounces (396 000 platinum ounces in nine-months to 31 March 2015).

Marula
Tonnes milled at Marula increased by 4.5% to 390 000 tonnes for the quarter ended
31 March 2016 compared to 373 000 tonnes reported in the prior corresponding period, which is
despite production being significantly impacted by safety stoppages in the period. Platinum in
concentrate production for the quarter consequently increased to 17 000 platinum ounces
(16 000 platinum ounces in the quarter ended 31 March 2015).

Tonnes milled over the nine month period ended 31 March 2016 increased by 6.2% to
1.28 million tonnes, compared to 1.20 million tonnes in the prior corresponding period. In line
with this, platinum in concentrate production for the nine month period ended 31 March 2016
rose 11% to 59 000 platinum ounces (53 000 platinum ounces in the nine month period ended
31 March 2015).

Zimplats
Tonnes milled during the quarter ended 31 March 2016 increased by 30% to 1.65 million tonnes
compared to 1.26 million tonnes reported in the prior corresponding period. Platinum production
in matte for the quarter ended 31 March 2016 increased to 89 000 platinum ounces (52 000
platinum ounces for the quarter ended 31 March 2015) as a result of the increased milling rate
and the release of stockpiled concentrates following a furnace outage in the final quarter of
FY2015.

Mill throughput over the nine-month period ended 31 March 2016 increased by 27% to
4.77 million tonnes, compared to 3.74 million tonnes in the corresponding prior period. The
higher throughput was directly attributable to the measures implemented to recover production
loses as a result of the safety closure of the Bimha Mine in August 2014. Platinum in matte for
the nine months ended 31 March 2016 was 42% higher at 220 000 ounces, compared to
155 000 platinum ounces in the prior comparable period.

Zimplats continues to engage with the Government of Zimbabwe with regards to the
indigenisation implementation plan and the securing of a more conducive regulatory and fiscal
framework for the mining industry in Zimbabwe.

Mimosa
Tonnes milled at Mimosa increased by 8.7% to 676 000 tonnes for the quarter ended
31 March 2016 (622 000 tonnes in the quarter ended 31 March 2015) as additional material was
milled from the stockpile. Platinum in concentrate production for the quarter increased as a
result of the increased mill throughput to 30 000 ounces (28 000 ounces in the quarter ended 31
March 2015).

Tonnes milled during the nine-month period ended 31 March 2016 increased by 3.3% to 1.99
million tonnes, compared to 1.92 million tonnes in the corresponding prior period. The increased
throughput resulted in 2.3% higher platinum in concentrate production of 90 000 platinum
ounces compared to 88 000 platinum ounces in the prior comparable period.

IRS
IRS refined platinum production for the quarter ended 31 March 2016 increased by 32.9%. Over
the nine-month period ended 31 March 2016 production increased by 7.6% to 577 000 ounces,
compared to 536 000 ounces in the previous comparable period. The increase in production is
largely attributed to higher deliveries from third-party customers and the release of some
material in the pipeline.

OUTLOOK
Implats’ full year guidance is estimated to be production of around 1.42 million refined platinum
ounces and unit cost of R22 500 per refined platinum ounce.



The third quarter production report for the period 1 January to 31 March 2016 has not been
reviewed and reported on by the external auditors of Implats.

COMMENTARY

Introduction
The Group’s operational and financial performance for the six months to 31 December 2015 reflects a steady improvement
compared to the corresponding reporting period last year, despite a challenging operating environment and the continued
impact of lower US dollar metal prices. 

The diverse geographical nature and scope of the Group’s assets are becoming ever-more advantageous to the Group’s
operating profile. The mining plan introduced at Zimplats in 2015, after ground stability challenges impacted production
from the Bimha Mine in the prior year, has largely restored platinum output to design capacity. Marula has improved its
production levels and management remains focused on the implementation of an asset optimisation strategy. Mimosa and Two
Rivers continued to exceed expectations. Impala Rustenburg restored mill throughput to pre-strike levels, but output
during the reporting period was impacted by lower than planned stoping volumes, largely as a result of Section 54 safety
stoppages and a lock-up of platinum group metals (PGMs) due to scheduled maintenance in the smelter. 
 
Implats strengthened its balance sheet through a successful R4 billion equity raising during the period under review,
the proceeds of which are earmarked for the completion of the new 16 and 20 shaft complexes at Impala Rustenburg.
Excluding the cash raised through the equity placement and R772 million project expenditure on the 16 and 20 shaft 
projects, the Group generated R630 million free cash for the six months ended 31 December 2015, despite operating 
in a period when rand metal prices were low. This was largely due to Impala Refining Services (IRS) sustaining its 
considerable financial contribution to the Group.

The Group continues to prioritise shorter-term cash preservation and profitability enhancement measures in a low metal
price environment, in line with the response plan implemented in February 2015. 

During the six months ended December 2015, the Group achieved its lowest ever 12-month moving average fatal injury
frequency rate (FIFR) of 0.024 per million man hours worked. At the South African operations the fatal incident free 
period between 13 April 2015 and 24 November 2015 resulted in 210 fatal free calendar days, equating to over eight 
million fatality free shifts during this period. Sadly and with deep regret, the Group then experienced two fatal 
incidents before the close of the reporting period.

Market review
US dollar strength and persistent negative sentiment towards commodities in general continued to impact US dollar
denominated PGM prices in 2015, mainly as a result of rising global economic uncertainty. The weakened South African 
rand, which depreciated from R12.17:US$ in June 2015 to R15.48:US$ at the end of the reporting period, provided some 
support to rand revenues during the reporting period. The rand denominated PGM basket price for the Group during the 
six months ended December 2015 averaged R21 843 per platinum ounce, some 15% lower than the comparable period in the 
prior year (H1 FY2015: R25 686 per platinum ounce). 

Overall demand for PGMs from the Group’s major customers remained strong during 2015, with sound market fundamentals
across the key PGM market segments. The possible exception to this was the Chinese platinum jewellery market which was
particularly impacted early in the year by the slowing Chinese economy and government austerity measures. However,
indications are that the fourth quarter of calendar 2015 has shown a stronger Chinese market performance than expected, 
and we await the results of the PGI retail barometer to confirm this. Strong growth in the Indian and US jewellery 
markets provided welcome support, and India is demonstrating the potential to become a major participant in the 
platinum jewellery market sector. 

Automotive PGM demand improved strongly in 2015, mainly due to continued sales growth in the US, China and Western
Europe. The US auto industry performed particularly strongly with record sales of 17.44 million units during the calendar
year - a 5.7% increase from 2014. This growth was largely supported by low oil prices which incentivised US consumers to
buy larger engine vehicles. China posted a healthy 7.3% growth in passenger vehicles sales reaching 21.15 million units
in 2015 and in Western Europe car sales rose 8.9%, reaching 13.2 million units in 2015. The Japanese market was the only
major automotive market that yielded disappointing vehicle sales in 2015, principally as a result of higher taxation
measures implemented in that country.

Despite strong growth in the automotive sector and the continued adoption of stricter emission legislation globally,
sentiment and PGM price support was particularly negatively impacted by the Volkswagen diesel scandal in 2015. Platinum
dominance in the diesel sector and the uncertainty brought about by the Volkswagen scandal was viewed by many as price
negative for future platinum demand. We remain convinced that modern Euro 6/VI compliant diesel vehicles are fundamentally
clean, environmentally friendly and absolutely essential to meet stricter global carbon dioxide emission standards.

Industrial demand for PGMs is largely influenced by global economic growth. Whilst lower PGM prices provided strong
industrial demand support towards the second half of the calendar year, slowing global growth and rising economic
uncertainty ultimately constrained demand growth and price support in 2015. Lower metal prices also impacted industrial
scrapping and PGM recycling in 2015, which is anticipated to have dropped by more than 10% from the levels achieved in 2014.

PGM investment continues to receive support from programmes initiated by the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC).
Platinum and palladium Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) remain the principal physical investment mechanism globally and
have experienced strong growth over recent years, principally from South African investors. These funds experienced some
selling activity in the second half of 2015, with total liquidations of 230 000 platinum ounces and 660 000 palladium
ounces respectively for the year. However, in the case of platinum, strong investment demand in Japan increased net
investment in bullion bars by more than 450 000 platinum ounces, more than offsetting the liquidation in the platinum ETFs.

Despite persistently low PGM metal prices and growing global economic uncertainty in 2015, the market fundamentals for
the Group’s metals remain sound due to growing global demand and constrained primary supply. In the Group’s assessment,
platinum will record a fundamental deficit of some 700 000 platinum ounces in calendar year 2015 and will remain in
deficit for the foreseeable future. The Group believes that liquid above ground stocks will continue to address market
fundamental deficits for the next 12 months, possibly longer. Hence the “lower-for-longer” view of prices remains unchanged
for the short term. In the medium to longer term, sustained and increasing market deficits, on the back of increasing 
demand, relatively flat primary supply and low platinum recycling growth, should support price appreciation.

Safety review
Safe production remains the Group’s key priority. Achieving zero harm demands an inherently safe work environment, the
adoption of leading safety practices and critical safe behaviour across all operations. During the six months ended
December 2015, the Group achieved its lowest ever 12 month moving average FIFR and ended the period under review with 
a six month FIFR of 0.048 per million man hours worked. In addition, some of the production teams recorded meaningful 
safety achievements at individual operations: Zimplats achieved four million fatality free shifts (taking two years and 
four months); one million fatality free shifts were achieved at Marula (11 months), Rustenburg Processing (one year 
and six months), 1 Shaft (11 months), 11 Shaft (10 months), 6 Shaft (two years and 11 months), 7 Shaft (three years 
and nine months) and 10 Shaft (one year and six months).

While over R1 billion has been spent on safety initiatives over the last three years (primarily on nets and bolts,
winch signalling devices, self-contained self-rescuers, fire retardant conveyor belts, shaft safety devices, safe blasting
systems, proximity detection systems, fire detection systems and safety training), safety remains a significant
challenge for the Group. During the first six months of the 2016 financial year, despite a 17% improvement in the FIFR, 
two employees regrettably suffered fatal injuries at Impala Rustenburg and another colleague lost his life at Mimosa.

Following the end of the reporting period, the Group has regrettably experienced three incidents, two at Impala
Rustenburg and one at Mimosa, which resulted in six fatalities. On 22 January 2016, four employees tragically lost their 
lives in an underground fire at Impala Rustenburg’s 14 Shaft. The whole of the Rustenburg operation was subsequently closed
for two days to engage employees on their safety readiness and emergency awareness, and to significantly refocus efforts
to achieving zero harm. All operations at 14 Shaft were suspended until 15 February 2016 when crews re-entered the upper
conventional section of the mine. Stoping and development activities in the upper sections commenced on 22 February
2016. The lower trackless and conventional mining sections remain closed until investigations into the cause of the
conveyor belt fire are completed and fire damage assessments, in consultation with the insurers, have been finalised. 
Instead of recruiting new teams as planned, all conventional mining crews from the lower section at 14 Shaft have been
re-deployed to other mining areas in Rustenburg.

The investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing and the insured asset damage (estimated to be R375 million)
and business interruption should be covered by the Group’s insurance programme. Initial indications are that the repairs
to the shaft are expected to be fully completed by July 2017. Because of the extended time period required to complete
the repairs, the impact on cash flow will be minimised by regular interim claims on the insurers.

The board of directors and the management team expressed their sincere condolences to the friends, families and
colleagues of the deceased, and recommit to achieving zero harm at all Implats’ operations. 

Operational review
Gross refined platinum production during the six months to 31 December 2015 increased by 9.8% to 692 100 ounces,
compared to 630 600 ounces achieved in the previous comparable period. This was primarily due to the impact of the 
ramp-up of operations at Impala Rustenburg in the comparable prior period following the five-month wage strike and 
increased matte production from Zimplats, offset by a lock-up of 72 000 ounces of platinum due to planned furnace 
maintenance at the Rustenburg smelters.

Group unit costs, excluding Mimosa and Two Rivers, benefited from the increased production volumes, as well as cost
containment initiatives in line with Implats’ response plan to low dollar metal prices, decreasing by 2.5% from 
R22 952 in the prior comparable period to R22 380 per platinum ounce in the period under review. On-mine costs 
decreased by 15.6% from R926 to R782 per tonne milled, and capital expenditure reduced from R2.2 billion in the 
comparable period to R1.9 billion.

Response plan review
A number of initiatives were announced in February and September 2015 in response to persistently low US dollar metal
prices. 

Both 8 Shaft and the 12 Shaft mechanised sections, which were identified as loss-making in the low price environment,
were closed as planned at the end of December 2015. Together these areas contributed 22 600 platinum ounces to 
Impala Rustenburg’s production in the six-month period, impacting more than 1 700 jobs.

Labour numbers at Impala Rustenburg have been reduced by approximately 2 690 people over the seven months to end
January 2016, following the closure of 8 Shaft and the 12 Shaft mechanised sections, as well as initiatives targeting
contractor efficiencies and labour optimisation through natural attrition and separations. Over this period, contractor
employment has reduced from 11 302 to 9 586 and own employees have declined from 32 536 to 31 562. Employee job losses 
were mitigated by replacing contractors and through transfers to the new 16 and 20 shafts.

The strategic review identified various measures to improve mining efficiencies and reduce operating costs and
targeted a saving of R930 million in the 2016 financial year. Further initiatives were subsequently identified and 
the budgeted operating cost base was reduced by a further R640 million, yielding a combined planned reduction of 
approximately R1.6 billion for the 2016 financial year, of which R1.3 billion was planned at Impala. 

At the end of December 2015 a saving of approximately R570 million had been realised at Impala, while all the other
operations remain on track to meet their targets for the year. A material part of these cost-saving initiatives included 
a stringent procurement plan targeting a 4% inflationary increase for the financial year. Results achieved during the
first six months showed a procurement cost containment of 1%.

The Group continues to focus on cash preservation and profitability in a lower metal price environment. The capital
budget for the 2016 financial year was reduced by R1.3 billion to R4.2 billion following further curtailment at the 
17 Shaft project and targeted reductions at Impala Rustenburg (R590 million), Marula (R45 million) and Zimplats 
(R640 million). Project development work at 17 Shaft has now been placed on a low cost care-and-maintenance programme 
pending higher PGM metal prices. It is now expected that only R240 million capital will be spent at 17 Shaft over the 
2016 and 2017 financial years, compared to R521 million previously planned. Over the six months to 31 December 2015, 
R772 million was spent on 16 and 20 shafts and R367 million at Zimplats. In total, R1.9 billion capital has been spent 
across the Group, resulting in a R510 million saving on planned capital expenditure over this period.

Managed operations
IMPALA PLATINUM
Mill throughput increased by 47% from the previous ramp-up affected comparable period to 5.9 million 
(H1 FY2015: 4.0 million) tonnes, and refined platinum production increased by 29% to 325 900 (H1 FY2015: 252 400) ounces. 
However, production in the period under review was impacted by maintenance work undertaken at the smelter, and the 
consequent lock-up of metal, as well as safety stoppages which again had a direct impact on stoping volumes, and the 
closure processes at 8 Shaft and the 12 Shaft mechanised sections. 

Material was stock-piled ahead of the smelter due to planned maintenance performed at both the No 3 and No 5 furnaces
during the reporting period. The full refurbishment and commissioning of the No 4 furnace, which is an additional
smelting unit, commenced in July 2015 and was completed at the end of November 2015. Three furnaces are now fully 
operational and all excess material is expected to be cleared during the second half of this financial year. 

The number of Section 54 safety stoppage instructions issued by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) continues 
to pose a significant challenge for the Rustenburg team. For the period under review, Impala recorded 42 DMR safety
stoppages, which led to a direct loss of 26 000 platinum ounces (430 000 mined tonnes), equating to approximately 
R530 million in lost revenue. While Impala remains very mindful of the safety issues that have affected operations 
over recent months, it continues to engage with the DMR in order to minimise the negative impacts of these stoppages 
on the safety risk profile and operational performance. 

The mill head grade declined marginally from 4.25 g/t to 4.15 g/t. Measures have been adopted to improve the head
grade by addressing off-reef mining, stoping widths and sweepings, and these have all started to yield positive results. 
In addition, continuous ramp-up of production volumes from 16 and 20 shafts will also assist in increasing mill head 
grades into the future.

The increased production volumes as well as various cost saving initiatives enabled significant cost containment and
consequently a reduction in unit costs, which decreased by 15.5% from the previous ramp-up affected comparable period to
R22 326 per platinum ounce refined (H1 FY2015: R26 430). Costs per tonne milled improved from R1 665 to R1 235.

Project development work at 17 Shaft has been halted given persistently low metal prices. The ramp-up of production at
16 Shaft is ahead of plan but 20 Shaft stoping performance was less than planned for the six months. Ongoing corrective
action is progressing and showing positive results. 

ZIMPLATS
Tonnes milled increased by 26% to 3.1 million (H1 FY2015: 2.5 million) as initiatives to mitigate the impact of lower
production volumes from Bimha Mine (Portal 4), following the underground collapse in July 2014, fully compensated for
lost production from this mine. Production has been supplemented by further open-pit mining and the redeployment of 
mining teams to other mines. The redevelopment of the Bimha Mine is progressing well, with on-reef development offsetting
development costs and full production is expected from April 2018. 

There was a significant improvement in run-of-mine production, and platinum in matte production increased by 27% to
130 300 (H1 FY2015: 102 400) ounces. The remaining stock-piled material (21 000 platinum ounces), which resulted from 
the May 2015 Zimplats smelter outage, will be treated in the second half of the 2016 financial year as material is 
delivered to IRS.

Unit costs benefited from the increased volumes as well as cost containment initiatives, and declined by 19.6% in
dollar terms to US$1 209 (H1 FY2015: US$1 504) per platinum ounce in matte. On-mine costs decreased from US$62 to 
US$50 per tonne milled.

Implats continues to support Zimbabwe’s aspirations to grow and diversify the PGM industry. On this basis, Zimplats
agreed to release approximately 36% of its ground in 2006 to the Government of Zimbabwe in return for cash and
indigenisation credits. In March 2013, Zimplats received a preliminary notice of the Government of Zimbabwe’s intention 
to compulsorily acquire additional land measuring 27 948 hectares within its special mining lease area. A formal 
objection was lodged at the time, but this demand has now been reiterated by government following further communication 
at the end of December 2015. The Group is engaging positively with the Government of Zimbabwe in this regard.

Aligned to this, on 8 January 2016 the indigenisation ministry published details in terms of the frameworks, templates
and procedures for implementing Zimbabwe’s indigenisation policy, in order to provide further clarity on the law and
its implementation. The legislation itself remains unchanged and Zimplats continues to engage with the Government of 
Zimbabwe to secure an acceptable and affordable framework to achieve these objectives.

The first stage refurbishment of the existing Selous Base Metals Refinery (BMR) to treat Zimplats’ smelter material
and considerations to expand furnace capacity to increase in-country smelting continues. To this end, Implats remains
supportive of beneficiation initiatives in Zimbabwe, provided these are affordable in the prevailing economic and 
commodity environment. 

MARULA
Marula delivered an improved performance during the period under review following Implats’ decision not to dispose of
this operation. The subsequent adoption of an optimisation strategy, specifically focusing on operational performance
and profitability, has resulted in a reduction in operating costs. 

Tonnes milled and head grade benefited from increased tonnage from the higher grade footwall section during the six
months and improved by 7% to 887 000 (H1 FY2015: 829 000) tonnes and by 5.6% to 4.37 (H1 FY2015: 4.14) g/t from the
previous comparable period, which was impacted by safety and labour stoppages. Consequently, platinum in concentrate
production increased by 13.0% to 41 800 (H1 FY2015: 37 000) ounces. 

As part of the mining optimisation programme to increase production to 90 000 ounces of platinum per annum, Marula’s
employees were moved from the old hybrid section to the new footwall section at Clapham and additional contractors have
been deployed in the hybrid section to sustain output from this area. This impacted unit costs during the period under
review as the contractors will only achieve planned production from the last quarter of this financial year. As a result,
unit costs increased marginally to R22 416 (H1 FY2015: R22 000) per platinum ounce in concentrate, which is well below
inflation and will improve further once planned production is achieved from the hybrid section. Costs per tonne milled
increased from R982 to R1 056.

Local community challenges and disruptions continue to be addressed by management at Marula.

IMPALA REFINING SERVICES (IRS)
IRS maintained its significant financial contribution to the Group despite low PGM prices. Platinum production from
mine-to-market operations remained in line with that from the previous comparable period at 289 300 (H1 FY2015: 286 700)
ounces, as lower volumes from Zimplats following a smelter lock-up at this operation in the last quarter of the previous
year was offset by increased production from Marula, Two Rivers and Mimosa. 

Production from third-party purchases and toll volumes decreased from 91 500 to 76 900 platinum ounces, largely due to
a lock-up of material in the Rustenburg smelter. Deliveries from third-party customers improved by 28% from 75 500 to
96 800 platinum ounces during the period. All back log concentrates from Zimplats and third-party customers are expected
to be processed by the end of the third quarter of the current financial year.

Non-managed operations
MIMOSA
Mimosa continued to operate exceptionally well with throughput and production exceeding steady-state capacity and
output achieved in the prior comparable period. Tonnes milled improved marginally to 1.3 million, while the head grade 
was maintained at 3.93g/t. This resulted in platinum in concentrate production increasing to 60 000 (H1 FY2015: 59 100)
ounces. Unit costs declined by 6.1% in dollar terms to US$1 466 (H1 FY2015: US$1 562) per platinum ounce in concentrate.
Costs per tonne decreased from US$71 to US$67.

A deferment of the 15% export levy on un-beneficiated platinum to 1 January 2017 was regularised by the Government of
Zimbabwe on 31 December 2015. Mimosa continues to consult with the Government of Zimbabwe in this regard.

TWO RIVERS 
Two Rivers had another excellent six months. Tonnes milled increased marginally to 1.7 million from the previous
comparable period and the head grade improved by 3% to 4.09g/t (H1 FY2015: 3.97g/t). Consequently, platinum in concentrate
production increased by 5.2% to 91 800 (H1 FY2015: 87 300) ounces. Unit costs benefited from the increased production
volumes and decreased by 6.2% to R11 416 (H1 FY2015: R12 165) per platinum ounce. Costs per tonne decreased from 
R630 to R617.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
There has been no material change to the technical assumptions, assessment criteria, and information relating to the
Group’s Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves, or legal title to its mining and exploration activities, as disclosed in
the integrated report for the financial year ended 30 June 2015. At Impala Rustenburg, 17 Shaft has been put onto a low
cost care-and-maintenance programme and this has necessitated a reduction in the Group’s Mineral Reserves. 

Main features relating to Implats’ Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as at 31 December 2015 relative to 
30 June 2015 are:
- Estimated total attributable Mineral Resources decreased by 1% (3 million ounces 4E) to 364 million ounces; the
  total attributable platinum ounces decreased by 2 million ounces to 194 million ounces
- Attributable Mineral Resources are dominated by Zimplats and Impala; the Zimplats Mineral Resources constitute 
  48% of total platinum resources
- Total attributable Mineral Reserves decreased by 20% (9 million ounces 4E) to 37 million ounces; the attributable
  platinum ounces decreased by 5.6 million ounces to 20.8 million ounces
- The main contributor to the decrease in Mineral Reserves is the exclusion of the 17 Shaft reserves from the Mineral
  Reserve estimate.

The revised Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve statement as at 30 June 2016, will provide the detailed updated
assessment and reporting criteria, as well as revised life-of-mine production profiles.

Financial performance
Revenue at R16.98 billion was R1.07 billion or 6.7% higher than the previous six months, as a result of:
- An increase in sales volumes of platinum, palladium, rhodium and nickel due to the higher production volumes and 
  a draw down of refined inventories to compensate for the lock-up of material as a result of furnace maintenance. 
  This accounted for a positive volume variance of R3.11 billion
- The average dollar revenue per platinum ounce sold of US$1 624, was US$709 or 30.4% lower and gave rise to a
  negative variance of R5.05 billion. The platinum price was 27.0% lower while the prices for palladium, rhodium 
  and nickel were down 23.2%, 34.6% and 38.8% respectively
- The average R/US$ exchange rate of 13.45 was 22.2% weaker than the 11.01 achieved during the prior six months
  resulting in a positive variance of R3.02 billion.

Cost of sales increased by 17.9%, or R2.57 billion to R16.96 billion compared to the six months to December 2014 
as a result of:
- Direct operating costs increased by R2.16 billion. After normalising the comparable period costs (adjusting for 
  the post-strike build-up), increases were contained to 7.8%, well below the mining inflation of 9.2%
- Depreciation increased by R623 million, mainly due to the increased units of production at Impala, the impact 
  of the weaker exchange rate on the Zimplats amortisation and an overall higher asset base
- Metals purchased by IRS increased by only R57 million as higher volumes purchased were offset by the lower rand
  metal prices
- The increase in metal inventories of R370 million was essentially due to the higher rand value of IRS stocks at
  December 2015 compared to June 2015.

As a result of the above, gross profit declined to R21 million.

Basic earnings per share were impacted by impairments of R257 million (equivalent to 28 cents per share) as a result
of the closure of the 12 Shaft mechanised sections at Impala Rustenburg.

In addition to the changes in gross profit and impairments, as noted above, the following material movements also
affected headline earnings:

Decreases in headline earnings:
- Net foreign exchange losses of R922 million versus R219 million in the prior period impacted by the weaker closing
  exchange rate of R15.48 compared to the R12.17 at June 2015
- Finance costs were on par with the previous period, but a reduction of capitalised borrowing cost resulted in an
  increase from R174 million in the prior period to R342 million through the statement of comprehensive income. 
  The reason for the reduction in capitalised borrowing cost was the transfer of assets from ‘asset under construction’ 
  to ‘completed assets’.

Increases in headline earnings:
- Cash costs of R808 million were transferred from cost of sales for the six months to December 2014 during the
  build-up after the 2014 strike, which was not repeated this reporting period
- Tax relief relating to a previously impaired debtor.

The gross cash as at 30 June 2015 was R2.6 billion and this improved to R6.4 billion as at the end of December 2015,
mainly as a result of the R4.0 billion cash from the equity raise and ongoing cash preservation programmes. Moreover, the
Group generated R630 million in free cash excluding spend on 16 and 20 shafts, which is funded through the proceeds of
the equity raise.

Total debt (excluding leases) increased by R1.2 billion to R7.96 billion, but this was largely due to the revaluation
of the dollar denominated convertible bond. This increase was more than offset by the increase in the value of the cross
currency interest rate swap, which was taken out to hedge the bond and is now valued at R1.3 billion. 

Given the continuing low rand PGM metal prices, the board has resolved not to declare an interim dividend.

Prospects
The challenges confronting South African PGM miners are significant and will continue to constrain primary metal
supply into the future. 

Together with increasing global demand for these metals, specifically in the key automotive sector, supported by
growing sales and tightening emission standards globally and in India in particular, the Group continues to forecast
fundamental deficits in PGMs over the medium to long term. Despite this view, near-term metal prices continue to be 
impacted by an uncertain global economic outlook and negative sentiment on resources in general, and in particular 
with respect to a slowing Chinese economy.

In this environment, Implats will continue to prioritise measures to preserve cash and enhance productivity and
profitability into the future. To this end, the Group has implemented a comprehensive response plan, which has already 
yielded significant improvements and will continue to be strengthened further to manage the impacts of the 14 Shaft 
fire at Impala Rustenburg and the impact of lower dollar metal prices at the Zimbabwean operations.

The Group remains resolute in its objective of achieving zero harm goals at Implats and to ensure the safety and
well-being of every employee. Implats will endeavour to finalise the investigation on the tragic 14 Shaft fire incident 
in consultation with the DMR, organised labour and the insurance providers. The Group aims to sequentially recommission 
portions of the affected bottom section of the shaft with the shaft being fully recommissioned by July 2017. In this 
process, Implats will redeploy people across the Rustenburg operation and protect jobs as best possible.

At this stage, the Group estimates that it will lose approximately 50 000 platinum ounces in the second half of the
year due to the 14 Shaft fire. Given this and the ongoing Section 54 stoppages, production at Impala has been revised 
to between 630 000 and 650 000 ounces of platinum for FY2016. The preliminary production estimate for FY2017 is between 
700 000 and 710 000 ounces. Thereafter, the previous guidance of building up to 830 000 platinum ounces per annum by 
FY2020 remains unchanged. 

Costs remain on target, but unit costs will be affected by the lower volumes and are expected to remain at R22 000 per
platinum ounce. The impact on profit before tax will be mitigated by proceeds from business interruption insurance, as
and when received. 

Production guidance for the other operations remains unchanged: Marula - 85 000 platinum ounces in concentrate;
Zimplats - 280 000 platinum ounces in matte; Mimosa - 110 000 platinum ounces in concentrate; and Two Rivers - 
170 000 platinum ounces in concentrate.

The capital estimate for the Group is R4.1 billion, marginally lower than previous guidance of R4.2 billion and
includes development expenditure of R1.3 billion.

6.  Derivative financial instrument 
    Implats entered into a Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) amounting to US$200 million to hedge certain 
    aspects of the foreign exchange risk on the US$ convertible bonds (note 9), being: exchange rate risk on dollar 
    interest payments and the risk of a future cash settlement of the bonds at a rand-dollar exchange rate weaker 
    than R9.24/US$. (US$200 million was swapped for R1 848 million on which Implats pays a fixed interest rate to 
    Standard Bank of 5.94%. Implats receives the 1% coupon on the US$200 million from Standard Bank on the 
    same date which Implats pays bond holders. In February 2018 Implats will repay the R1 848 million in return of 
    the US$200 million.)

    The CCIRS with Standard Bank is carried at its fair value of R1 311 (December 2014: R497) (June 2015: R630) million.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015

Shareholders are advised that Implats? headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the half year ended 31
December 2015 is expected to be between 50 and 59 cents which is between 20% and 10% lower than that
of the half year ended 31 December 2014 (HEPS of 66 cents).

Basic earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be between 29 and 35 cents which is between 30% and 15%
lower than the previous comparable period, being the half year ended 31 December 2014 (EPS of 41 cents).

The difference between EPS and HEPS for the six months to December 2015 is primarily due to the
impairment of the 12 Shaft mechanised section, which, as announced in September 2015, was closed in
December 2015.

The decline in HEPS is primarily due to the lower rand metal prices, which were 15% lower than the
previous comparable period ended 31 December 2014.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed and reported on
by the external auditors of Implats. The Group?s reviewed interim financial results for the period ended
31 December 2015 will be released on 25 February 2016.

Fire at Impala Rustenburg 14 Shaft

Implats regrets to announce that four employees have lost their lives following a fire, which occurred
underground at Impala Rustenburg’s 14 Shaft on 22 January 2016. The fire was detected during the
night shift of Friday, 22 January 2016, employees were immediately stopped from proceeding
underground and the teams working underground were evacuated from the various areas of the shaft.
However, four employees were reported missing and an immediate search and rescue operation was
initiated. Sadly, the bodies of the four missing employees were discovered by one of the search and
rescue teams during the late afternoon of Saturday, 23 January 2016. The four employees were
overcome by fumes while they were trying to find their way to safety.

Mine management is continuing its engagement with the families of the deceased and providing the
support and assistance required at this very difficult time. The Minister of Mineral Resources, the
Honourable Mr Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane, was in attendance at the mine during the afternoon of
Sunday, 24 January 2016 to obtain a full report from mine management. Minster Zwane also met
with the deceased employees’ families before addressing the media about this tragedy where he said,
“We need to navigate our way through this tragedy and ‘take hands’ in solving the issue without
blame in an honest way to avoid similar incidents”.

The detailed investigation is continuing to assess the cause of the fire and the damage that has
resulted. The fire has reportedly now been extinguished and the six rescue and assessment teams,
which are working in the lower reaches of the mine where the fire started, are clearing residual smoke
in certain areas. The telemetry systems on the shaft is showing that gas readings have reduced
appreciably as measured at the two primary surface ventilation fans. The system shows that the
upper section of the mine is clear, but power has not as yet been restored to the bottom section of the
shaft area.

It is too early to assess the effect on production at this stage.

Implats’ CEO, Terence Goodlace, commented, “This is a tragic loss for everybody and our heart-felt
condolences are with the families of the deceased. We are all deeply mourning the loss of our
colleagues and wish to express our most sincere sympathies to the various stakeholders affected by
this tragedy. The support we are receiving from the neighbouring mining community, including the
other operations, the Department of Mineral Resources, other levels of government and the
leadership of the respective unions is gratefully appreciated. My personal gratitude and appreciation
is also extended to the many people at Impala Rustenburg that have been working tirelessly through
this difficult and demanding time”.

Additional information will be provided to all stakeholders on a regular basis.
