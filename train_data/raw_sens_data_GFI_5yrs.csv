Operational update for the quarter ended 30 September 2020

SALIENT FEATURES
- 557,000 ounces of attributable gold production
- US$1,070 per ounce of all-in-cost

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Q3 2020 was a period of recovery for our operations that were most severely disrupted by COVID-19, namely South Deep
and Cerro Corona. The business in general performed well during the quarter and continues to settle into the 'new' 
normal created by COVID-19. While the impact of COVID-19 has been largely contained at our operations, a second wave has
commenced in certain parts of the world (mainly in the Northern hemisphere). However, we cannot rule out a second wave in 
the countries in which we operate and we must ensure that the necessary protocols are maintained across the business. 

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q3 2020 was 557koz, up 7% YoY (up 1% QoQ). All-in costs (AIC) decreased by
1% YoY (flat QoQ) to US$1,070/oz, while all-in sustaining costs (AISC) increased 2% YoY (and decreased 3% QoQ) to
US$964/oz. 

The Australian region produced 250koz at AIC of A$1,363/oz (US$984/oz) and AISC of A$1,288/oz (US$931/oz). Our mines
in Ghana produced 211koz (including 45% of Asanko) at AIC of US$1,068/oz and AISC of US$1,030/oz. Cerro Corona in Peru
produced 51koz (gold equivalent) at AIC of US$1,146 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of US$953 per gold equivalent
ounce.

South Deep had a strong recovery after a disrupted Q2 2020, producing 65koz at an AIC of R583,344/kg (US$1,075/oz) and
AISC of R572,447/kg (US$1,055/oz). The mine is generating meaningful cashflow at current prices. 

COVID-19 update
As at 9 November 2020, the number of active cases among Gold Fields' workforce was only 26 with none in hospital.
Since the beginning of the pandemic in March, Gold Fields has conducted more than 41,000 tests among its workforce, 
of which 1,745 were positive.

* ""Awaiting results"" and ""Active cases"" refers to the current figures.

The high level of testing is a tribute to the work done by our operations to keep our employees safe. Remarkably, we
have had no single positive case in our Australian operations. Other key activities to ensure safe operations include:
- Strict adherence to all government regulations/protocols;
- Closure of offices and imposition of travel restrictions;
- Standard operating procedures on return to work;
- Social distancing, sanitisation and mask wearing mandatory;
- Regular communication to employees about COVID-19, assisting them to work remotely and how to deal with the
  fall-out of the pandemic;
- Dedicated COVID-19 information portal;
- Mental health support programmes; and
- Social media awareness and return-to-work communication campaigns for employees, communities and others.

JOHANNESBURG 12 November 2020: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) is pleased to provide an operational update for 
the quarter ended 30 September 2020. Detailed financial and operational results are provided on a six-monthly basis 
i.e. at the end of June and December.    

Balance sheet 
Gold Fields remains in a strong financial position. During Q3 2020, there was a further decrease in the net debt
balance (including leases) to US$1,159m at 30 September 2020 from US$1,239m at 30 June 2020, after taking into account 
the interim dividend payment of US$85m. This implies a net debt to EBITDA of 0.68x, compared to 0.84x at end June 2020. 
The net debt balance (excluding leases) decreased to US$796m from US$876m at the end of June 2020. 

Post quarter end, Gold Fields repaid the 2020 bond that were outstanding from a combination of cash resources and by
drawing on our US$ debt facilities. 

In a report released on 2 November 2020, Standard and Poor's Global ratings revised its outlook on Gold Fields to
positive from stable, and affirmed the 'BB+/B' global scale ratings and 'zaAAA/zaA-1+' South Africa national scale ratings.

Salares Norte
The Salares Norte project continued its positive momentum during Q3 2020. Year-to-date, US$78m has been spent on the
project, including pre-development costs of US$11m (incurred during Q1 2020), district exploration of US$11m, camp Phase
1 construction costs of US$13m and initial capex of US$43m. At the end of September 2020, engineering progress was 85.3%
compared to plan of 83.0%. 

At the end of Q3 2020, construction progress stood at 8.8% vs. plan of 4.9%, contributing towards total project
progress of 19.4% coming in slightly ahead of plan of 18.1%. Camp Phase I construction was completed during Q3 2020 while
Phase II construction was three months ahead of schedule at the end of the quarter. The diversion channel earthworks and
precast installation progressed as planned during Q3 and the bulk earthworks contractor commenced activities on 21
September. The mining contractor completed mobilisation and began pioneering works on 1 October, as planned. The pre-strip 
and construction of the process plant is expected to commence at the end of the year. 

Although no district exploration drilling was planned for Q3 2020, 1,650 metres were drilled during September. This
allowed the team to catch up on the metres that were planned but not drilled during Q2 due to COVID-19 related
restrictions. At the end of Q3 2020, total district exploration metres stood at 10,108 metres for the year compared to 
plan of 9,084 metres.

At the end of September 78% of the project Estimate at Completion (EAC) budget (excluding remaining contingency) had a
fixed and firm price (excluding inflation factors) through contracts and purchase orders awarded, significantly
reducing the risk of price differences.

Outlook and guidance
FY 2020 production and cost guidance remains unchanged from the update in August 2020. Attributable equivalent gold
production for 2020 for the Group is expected to be between 2.200Moz and 2.250Moz (original guidance: 2.275Moz -
2.315Moz).

AISC is expected to be between US$960/oz and US$980/oz (original guidance: US$920/oz - US$940/oz) and AIC is expected
to be between US$1,070/oz and US$1,090/oz (original guidance: US$1,035/oz - US$1,055/oz). 

Potential further COVID-19 related disruptions increases the risk to Group production and cost guidance.

We have maintained the view that the appropriate level of sustaining capital expenditure for our business is
US$250-300/oz. In recent years, we have spent at the lower end of this range due to high project capital expenditure. 
However, our most recent business planning process shows that for next year, we will be required to spend closer to the upper 
end of the range. This will enable us to spend on key projects that will allow us to sustain our production base for the next
8-10 years. Specifically in Australia, to ensure that we maintain the 1Moz production base, we will need to spend
additional capital to extend the mine life at Agnew; develop a second decline at Wallaby at Granny Smith; and continue to
invest in the ever-growing Invincible complex at St Ives.

South Deep was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown restrictions during Q2 2020. The
mine has slowly ramped up production as labour numbers returned to normal, while adherence to COVID-19 protocols has
continued in order to manage the pandemic.   

Gold production increased by 63% to 2,019kg (64,900oz) in the September quarter from 1,238kg (39,800oz) in the June
quarter due to an increase in volume mined.  

Underground reef grade mined decreased by 6% to 6.37g/t in the September quarter from 6.74g/t in the June quarter as a
result of an increase in destress mining as well as mining lower grade stopes compared to Q2. The reduction in broken
grade is in line with the mining sequence. Reef yield increased by 5% to 6.07g/t in the September quarter from 5.80g/t 
in the June quarter.  

Development increased by 56% to 995m in the September quarter from 638m in the June quarter, while destress increased
by 83% to 10,533m2 in the September quarter from 5,751m2 in the June quarter. These increases are mainly as a result of
production ramp-up post COVID-19 restrictions. Similarly, secondary support and backfill increased by 161%
quarter-on-quarter and 122% quarter-on-quarter, respectively. 

All-in cost decreased by 21% to R583,344/kg (US$1,075/oz) in the September quarter from R738,079/kg (US$1,231/oz) in
the June quarter mainly driven by higher gold sold, partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and
depreciation and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 12% to 127,300oz in the September quarter from 144,500oz in the June quarter mainly due
to lower tonnes milled as a result of lower production days. Yield decreased by 3% to 1.14g/t in the September quarter
from 1.17g/t in the June quarter. The difference between the mined grade of 1.40g/t and the yield of 1.14g/t is
attributable to lower grade stockpiles processed.

Ore processed in the September quarter included 1.0Mt of stockpiles at an average head grade of 0.78g/t compared to
1.1Mt of stockpiles at an average head grade of 0.80g/t processed in the June quarter.

All-in cost increased by 12% to US$1,099/oz in the September quarter from US$982/oz in the June quarter due to lower
gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.
Capital expenditure increased by 7% to US$41.5 million in the September quarter from US$38.8 million in the June
quarter.

All-in cost for Tarkwa is expected to be US$1,020/oz, above original guidance for 2020 (US$970/oz), mainly as a result
of higher royalties on the back of a higher gold price realised and additional COVID-19 costs. The higher cost guidance
is already factored into Group guidance.

Gold production increased by 22% to 61,900oz in the September quarter from 50,800oz in the June quarter mainly due to
higher yield. Yield increased by 33% to 1.65g/t in the September quarter from 1.24g/t in the June quarter due to higher
grades fed from the Damang Pit Cutback as the mining transitioned from the Huni Sandstones to the better mineralised
lithologies. Mining transitioned through the bulk of the Huni Sandstone during the quarter, with minimal volumes of Huni
Sandstone remaining.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 3% to 7.9Mt in the September quarter from 8.1Mt in the June quarter mainly due to less
production days following the change in the production calendar in the June quarter. However, ore tonnes mined
increased by 54% to 2.3Mt in the September quarter from 1.5Mt in the June quarter due to improved equipment availability 
and mining in exposed ore areas.

Gold mined increased by 61% to 115koz in the September quarter from 71koz in the June quarter due to higher ore tonnes
and grade mined.

All-in cost decreased by 36% to US$732/oz in the September quarter from US$1,149/oz in the June quarter mainly due to
higher gold sold and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by higher capital
expenditure. 

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 152% to US$5.3m in the September quarter from US$2.1m in the June quarter
mainly due to expenditure incurred on engineering projects, gravity screens and a Knelson concentrator. Non-sustaining
capital expenditure decreased by 33% to US$1.4m in the September quarter from US$2.1m in the June quarter due to timing
of capital expenditure for the second phase of the Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) raise.

All figures in table on a 100% basis.

Gold production decreased by 29% to 49,000oz (100% basis) in the September quarter from 69,000oz (100% basis) in the
June quarter mainly due to lower yield and tonnes milled. Yield decreased by 21% to 1.04g/t in the September quarter from
1.31g/t in the June quarter.

Total tonnes mined increased by 29% to 12.3Mt in the September quarter from 9.5Mt in the June quarter on the back of
increased stripping at the Esaase and Akwasiso pits. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 30% to 1Mt in the September quarter
from 1.4Mt in the June quarter. The Nkran Cut 2 west wall failure has forced the team to look for other ore sources and as
a result has required the acceleration of stripping activities to expose more ore.

Waste tonnes mined increased by 39% to 11.3Mt in the September quarter from 8.1Mt in the June quarter due to
accelerated stripping of the Esaase main pit to expose ore source for Q4. Further updates will be given in the March 2021 
quarter after review of the long term plan.

The accelerated stripping to expose new ore sources has significantly increased costs. This increased stripping
together with increased exploration activity has resulted in a 35% increase in all-in cost to US$1,760/oz in the September
quarter from US$1,305/oz in the June quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 31% to US$7.0m in the September quarter from US$10.2m in the June quarter
mainly due to timing of expenditure on the TSF raise. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 3% to US$12.1m in
the September quarter from US$12.5m in the June quarter due to timing.

Gold equivalent gold production increased by 9% to 50,500oz in the September quarter from 46,300oz in the June quarter
due to higher gold grades processed, together with a higher price factor, resulting from the higher copper price during
the September quarter.

 Total tonnes mined increased by 68% to 4.3Mt in the September quarter from 2.6Mt in the June quarter due to the
increase in the workforce and mining fleet after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. A waste recovery plan has been
implemented, which includes progressive increase of the mining fleet and building an access ramp on the north of the pit to
implement an additional mining front in 2021. 

Gold yield increased by 6% to 0.56g/t in the September quarter from 0.53g/t in the June quarter due to a 6% increase
in gold head grade processed to 0.83g/t in the September quarter from 0.78g/t in the June quarter. The copper yield
decreased by 5% to 0.36% in the September quarter from 0.38% in the June quarter on the back of a decrease in copper head
grade processed.

All-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 24% to US$594/oz in the September quarter from US$783/oz in the June quarter
driven by lower operating expenses and the positive impact of inventory movement resulting from higher closing
concentrate stocks, partially offset by lower by-product credits, lower gold ounces sold and higher capital expenditure. 
All-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 1% to US$1,146 per equivalent ounce in the September quarter from US$1,152 per
equivalent ounce in the June quarter driven mainly by the positive impact of the inventory movement.

Capital expenditure increased by 64% to US$12.6 million in the September quarter from US$7.7 million in the June
quarter due to increased construction activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities following the impact of
COVID-19 restrictions in the June quarter.

All-in cost for Cerro Corona is expected to be US$1,120/oz gold equivalent (US$790/oz gold), above original guidance
for 2020 (US$830/oz gold equivalent, US$575/oz gold), mainly as a result of lower production on the back of COVID-19
interruptions, additional COVID-19 costs and additional royalties due to higher metal prices. The higher cost guidance 
is already factored into Group guidance.

Gold production decreased by 5% to 90,500oz in the September quarter from 94,900oz in the June quarter as an 18%
decrease in tonnes milled was partially offset by a 16% increase in yield. 

Total tonnes mined at the underground mines decreased by 10% to 628,000t in the September quarter from 698,000t in the
June quarter due to less production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter. During the September
quarter the underground development fleet was rationalised and emphasis shifted to ore production. 

Total waste tonnes mined in the open pits decreased by 50% to 1.6 Mt in the September quarter from 3.3Mt in the June
quarter. Capital waste tonnes decreased by 99% to 11,000t in the September quarter from 1.3Mt in the June quarter,
following the conclusion of pre-strip activities at Neptune stage 6 pit early in the September quarter. Operational waste
tonnes decreased by 17% to 1.6Mt in the September quarter from 2.0Mt in the June quarter. Year-to-date the open pit
production is in line with the planned mining sequence and during Q3 the mining fleet was also utilised to focus on 
additional progressive rehabilitation. In addition the current quarter had a reduced number of days compared to the 
previous quarter.

Ore tonnes mined at the open pits decreased by 42% to 461,000t in the September quarter from 791,000t in the June
quarter, with all open pit ore being sourced from Neptune pit stages 5 and 6. Pre-strip activities of Neptune stage 
7 pit will commence in November 2020.

Surface mined grade increased by 45% to 1.76g/t in the September quarter from 1.21g/t in the June quarter with high
grade ore sourced from Neptune stage 6 pit.

Total tonnes processed decreased by 18% to 1.12Mt in the September quarter from 1.36Mt in the June quarter due to less
production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter and a four day planned mill shutdown to replace
liners.

All-in cost decreased by 17% to A$1,149/oz (US$839/oz) in the September quarter from A$1,388/oz (US$900/oz) in the
June quarter due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower capital expenditure, partially
offset by lower gold sold.

Capital expenditure decreased by 27% to A$22 million (US$16 million) in the September quarter from A$30 million 
(US$19 million) in the June quarter following the conclusion of Neptune stage 6 pre-strip activities during the 
September quarter.

Mine physicals in table on a 100% basis.

Gold production decreased by 22% to 55,900oz in the September quarter from 71,900oz in the June quarter due to
decreased ore processed and decreased yield.

Ore tonnes mined decreased by 13% to 1.86Mt in the September quarter from 2.13Mt in the June quarter as mining
activity focused on stripping in stages 2 and 3 of the pit.

Yield decreased by 10% to 0.92g/t in the September quarter from 1.02g/t in the June quarter due to the processing of
low grade stockpiles together with a decrease in grade of ore from source.

Tonnes processed decreased by 14% to 1.89Mt in the September quarter from 2.19Mt in the June quarter with decreased
availability at the processing plant due to less production days in the September quarter compared to the June quarter,
combined with an extended planned shutdown to perform a full reline on the SAG mill and crusher. A ball mill bearing
failure on restarting the process plant after the shutdown impacted production for a further seven days. A specialist team
was mobilised and the root cause of the failure was determined and rectified prior to the installation of a replacement
bearing.   

All-in cost increased by 11% to A$1,518/oz (US$1,085oz) in the September quarter from A$1,363/oz (US$886/oz) in the
June quarter due to lower gold sold and increased capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sale before
amortisation and depreciation.

Capital expenditure (on a 50% basis) increased by 15% to A$13 million (US$9 million) in the September quarter from
A$11 million (US$7 million) in the June quarter with pre-strip activities at the Gruyere pit stage 3 continuing during the
quarter. 

All-in cost for Gruyere is expected to be A$1,350/oz (US$945/oz), above original guidance for 2020 (A$1,150/oz,
US$795/oz), mainly as a result of lower production due to plant downtime resulting from a ball mill motor bearing failure
(previously reported on by Gold Road) and mill configuration changes to cater for increased fresh rock processing, higher
processing and COVID-19 relating expenditure, as well as additional royalties due to a higher gold price realised. The
higher cost guidance is already factored into Group guidance.

Certain forward-looking statements
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933
(the Securities Act) and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) with respect to Gold
Fields' financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies, competitive position,
growth opportunities for existing services, plans and objectives of management, markets for stock and other matters.

These forward-looking statements, including, among others, those relating to the future business prospects, revenues,
income and production and operational guidance of Gold Fields, wherever they may occur in this report, are necessarily
estimates reflecting the best judgement of the senior management of Gold Fields and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. 
As a consequence, these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of various important factors, including
those set forth in this report. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: 
- changes in the market price of gold, and to a lesser extent copper and silver;
- material changes in the value of Rand and non-US Dollar currencies;
- difficulties, operational delays, cost pressures and impact from labour relations following its restructuring at the
  South Deep operation in South Africa;
- the ability of the Group to comply with requirements that it provide benefits to affected communities;
- the effect of relevant government regulations, particularly labour, environmental, tax, royalty, health and safety,
  water, regulations and potential new legislation affecting mining and mineral rights;
- court decisions affecting the South African mining industry, including, without limitation, regarding the
  interpretation of mineral rights legislation and the treatment of health and safety claims;
- the challenges associated with replacing annual mineral reserve and resource depletion as well as growing its
  reserve and resource base to extend the life of operations;
- the ability to achieve anticipated efficiencies and other cost savings in connection with past and future
  acquisitions or joint ventures;
- the success of the Group's business strategy, development activities and other initiatives, particularly at Damang
  and the Salares Norte project;
- changes in technical and economic assumptions underlying Gold Fields' mineral reserve estimates;
- supply chain shortages and increases in the prices of production imports;
- changes in health and safety regulations that could lead to claims or liability for regulatory breaches;
- the occurrence of operational disruptions such as stoppages related to environmental and industrial accidents and
  pollution incidents;
- loss of senior management or inability to hire or retain sufficiently skilled employees or sufficient representation
  among Historically Disadvantaged Persons in management positions;
- power cost increases as well as power stoppages, fluctuations and usage constraints;
- regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change;
- high debt levels posing a risk to viability and making the Group more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive
  conditions;
- the ability of the Group to protect its information technology and communication systems and the personal data it
  retains as well as the failure of such systems;
- the ability to obtain, renew and comply with, water use licences and water quality discharge standards;
- the occurrence of future acid mine drainage related pollution;
- geotechnical challenges due to the ageing of certain mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex,
  often deeper underground, deposits;
- economic, political or social instability in the countries where Gold Fields operates;
- downgrades in the credit rating of South Africa and its impact on Gold Fields' ability to secure financing;
- reliance on outside contractors to conduct some of its operations;
- ageing infrastructure, unplanned breakdowns and stoppages that may delay production, increase costs and industrial
  accidents;
- the inability to modernise operations and remain competitive within the mining industry;
- the effects of regional re-watering at South Deep;
- the effects of a failure of a dam at a tailings facility and the closure of adjacent mines;
- actual or alleged breach or breaches in governance processes, fraud, bribery or corruption at Gold Fields'
  operations that leads to censure, penalties or negative reputational impacts;
- the occurrence of labour disruptions and industrial actions;
- the adequacy of the Group's insurance coverage;
- financial flexibility could be limited by South African exchange control regulations;
- difficulty controlling theft of gold and copper bearing materials and illegal mining on some Gold Fields properties;
- the costs and burdens associated with tenements in Australia which are subject to native title claims, including any
  compensation payable to native title holders;
- the impact of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and the spread of other contagious diseases, such as coronavirus (COVID-19);
- the identification of a material weakness in disclosure and internal controls over financial reporting;
- difficulty with participating in future issues of securities, or in bringing an action against Gold Fields, for
  shareholders outside South Africa;
- liquidity risks in trading ordinary shares on JSE Limited;
- Gold Fields' ability to pay dividends or make similar payments to its shareholders; and
- shareholders' equity interests in Gold Fields becoming diluted upon the exercise of outstanding share options.

Further details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting Gold Fields are described in Gold Fields' filings with
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Integrated
Annual Report 2019 and the annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019. Gold Fields undertakes no
obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Remarks by the Gold Fields Chair, Ms Cheryl Carolus, at the Gold Fields
AGM on 20 August 2020:


    Good afternoon. As has become customary let me start by providing
    a brief summary of the key developments at Gold Fields not just
    for 2019 but for the year to date as well. 2020 has indeed been a
    year that we will not forget  both in our professional and in our
    personal capacities. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to live
    outside of our comfort zones and, for Gold Fields, to operate well
    outside its business-as-usual parameters.

    I would like to pay tribute to how our 17,000 people have managed
    this crisis.

    To date 1,443 of our workforce have been infected and, tragically,
    three colleagues have died as a result of Covid-19. We cannot name
    two of them, but our heartfelt condolences go out to their
    families and friends. I also want to express my condolences on the
    death of Josephat Zvaipa, COO of Galiano Gold, our partners at the
    Asanko gold mine.

    Of the employees and contractors that have tested positive, 784
    have recovered, in part due to the exceptional medical care and
    assistance provided by our facilities and support given by the
    mines as well as the public health institutions we work with.

    The situation could have been worse had the company not acted
    swiftly to introduce a range of strategies and programmes to
    prevent our people getting infected, including strict adherence to
    all government protocols, sanitation, distancing, wearing of
    masks, travel restrictions and extensive educational campaigns for
    our workforce.

    Our operations have also gone out of their way to assist
    communities and governments as they battle the pandemic. They have
    done so voluntarily by providing much-needed equipment, PPE and
    resources to hospitals and clinics, funded awareness campaigns on
    community radio stations and organised sanitation of public
    facilities, amongst many other initiatives. A number of our
    directors, managers and employees have also been donating in their
    personal capacity to funds and organisations that assist people
    who are directly impacted by the pandemic. I thank them for this.

    All this and our employees have managed to keep our operations
    running relatively smoothly and profitably. As you would have seen
    from our interim results announcement this morning, the impact of
    the pandemic on production has been limited  we expect to be
    within 3% of our original production guidance for 2020. As a
    result of Covid-related costs, such as testing and site
    adjustments, and higher royalties due to the surging gold price,
    we have upped our cost guidance for the year, but marginally so.
    Amid the continued strong operating performance, and with the help
    of the strong gold price, our cash-inflow for the six months was a
    very healthy US$320m.


                                    4
A positive development emerging from the current crisis is the
strong focus on the health of our workers and our communities. We
have always prioritised safety at our operations, but this crisis
has reminded us to give equal attention to the health and wellness
of our people. Its highly unlikely that measures such as social
distancing will remain with us once the crisis is over, but what
we will retain are the ability to test our workers, support them
as they deal with occupational and non-occupational diseases and
focus on their mental wellbeing.
The pandemic has also seen a surge in violence against women. Our
Corporate Office and South Deep teams used Mandela Day to express
their support and raise funds for organisations that seek to help
victims of gender-based violence, a cause the Board and I
personally whole-heartedly support. Turning to safety, tragically
we had a fatal incident at South Deep in June this year. Abel
Magajane, a shaft timberman, succumbed from injuries sustained in
an underground accident. He leaves behind his wife and three
children. His death follows that of Maria Ramela, also at South
Deep, almost exactly a year earlier. We once again extend our
heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of
Abel and Maria.

We firmly support our management teams efforts to reduce
fatalities and serious injuries. I believe that our two key safety
programmes  Courageous Safety Leadership and Vital Behaviours 
are critical to achieving Zero Harm, together with strict
adherence to and implementation of our stringent safety standards
and rules.

In my Chairs Report in the latest Integrated Annual Report, I
wrote that I considered 2019 the most successful in my tenure as
Chairperson of Gold Fields. It was an exceptional year, during
which the companys reinvestment strategy, which commenced in late
2016, came to fruition. The impact of the companys three-year,
US$1bn investment programme, is significant. We essentially built
two new mines  Gruyere in Australia and Damang in Ghana  bought
45% of the prospective Asanko mine in Ghana and have taken a
greenfields project  Salares Norte in Chile  to a positive
construction decision. There is also the continued investment in
near-mine exploration at our Australian operations to secure their
longevity.

I was privileged to attend the opening of Gruyere last year. It
was heartening to see the efforts by our team at the mine to
integrate the Indigenous people into the workforce and share the
benefits of mining with the community.
Our portfolios performance was also boosted by the progress made
at South Deep. After a difficult 2018, in which we undertook a
significant restructuring process, the mine has reported material
and steady progress towards sustainable growth. These developments
have been further entrenched during 2020, despite the impact of
Covid-19.

Our portfolio is now in a strong position to maintain sustainable
production of 2 million to 2.5 million ounces per year for the
next 10 years and continue to generate cash sustainably into the

                                5
foreseeable future. The cash already generated by our mines has
not only enabled us to invest in the Companys future growth but
also pay off debt and create significant value for our
stakeholders. During 2019, Gold Fields' total value distribution
to our stakeholders amounted to US$2.6bn in the form of payments
to governments, capital providers, business suppliers and our
workforce. Significantly, about a third of this value remained
with our host communities.

My optimism about the future of the Company is not only based on
its sound operational and financial performance, but also on its
firm commitment to excellent environmental, social and governance
systems and performance. During 2019 and 2020 to date, Gold Fields
reported no serious environmental incidents. We are building on
our successful forays into renewable energy at our Australian
mines, particularly the microgrid at our Agnew mine. With almost
60% of the mines energy now coming from renewables, Agnew has
become a landmark renewables project not only in Australia, but
also for the global mining sector. As we expand the use of
renewables to our other mines, together with our energy efficiency
initiatives, this will make a significant contribution to reducing
our energy costs, securing energy supplies and reducing our carbon
footprint.

The Board is also working closely   with management in ensuring that
the governance and management       of Gold Fields 34 tailings
facilities are monitored closely.   This includes the implementation
of the stringent Global Industry    Standard on Tailings Management
released this month.

We have made reasonable progress on improving the diversity of our
workforce. Around 20% of our workforce and management are now
female, half of whom work in core mining activities. We aim to
improve on this as we seek to attract more women to our mines
around the world and further entrench diversity among our
workforce.

There have been no recent changes to the Board or Executive
Committee of the Company. I am confident that we can maintain this
stability and retain this team of dedicated, able women and men.
Their experience, knowledge and commitment was undoubtedly a key
reason for Gold Fields success in 2019 and the way the company
has managed the challenges of 2020. However, this does not absolve
the Board from its critical duty to ensure succession for the most
critical roles within the Company. Succession planning has moved
up in the Boards agenda over recent years, and we are applying
our minds to ensure continuity when key members of the executive
retire or leave.

On this note, I would like to state that Nick Holland, after 24
years as executive director and 13 years as CEO, will retire from
his position in September 2021. This is in line with the Companys
retirement policy, as has been disclosed to shareholders regularly
in the Companys Remuneration Report. A global search for a
suitable replacement will commence soon.


                                6
    I would like to end by thanking my fellow directors and Gold
    Fields executive leadership team, along with the employees of
    this Company, for their dedication and commitment to the
    sustainability of our business.

Remarks by the Chair of the Gold Fields Social, Ethics and Transformation
Committee, Dr Carmen Letton, at the Gold Fields AGM on 20 August 2020,

    Good afternoon, Shareholders and our Management Team

    I want to start by echoing our Chairpersons praise for the strong
    commitment Gold Fields employees have shown in assisting each
    other, their communities and their governments during the current
    COVID-19 crisis.

    These are very challenging times for all of us both personally and
    professionally. But it has also brought out the very best in our
    employees. They have not only ensured that our mines continue to
    run safely, profitably and sustainably, but that stakeholders,
    particularly our communities, receive the help they need to deal
    with this pandemic and the country crisis.

    I would also like to express my sincere          condolences to the
    relatives, friends and colleagues of those      lost to COVID-19 or
    mining-related accidents. It remains the GFL    Board and Management
    teams continual and determined focus to keep   our people safe.

    Before reviewing the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committees
    recent work, it is worth reiterating its wide-ranging mandate
    built around our key stakeholders  our employees and contractors,
    communities, governments, shareholders and business partners. This
    mandate comprises:
     - Social and Economic Development;
     - Good corporate citizenship;
     - Strong environmental, health and safety custodianship, though
       oversight of this rests with the SHSD Committee;
     - Labour and employment practices;
     - Transformation;
     - Communication, reputation and branding; and
     - Risk oversight related to SET.

    It is the responsibility and has been the focus of, this Committee
    to ensure that Gold Fields has sound relationships with our
    stakeholders through responsible business practices in line with
    industry-leading guidelines.

    Strong stakeholder relationships are at the heart of Gold Fields
    activities and the Committee seeks to ensure that the company
    continues to engage with stakeholders. We discuss and negotiate
    key decisions, mitigate any adverse environmental and social
    impacts and, most critically, share the benefits of mining.

    During 2019, Gold Fields generated revenue of almost US$2.6
    billion, which was distributed to our key stakeholders as follows:
     - Our workforce: US$395 million;
                                    7
 - Our capital providers and shareholders: US$162 million;
 - Governments, in the form of taxes and royalties: US$254
   million;
 - Our business partners: US$1.74 billion; and,
 - Our communities in the form of Socio-Economic Development
   spending: US$22 million.

In the first half of 2020, total distributed revenue was US$1.3
billion and stakeholder distributions were maintained at 2019
levels.

In addition to our Socio-Economic Development spend, our
operations supported host communities and governments through
donations and other contributions during the current COVID-19
crisis. To date, our help for communities and governments to
combat the pandemic has totalled almost US$2 million. Initiatives
have included donations of medical and sanitisation equipment,
food provisions to our most vulnerable, protective gear for our
front line people and educational campaigns in the community.
These contributions demonstrate the commitment of our mines to
going beyond compliance in safeguarding the health and wellbeing
of their communities.

Our investment in communities goes well beyond Socio-Economic
Development spending and donations. Gold Fields seeks to help
alleviate unemployment and create sustainable economies through
our community employment and procurement programs. As at June
2020, some 53% of our workforce  thats 8,200 employees and
contractors  lived in our host communities, while about 30% of
total supplier spend was with local community enterprises.

Quantifying this impact across Gold Fields businesses shows that
overall, almost 30% of the revenue we generate was distributed to
our host communities. Now, our mine management teams have been
incentivised to maintain and develop this level of support into
the future.

Among the few positives to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic is
the development of a closer working relationship with host
governments in supporting their health efforts, by providing
facilities, resources and much-needed funding. Equally positive,
governments have declared mining an essential service, which
enables us to continue operating. We hope to extend this working
relationship beyond the pandemic, in order to address issues
holding back mining sector growth in the many countries in which
we operate.

For many years, our CEO has spoken out for governments, trade
unions and mining companies to enter a social compact to grow the
total mining pie for the benefit of all stakeholders, rather than
battle over slices of an ever-shrinking pie. This has been
particularly evident amid the recent wave of resource nationalism
in many mineral-rich nations. Agreements needed to boost the
mining sector have not been forthcoming with most stakeholders
pursuing their own self-interest. We hope that the Covid-19 crisis
acts as a catalyst for this much needed dialogue.
                                8
Turning now to our People strategy. We continue to focus on
building a more diverse and inclusive workforce, with particular
emphasis on employing more women, residents from our host
communities and, in South Africa, historically disadvantaged
people. A diversity and inclusion strategy was approved by the
Board last year. The strategy, in addition to increasing the
attraction and retention of female employees, emphasises the
importance of ensuring that all people are treated with dignity
and respect. It focuses on workplace inclusiveness and diversity
as well as workplace sustainability and accountability.

The Companys diversity and inclusiveness strategy sets out our
people goals for the next five years. This will create a
foundation for building a truly diversified and inclusive company,
reflective of the societies in which we operate. This year, the
management team is working with the regions to set up a global
gender program, while supporting the increased representation of
youth, Historically Disadvantaged South Africans, and Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia. Unconscious bias and
diversity training has been rolled out across the Group to assist
employees in understanding their biases and raise awareness. This
strategy is live and each year we seek to improve and strengthen
our approaches and goals.

In some of these areas, we are making good progress. Currently,
women make up 20% of our global workforce, including in our core
mining activities. Youth representation is approximately 30%,
representation of Historically Disadvantaged South Africans at
South Deep 72% and, as I reported earlier, 53% of our workforce
live in our communities. Clearly, at the end of our 5-Year
strategy we hope to have maintained or potentially raised these
numbers markedly.

You may ask why the focus on our youth as an integral strategy
foundation. The future of work, the workplace in general and
mining in particular are changing  and changing at an
unprecedented rate. As we progress towards the mine of the future,
it is inevitable that we will rely increasingly on new entrants
into the labour market who possess the technical and non-technical
skills necessary to prosper at the digital edge. It also requires
us to retrain, where possible, existing employees to succeed in an
environment where automation, modernisation, mechanisation and
digitisation are key. In the past six years, the company has
invested almost US$90 million in targeted human resources
development and training programs.

Now, just a few words on our increasing focus on Indigenous
Peoples issues in Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples are key stakeholders at all our mines and we already have
an excellent relationship and formal Native Title Agreement with
the Yilka and Sullivan Edwards People at the Gruyere mine.      We
have also just embarked on a program to develop a similar
framework to support and engage with the Tjwarl People, who hold
native title rights and interests over a large area of the


                                9
Northern Gold Fields. This includes land on which the Agnew Mine
and exploration tenure are located.

Gold Fields Australia is making good progress implementing its
Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan that seeks to develop
respectful relations and develop formal consultation processes. We
want to create meaningful opportunities, such as employment and
contracting, with Indigenous people.

In this context, heritage management at our mines is also
critical, particularly in the wake of the Juukan Gorge incident on
May 24 this year. Rio Tinto blasted an area of Juukan Gorge, in
accordance with regulatory approvals.        Still, it destroyed
Aboriginal rock shelters thought to be about 46,000 years old. The
incident has received extensive media coverage, with significant
reputational damage to Rio Tinto and the broader Australian mining
industry.

As a direct response to the Juukan Gorge incident, Gold Fields has
undertaken a review of our own heritage management processes,
including the legal approvals that each operation holds for the
destruction of Aboriginal heritage sites. Destruction is the
unfortunate word used in the formal legal framework in Australia.
We are also following closely the Western Australian Governments
efforts to refresh the existing Aboriginal heritage laws and will
participate in the consultation process regarding the proposed new
legislation.

Moving to our communications, reputation and branding efforts. In
the past two years, Gold Fields has changed gears on this front in
order to enhance stakeholder experience and improve peoples daily
lives.    We have adopted and developed a range of social,
professional and commercial media platforms. These support our
employees, raise awareness of our support efforts and communicate
with a much broader audience.     This program has us very highly
placed in terms of brand and recognition, with some 4.8 million
impressions, 370,000 engagements with our content, and 300,000
followers of our publishing.     The key purposes in all of our
communications, reputation and branding efforts are:
 - Keeping our employees, their families and communities safe;
 - Keeping employees informed about what is happening in their
   company and specific countries;
 - Keeping our employees connected, energised, motivated and
   productive (which is especially important in our remote and on-
   mine workers);
 - Safeguarding our employees mental health;
 - Keeping stakeholders informed; and
 - Informing our communities of initiatives and empowering them
   with that information.

Finally, I would like to talk briefly about the issue of artisanal
and small-scale mining at and around our Damang and Tarkwa mines
in Ghana. This issue poses a potential risk in a pre-election and
high gold price environment. Although the number of these miners
is small and we adopt a zero-tolerance approach to such property

                               10
    encroachment, we have revised our strategy to reflect a changing
    context with increasing gold price.

    As part of this strategy we have intensified consultation with
    affected stakeholders, particularly traditional leaders, and
    intensified the creation of non-mining jobs to provide community
    members with alternative opportunities. Furthermore, we have
    updated our protection services strategies to better identify and
    manage the infiltration of these miners. In order to support
    Ghanas community mining program, we are ceding a portion of our
    Damang concession to the government. This is awaiting formal
    government approval.

    In conclusion, I would like to express my deep personal
    appreciation and gratitude to my co-directors, our management team
    and all Gold Fields employees around the world. They have ensured
    that the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee continues to
    meet its performance objectives, thereby contributing to the
    companys sustainability and success. Their passionate advocacy of
    social performance, ethical business and the transformation of our
    company is what underpins our success both today and into the
    future. Gold Fields shareholders have much to be proud of as part
    owners of this incredible company.

    Chairs special mention:
    For a number of years now, Gold Fields has supported Not-For-
    Profit organisations that help victims of gender-based and
    domestic violence. In 2020, the Board and Executive spoke out and
    put their names and faces to this cause. This advocacy from Gold
    Fields and these individuals promises to improve the plight of
    victims of gender-based and domestic violence wherever we are able
    to touch them with a bold and public statement that:
     - There is no place for domestic violence generally and that it
       is unacceptable in our community;
     - Everyone has the right to live free from harm and without fear
       of violence or abuse.
     - All victims need compassionate and highly responsive support;
       and
     - Help is here for those who are desperate and vulnerable.

    There are many more examples of generosity and advocacy by teams
    and individuals in the group, too many for me to mention here.
    However, this act is an insight into the way in which the
    individuals in our company align with our values and the intent to
    do the right thing. This lies at the core of our social, ethics
    and transformation mandate and the culture of Gold Fields.

              Trading statement for H1 2020

Johannesburg, 5 August 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that basic earnings per share for the six
months ended 30 June 2020 (H1 2020) are expected to be between
US17.1-18.9 per share, an increase of 90-110% (US8.1-9.9 per
share) from the basic earnings of US9.0 per share reported for the
six months ended 30 June 2019 (H1 2019).

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for H1 2020 are expected to be
US19.5-20.5 per share, 290-310% (US14.5-15.5 per share) higher
than the US5.0 per share reported for H1 2019.

Normalised earnings for H1 2020 are expected to be US35.5-38.5
per share, 137-157% (US20.5-23.5 per share) higher than the
US15.0 per share reported for H1 2019.

The increase in earnings for the period is driven largely by the increase
in the gold price received.

Attributable gold equivalent production for the six months ended 30
June 2020 increased marginally YoY to 1,087koz (H1 2019:
1,083koz), with the contribution from Gruyere (only commenced
production in July 2019) and increased production days, largely offset
by the impact of Covid-19 stoppages at South Deep and Cerro Corona
as well as the impact of the lower copper price at Cerro Corona, which
resulted in lower gold equivalent ounces.
The increase in production days relates to a decision that was taken,
during Q2 2020, to align the production months with the calendar
months, which resulted in an extra 10 production days in H1 2020.
These 10 extra production days also impacted Q2 2020. This once-off
adjustment has no impact on H2 2020.
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) for the Group for H1 2020 is US$986/oz,
compared to US$891/oz in H1 2019, an increase of 11% YoY, driven
by an increase in net operating costs (mainly driven by a move of
waste tonnes from capital to operating costs at Damang following
intersection of the main orebody), sustaining capital expenditure and
royalties (approximately US$15/oz) as well as lower by-product credits
(due to the lower copper price). Covid-19 related costs are estimated
at approximately US$20/oz for H1 2020 and are embedded in the
AISC.

All-in costs (AIC) for H1 2020 was 4% lower YoY at US$1,065/oz (H1 2019: US$1,106/oz) as project
capital was US$137m lower in H1 2020 compared to H1 2019, which more than offset the increases
relating to AISC, discussed above.

For Q2 2020 attributable group gold-equivalent production was 550koz (Q1 2020: 537koz),with AISC of
US$997/oz (Q1 2020: US$975/oz) and AIC of US$1,069/oz (Q1 2020: US$1,060/oz).

Revised cost guidance for FY 2020
FY 2020 Production guidance, as updated with the Q1 2020 operating update, remains intact at between
2.200Moz and 2.250Moz.

In light of the increase in costs in H1 2020, we are increasing our cost guidance for the year. AISC is
expected to be between US$960/oz and US$980/oz (original guidance: US$920/oz - US$940/oz) and
AIC is expected to be between US$1,070/oz and US$1,090/oz (original guidance: US$1,035/oz -
US$1,055/oz). The revised cost guidance is based on an estimated rand exchange rate of R17.00 and
A$ exchange rate of 0.70 for H2 2020. Increased royalties (due to the higher gold price) account for
US$15/oz of the cost increase, while Covid-related costs account for US$10/oz. Potential further Covid-
19 related disruptions increases the risk to Group production and cost guidance.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and reported
on, by the Companys external auditors.

Gold Fields is expected to release H1 2020 financial results on Thursday, 20 August 2020.

DISPATCH OF SUPPLEMENTARY NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Shareholders are referred to the announcement released on SENS on 25 May 2020 with
regard to the publishing and distribution to shareholders of the Company's notice
of annual general meeting (""Original AGM Notice""), and are advised that a
supplementary notice to the Original AGM Notice (""Supplementary Notice"") had been

The purpose of the Supplementary Notice is to notify Gold Fields' shareholders
that due to the continuing impact of COVID-19, Gold Fields is of the view that,
in the interests of the safety of its shareholders, staff and the public, it would
be prudent to hold its annual general meeting (""AGM"") entirely by electronic
communication and not physically and to update shareholders on the procedure to
follow so as to participate by electronic communication at the AGM. The content
of the Original Notice, including the record dates and last date of trade, will
remain in all respects valid, and save for the information relating to the holding
of the AGM purely by electronic communication as set out in the Supplementary
Notice, has not changed.

""Companies Act"") and no physical meeting will be held.

Shareholders are reminded that in terms of section 59(1) (b) of the Companies Act,
71 of 2008, the record date for the purpose of determining which shareholders are
entitled to participate in and vote at the AGM (being the date on which a
shareholder must be registered in the Companys securities register in order to
participate in and vote at the AGM) is Tuesday, 11 August 2020. Therefore the last
day to trade in order to be registered in the Companys securities register as at
the record date is Wednesday, 5 August 2020.

account of the JSE or the Company. Neither the Company nor the JSE can be held
accountable in the case of loss of network connectivity or other network failures
due to insufficient airtime or data, internet connectivity, internet bandwidth
and/or power outages, which prevents any such shareholder from participating in
and/or voting at the AGM.

-  US$1,060 per ounce of all-in costs

JOHANNESBURG. 23 April 2020: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) is pleased to provide an operational update for the quarter ended 
31 March 2020. Detailed financial and operational results are provided on a six-monthly basis i.e. at the end of June and December.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
2020 will go down in history as being a year when a global pandemic disrupted and changed the world as we know it. Over the past 
months, the effects of Covid-19 have been pervasive. In addition to the devastating effect on the health and well-being of people 
around the world, the global economic and social impacts have been severe.

During the quarter, Gold Fields recorded no fatal accident at its operations compared with one fatality for the 2019 full year. 
While the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) regressed to 3.39 in Q1, compared with the 2.19 average for 2019, this was 
the result of a higher number of less serious incidents. The number of Serious and Lost Time Injuries at 2 and 9, respectively, were 
significantly lower than the same category of injuries in Q4 2019.

Gold Fields had got off to a solid operational start in Q1 2020, with all regions tracking the annual guidance as provided on 
13 February in terms of both production and AIC. While most of our operations have continued to operate largely as normal, production 
at South Deep and Cerro Corona will likely be impacted by Covid-19 related stoppages in Q2 2020. For Q1 2020, Group attributable 
equivalent gold production was 537koz, largely flat YoY (down 9% QoQ), taking into account production is not evenly weighted between 
quarters. AIC for the Group was US$1,060/oz, marginally lower YoY (up 9% QoQ). AIC for Q1 2020 excluding expenditure on Salares Norte 
was US$1,019/oz.

The Australian region produced 237koz at AIC of A$1,390/oz (US$925/oz) and AISC of A$1,316/oz (US$876/oz). Our mines in Ghana produced 
194koz (including 45% of Asanko) at AIC of US$1,130/oz and AISC of US$1,105/oz. Cerro Corona in Peru produced 62koz (gold equivalent) 
at AIC of US$837 per gold equivalent ounce and AISC of US$714 per gold equivalent ounce. Finally, South Deep produced 61koz at AIC of 
R597,181/kg (US$1,236/oz) and AISC of R592,925/kg (US$1,227/oz). South Deep continues to perform ahead of expectations and is 
generating meaningful cashflow.

Balance sheet
Gold Fields remains in a strong financial position. During Q1 2020, there was a further decrease in the net debt balance (including 
leases) to US$1,260m at 31 March 2020 from US$1,664m at 31 December 2019. This implies a net debt to EBITDA of 0.94x, compared to 
1.29x at end December 2019. The net debt balance (excluding leases) decreased to US$957m from US$1,331m at the end of Q4 2019. 
At the end of the quarter, Gold Fields had approximately US$800m in cash on hand and in excess of US$1.5bn of committed, unutilised 
debt facilities.

Post quarter end, Gold Fields entered into two new R500m revolving credit facilities (RCF) with two South African banks. These 
facilities will mature in April 2023 and will replace the two facilities that are expiring in May 2020.

Impacts and potential impacts of Covid-19 on our operations
To date, the impact of the pandemic has been relatively muted on our operations, with production only slightly affected. However, the 
situation is fluid and there is the possibility of further lockdowns and restrictions in the countries in which we have a presence 
which may lead to production disruptions in future. The Group has put in place contingency plans in order to deal with these potential 
eventualities.

In line with the national lockdown in South Africa, our South Deep mine was placed on care and maintenance from 27 March 2020 to 
19 April 2020. Certain essential services at the mine continued and the majority of employees were sent home and have continued to 
receive their base pay during the lockdown period. While the national lockdown was extended by a further two weeks to the end of April, 
Government revised the regulations for mining during the extended lockdown, with mines allowed to operate at a maximum capacity of 50% 
of employees. As such, South Deep has commenced a staged incremental ramp up plan which includes recalling employees, making the mine 
safe and implementing Covid-19 standard operating procedures.  The initial plan will be to operate at employment levels of 
50%.  Employment levels beyond this will be subject to further South African government restrictions being lifted. Over the entire 
period of the lockdown and ramp up (should South Deep be allowed to build up to full production by end of May 2020), the lost 
production at the mine is expected to be up to 32koz (1,000kg).

Peru imposed a 15-day curfew on 16 March 2020. There have been two extensions to the curfew, which is now in place until 26 April 2020. 
Our Cerro Corona mine continued to operate largely as normal until Monday, 13 April 2020. From this point until the end of the curfew, 
the mine will be restricted to about 30% of the workforce (total workforce comprises 700 people) being on site focused on essential 
services and processing stockpiled material. Post 26 April 2020, there are likely to be restrictions on the number of people at site. 
We expect to have 50-60% of the workforce on site in May, increasing to 80% in June and a return to full capacity by end-June 2020.

At present, we estimate the impact on gold equivalent production to be approximately 25koz. In addition, rebasing the price ratio using
US$1,494/oz for gold and US$4,855/t for copper (previous guidance was based on US$1,300/oz for gold and US$5,730/t for copper),
production will be negatively impacted by approximately 30koz.

The Ghanaian government has implemented a partial lockdown, primarily in the main metropolitan areas of the country. Our Tarkwa and 
Damang mines in Ghana have continued to operate at normal levels and production has not been impacted. The partial lockdown has since 
been lifted.

While Australia is not under full lockdown, interstate travel has been halted and flights within Western Australia (WA) restricted 
to a degree. The majority of our people who live outside of WA are now temporarily based in Perth, and we have changed the 
Fly-in-Fly-out roster and de-densified flights. Our Australian mines are operating at normal levels. 

In Chile, a three-month curfew-based lockdown was imposed on 19 March 2020. Certain project activities at Salares Norte continue, 
specifically with regards to the camp expansion, which is a critical lead item to facilitate construction which is scheduled to 
commence later this year. Non-critical employees have been demobilised. 

All corporate office employees have been working from home since 27 March 2020 and will continue to do so until the lockdown period in 
South Africa is lifted.

Our response and contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic
The Covid-19 pandemic has provided a unique and unprecedented challenge in managing a global mining business. While governments in our 
operating jurisdictions have implemented varying degrees of social distancing and lockdown measures, Gold Fields has endeavoured to 
comply with all of the protocols and directives that have been imposed to contain the spread of the virus. In addition, all of our 
operating sites have developed contingency plans to deal with any incidents of Covid-19 and have set up isolation facilities should 
there be any positive cases.

Over the past month Gold Fields? operations around the globe have contributed to campaigns to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 
pandemic by funding government initiatives, continuing to support employees and suppliers, and investing in healthcare programmes in 
communities.

At the Corporate Office in Johannesburg, executives and employees have made voluntary donations to South Africa?s Solidarity Fund, 
which is supporting government programmes to fight the pandemic and other Covid-19 relief programmes. This includes donations of 
one-third of their salaries or fees for a three-month period by our CEO, CFO, Chairperson and other directors and executives.

The South Deep mine in South Africa also made a R15m contribution to the Solidarity Fund, with the mine executives and employees 
donating over R1m in their personal capacity to date. The mine has been on care and maintenance since the beginning of the lock-down 
in South Africa on March 27, which requires only about 7% of employees to be on duty for basic maintenance. The mine continued to pay 
base wages to all staff at a cost of R96m and also paid R22m to SMME contractors and service providers. It is continuing to pay the 
base wages to the 50% of the workforce that are not yet allowed back at the mine until end-April at a further cost of R60m, while 
SMMEs are receiving a further R17m during the last two weeks of April. 

Our Ghana region has contributed over US$830,000 in funding, of which US$433,000 was part of the Ghana Chamber of Mines? US$2m donation 
to the Ministry of Health to fight the pandemic. Another US$400,000 was committed to support employees and host communities around our 
Tarkwa and Damang mines with the purchase of healthcare equipment. We have also developed and sponsored community awareness programmes.

In Australia, Gold Fields committed A$250,000 (US$150,000) to the Covid-19 Community Support Initiative set up by Council for Mining 
and Energy, which is funding three organisations that are assisting rural communities: Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, 
Foodbank Australia and Lifeline WA. Among community initiatives, our St Ives mine donated A$23,500 to the Meals and Wheels programme 
in neighbouring Kambalda, to provide seniors with eight meals per month over a six-month period.

Our Peru region has contributed US$162,000 with the focus on providing medical and healthcare equipment to government and regional 
hospitals as well as NGOs operating in our host communities. This includes contributing to the purchase of 500,000 Covid-19 testing 
kits donated to the government by the National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy. Our Salares Norte project in Chile is funding 
sanitising and healthcare programmes in Diego de Almagro, the closest town to the project about 200km away.

Guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2020
Although production has been relatively uninterrupted at this stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are in full support of our host 
governments? measures and any potential future measures which might be imposed to curb the spread of the virus. Any further actions 
taken by Gold Fields going forward will be also determined by the nature and extent of incidences of infections at our mines and in 
the countries in which we operate. We believe that the Group is in a strong financial position with significantly reduced debt 
compared to prior periods and sufficient liquidity to withstand prolonged production shut downs, should they occur. Buoyant gold 
prices are expected to enhance the earnings potential of the Group.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the path that the Covid-19 virus might take going forward, together with the impact that this 
would have on production, we have only adjusted the full year guidance to take into account the production losses estimated for 
South Deep and Cerro Corona. Attributable equivalent gold production for 2020 for the Group is expected to be between 2.200Moz and 
2.250Moz (previous guidance: 2.275Moz - 2.315Moz). Cost guidance is unchanged with AISC expected to be between US$920/oz and 
US$940/oz and AIC expected to be between US$1,035/oz and US$1,055/oz. Further Covid-19 related disruptions increases the risk to 
Group guidance.

Gold production decreased by 13% to 1,885 kilograms (60,600 ounces) in the March quarter from 2,159 kilograms (69,400 ounces) in the 
December quarter due to a decrease in volume and grade. Volumes decreased as a result of 10 less production days in the March quarter 
(-11%) due to the Christmas break together with a slow production build-up post the December break.

Underground reef grade mined decreased by 10% to 5.89g/t in the March quarter from 6.54g/t in the December quarter as a result of 
increased mining in the eastern lower grade distal portion of the ore-body and reduced mining in the high grade proximal part of the 
orebody per the mine plan and schedule. 

In line with the mine plan, development decreased 20% quarter-on-quarter to 902m as a result of the re-allocation of resources to 
destress activities which increased 13% quarter-on-quarter to 9,207m2. Secondary support decreased subsequent to re-allocation of 
resources to other activities and a reduction of backlog activities on which significant emphasis was placed in 2019.

Backfill placement decreased as a result of plant maintenance stoppages, campaign milling due to Eskom?s stage 4 load curtailment and 
to a lesser extent to the reduction of fillable stopes.

All-in costs increased by 35% to R597,181/kg (US$1,236/oz) in the March quarter from R443,563/kg (US$932/oz) in the December quarter. 
The cost increases were driven by lower gold sold, some preparation costs on infrastructure for starting up of non-sustaining capital 
expenditure in the new mine development and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Gold production increased by 5% to 127,100 ounces in the March quarter from 120,900 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to higher 
yield. Yield increased 4% to 1.14g/t in the March quarter from 1.10g/t in the December quarter, driven by a 7% increase in grade mined 
to 1.29g/t in the March quarter in line with the mining sequence.

Total tonnes mined, including capital waste stripping, increased by 7% to 21.4 million tonnes in the March quarter from 20.1 million 
tonnes in the December quarter. 

All-in costs increased by 1% to US$994/oz in the March quarter from US$989/oz in the December quarter due to higher cost of sales 
before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by higher gold sold. The increase in cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation was mainly due to the increase in operational waste tonnes mined in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 5% to US$28.7m in the March quarter from US$30.1m in the December quarter mainly due to timing of 
infrastructure projects.

Gold production decreased by 21% to 36,900 ounces in the March quarter from 46,900 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to lower 
yield. Yield decreased by 20% to 1.00g/t in the March quarter from 1.25g/t in the December quarter due to lower grades mined together 
with higher levels of lower grade stockpile being fed to supplement ore tonnes mined. The lower gold production was, however, in line 
with the plan for the quarter. As previously guided, the March quarter was again impacted by the transition through the Huni sandstone 
lithology, which is associated with higher than usual grade variability. The transition through the Huni sandstones will continue 
during Q2 2020 and be completed by mid-year, when mining will occur in the higher (and more consistent) grade Tarkwa phyllites. Mine 
grade for H2 2020 is therefore expected to improve to approximately 1.80g/t. Damang is on track to deliver the 2020 production 
guidance. 

Capital waste tonnes, included in total waste tonnes, decreased by 99% to 0.01 million tonnes in the March quarter from 1.5 million 
tonnes in the December quarter. This decrease in capital waste tonnes was due to the completion of capital waste mining at the Damang 
Complex ahead of plan.

All-in costs increased by 37% to US$1,804/oz in the March quarter from US$1,313/oz in the December quarter mainly due to lower gold 
sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower capital expenditure. Cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation increased by 19% to US$57 million in the March quarter from US$48 million in the December quarter mainly 
underpinned by a higher GIP cost of US$11 million in the March quarter compared with US$3 million in the December quarter. AIl-in costs 
are in line with the 2020 plan and are expected to decrease significantly in H2 2020 when mining will occur in the higher grade ore 
body at the Damang pit.

Capital expenditure decreased by 45% to US$4.2 million in the March quarter from US$7.6 million in the December quarter due to lower 
capital waste tonnes mined as the strip ratio continues to reduce at depth.

All figures in table on a 100 per cent basis

Gold production increased marginally to 66,300 ounces (100% basis) in the March quarter from 66,100 ounces (100% basis) in the 
December quarter mainly due to higher yield. Yield increased by 4% to 1.47g/t in the March quarter from 1.41g/t in the December quarter 
driven by higher grade ore fed during the quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 41% to 9.0 million tonnes, in the March quarter, due to improved contractor equipment performance at 
both the Nkran and Esaase pits. Ore tonnes mined increased 36% to 1.9 million tonnes coming mainly from the Nkran and Esaase pits. 
Waste tonnes mined increased by 42% to 7.1 million tonnes mainly because of the accelerated stripping of the Esaase pit to expose ore 
earlier due to the wall failure at the Nkran pit.

All-in cost decreased by 19% to US$881/oz in the March quarter from US$1,094/oz in the December quarter underpinned by a 3% increase in 
gold sold, lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower capital expenditure. The lower cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation was due to a credit from GIP because of the higher ore tonnes mined. Total capital expenditure decreased 
by 48% mainly due to expenditure on the LOM Study, Esaase haul road upgrade and pit establishment as well as Akwasiso pit preparation 
capital that was incurred in the December 2019 quarter but not repeated in the March 2020 quarter.

Gold production decreased by 9% to 36,900 ounces in the March quarter from 40,400 ounces in the December quarter due to lower grades 
processed and a reduction in ore tonnes milled. Copper production decreased by 10% to 6,905 tonnes from 7,708 tonnes due to lower 
grades processed and lower tonnes milled. Equivalent gold production decreased by 12% to 62,300 ounces in the March quarter from 
70,800 ounces in the December quarter underpinned by the lower gold and copper production in line with the mining sequence and lower 
price factor. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 15% to 6.0 million tonnes in the March quarter from 5.2 million tonnes in the December quarter in line 
with strategy and the mine sequence of stockpiling the low grade ore, which will be treated at the end of the life of the mine. There 
has been an increase of low grade ore stocks of 1.2 million tonnes to 6.1 million tonnes in the March quarter from 4.9 million tonnes 
at the end of the December quarter. Total low grade ore stockpiled has an average gold grade of 0.66 grams per tonne and an average 
copper grade of 0.32 per cent. Gold and copper mined grades are lower in the March quarter than the December quarter, in line with the 
mine sequence.

Gold yield decreased by 7% to 0.71g/t in the March quarter from 0.76g/t in the December quarter due to a 7% decrease in gold head grade 
processed to 1.06g/t in the March quarter from 1.14g/t in the December quarter.

All-in cost per gold ounce increased by 3% to US$647/oz in the March quarter from US$628/oz in the December quarter mainly due to lower 
by-product credits driven by lower copper sales and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure. All-in cost per 
equivalent ounce decreased by 11% to US$837 per equivalent ounce in the March quarter from US$940 per equivalent ounce in the December 
quarter driven by lower capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure decreased by 52% to US$11.6 million in the March quarter from US$24.2 million in the December quarter due to a 
decrease in construction activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the rainy season.

Gold production decreased by 14% to 93,100 ounces in the March quarter from 107,800 ounces in the December quarter. The ounce reduction 
was the result of lower grade ore delivery from open pit mines and some draw-down of lower grade surface stockpiles. The December 
quarter also included the release of approximately 4,000 ounces left within the circuit at the end of the September quarter.

Ore tonnes mined at the open pits decreased by 31% to 633,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 919,000 tonnes in the December quarter. 
The decrease was due to the final 287,000 tonnes of ore being extracted from the Invincible open cut stage 6 during the December 
quarter with the pit now closed. Open pit mining is now sourced from the Neptune pit only.

Surface mined grade decreased by 23% to 1.63g/t in the March quarter from 2.13g/t in the December quarter, following the conclusion of 
mining activities at the high grade Neptune stage 2 pit early in the March quarter that was mined slightly ahead of schedule late in 
December 2019 and early January 2020.

The Invincible Underground Mine and Hamlet North underground ramp up has progressed according to schedule as St Ives transitions to 
predominantly high grade underground ore feed. 

All-in cost increased by 14% to A$1,364/oz (US$907/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,197/oz (US$817/oz) in the December quarter due to 
decreased gold sold and the costs of stockpiles drawn down, partially offset by reduced capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure decreased by 23% to A$27 million (US$18 million) in the March quarter from A$35 million (US$24 million) in the 
December quarter with the completion of underground infrastructure and the associated spend at Hamlet North mine during the December

Gold production decreased by 15% to 47,400 ounces in the March quarter from 55,700 ounces in the December quarter due to a decrease 
in grade of ore mined and processed, as well as a decrease in tonnes processed. 

Mined grade decreased by 16% to 4.77g/t in the March quarter from 5.69g/t in the December quarter. There was increased ore development 
at Waroonga during Q1 which in part contributed to the lower grade in the quarter. The focus for the first half of 2020 is to develop 
into the Waroonga North Lower, Kath and Sheba areas. This emphasis on developing into these new areas has seen a 58% increase in waste 
material moved in the March quarter from the December quarter. The mined grade is expected to improve in the June quarter as the 
delivery of ore from Waroonga North Lower and Kath areas increases as per the mine plan.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5% to 322,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 338,000 tonnes in the December quarter due to a planned 
maintenance shutdown performed at the processing plant.

All-in cost increased by 18% to A$1,637/oz (US$1,090/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,385/oz (US$943/oz) in the December quarter due 
to decreased gold sold and increased capital expenditure, partially offset by decreased cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation.

Capital expenditure increased by 78% to A$16 million (US$11 million) in the March quarter from A$9 million (US$6 million) in the 
December quarter due to increased capital development in the Sheba and Kath areas, as well as increased exploration drilling in the 
March quarter.

Gold production decreased by 6% to 66,600 ounces in the March quarter from 71,100 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to a 
decrease in ore processed. 

Ore mined decreased by 4% to 418,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 437,000 tonnes in the December quarter and waste mined decreased 
by 22% to 123,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 158,000 tonnes in the December quarter. The decrease in mining activity was due to 
focus on ore drive development in the Z100 area early in the March quarter and increased infrastructure, ground support and project 
development activities in Z110 & Z120 levels, in preparation for production later in the year.   

Ore processed decreased by 9% to 429,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 471,000 tonnes in the December quarter. During the December 
quarter 34,000 tonnes of ore were also processed from existing stockpiles (March quarter - nil).

All-in cost decreased by 5% to A$1,338/oz (US$890/oz) in the March quarter from A$1,411/oz (US$966/oz) in the December quarter due to 
lower capital expenditure, partially offset by a reduction in gold sold.

Capital expenditure decreased by 38% to A$20 million (US$13 million) in the March quarter from A$32 million (US$22 million) in the 
December quarter following the close-out of underground infrastructure projects and conclusion of mobile equipment purchases in the 
December quarter.

Mine physicals in table on a 100 per cent basis

Gold production decreased by 15% to 59,600 ounces in the March quarter from 70,000 ounces in the December quarter due to a decrease in 
yield and a decrease in tonnes processed.

Ore tonnes mined reduced 16% in the March quarter to 1,837,000 tonnes from 2,190,000 tonnes in the December quarter as the mine 
transitions into fresh rock ore. Production drill rig availability was an issue early in the quarter but was subsequently resolved.

Ore grade mined increased 15% to 1.06g/t in the March quarter from 0.92g/t in the December quarter. The grade result is a function of 
mining location in the pit as grade gradually improves when mining from south through to north. There was also less low grade ore 
defined.

Yield decreased by 9% to 0.96g/t in the March quarter from 1.06g/t in the December quarter. Gruyere had built up stockpiles of higher 
grade material during the first nine months of 2019 while construction of the processing facility was being completed and during the 
early stages of commissioning.  This higher grade material was preferentially treated and  contributed to an uplift in the yield during 
the December quarter with the same material not available in the March quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 6% to 1,926,000 tonnes in the March quarter from 2,051,000 tonnes in the December quarter due to an 
extended planned shutdown in the March quarter to replace mill liners,  conduct necessary works to enhance the durability of high wear 
areas in the crushing and grinding circuits and conduct reliability improvements at the processing plant.

All-in cost increased by 21% to A$1,188/oz (US$791/oz) in the March quarter from A$983/oz (US$684/oz) in the December quarter due to 
decreased gold sold and planned shutdown costs, partially offset by decreased capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure (on a 50% basis) decreased by 50% to A$4 million (US$3 million) in the March quarter from A$8 million 
(US$5 million) in the December quarter following the close-out of mining and processing infrastructure projects in the December 
quarter and due to a move from mining capital waste to operating waste.

   Historically Disadvantaged Persons in management positions;

   as the failure of such systems;
-  the ability to obtain, renew and comply with, water use licences and water quality discharge standards;

-  the adequacy of the Group?s insurance coverage;
-  financial flexibility could be limited by South African exchange control regulations;

-  difficulty with participating in future issues of securities, or in bringing an action against Gold Fields, for shareholders 
   outside South Africa;

COVID-19 update

The IAR also provides an update by CEO Nick Holland on the impact of
the Covid-19 pandemic on Gold Fields and its operations, detailing
the actions taken by the Company to date, both in response to
government directives and on its own accord. This include putting
the South Deep mine in South Africa on care and maintenance for the
current three-week lockdown period in South Africa from 27 March
2020 to 16 April 2020.

Apart from South Deep, the rest of the Group production has been
largely uninterrupted. However, increasingly stricter regulations
are being put in place by governments around the world. As a result,
we caution that our production and cost guidance for the 2020
financial year provided in February 2020 has an elevated level of
risk.

On the position of the Company going forward, Holland says: We have
evaluated the potential effects of a three-month operational closure
period across the Group (period used is based on periods of lockdown
experienced China and South Korea). Over this period there could
potentially be no production and approximately 50% savings on cost
and capital. Gold Fields is of the view that it will be a stable,
going concern for the foreseeable future. However, this estimate is
inherently uncertain as it is based on expectations of future
events, including the length of the closure period, which is
currently unknown.

The CEO report is on pages 30-34 of the IAR.

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Supplement 2019

The Gold Fields Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Supplement
2019 contains a comprehensive overview of Gold Fields Mineral
Resource and Mineral Reserve status as well as a detailed breakdown
for its operations and projects.

As at 31 December 2019, Gold Fields had attributable gold-equivalent
Mineral Reserves of 51Moz (2018: 50Moz) and gold-equivalent Mineral
Resources of 116Moz (2018: 108Moz). The contribution to Group gold-
eq Reserves from operation outside of South Africa increased to
22Moz in 2019 (2018: 20Moz), representing 42% of the Groups Reserve
base. As recently as 2015 only 28% of Reserves were not from South
Deep, our only South African operation.

The Groups attributable copper Mineral Reserves totalled 616
million pounds in 2019 (2018: 691 million pounds) and copper Mineral
Resources 882 million pounds (2018: 844 million pounds). The copper
Resources and Reserves exclude Far Southeast. Attributable silver
Reserves were 39Moz and silver Resources 44Moz, both unchanged from
2018. Stated figures are net of annual production depletion.

The SAMREC Code (2016 edition) compliant Mineral Reserves are based
on gold, copper and silver prices of US$1,200/oz (A$1,600/oz,
R550,000/kg), US$2.60/lb for 2020 and US$2.80/lb from 2021 owards
and US$17.50/oz respectively. Relevant modifying factors, tonnes,
grades, classification, reconciliations and Competent Persons are
detailed in the Supplement.

MEDIA RELEASE


GOLD FIELDS OPERATIONS  UPDATE ON COVID-19 IMPACT


Johannesburg, 24 March 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) fully supports the measures and policies to curb the
Covid-19 pandemic implemented by the countries in which we operate.

The world finds itself facing an unprecedented situation - the
Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments across the globe to take
decisive actions to safeguard the lives of their people. Gold Fields
is fully committed to first and foremost protecting the health and
safety of our people and communities, and supports all governments
efforts to contain the spread of the virus, says Gold Fields CEO
Nick Holland.

In particular, we note yesterdays announcement by South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa of a 21-day lockdown commencing this
Friday. It is a painful, but necessary and bold decision and one
that we support to the fullest, he adds.

The nature and extent of incidences of infections at our global
operations will determine the companys action with regards to
continued operations at the mine sites.

The following provides an update on the situation in each Region and
the additional measures we have now put in place:

-   Our South Deep mine in South Africa will be safely put on
    care and maintenance as from 27 March 2020. South Deep is seeking
    permission from the regulator for the following activities to
    continue: pumping, security, essential plant maintenance,
    managerial oversight and medical services. Employees who will be
    providing these essential services will be accommodated in our
    residences. The majority of employees will be sent home as from
    Thursday and will continue to receive their base pay during the
    21-day lock-down period. Where possible, select employees will
    work from home. Based on the current run-rate, the 21-day
    lockdown is expected to result in 16koz (500kg) of lost
    production at South Deep.
-   Peru imposed a 15-day curfew on 16 March 2020. Our Cerro
    Corona mine is still continuing operations as the workforce stays
    in a self-contained camp on-site. We have just over 700 employees
    currently at Cerro Corona. Once the curfew period has ended we
    will reassess our ability to safely continue operations depending
    on the governments next actions.
-   Our Tarkwa and Damang mines in Ghana continue operating and
    production has to date not been impacted.
-   While there are restrictions on interstate travel in
    Australia, this currently does not apply to our Fly-In Fly-Out
    employees who continue to travel to and from our mines in Western
    Australia. Production has also not been impacted to date.
-   In Chile, a three-month curfew-based lockdown was imposed on
    19 March 2020. Project activities at Salares Norte continue, with
    construction only scheduled to begin later this year. Non-
    critical employees have been demobilized.
-   All corporate office employees will be working from home from
    27 March 2020 until the lockdown period in South Africa is
    lifted.

The company is in a strong financial position with significantly
reduced debt at the end of December 2019. At the time of this
release Gold Fields had approximately US$600m in cash and in excess
of US$1.5bn of committed, unutilised debt facilities. We have
sufficient liquidity to withstand an interruption to our operations
for a considerable period of time, but will work towards minimising
the impact of Covid-19 on our operations, Holland says

We will review the situation at regular intervals to decide on
further actions if required and will keep the market updated
accordingly.

RESULTS OF SHARE PLACING

Johannesburg, 13 February 2020: Gold Fields (Tickers JSE: GFI and NYSE:
GFI) is pleased to announce the successful completion of the placing
announced yesterday on SENS (the ""Placing"").

A total of 41,431,635 new ordinary, no par value shares in the authorised
but unissued share capital of Gold Fields have been placed with existing
and new institutional investors (the ""Placing Shares"") at a price of ZAR
90.20 per share (the ""Placing Price""). Gross proceeds of approximately
ZAR3.7 billion / US$252 million were raised through the Placing. The net
proceeds from the Placing will be used to continue predevelopment work
and commence construction of the Salares Norte project, an exciting
project in an established mining jurisdiction with an initial 11.5 year
life of mine and an average annual production of 450koz of gold
equivalent (over the first seven years) at an all-in sustaining cost of
US$552/oz (over the life of mine).


J.P. Morgan Securities plc acted as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint
Bookrunner and BMO Capital Markets Limited (together with J.P. Morgan
plc, the ""Managers"") acted as Joint Bookrunner in respect of the Placing.

The Placing Shares being issued represent, in aggregate, approximately
5 per cent of the Company's issued ordinary share capital prior to the
Placing. The Placing Price represents a discount of 3.8 per cent to the
30 day VWAP prior to 12 February 2020, which is in compliance with
Section 5.52 of the JSE Listings Requirements. The Placing Shares, when
issued, will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Gold
Fields ordinary shares in issue, including the right to receive all
dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date
of issue thereof.

An application will be made to the JSE Limited (""JSE"") for the listing
of the Placing Shares. Subject to approval by the JSE, listing and
trading (""Admission"") of the Placing Shares are expected to occur on the
JSE on or around 18 February 2020 (or such later date as may be agreed
between the Company and the Sole Global Coordinator) and dealings in the
Placing Shares are expected to commence at the same time. The Placing
is conditional upon, amongst other things, Admission of the Placing
Shares on the JSE becoming effective and the placing agreement between
the   Company   and   the   Managers  (""Placing   Agreement"")    becoming
unconditional and not being terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to Admission.

Placing Shares purchased by persons outside the United States may not
be offered, sold, resold, delivered or otherwise distributed in or into
the United States or to any U.S. person (as defined by Regulation S under
the Securities Act) or deposited into the Company's ADS program for a
period of 40 days after the settlement of the Placing and the Company's
ADSs may not be used in any hedging transaction that includes the Placing
Shares.   Further, the Placing Shares may not be deposited into the
Company's ADS program for so long as they are restricted securities
(within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act) and therefore
are not tradeable on the New York Stock Exchange.        Please read the
important notice at the end of this announcement for further details in
relation to these restrictions.

Following Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise
870,064,342 ordinary no par value shares. This figure may be used by
shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by
which they will determine if they are required to notify their beneficial
interest in, or a change to their beneficial interest in, the Company's
ordinary shares under section 122 of the South African Companies Act of
2008.

Pursuant to the terms of the Placing Agreement, Gold Fields has agreed,
subject to certain exclusions, to a lock-up arrangement in respect of
Gold Fields's equity securities for a period of 90 days from 13 February
2020.

PROPOSED PLACING OF NEW ORDINARY SHARES

Johannesburg, 12 February 2020: Gold Fields announces its intention to
conduct a non pre-emptive cash placing through the issue of up to
41,431,635 new ordinary no par value shares in the authorized but
unissued share capital of the Company (the ""Placing Shares"") to
certain institutional investors (the Placing).

The Placing Shares represent approximately 5 per cent of the Companys
existing issued ordinary shares and is the maximum number of shares
that may be issued by the Company under and in accordance with its
existing general authority to issue shares for cash, as described in
the JSE Listings Requirements, granted by shareholders at the 2019
annual general meeting of the Company held on 21 May 2019.

It is expected that the gross proceeds from the Placing will amount to
approximately ZAR4.0bn / US$269m, based on the closing share price of
ZAR96.39/share as at 11 February 2020.

The Placing is being conducted through an accelerated bookbuild
process (the Bookbuild), which will be launched immediately
following   this  announcement   (the  Announcement).   J.P.  Morgan
Securities plc will act as Sole Global Coordinator and Joint
Bookrunner and BMO Capital Markets Limited (together with J. P. Morgan
Securities plc, the Managers) will act as Joint Bookrunner in
respect of the Placing.


Transaction background and use of proceeds

In line with the Companys strategy of reinvesting for the future,
Gold Fields has decided to begin initial construction of its Salares
Norte project (the Project). Salares Norte is an exciting project in
an established mining jurisdiction with an initial 11.5 year life of
mine and an average annual production of 450koz of gold equivalent
(over the first seven years) at an all-in sustaining cost of US$552/oz
(over the life of mine). The Project is expected to generate an
internal rate of return (IRR) of 23% at a US$1,300/oz gold price and
US$17.50/oz silver price with a 2.3 year payback period and a capital
cost estimate of US$860m.

In order to progress with the construction of the Project, the board
of directors of Gold Fields (the Board) has been formulating its
funding strategy. Following a review of the alternatives available to
the Company and consistent with the Companys prudence regarding its
debt position, the Board believes that a combination of the proceeds
of the Placing, operational cash flow and existing debt facilities
will allow the Company to fully fund the construction of Salares
Norte, and allow Gold Fields to maintain a 100 per cent interest in
this world-class project and exploration district. The net proceeds
from the Placing will be used to continue predevelopment work and
commence full construction of the Project in Q42020, with first gold
expected in Q12023.

Structure of the Placing

The Placing will be made outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S (Regulation S) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act) to persons who are not U.S. persons
(as defined in Regulation S), and within the United States only to
persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers
within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. No American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing
ordinary shares of the Company are being offered in the Placing.

The Placing Shares purchased by persons outside the United States may
not be offered, sold, resold, delivered or otherwise distributed in or
into the United States or to any U.S. person (as defined by Regulation
S under the Securities Act) or deposited into the Companys ADS
program for a period of 40 days after the settlement of the Placing
and the Companys ADSs may not be used in any hedging transaction that
includes the Placing Shares.   Further, the Placing Shares may not be
deposited into the Companys ADS program for so long as they are
restricted securities (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act) and therefore are not tradeable on the New York Stock
Exchange.    Please read the important notice at the end of this
announcement for further details in relation to these restrictions.

In South Africa, the Placing will be made only by way of separate
private placements to: (i) selected persons falling within one of the
specified categories listed in section 96(1)(a) of the South African
Companies Act, 2008 (the ""South African Companies Act""); and (ii)
selected persons, acting as principal, acquiring Placing Shares for a
total acquisition cost of R1,000,000 or more, as contemplated in
section 96(1)(b) of the South African Companies Act (""South African
Qualifying Investors"").
The price per ordinary share at which the Placing Shares will be
placed (the ""Placing Price"") will be decided at the close of the
Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild, the Placing
Price and allocations are at the discretion of the Company and the
Managers. The Placing Price will be announced as soon as practicable
on the Stock Exchange News Service of the exchange operated by the JSE
Limited (""JSE"") after the close of the Bookbuild.

The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari
passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of no par
value in the issued share capital of the Company, including the right
to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or
paid after the date of issue of the Placing Shares.

Subject to the approval by the JSE, listing and trading of the Placing
Shares on the JSE is expected to commence at 9a.m. on Tuesday, 18
February 2020 (or such other time and/or date as may be agreed between
the Company and the Sole Global Coordinator). Investors will receive
Placing Shares which are listed and traded on the JSE in ZAR.

Pursuant to the terms of the placing agreement entered with the
Managers, Gold Fields has agreed, subject to certain exclusions, to a
lock-up arrangement in respect of Gold Fields equity securities for a
period of 90 days from 13 February 2020.

Information to Distributors

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements
contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial
instruments, as amended (MiFID II); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of
Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II;
and (c) local implementing measures (together, the MiFID II Product
Governance Requirements), and disclaiming all and any liability,
whether   arising  in   tort,   contract   or   otherwise,   which   any
manufacturer (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance
Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Placing
Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has
determined that such securities are: (i) compatible with an end target
market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of
professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in
MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution
channels   as  are  permitted   by   MiFID   II  (the   Target   Market
Assessment).
Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note
that: the price of the Placing Shares may decline and investors could
lose all or part of their investment; the Placing Shares offer no
guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the
Placing Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a
guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in
conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and
who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may
result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to
the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling
restrictions in relation to the Placing.     Furthermore, it is noted
that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, the Managers will
only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients
and eligible counterparties.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not
constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for
the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or
group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action
whatsoever with respect to the Placing Shares.
Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Placing Shares          and determining
appropriate distribution channels.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THE FOREGOING, NO PUBLIC OFFERING OF THE
PLACING SHARES IS BEING MADE BY ANY PERSON ANYWHERE AND THE COMPANY
HAS NOT AUTHORISED OR CONSENTED TO ANY SUCH OFFERING IN RELATION TO
THE PLACING SHARES.

Johannesburg, 6 February 2020: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that headline earnings per share for the
12 months ended 31 December 2019 (FY 2019) are expected to
range from US$0.19-0.21 per share, 171-200% (US$0.12-0.14 per
share) higher than the headline earnings of US$0.07 per share
reported for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018 (FY 2018).

Basic earnings per share for FY 2019 are expected to range from
US$0.19-0.21 per share, 145-150% (US$0.61-0.63 per share) higher

share) higher than the normalised earnings of US$0.03 per share
reported for FY 2018.

The increase in basic and headline earnings is driven by higher

be 590koz (Q3 2019: 523koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) -
original interpretation - of US$922/oz (Q3 2019: US$1,018/oz) and
US$864/oz (Q3 2019: US$947/oz) on the revised interpretation. All-
in costs (AIC) for the quarter are expected to be US$974/oz (Q3
2019: US$1,084/oz).

Attributable gold equivalent production for 2019 is expected to be
2,195koz, 8% higher than 2018 (FY18: 2,036koz), exceeding the
upper end of the guidance range of 2,130-2,180koz. Production once
again exceeded the annual guidance provided at the start of the
year.

AIC for 2019 are expected to be US$1,064/oz, 9% lower than 2018
(FY18: US$1,173/oz) and below guidance for 2019 of US$1,075/oz
to US$1,095/oz. AISC on the original WGC interpretation are
expected to be US$970/oz (FY18: US$981/oz) and US$897/oz on
the revised interpretation. AISC guidance (original interpretation) for 2019 was between US$980/oz
and US$995/oz.


Notable cash generation and net debt reduction for 2019
Net cash flow is expected to be US$249m for FY 2019, after growth expenditure of US$193m,
comprising US$71m on Damang, US$67m for Gruyere and US$55m on Salares Norte. Mine cash flow
for the year, which excludes growth expenditure, is expected to be US$552m.

The net debt (pre-IFRS 16) at 31 December 2019 is expected to decrease to US$1,331m. This implies
a net debt to EBITDA of 1.08x. When adjusting for IFRS 16, the net debt balance at the end of FY
2019 is expected to be US$1,664m, with a net debt to EBITDA of 1.29x.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and reported
on, by the Company's external auditors.

Gold Fields expect to release FY 2019 financial results on Thursday, 13 February 2020.

SALARES NORTE RECEIVES ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVAL

Santiago de Chile, 18 December 2019: Gold Fields Limited (Gold
Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce that the Atacama
Environmental Assessment Commission today approved the
environmental impact study for its Salares Norte project in Chile.

The environmental approval for the project is a crucial step for Gold
Fields as it evaluates a construction decision. ""The company will now
formulate a funding plan, update the feasibility study completed earlier
this year and proceed to a construction decision during H1 2020,"" says
Nick Holland, CEO of Gold Fields.

The potential mine would present a boost for the regional economy
with respect to job creation, procurement of goods and services as
well as payments of taxes and royalties. It is estimated that about
2,700 jobs would be created during construction of the mine, which -
if given the go-ahead by Gold Fields - would be completed by end-
2022. About 900 workers would be employed once the mine is
operational.

Operational parameters for Salares Norte
The Salares Norte project is located in the Diego de Almagro
municipality in the Atacama Region in northern Chile, at between
3,900m and 4,700m above sea level.

Key findings of the feasibility study, announced in February 2019,
were:
   * Capital cost of US$834m for construction
   * A maiden Mineral Reserve of 3.5Moz of gold and 39Moz of
       silver was declared in December 2018. The gold-equivalent
       Mineral Reserve is 4.0Moz.
   * Initial 12-year life-of-mine
   * Annual throughput of 2Mt of ore
   * Life-of-mine production of 3.7Moz gold-equivalent
   * Average annual production of 450koz gold equivalent for the first seven years at AISC of
          US$465/oz

Statement by Nick Holland
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

Q3 2019 performance
Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 2% lower YoY (3% lower QoQ) at 523koz. Production for the quarter was
impacted by an unusually high lock up of gold in circuit at two of the Australian operations; lower grade at Damang as the mine
transitions into the main pit; as well as lower grades mined and the lower price factor at Cerro Corona. South Deep delivered another
improved quarter, with production increasing 6% QoQ.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC), on the original interpretation, were 4% higher YoY (3% higher QoQ) at US$1,018/oz, AISC, on the revised
interpretation for Q3 2019 was US$947/oz, 4% higher QoQ. All-in costs (AIC) were 5% lower YoY (4% lower QoQ) at US$1,084/oz.

The net debt balance (pre-IFRS16) decreased by US$97m to US$1,401m from US$1,498m at 30 June 2019. Apart from the cash generated by the
operations, there were a number of components that impacted the net debt during the quarter including: US$92m inflow from the sale of
the Gold Road and Hummingbird stakes; US$34m outflow for the interim dividend; US$10m paid to Asanko as part of the deferred purchase
consideration.

Regional operational performance
The Australian region produced 210koz for the quarter, down 6% YoY (up 2% QoQ), with Gruyere contributing for the first time.
Production for the quarter was impacted by a build-up of gold in circuit at the end of the quarter at both St Ives and Gruyere,
amounting to approximately 7koz in total which was recovered shortly after quarter-end. AIC for the region was A$1,538/oz
(US$1,054/oz), up 16% YoY (down 14% QoQ) as the project capex at Gruyere comes to an end.

Production in Ghana for Q3 2019 was 205koz, up 5% YoY (down 5% QoQ), with AIC of US$1,067/oz, largely flat YoY (up 3% QoQ). As the
reinvestment project at Damang progresses, the mine is currently transitioning through the anticipated lower (more variable) grade
Huni sandstone lithology, which impacted production in the quarter.

Gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona was down 22% YoY (down 19% QoQ) at 65koz, due to lower grades mined (as per mining sequence)
and the lower price factor. Consequently, AIC for the quarter was US$929 per equivalent ounce, up 34% YoY (up 29% QoQ).

Production at South Deep increased again in Q3 2019 to 1,897kg (61koz), up 23% YoY (up 6% QoQ). Encouragingly, AIC for the quarter
decreased to R588,855/kg (US$1,258/oz), which enabled the mine to be cash positive for Q3 2019, being the second consecutive quarter.
There was continued QoQ improvement in a number of enabling activities at the mine including, destress mining, long hole stoping and
placement of backfill. South Deep is expected to exceed its production guidance for the year by between 5% and 10%. The AIC guidance is
expected to be achieved.

Update on projects
Gruyere
Gruyere produced 29koz (100% basis) during Q3 2019. Encouragingly, commercial levels of production (defined as a minimum total process
plant throughput rate of 70% of nameplate capacity, and a minimum average gold recovery of 85% of expected life of mine metallurgical
recovery) were achieved at Gruyere at the end of the September quarter, slightly ahead of schedule. Given the fact that throughput
rates and gold recoveries have been above expectations during the ramp up, gold production for 2019 is expected to be at the upper end
of guidance of 75koz - 100koz (100% basis). The final forecast capital cost is now estimated at A$607m (100% basis, +/- 1%).

Damang
Production at Damang decreased 9% QoQ to 49.7koz from 54.6koz in the June quarter, driven predominantly by lower yield. Ore tonnes
mined decreased by 25% QoQ due to completion of mining of the Amoanda pit ahead of plan together with a higher proportion of mining at
the west end of the Damang pit complex which has a higher strip ratio. At the end of the September quarter, 33 months into the Damang
Reinvestment Project, total material mined amounted to 111Mt (17% ahead of the project schedule) while gold produced was 486koz
(21% above plan of 401koz). Project capital spent to date is US$339m compared to plan of US$300m, largely driven by the additional
capital waste tonnes mined.

Salares Norte
The EIA process is progressing well and we expect it to be granted before the middle of 2020. We continue to work on a financing plan
and have commenced a process to evaluate the possibility of bringing in a partner for the project. Detailed engineering continues and
was 47% complete at the end of Q3 2019.

Guidance unchanged
Gold Fields expects to end 2019 on a strong footing and we expect to achieve previous production and all-in cost guidance for the year.
This provides us with a solid base to grow production and reduce all-in costs into 2020, enabling the group to generate strong free
cash flow.

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2019 is now expected to be at the upper end of the previously announced range
of 2.13Moz to 2.18Moz. AISC is expected to be between US$980/oz and US$995/oz based on the original WGC interpretation. AIC is planned
to be between US$1,075/oz and US$1,095/oz. These expectations assume exchange rates of R/US$:14.50 and A$/US$:0.69.

Hedging
As reported in August 2019, Gold Fields entered into select tactical hedges for 2020 during H1 2019. The hedges were entered into in
order to underwrite real net debt reduction of US$300-400m by the end of 2020. We do not plan to undertake any other hedging activity
for 2020 or beyond. However, in line with our hedging policy, we could look at hedging production at Salares Norte (not the rest of the
Group) in order to underwrite the payback for the project.

Gold production increased by 6 per cent from 1,782 kilograms (57,306 ounces) in the June quarter to 1,897 kilograms (60,990 ounces)
in the September quarter in line with the 2019 ramp up plan post the restructuring process concluded at the end of 2018.

Total underground tonnes mined increased by 26 per cent from 270,100 tonnes in the June quarter to 339,400 tonnes in the September
quarter. Ore tonnes mined increased by 29 per cent from 253,700 tonnes to 328,300 tonnes, while underground waste mined decreased by
32 per cent from 16,400 tonnes to 11,100 tonnes. Underground reef grade mined decreased by 9 per cent from 6.29 grams per tonne to
5.70 grams per tonne. Total gold mined from underground increased by 17 per cent from 1,596 kilograms (51,300 ounces) in the
June quarter to 1,872 kilograms (60,200 ounces) in the September quarter.

Total tonnes milled increased by 100 per cent from 281,500 tonnes in the June quarter to 562,700 tonnes in the September quarter.
Underground reef tonnes milled increased by 19 per cent from 269,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 321,100 tonnes in the
September quarter mainly due to increased stoping volume as a result of improved stope availability. In the September quarter
18 stopes were mined compared with 12 stopes in the June quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by 12 per cent from 6.60 grams per
tonne to 5.78 grams per tonne due to mining in lower grade areas.

Surface tailings material treated increased substantially from 1,400 tonnes in the June quarter to 234,300 tonnes in the September
quarter mainly due to increased backfill placement capability, enabled by the new CIL circuit being commissioned. In the June quarter
re-mining tonnes were not processed for gold recovery but instead were pumped directly underground for backfill (not declared as
surface treatment). Post commissioning of the new CIL circuit (which allows for the separating out of underground treatment and
surface treatment) re-mining tonnes were again treated for gold recovery prior to being pumped underground for backfill.

Gold recovered from underground amounted to 1,857 kilograms (59,703 ounces). In addition, 40 kilograms (1,286 ounces) were recovered
from the treatment of surface material. Surface yield decreased by 96 per cent from 3.97 grams per tonne to 0.17 grams per tonne due
to treating 1,400 tonnes of industrial waste material in the June quarter compared with 234,000 tonnes treated in the September quarter
comprising of 4,000 tonnes industrial waste and 230,000 tonnes tailings reclamation.

Destress mining increased by 31 per cent from 6,310 square metres in the June quarter to 8,291 square metres in the September quarter.
The increase is due to improved operational efficiency as a result of the mine business improvement programs and the reallocation of
resources to destress mining as new destress cuts became available.

Longhole stoping increased by 46 per cent from 137,500 tonnes to 200,400 tonnes. Development decreased by 10 per cent from
1,133 metres in the June quarter to 1,015 metres in the September quarter. Development in the current mine areas increased by 7 per
cent from 261 metres in the June quarter to 280 metres in the September quarter. Development North of Wrench decreased by 16 per cent
from 872 metres in the June quarter to 735 metres in the September quarter due to resources allocated to destress mining and due to
development being significantly ahead of requirement.

The current mine contributed 38 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the September quarter compared with 45 per cent of the total ore
tonnes in the June quarter. The North of Wrench contributed 62 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the September quarter compared with
55 per cent in the June quarter. The tonnage contribution from longhole stoping increased by 8 per cent from 51 per cent in the
June quarter to 59 per cent in the September quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation was similar at R937 million (US$64 million). Cost of sales before gold inventory
change and amortisation and depreciation increased by 9 per cent from R898 million (US$62 million) in the June quarter to R981 million
(US$67 million) in the September quarter mainly due to increased utilities, contractors and consumable costs in the September quarter
due to increased production and two months winter electricity tariffs. This was offset by a gold-in-process credit to cost of
R44 million (US$3 million) in the September quarter compared with a charge to cost of R37 million (US$3 million) in the June quarter.
The net gold-in-process movement was R81 million (US$6 million).

Capital expenditure decreased by 2 per cent from R119 million (US$8 million) in the June quarter to R117 million (US$8 million) in the
September quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 2 per cent from R119 million (US$8 million) in the June quarter to R117 million
(US$8 million) in the September quarter due to a decrease in major component and rebuild costs for the mines fleet. No growth
capital expenditure was incurred for the June and September 2019 quarters in line with the operational plan.

All-in sustaining costs and all-in costs decreased marginally from R590,492 per kilogram (US$1,275 per ounce) in the June quarter to
R588,855 per kilogram (US$1,258 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to higher gold sold, lower sustaining capital
expenditure, partially offset by marginally higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 134,200 ounces in the June quarter to 127,300 ounces in the September quarter mainly due
to lower feed grade in line with the mining plan.
Total tonnes mined, including capital waste stripping, increased by 3 per cent from 23.4 million tonnes in the June quarter to
24.0 million tonnes in the September quarter. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 8 per cent from 4.0 million tonnes to 3.7 million tonnes
in line with the plan.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 6 per cent from 11.5 million tonnes to 12.2 million tonnes due to higher operational waste
stripping required to expose ore in line with the plan. Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 3 per cent from 7.9 million tonnes to
8.1 million tonnes. Mined grade decreased by 3 per cent from 1.25 grams per tonne to 1.21 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined
at Akontansi pit. Gold mined decreased by 10 per cent from 159,000 ounces to 143,100 ounces as a result of decreased ore tonnes and
grade mined. The strip ratio increased from 4.9 to 5.5 due to higher stripping at Teberebie pit.

The CIL plant throughput was similar at 3.4 million tonnes.   Yield decreased by 5 per cent from 1.21 grams per tonne to 1.15 grams per
tonne mainly due to lower grade ore mined and fed.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 5 per cent from US$87 million to US$83 million mainly due to lower
operational costs and a gold-in-process credit to cost of US$5 million in both quarters.

Capital expenditure decreased by 10 per cent from US$30 million to US$27 million due to lower capital waste stripping and timing of
tailings storage construction.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent from US$958 per ounce in the June quarter to US$969 per ounce in
the September quarter due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower
capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 9 per cent from 54,600 ounces in the June quarter to 49,700 ounces in the September quarter mainly due
to lower yield. Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, remained similar at 8.4 million tonnes.

Ore tonnes mined, decreased by 25 per cent from 1.34 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.00 million tonnes in the September quarter
due to Amoanda pit completion ahead of schedule and an increase in mining at the west end of Damang pit complex (DPC) with a relatively
high strip ratio. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 7.1 million tonnes to 7.4 million tonnes due to higher
productivity at the DPC. Capital waste tonnes, included in total waste tonnes, decreased by 31 per cent from 5.8 million tonnes to
4.0 million tonnes due to geotechnical works at the east wall of Damang Pit Cutback. These works included installation of geotechnical
rock fall barriers (fencing) which included drilling and installation of base plates, mounting of posts and attachment of mesh to the
posts.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 162 per cent from 1.3 million tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes due to high volumes mined from
the west end of DPC which has a relatively higher strip ratio. In the September quarter total tonnes mined at Amoanda pit were
0.1 million tonnes, at Saddle 1.3 million tonnes and at Damang Pit Cutback (DPCB) 7.0 million tonnes.
Grade mined increased by 1 per cent from 1.57 grams per tonne to 1.59 grams per tonne due to higher grade material mined from Saddle
pit. Gold mined decreased by 24 per cent from 67,500 ounces to 51,300 ounces due to lower tonnes mined as a result of the end of life
of the Amoanda pit. The strip ratio increased from 5.3 to 7.4 due to more waste tonnes mined from the West of DPC.

Tonnes processed decreased by 1 per cent from 1.17 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.16 million tonnes in the September quarter.
Yield decreased by 8 per cent from 1.46 grams per tonne to 1.34 grams per tonne due to lower feed grade. The lower feed grade is
mainly due to lower stockpile grade fed to supplement ore tonnes mined. In the September quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as
follows: 0.72 million tonnes at 1.70 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.44 million tonnes at 1.33 grams per tonne from stockpiles.
This compared with 0.96 million tonnes at 1.68 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.21 million tonnes at 1.53 grams per tonne from
stockpiles in the June quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 17 per cent from US$30 million in the June quarter to US$35 million
in the September quarter, mainly due to higher operating tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 24 per cent from US$25 million in the June quarter to US$19 million in the September quarter due to
lower capital waste tonnes mined.

Sustaining capital expenditure was similar at US$2 million. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from
US$23 million to US$17 million mainly due to lower capital waste mined.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 25 per cent from US$673 per ounce in the June quarter to US$842 per ounce in the September
quarter mainly due to lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

All-in costs increased by 8 per cent from US$1,097 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,185 per ounce in the September quarter due to
lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower non-sustaining capital
expenditure.
At the end of the September 2019 quarter, 33 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project (DRP 40m), total material mined amounts to
111 million tonnes, 17 per cent ahead of the project schedule. Gold produced for the same period was 485,930 ounces, 21 per cent above
the DRP ounces of 401,230. The project capital spent to date is US$339 million versus the DRP to date of US$300 million, largely driven
by the additional capital waste tonnes mined.

All figures in table on a 100 per cent basis

Gold production increased by 1 per cent from 62,100 ounces in the June quarter to 62,400 ounces in the September quarter.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 16 per cent from 8.9 million tonnes in the June quarter to 7.5 million tonnes in the September quarter.
Ore tonnes mined was similar at 1.1 million tonnes. Grade mined decreased by 5 per cent from 1.55 grams per tonne in the June quarter
to 1.47 grams per tonne in the September quarter.

Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 18 per cent from 7.8 million tonnes in the June quarter to 6.4 million tonnes in the September
quarter. The strip ratio decreased by 22 per cent from 7.4 in the June quarter to 5.8 in the September quarter. The decrease in strip
ratio and waste tonnes mined in the September quarter was mainly due to waste mining from the Cut 2 pushback at Nkran nearing
completion in the September quarter.

Operating waste tonnes mined increased by 46 per cent from 2.8 million tonnes in the June quarter to 4.1 million tonnes in the
September quarter. Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 54 per cent from 5.0 million tonnes in the June quarter to 2.3 million
tonnes in the September quarter.

The plant throughput was similar at 1.4 million tonnes. Yield decreased by 4 per cent from 1.39 grams per tonne in the June quarter to
1.34 grams per tonne in the September quarter. In the September quarter, total tonnes processed exceeded the ore tonnes mined. Total
tonnes processed included 345,000 tonnes fed from the ROM stockpile at an average grade of 1.35 grams per tonne and 1 094 000 tonnes
from the pits at a grade of 1.44 grams per tonne. This compared with 319,000 tonnes that were fed from the ROM stockpile at an average
grade of 1.31 grams per tonne and 1 056 000 tonnes from the pits at a grade of 1.55 grams per tonne in the June quarter.

Gold Fields 45 per cent share of gold produced and gold sold amounted to 28,100 ounces and 28,400 ounces for the September quarter,
respectively and 27,900 ounces and 29,900 ounces for the June quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 13 per cent from US$47 million in the June quarter to US$53 million in
the September quarter mainly due to higher operational waste tonnes mined of 1.3 million tonnes in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 50 per cent from US$28 million in the June quarter to US$14 million in the September quarter and
included deferred stripping of US$20 million and US$10 million, respectively. Capital expenditure decreased due to a decrease in
deferred stripping as a result of the Cut 2 pushback at Nkran nearing completion as well as lower expenditure on the tailings storage
lift during the September quarter.

Sustaining capital decreased by 54 per cent from US$25 million in the June quarter to US$11 million in the September quarter.
Non-sustaining capital was similar at US$3 million.

Gold Fields share of cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 14 per cent from US$21 million to US$24 million.
Gold Fields share of capital expenditure decreased by 54 per cent from US$13 million in the June quarter to US$6 million in the
September quarter. Gold Fields share of sustaining capital decreased by 55 per cent from US$11 million in the June quarter to
US$5 million in the September quarter. Gold Fields share of non-sustaining capital decreased from US$2 million in the June quarter to
US$1 million in the September quarter.

All-in sustaining costs decreased marginally from US$1,180 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,179 per ounce in the September
quarter.

All-in costs increased by 4 per cent from US$1,247 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,301 per ounce in the September quarter mainly
due to lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 14 per cent from 40,900 ounces in the June quarter to 35,000 ounces in the September quarter due to lower
grades mined and processed and lower recovery. Copper production decreased by 10 per cent from 8,357 tonnes to 7,488 tonnes due to
lower grade mined and processed. Equivalent gold production decreased by 19 per cent from 80,300 ounces to 64,800 ounces mainly due to
lower grade processed in line with the mining sequence and lower price factor.

Gold head grade decreased by 10 per cent from 1.22 grams per tonne to 1.10 grams per tonne and gold recoveries decreased from 65.7 per
cent to 62.8 per cent mainly due to the elevated but localised arsenic content. Copper head grade decreased by 8 per cent from
0.59 per cent to 0.54 per cent in line with the mining sequence and copper recoveries decreased from 89.5 per cent to 88.3 per cent.
As a result of the above, gold yield decreased by 14 per cent from 0.80 grams per tonne to 0.69 grams per tonne. Copper yield
decreased by 11 per cent from 0.53 per cent to 0.47 per cent.

In the September quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 36,372 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,480 per
ounce and 7,475 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$4,948 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This
compared with 39,901 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,292 per ounce and 8,017 tonnes of copper that was sold
at an average price of US$5,289 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the June quarter.

Total tonnes mined increased by 16 per cent from 5.45 million tonnes in the June quarter to 6.31 million tonnes in the September
quarter mainly due to higher ore and waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined increased by 18 per cent from
1.76 million tonnes to 2.07 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 15 per cent from 3.69 million tonnes to
4.24 million tonnes in line with the mining plan. The strip ratio decreased from 2.10 to 2.05.

Ore processed was similar at 1.65 million tonnes.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation was similar at US$39 million. The gold-in-process credit to cost of US$2 million
in the September quarter compared with a credit to cost of US$1 million in the June quarter due to a higher amount of low grade ore
stockpiled in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from US$10 million to US$16 million due to an increase in construction activities at the
tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the dry season.

All-in cost per gold ounce increased by 83 per cent from US$381 per ounce in the June quarter to US$698 per ounce in the September
quarter mainly due to higher capital expenditure, lower by-product credit due to lower copper price received and lower gold sold.
All-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 29 per cent from US$719 per equivalent ounce to US$929 per equivalent ounce due to higher
capital expenditure and lower equivalent ounces sold.

Gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 84,600 ounces in the June quarter to 75,200 ounces in the September quarter due to
reduced ore tonnes processed as a result of a seven-day mill maintenance shutdown as well as lower grades of ore processed.

Total ore tonnes mined increased by 8 per cent from 1.3 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.4 million tonnes in the September
quarter.

Total underground ore tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 311,200 tonnes in the June quarter to 301,800 tonnes in the September
quarter. Grade mined increased by 7 per cent from 3.65 grams per tonne to 3.90 grams per tonne and resultant gold mined increased by
4 per cent from 36,500 ounces in the June quarter to 37,800 ounces in the September quarter. In the September quarter tonnes mined
were sourced as follows: 243,600 tonnes at 3.9 grams per tonne from Invincible, 54,600 tonnes at 4.1 grams per tonne from Cave Rocks
and 3,600 tonnes at 2.2 grams per tonne from Hamlet. This compared with 243,900 tonnes at 3.8 grams per tonne from Invincible,
50,600 tonnes at 3.4 grams per tonne from Cave Rocks and 16,700 tonnes at 2.9 grams per tonne from Hamlet in the June quarter.

At the Hamlet underground operation, mining of the main ore body is winding up with mine activities to be concluded by the end of 2019.
Simultaneously the higher-grade Hamlet North ore body is being developed with first production ore expected during the March 2020
quarter. Remnant mining of lower levels at the Cave Rocks underground mine continued in the September quarter with mining activities
at Cave Rocks to be concluded by the end of 2019.

Total tonnes mined at the open pits, decreased by 9 per cent from 3.4 million tonnes in the June quarter to 3.1 million tonnes in the
September quarter.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 10 per cent from 1.0 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.1 million tonnes
in the September quarter. Grade mined from open pits decreased by 5 per cent from 1.67 grams per tonne to 1.59 grams per tonne
reflecting the lower grade ore mined from Neptune pit in the September quarter. Gold mined from the open pits increased by 10 per cent
from 51,900 ounces to 56,900 ounces. In the September quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.7 million tonnes at 1.24 grams
per tonne from Neptune and 0.4 million tonnes at 2.11 grams per tonne from Invincible. This compared with 0.6 million tonnes at
1.32 grams per tonne from Neptune and 0.4 million tonnes at 2.16 grams per tonne from Invincible in the June quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 125 per cent from 0.8 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.8 million tonnes in the
September quarter with Neptune stage 5 moving to operational waste stripping and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 88 per cent
from 1.6 million tonnes to 0.2 million tonnes with lower capital waste mining at Neptune stage 5. The strip ratio decreased from
2.5 to 1.8 with lower waste mining at Neptune.

Ounces mined at the total St Ives complex increased by 7 per cent from 88,300 ounces in the June quarter to 94,700 ounces in the
September quarter. At the end of the September quarter, stockpiled Neptune high-grade oxide material amounted to 1,075,800 tonnes at
1.21 grams per tonne, Invincible amounted to 133,300 tonnes at 2.12 grams per tonne and A5 amounted to 173,600 tonnes at 1.41 grams per
tonne. This compared with Neptune high-grade oxide material that amounted to 663,200 tonnes at 1.23 grams per tonne, Invincible that
amounted to 191,900 tonnes at 2.91 grams per tonne and A5 that amounted to 174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne at the end of the
June quarter. Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide material blend. The excess Neptune oxide material is
stockpiled and fed to the mill so as to maintain the optimum blend.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 7 per cent from 1.15 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.07 million tonnes in the
September quarter mainly due to a seven-day maintenance shutdown to perform mill relining work. Yield decreased by 4 per cent from
2.28 grams per tonne to 2.19 grams per tonne due to lower grade of ore mined in the blend and approximately 4,000 ounces left within
the circuit at the end of the September quarter 2019 which will be produced in the next quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 10 per cent from A$87 million (US$62 million) in the June quarter to
A$78 million (US$53 million) in the September quarter. The gold inventory credit to cost of A$11 million (US$7 million) in the
September quarter compared with a charge to cost of A$7 million (US$5 million) in the June quarter, partially offset by increased
mining cost of A$8 million (US$5 million) due to increased ore and operational waste mined at the open pits in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 5 per cent from A$37 million (US$26 million) to A$35 million (US$24 million) due to decreased capital
development in the September quarter.

All-in cost increased by 4 per cent from A$1,468 per ounce (US$1,029 per ounce) in the June quarter to A$1,533 per ounce (US$1,050 per
ounce) in the September quarter due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation
and lower capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 56,400 ounces in the June quarter to 50,400 ounces in the September quarter due to lower
grades mined and processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 20 per cent from 299,100 tonnes in the June quarter to 360,200 tonnes in the September quarter.
Mined grade decreased by 23 per cent from 6.38 grams per tonnes to 4.90 grams per tonne due to increased material mined from the lower
grade portion of Waroonga North area.

Deteriorating ground conditions in the FBH ore body during the June quarter 2019, precipitated a change in mining plans to expand
production from the Waroonga North ore body. Certain areas of the Waroonga North area ore body were associated with lower grades which
had the effect of reducing the overall mining grades. Due to the FBH conditions, the mining rate of FBH slowed down with additional
development to allow just in time stoping activities.

The delay in FBH and the resequencing of Waroonga North had a negative impact on the September quarter ounce production.   Additional
development was also undertaken at New Holland to assist in opening up additional mining fronts.

Gold mined decreased by 8 per cent from 61,300 ounces in the June quarter to 56,700 ounces in the September quarter. In the September
quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 206,800 tonnes at 5.7 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 153,400 tonnes at 3.8 grams per
tonne from New Holland. This compared with 168,200 tonnes at 8.2 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 130,900 tonnes at 4.0 grams per
tonne from New Holland in the June quarter. The decline in the Waroonga grade is mainly due to lower grade and ore tonnes from the
Bengal ore body in line with the mining sequence and due to lower grades in the early stages of Waroonga North.

Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 304,600 tonnes in the June quarter to 307,000 tonnes in the September quarter.
The combined yield decreased by 11 per cent from 5.75 grams per tonne to 5.10 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 5 per cent from A$56 million (US$39 million) in the June quarter to
A$53 million (US$36 million) in the September quarter. The decrease was due to a gold inventory credit to cost of A$10 million
(US$7 million) in the September quarter compared with A$2 million (US$2 million) in the June quarter and a decrease of A$2 million
(US$1 million) in the cost of employee accommodation following the commissioning of the new accommodation village on site. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in mining cost of A$6 million (US$4 million) due to increased ore mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 38 per cent from A$37 million (US$26 million) to A$23 million (US$15 million) mainly due to the
completion of the new accommodation village and lower capital development at Waroonga in the September quarter.

All-in cost increased by 1 per cent from A$1,747 per ounce (US$1,224 per ounce) in the June quarter to A$1,756 per ounce (US$1,200 per
ounce) in the September quarter due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation
and lower capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 8 per cent from 64,700 ounces in the June quarter to 69,700 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to
increased ore processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 6 per cent from 425,600 tonnes to 450,900 tonnes due to increased ore development in the
September quarter resulting in increased flexibility and availability of production stoping fronts. Grade mined decreased by 1 per
cent from 5.16 grams per tonne in the June quarter to 5.12 grams per tonne in the September quarter in line with the mining sequence.
As a result, overall ounces mined increased by 5 per cent from 70,700 ounces in the June quarter to 74,300 ounces in the September
quarter.

Tonnes processed increased by 11 per cent from 419,900 tonnes in the June quarter to 464,100 tonnes in the September quarter due to
increased ore availability. The yield decreased by 3 per cent from 4.79 grams per tonne to 4.67 grams per tonne due to lower grade
mined.
Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 11 per cent from A$53 million (US$38 million) in the June quarter to
A$59 million (US$41 million) in the September quarter due to increased ore tonnes mined and a major relining of the SAG Mill in the
September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 4 per cent from A$25 million (US$17 million) in the June quarter to A$26 million (US$18 million) in
the September quarter mainly due to increased exploration expenditure.

All-in cost increased by 1 per cent from A$1,335 per ounce (US$936 per ounce) in the June quarter to A$1,347 per ounce (US$927 per
ounce) in the September quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and higher capital expenditure,
partially offset by and higher gold sold.

All figures in table on a 100 per cent basis
* Gold sold was credited to capital prior to commercial levels of production being achieved

Gold production commenced in the September quarter with 29,100 ounces produced in the September quarter. Approximately 3,000 ounces
were left within the circuit and will be produced in the next quarter. Commercial levels of production were achieved at the end of the
September quarter.

Commissioning of the final components at the process plant was achieved in the September quarter with the SAG and ball mills operating
steadily. Plant availability for the September quarter was at 73.4 per cent (82.4 per cent for the September month), while the
percentage of nameplate capacity (8.2 million tonnes per annum) achieved for the September quarter was 55.6 per cent (75 per cent in
the September month).

The final forecast capital cost (FFC) is estimated at A$607 million (level of accuracy range + 1 per cent/-1 per cent).

In accordance with the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition, Gold Fields will fund up to 10 per cent of
costs overruns, excluding scope changes and force majeure costs. Consequently, Gold Fields share of the estimated FFC of A$607 million
(+/- 1 per cent) is approximately A$329 million. This has all been incurred by the end of September 2019.

Ore mined from the Gruyere open pit increased by 24 per cent from 1.7 million tonnes in the June quarter to 2.1 million tonnes in the
September quarter with additional low-grade material of 400,000 tonnes mined within the pit shell contributing to the ore tonnes and
grade. Grade mined increased by 5 per cent from 0.84 grams per tonne in the June quarter to 0.88 grams per tonne in the September
quarter and resultant ounces mined increased by 30 per cent from 46,000 ounces in the June quarter to 59,700 ounces in the September
quarter.

Grade control drilling has identified additional ore above the cut-off grade but below the average life of mine grade. This additional
ore is still within the existing pit shell and would otherwise be categorised as waste. The strategy is to stockpile the lower grade
ore above the cut-off grade and to preferentially process the high-grade ore.

At the end of the September quarter stockpiled material amounted to 84,100 ounces (3.3 million tonnes at 0.79 grams per tonne) compared
with 64,000 ounces (2.5 million tonnes at 0.82 grams per tonne) in the June quarter.

Ore tonnes processed in the September quarter were 1.1 million tonnes and yield was at 0.82 grams per tonne with total production of
29,100 ounces. The reduced yield was due to preferential treatment of low grade ore during the start-up in order to test the integrity
of the circuit as well as building up a baseline of gold-in-circuit.

Trading statement for H1 2019


Johannesburg, 2 August 2019: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) advises that basic earnings per share for the six months ended 30
June 2019 (H1 2019) is expected to be between US8.0-10.0 per share, an
improvement of US53.0-55.0 per share (118-122%) from the basic loss of
US45.0 per share reported for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (H1 2018).

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for H1 2019 are expected to be 10-15%
(US0.8-1.2 per share) lower at US6.8-7.2 per share from the US8 per share
reported for H1 2018

Normalised earnings for H1 2019 are expected to be US13.0-17.0 per share,
160-240% (US8.0-12.0 per share) higher than the US5.0 per share reported
for H1 2018.

Attributable gold equivalent production for the six months ended 30 June
2019 increased by 9% YoY to 1,083koz (H1 2018: 994koz), mainly due to the
inclusion of the contribution from Asanko in H1 2019.
On 14 November 2018, the World Gold Council (WGC) published an update to its
guidance on the interpretation of all-in sustaining costs (AISC) and all-in
costs (AIC). Gold Fields has adopted the revision prospectively from 1
January 2019. Based on the revised WGC guidance, AISC for the Group is
US$891/oz for H1 2019. On the previous interpretation, AISC for the period
was US$973/oz (H1 2018: US$965/oz), marginally higher YoY.

AIC for H1 2019 was 5% lower YoY at US$1,106/oz (H1 2018: US$1,169/oz) as
project capital started to decrease. AIC reporting was not affected by the
revised WGC guidance.

For Q2 2019 attributable group gold-equivalent production was 541koz (Q1
2019: 542koz), with AISC (new interpretation) of US$910/oz (Q1 2019:
US$871/oz); AISC (previous interpretation) of US$985/oz (Q1 2019: US$963/oz)
and AIC of US$1,132/oz (Q1 2019: US$1,080/oz).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed, and reported on, by the Company's external auditors.

Gold Fields will release H1 2019 financial results on Thursday, 15 August
2018.

Remarks by Gold Fields Chair Cheryl at the Gold Fields AGM, 21 May
2019:
Good afternoon  As has become customary I want to begin this AGM
with a few introductory remarks. Let me start out with the issue
that is most critical to Gold Fields  safety & health.

Gold Fields continues to show significant progress in improving our
safety performance and management practices. During 2018, the
fatality rate, the benchmark total recordable injury frequency rate
(TRIFR) and the total number of recordable injuries continued their
overall improvements of the past few years. At 1.83 incidents per
million hours worked, the Gold Fields 2018 TRIFR has improved by
55% since 2014.

The Board shares management's commitment to eliminate all
fatalities and serious injuries. It is therefore a major
disappointment that we experienced a fatality during 2018. I want
to express my sincerest condolences to the family, friends and
colleagues of Ananias Mosololi, a load haul dump truck operator at
South Deep.

On the health front, the Occupational Lung Disease Working Group,
representing the majority of gold mining companies in South Africa,
including Gold Fields, reached a historic settlement with attorneys
representing ex-mineworkers suffering from silicosis and
tuberculosis (TB). The settlement, once approved by the courts, is
set to see R5bn (US$380m) dedicated to compensating ex-mine workers
suffering from this dreadful disease. Gold Fields' contribution is
almost R400m.

Turning to financial and operational matters, Gold Fields' mines
performed well during 2018 against a background of a volatile gold
price and the heavy investment in growth projects. All mines,
except South Deep, met, or improved on, their production and cost
guidance and generated sufficient cash to fund the bulk of the
investment spend and pay a modest dividend to shareholders. We had
to increase our debt to pay for the acquisition of Asanko Gold but
our balance sheet remains in good health. We have further
strengthened our debt profile with the successful US$1bn raised in
new bonds earlier this month (May 2019).

South Deep embarked on a fundamental restructuring in Q3 2018,
which saw management close loss-making areas, reduce the cost base
and embark on a section 189 retrenchment process. Unfortunately,
this meant that we had to retrench just over 1,500 employees and
contractors, despite the strong opposition by the unions, which led
to a 45-day strike. We could not avoid the retrenchments, as this
would have put the sustainability of South Deep, and the remaining
3,500 jobs, at risk.

I believe that the restructuring, the most comprehensive in South
Deep's history, will achieve a significant reduction in the cash
losses this year and set the mine up for long-term and sustainable
growth. So far this year the mine is meeting its targets and we are
confident that it will continue doing so.

Developments at Gold Fields in 2018 and in 2019 to date clearly
underscore the company's strong, expanding and sustainable global
profile. Not only are our production and cash-flow already heavily
weighted towards our mines in Australia, Peru and Ghana, we have
increased our investment in these countries to enhance
sustainability of our business. The key developments here are:

     Our combined US$500m-plus investment over the past two years
      in the Damang mine in Ghana and the Gruyere project in
      Australia is beginning to bear fruit in 2019, with the
      potential to further boost our production and profitability in
      these regions
     During 2018, we acquired a 45% stake in the highly prospective
      Asanko gold mine in Ghana, further raising our profile in a
      jurisdiction in which we have operated for 25 years
     We have successfully completed a feasibility study for the
      Salares Norte project in Chile and declared a maiden Mineral
      Reserve. While we await the outcome of the Environmental
      Impact Assessment, expected in early 2020, we have also asked
      management to develop a funding plan for the project
     We have extended the life of our Cerro Corona mine in Peru to
      2030 and are working on a scoping study with the aim of
      extending it further to 2040
     Our substantial investments in near-mine exploration at our
      Australian mines continued to yield good results, with the
      mines not only making up annual depletion but adding net
      Mineral Reserves over the past four years

As a result of these developments we expect the production of our
portfolio in Australia, Ghana and Peru to approach 2Moz during 2019
and we believe that our global portfolio outside of South Africa
will be able to maintain a similar production level over the medium
to longer term (at the current gold price). Also noticeable is that
until two years ago, just over 70% of our Reserves were held by
South Deep. That profile has changed: at the end of 2018, over 40%
of the Group's attributable Mineral Reserves were now outside of
South Africa.

Not only has the cash generated by our mines enabled us to invest
in future growth, but also to create significant value for our key
stakeholders. During 2018, Gold Fields' total value distribution to
our stakeholders was US$2.7bn in the form of payments to
governments, capital providers, business suppliers and our
workforce.

A particular focus in 2018 was strengthening our relations with
host communities, whose partnership is critical in sustaining our
mines. During 2018, almost a quarter of our total value creation,
almost US$700m, remained in our host communities through focused
job creation, procurement and investment in Shared Value projects.
Carmen Letton will expand on this in her SET Report back just now.

Before I conclude, I want to welcome Phuti Mahanyele-Dabengwa. She
joined the Gold Fields Board in September last year and this is her
first AGM. With these brief remarks let us please proceed with the
order of business.


Remarks by the Chair of the Gold Fields Social, Ethics and
Transformation Committee, Dr Carmen Letton, at the Gold Fields AGM,
21 May 2019:
Good afternoon Shareholders, members of the Gold Fields board and
management team and other guests
This is my first report back as Chair of the Social, Ethics, and
Transformation committee of Gold Fields. It's a great honour and I
want to pay tribute to my predecessor, Don Ncube, who retired from
the Board at last year's AGM. Don set the tone and culture for this
committee and has provided a sound platform on which my fellow
directors and I can build. He was energised and passionate in
handing over, driving us to lead on modern policy and practices and
building strong foundations. He left me with foundations that I
constantly refer to and use. So a personal thank you to Don, who is
not here today.
Let's talk a little about our foundations. This committee has a
wide-ranging mandate built around a number of responsible business
practices. We focus on:
     - Social and economic development
     - Good corporate citizenship
     - Sound stakeholder relations with our workforce, communities,
       governments and investors
     - Labour and employment practices
     - Transformation
     - Communication, reputation and branding
Our 2019 key strategic themes are drawn from these:
   Globalisation of our SET Leading Practices with a focus on
     execution across all regions
   Diversity and Inclusion with a      focus on Youth, Previously
     Disadvantaged groups and Women
   Communication and Branding to ensure that we improve our
     stakeholder perceptions, strengthen our brand and talk openly
     about collaboration, strategy and outcomes.
It is the responsibility of this Committee to ensure that Gold
Fields carries out these practices in line with industry-leading
guidelines, including the principles of the UN Global Compact, the
ten ICMM Principles as well as ILO Conventions.
Stakeholder engagement is at the heart of Gold Fields' activities.
The Committee makes sure that the company engages its stakeholders,
discusses   and   negotiates   key  decisions   with   them   before
implementation, mitigates any adverse environmental and social
impacts and, most critically, shares the benefits of mining with
them.
During 2018 Gold Fields generated revenue of almost US$2.6 billion,
which was distributed to key stakeholders as follows:
     - Our workforce: US$442 million
     - Our capital providers and shareholders: US$147 million
     - Governments, in the form of taxes and royalties: US$283
       million
     - Our business partners: US$1.82 billion
     - Our communities in the form of Socio-Economic Development
       spending and Shared Value projects: US$26 million
However, our investment in communities goes well beyond socio-
economic development and compliance spending. Over the past few
years we have asked Gold Fields to prioritise sharing the value we
create with the communities surrounding our mines. The focus is to
alleviate unemployment and create sustainable economies through
community employment and procurement. We are making considerable
progress, and at the end of 2018, 56% of our workforce, or 9,259
people, were members of our host communities. Furthermore, 27% of
total supplier spend was with enterprises from these communities.
Quantifying this impact across Gold Fields shows that we distribute
25% of our total value creation  the equivalent of US$690 million
 in our host communities. This is significant and our management
teams at the mines have been incentivised to achieve further
sustainable host community job creation and procurement.
It is also critical to mention that our community investment
projects provide significant shared value both to our operations
and our communities. As I am speaking the finishing touches are
being applied to Gold Fields' largest infrastructure investment to
date: the US$26m public road between Tarkwa and Damang in Ghana.
Not only will this make transport between our two mines faster and
safer, it created community jobs during construction and offers
almost 100,000 affected residents easier access to schools, markets
and public facilities.
Similarly, at our Cerro Corona mine in Peru, we have spent almost
US$3 million over the past three years on improving water supply to
the host communities. This has provided a large majority of
residents access to clean potable water.
Turning to one of our most critical stakeholders, our employees and
contractors. Our workforce is structured to support the delivery of
immediate and long-term strategic objectives so that our mines can
continue to operate sustainably and profitably. During 2018, the
two   most   significant  people-related   developments   were   the
restructuring exercise and related strike action at South Deep, as
well as the transition from owner to contractor mining at Tarkwa.
Due to the workforce restructuring at these mines, Gold Fields'
overall workforce numbers dropped 5% from 18,594 in 2017 to 17,611
in 2018. The number of direct employees declined by 37% to 5,601,
while the number of contractors rose 23% to 12,010.
The retrenchment of 1,082 employees and 420 contractors at South
Deep was particularly painful. The retrenchments were opposed by
the majority union, however, management was left with little option
to this course of action. The mine was losing R100 million a month
and, had we not proceeded with the retrenchments, the long-term
sustainability of the mine and the remaining 3,500 jobs would have
been at risk.
At Tarkwa, the maturity of the mine and the accompanying costs
would have made the previous owner mining model unsustainable.
While the switch to contractor mining was opposed by the union, all
2,100 affected employees received generous retrenchment benefits in
line with Ghanaian labour laws. Almost 80% of them were rehired by
the two contractors, with most coming from our host communities.
We continued to focus on building a more diverse and inclusive
workforce, with particular emphasis on employing women, residents
from our host communities and, in South Africa, historically
disadvantaged people. This forms a key pillar of the SET and HR
strategy. A diversity policy was approved by the Board during the
year. In addition to increasing the attraction and retention of
female employees, this policy also emphasises the importance of
ensuring that all people are treated with dignity and respect.
Since last year's AGM the Committee also approved:
     - A new Group Sexual Harassment Policy
     - An updated Group Disciplinary and Grievance Policy
     - An updated Human Rights policy
     - A new Materials and Supply Chain Stewardship Policy
Gold Fields remains committed to the training and development of
employees. In the past five years the company has invested US$77
million in human resources development programs which inter alia
consist of on-the-job skills training, learnerships,
apprenticeships, and the training of artisans.
I would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to my
co-directors and Gold Fields' management teams for their support in
ensuring that the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee meets
its key compliance and transformation performance objectives. By
doing so we contribute to strengthening our social licence to
operate and, ultimately, the success of Gold Fields.

Statement by Nick Holland 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

Setting Gold Fields up for the future
Over the past two years, Gold Fields has been focused on reinvesting into the business, with 2019 expected to be the inflection point 
as project capital decreases and the new projects start to contribute to the group. The key motivation behind the investment focus is 
to ensure that our portfolio of mines continues to generate cash sustainably into the foreseeable future, while at the same time 
lowering our costs and extending mine life. 

Having spent total project capital in excess of US$500m over the past two years, primarily on Damang and Gruyere, Gold Fields is now 
well placed to maintain a production profile of approximately 2Moz a year at our international operations in Australia, Ghana and the 
Americas over the medium to long term. This is based on current gold price levels, our attributable gold Mineral Reserves of 20Moz in 
these regions as well as our track record of Resource conversion and exploration activities. 

The 2Moz milestone is expected to be reached for the first time in 2019 as Damang increases production; Gruyere is set to come into 
production and our Asanko joint venture (JV) in Ghana contributes for the full year. The longer-term future of this portfolio also 
looks positive as we continue to invest in near-mine exploration at our Australian mines, while the Board has approved a maiden Mineral 
Reserve and the technical components of the feasibility study for the high-grade, low-cost Salares Norte project in Chile. We will 
continue to advance this project to a build decision in mid-2020 with the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment being a key 
variable.

The globalisation of our portfolio has also been evident in a gradual shift in our Mineral Reserve exposure. Until two years ago, just 
over 70% of our Reserves were held by South Deep. That profile has changed: of our total gold-equivalent Mineral Reserves of 50.9Moz 
in December 2018, 41% are now outside South Africa. 

One of the key benefits of the reinvestment programme over the past two years is the expected reduction in Group All-in Costs (AIC) to 
approximately US$900/oz by 2020/21, a level which we feel is required to be competitive on a global scale. As the quality of the 
portfolio improves and our cost profile starts to decline, we expect an improved free cash-flow (FCF) margin. For 2019, therefore, we 
have adjusted our target to a FCF margin of 15% at a gold price of US$1,200/oz (previously US$$1,300/oz).

Q1 2019 performance
Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 11% higher YoY (6% higher QoQ) at 542koz (production in Q1 2019 included 
27koz attributable from the Asanko JV). All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were largely flat YoY (down 5% QoQ) at US$963/oz and all-in 
costs (AIC) were 6% lower YoY (11% lower QoQ) at US$1,080/oz. 

The average US$ gold price achieved in the quarter was 1% lower YoY (7% higher QoQ) at US$1,298/oz. The average Australian dollar for 
the quarter was A$0.71/US$ (10% weaker YoY and 1% weaker QoQ), resulting in an A$ gold price of A$1,827/oz. The average South African 
rand for the quarter was R14.04/US$ (17% weaker YoY and 2% stronger QoQ), resulting in a rand gold price of R590,314/kg. 

Despite the project capital still being spent by the Group in Q1 2019, as well as the payment of the FY18 dividend during the quarter, 
the net debt balance was largely unchanged at US$1,614m from US$1,612m at 31 December 2018.

Regional operational performance
The Australian region produced 229koz for the quarter, up 3% YoY (up 4% QoQ), with AIC of A$1,598/oz (US$1,138/oz), up 46% YoY (up 15% 
QoQ). The increase relates to the change in how Gruyere is accounted for, with the project now being included in the AIC for the region 
as it comes into production this year (previously it was just included in the Group numbers). Excluding Gruyere, AIC for the region was 
A$1,449/oz (US$1,031/oz) up 32% YoY (up 4% QoQ).

Managed production, including our 45% share of Asanko, in Ghana for Q1 2019 was 221koz, up 32% YoY (up 10% QoQ), with AIC of US$983/oz, 
down 15% YoY (down 11% QoQ), as benefits of the Damang reinvestment project started to materialise during the quarter. Gold equivalent 
production at Cerro Corona was up 12% YoY (18% lower QoQ) at 77koz, with AIC of US$677 per equivalent ounce, flat YoY (up 4% QoQ). 

Production at South Deep started to recover after a challenging Q4 2018 due to the protracted industrial action, with the mine 
producing 34koz (1,069kg) which is tracking the mine?s plan for the year, despite the effects of the load curtailment implemented by 
Eskom. Planned production for 2019 is H2 weighted due to higher grade corridors being accessed during this time. The rebooting of the 
mine post the strike last year, which ended on 18 December 2018, meant that most of January was devoted to making safe, reorientating 
the reduced workforce and recalibrating the organisation to implement the revised mining plan following the previously announced 
restructuring. Momentum did however pick up in February and March and continued into April. South Deep continues to focus on a number 
of key enabling activities, with tangible progress being achieved at the end of the quarter and into Q2 2019.

Update on projects
Damang
Damang continued its strong performance in Q1 2019. The mine produced 57koz at AIC of US$1,027/oz and AISC of US$633/oz, a significant 
improvement from the 40koz produced in Q4 2018 at AIC of US$1,601/oz and AISC US$937/oz. Project capital of US$23m was spent at Damang 
during the quarter leaving US$46m to be spent over the remainder of 2019 (predominantly in Q2 2019). A total of 2,352m of Resource 
infill drilling was completed at Amoanda during the quarter with 9,316m planned for Q2 2019 in order to define the further extent of 
the orebody, which is open to the North.

Gruyere
Gruyere remains on target for first gold production in the June 2019 quarter and within the previously announced total cost estimate of 
A$621m (100% basis). Construction of the Gruyere processing plant is nearing completion (at 97%) with finishing works in progress 
across site and progressive handover to commissioning. Mining scaled up to double shift operations in January, as scheduled, with total 
mining movement tracking ahead of plan. Approximately 800,000 tonnes (100% basis) of ore have been mined and stockpiled in preparation 
for the plant start-up. 

Outlook for 2019 unchanged 
As previously guided, Gold Fields expects an increase of 4% - 7% in attributable equivalent gold production in 2019 to 2.13Moz - 
2.18Moz. AISC is expected to be between US$980/oz and US$995/oz and AIC between US$1,075/oz - US$1,095/oz. The year will however, be 
one of two halves, with both production and cash-flow being weighted to H2 2019.

Eskom power shortage
South Deep has developed a short, medium and long term response to the power shortage being experienced in the country. In the short 
term, the mine is campaign milling and hoisting, and is making use of emergency generators as a contributor to baseload (total capacity 
of 14MW relative to required baseload of 60MW). In the medium term, the mine is looking to acquire additional diesel generators to 
boost its generating capacity. For the long term, the mine is considering a 40MW solar PV project which may be undertaken in a phased 
approach of 10MW increments. 

New lease standard
Gold Fields adopted IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) which replaced the previous leases standard, IAS 17 Leases (IAS 17) on 1 January 2019. 
IFRS 16 has one model for leases which resulted in almost all leases being included on the statement of financial position. Gold Fields 
recognised significant right of use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets and corresponding lease liabilities 
representing its obligation to make lease payments. 

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, the classification and nature of expenses related to leases changed. Previously under IAS 17, 
the Group recognised operating lease expenses relating to the operations in cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation. Under 
IFRS 16, the group recognises an amortisation and depreciation charge for the right-of-use assets and a finance expense in respect of 
the lease liability. The adoption of IFRS 16 led to a reduction in Gold Fields operating cost and an increase in the amortisation and 
depreciation charge and finance expense. There is no significant impact on the income statement as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16.

The adoption of IFRS 16 has no impact on the all-in-sustaining-cost, all-in-costs and net cash flows of Gold Fields.

The December quarter was impacted by a strike which materially reduced production and increased costs in that quarter.  Thankfully the 
strike was settled on 18 December 2018.

Gold production increased by 212 per cent from 343 kilograms (11,019 ounces) in the December quarter to 1,069 kilograms (34,353 ounces) 
in the March quarter, the focus was on changing historical behaviours and on starting the journey to entrench Gold Fields values and 
new way of doing business.  The production was in line with the plan underpinning the guidance for the year despite the load 
curtailment implemented by Eskom.  Most of January was dedicated to making safe and retraining people.

Total underground tonnes mined increased by 168 per cent from 79,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 211,600 tonnes in the March 
quarter.  Ore tonnes mined increased by 184 per cent from 62,000 tonnes to 176,000 tonnes, while underground waste mined increased by 
109 per cent from 17,000 tonnes to 35,600 tonnes.  Access development in the reef areas increased by 151 per cent from 11,800 tonnes to 
29,600 tonnes.  Underground reef grade mined increased by 34 per cent from 4.67 grams per tonne to 6.24 grams per tonne due to an 
increase in longhole stoping and benching grade from 4.78 grams per tonne in the December quarter to 7.34 grams per tonne in the March 
quarter as a result of higher stoping tonnes from higher grade corridors.  Total gold mined from underground increased by 293 per cent 
from 280 kilograms (9,000 ounces) in the December quarter to 1,099 kilograms (35,300 ounces) in the March quarter.

Total tonnes milled increased by 63 per cent from 159,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 258,800 tonnes in the March quarter.  Reef 
yield increased by 20 per cent from 5.30 grams per tonne to 6.34 grams per tonne in line with the higher reef grade.  

Surface tailings material treated decreased by 15 per cent from 70,000 tonnes to 59,600 tonnes. 

Gold recovered from underground amounted to 1,055 kilograms (33,900 ounces) and together with 14 kilograms (445 ounces) recovered from 
the treatment of surface material, resulted in gold produced of 1,069 kilograms (34,300 ounces).

Destress mining increased by 193 per cent from 1,323 square metres in the December quarter to 3,881 square metres in the March quarter. 
We decided to apply shotcrete in destress areas based on empirical data and recommendation from the Geotechnical review board (GRB).
This will reduce rehabilitation.  Cycle times will be initially affected but should normalise in time.  Costs can be managed and should 
be offset with less rehabilitation.  

Longhole stoping increased by 245 per cent from 29,700 tonnes to 102,500 tonnes.  Development increased by 152 per cent from 452 metres 
in the December quarter to 1,139 metres in the March quarter. Development in the current mine areas increased by 111 per cent from 
217 metres in the December quarter to 458 metres in the March quarter.  Development North of Wrench increased by 190 per cent from 
235 metres in the December quarter to 681 metres in the March quarter.

The current mine contributed 55 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the March quarter compared with 69 per cent of the total ore tonnes 
in the December quarter.  The North of Wrench contributed 31 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the December quarter compared with 
45 per cent in the March quarter.  The tonnage contribution from longhole stoping increased by 3 per cent from 45 per cent in the 
December quarter to 48 per cent in the March quarter. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 4 per cent from R763 million (US$52 million) to R734 million 
(US$52 million).  Cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciation increased from R638 million 
(US$43 million) in the December quarter to R788 million (US$56 million) in the March quarter mainly due to higher salaries and wages 
due to increases, increased utilities and contractors and consumable costs in the March quarter due to increased production.  This was 
partially offset by a gold-in-process credit to cost of R54 million (US$4 million) in the March quarter compared with a charge to cost 
of R125 million (US$9 million) in the December quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from R177 million (US$12 million) in the December quarter to R131 million (US$9 million) 
in the March quarter.  

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 14 per cent from R153 million (US$11 million) in the December quarter to R131 million 
(US$9 million) in the March quarter due to a decrease in major component and rebuild costs for the mine?s fleet, partially offset by an 
increase in support costs.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 100 per cent from R24 million (US$1 million) to Rnil 
million (US$nil million) due to the suspension of new mine development as planned.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 51 per cent from R1,834,112 per kilogram (US$3,906 per ounce) in the December quarter to 
R900,408 per kilogram (US$1,992 per ounce) in the March quarter mainly due to higher gold sold, lower sustaining capital expenditure 
and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Total all-in cost decreased by 52 per cent from R1,881,395 per kilogram (US$3,986 per ounce) in the December quarter to R900,408 per 
kilogram (US$1,992 per ounce) in the March quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs, as well as lower non-
sustaining capital expenditure.

25.0 million tonnes in the March quarter due to improved contractor fleet performance.  Ore tonnes mined increased by 3 per cent from 
4.0 million tonnes to 4.1 million tonnes due to increased mining volumes in line with the mining plan.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 20 per cent from 7.5 million tonnes to 9.0 million tonnes due to higher operational waste 
stripping required to expose ore at the Akontansi pit in line with the mining plan.  Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 8 per cent

tonne.  Gold mined increased by 3 per cent from 157,200 ounces to 161,900 ounces as a result of increased ore tonnes mined.  The strip 
ratio increased from 4.7 to 5.2. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased marginally from 3.5 million tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes.  Yield increased by 2 per cent from 
1.21 grams per tonne to 1.23 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grade ore mined and processed and improved plant recovery.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 14 per cent from US$83 million to US$71 million mainly due to a gold-
in-process credit to cost of US$9 million in the March quarter compared with US$4 million in the December quarter.  

Capital expenditure increased by 15 per cent from US$34 million to US$39 million due to higher capital waste stripping.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased marginally from US$924 per ounce in the December quarter to US$922 per ounce 
in the March quarter due to higher gold sold and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation partially offset by higher 
capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 43 per cent from 40,000 ounces in the December quarter to 57,200 ounces in the March quarter mainly due 
to higher yield and tonnes processed.  The December quarter included a 16 day planned plant shutdown to replace the SAG mill shell.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 18 per cent from 10.6 million tonnes in the December quarter to 
8.7 million tonnes in the March quarter due to the reduction in the 2019 planned tonnes in line with the mining sequence and as 
Amoanda will cease mining as from June 2019.  

Ore tonnes mined, decreased by 5 per cent from 1.43 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.36 million tonnes in the March quarter. 
Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 21 per cent from 9.2 million tonnes to 7.3 million tonnes in line with the operational plan.  
Capital waste tonnes included in total waste tonnes decreased by 13 per cent from 6.8 million tonnes to 5.9 million tonnes in line with 
the 2019 plan.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 42 per cent from 2.4 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes in line with the 
operational plan.  In the March quarter total tonnes mined at Amoanda pit were 0.9 million tonnes, at Saddle 1.8 million tonnes and at 
DPCB 6.0 million tonnes. 

Head grade mined increased by 6 per cent from 1.50 grams per tonne to 1.59 grams per tonne due to higher grade mined at the Saddle pit.
Gold mined increased by 1 per cent from 68,800 ounces to 69,400 ounces.  The strip ratio decreased from 6.4 to 5.4 due to lower strip 
ratio areas at the Saddle and Amoanda pits.

Tonnes processed increased by 19 per cent from 0.97 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.15 million tonnes in the March quarter 
due to higher plant overall equipment availability and ongoing mill optimisation work.  Yield increased by 20 per cent from 1.28 grams 
per tonne to 1.54 grams per tonne due to higher feed grade and improved recovery.  In the March quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as 
follows: 0.96 million tonnes at 1.65 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.19 million tonnes at 2.07 grams per tonne from high grades 
stockpiled in the December quarter during the SAG mill shell replacement.  This compared with 0.84 million tonnes at 1.44 grams per 
tonne from the pits and 0.13 million tonnes at 1.03 grams per tonne from stockpiles in the December quarter. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 15 per cent from US$33 million in the December quarter to US$28 million 
in the March quarter, mainly due to lower operational waste tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 19 per cent from US$31 million in the December quarter to US$25 million in the March quarter as a 
result of lower capital waste tonnes mined and additional costs incurred on the Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) and Amoanda 
Tomento scout drilling in the December quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 33 per cent from US$3 million to US$2 million.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure 
decreased by 18 per cent from US$28 million to US$23 million mainly due to lower capital waste mined (5.9 million tonnes in the March 
quarter compared with 6.8 million tonnes mined in the December quarter).

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 32 per cent from US$937 per ounce in the December quarter to US$633 per ounce in the March quarter 
mainly due to higher gold sold and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation. 

All-in costs decreased by 36 per cent from US$1,601 per ounce in the December quarter to US$1,027 per ounce in the March quarter due to 
the same reasons above, as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure. 
At the end of the March 2019 quarter, and 27 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project (DRP), total material mined amounted to 
94 million tonnes, 21 per cent ahead of the project schedule.  Gold produced during the same period was 381,500 ounces, 34 per cent 
above the DRP ounces of 285,152.  The additional ounces mined is due to incremental growth from Amoanda pit not factored into the 
original DRP.  The project capital spent to date is US$294 million versus the original DRP budget to date of US$249 million, largely 
driven by the additional capital waste tonnes mined.

Gold production decreased by 18 per cent from 48,400 ounces in the December quarter to 39,900 ounces in the March quarter due to lower 
grades mined and processed.  Copper production decreased by 12 per cent from 8,849 tonnes to 7,764 tonnes due to lower grade mined and 
processed.  Equivalent gold production decreased by 18 per cent from 93,200 ounces to 76,800 ounces mainly due to lower grade processed 
in line with the mining sequence and the lower price factor used for equivalent ounce conversion. 

Gold head grade decreased by 16 per cent from 1.35 grams per tonne to 1.13 grams per tonne and gold recoveries decreased from 68.3 per 
cent to 67.3 per cent, in line with the mining sequence and due to the arsenic content which is localised and not significant in the 
context of the total ore body.  Copper head grade decreased by 10 per cent from 0.60 per cent to 0.54 per cent in line with the mining 
sequence and copper recoveries decreased from 90.3 per cent to 89.0 per cent.  Gold yield decreased by 22 per cent from 0.98 grams per 
tonne to 0.76 grams per tonne due to lower head grade and recovery.  Copper yield decreased by 17 per cent from 0.58 per cent to 0.48 
per cent due to lower head grade and recovery.

In the March quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 41,413 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,296 per ounce 
and 7,852 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,604 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared 
with 45,494 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,227 per ounce and 8,369 tonnes of copper that was sold at an 
average price of US$5,426 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the December quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 2 per cent from 5.25 million tonnes in the December quarter to 5.37 million tonnes in the March quarter 
mainly due to higher ore mined in line with the mining sequence and higher efficiency of the new mining contractor.  Ore mined 
increased by 5 per cent from 1.82 million tonnes to 1.92 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased marginally from 
3.43 million tonnes to 3.45 million tonnes in line with the mining plan.  The strip ratio decreased from 1.89 to 1.80.

Ore processed increased by 6 per cent from 1.60 million tonnes to 1.70 million tonnes due to higher plant throughput in the March 
quarter (823 tonnes per hour in the March quarter versus 793 tonnes per hour in the December quarter), due to ore characteristics and 
appropriate blending.  

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 10 per cent from US$38 million to US$42 million mainly due to a 
US$1 million gold-in-process charge to cost in the March quarter compared with US$5 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the 
December quarter as a result of an increase in stockpiles in the December quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 46 per cent from US$13 million to US$7 million due to a decrease in construction activities at the 
tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the rainy season.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 19 per cent from US$252 per ounce in the December quarter to 
US$203 per ounce in the March quarter mainly due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by higher cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation and lower gold sold.   All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 
4 per cent from US$649 per equivalent ounce to US$677 per equivalent ounce due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation and lower equivalent ounces sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

Gold production, increased by 17 per cent from 87,900 ounces in the December quarter to 103,000 ounces in the March quarter due to 
increased ore tonnes mined with less reliance on stockpiled material. 

Total ore tonnes mined increased by 83 per cent from 0.6 million tonnes in the December quarter 1.1 million tonnes in the March 
quarter.

Total underground ore tonnes mined increased by 3 per cent from 323,200 tonnes in the December quarter to 334,500 tonnes in the March 
quarter.  Gold mined from underground operations increased by 21 per cent from 39,100 ounces in the December quarter to 47,500 ounces 
in the March quarter.

At the Hamlet underground operation, mining of the main ore body is decelerating with mine activities to be concluded by the end of 
2019. Simultaneously the Hamlet North ore body is being developed with first ore expected during the first half of 2020. Ore tonnes 
mined at Hamlet decreased by 65 per cent from 73,800 tonnes in the December quarter to 25,700 tonnes in the March quarter.  Head grade 
decreased by 18 per cent from 3.76 grams per tonne to 3.09 grams per tonne due to mine sequence and resultant gold mined decreased by 
71 per cent from 8,900 ounces to 2,600 ounces.

Operations at the Invincible underground mine are approaching steady state. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 
249,400 tonnes in the December quarter to 244,800 tonnes in the March quarter.  Head grade mined during the March quarter increased by 
34 per cent from 3.76 grams per tonne to 5.05 grams per tonne due to mining of high grade stopes in the Drake zone, as per the mine 
plan.  Gold mined from Invincible underground increased by 31 per cent from 30,200 ounces to 39,700 ounces. 

Remnant mining of lower levels at the Cave Rocks underground mine commenced during the quarter, with 64,000 tonnes mined at 2.53 grams 
per tonne, yielding 5,200 ounces. The crown pillar extraction of Cave Rocks is planned for the second half of 2019.

Total tonnes mined at the open pits, increased by 9 per cent from 3.3 million tonnes in the December quarter to 3.6 million tonnes in 
the March quarter.  

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 167 per cent from 0.3 million tonnes in the December quarter to 0.8 million 
tonnes in the March quarter.  Ore was sourced from Neptune and Invincible open pits in the March quarter compared with Neptune open pit 
the only source of ore in the December quarter.  

Grade mined from open pits, increased by 24 per cent from 1.40 grams per tonne to 1.73 grams per tonne reflecting the higher grade ore 
mined from Invincible pit in the March quarter.  Gold mined from the open pits increased by 219 per cent from 13,100 ounces to 
41,800 ounces.  In the March quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.5 million tonnes at 1.48 grams per tonne from Neptune 
and 0.3 million tonnes at 2.09 grams per tonne from Invincible.  This compared with 0.3 million tonnes at 1.40 grams per tonne from 
Neptune and nil from Invincible in the December quarter. 

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 120 per cent from 0.5 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.1 million tonnes in the 
March quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 32 per cent from 2.5 million tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes.  The increase in 
operational waste tonnes mined was due to mining of Invincible stage 6 in the March quarter.  The decrease in capital waste tonnes was 
due to a reduction in pre-strip mining at Neptune stage 5 in the March quarter.  The strip ratio decreased from 10.6 to 3.8 driven by 
lower pre strip activity at Neptune.

Ounces mined at the total St Ives complex increased by 71 per cent from 52,200 ounces in the December quarter to 89,300 ounces in the 
March quarter due to an 83 per cent increase in overall ore tonnes mined which increased from 0.6 million tonnes in the December 
quarter to 1.1 million tonnes in the March quarter.  The difference between ounces mined and ounces produced in both quarters is due 
to the drawdown from stockpiles being partially offset by plant recoveries.

At the end of the March quarter, stockpiled Neptune high-grade oxide material amounted to 27,300 ounces (563,000 tonnes at 1.51 grams 
per tonne), Invincible amounted to 5,400 ounces (93,000 tonnes at 1.79 grams per tonne) and A5 amounted to 7,800 ounces (174,000 tonnes 
at 1.41 grams per tonne).  This compared with Neptune high-grade oxide material which amounted to 47,700 ounces (763,100 tonnes at 
1.94 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 100 ounces (2,000 tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne) and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces 
(174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne) at the end of the December quarter.  Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent 
oxide material blend.  The excess Neptune oxide material is stockpiled and fed to the mill so as to maintain the optimum blend. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 2 per cent from 1.08 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.10 million tonnes in the 
March quarter.  Yield increased by 15 per cent from 2.53 grams per tonne to 2.92 grams per tonne due to increased ore tonnes mined and 
processed with less reliance on stockpiled material.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 5 per cent from A$83 million (US$60 million) to A$87 million 
(US$62 million) mainly due to an increase in mining costs of A$5 million (US$3 million), in line with the increase in operational 
mining and reduction in pre-stripping activities in the March quarter.  The gold inventory charge to costs of A$13 million 
(US$10 million) in the March quarter compared with A$16 million (US$12 million) in the December quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from A$47 million (US$34 million) to A$35 million (US$25 million) due to lower pre-strip 
mining at the open pits and lower infrastructure spend following the completion of infrastructure fit-out at the Invincible underground 
mine in the December quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent from A$1,533 per ounce (US$1,109 per ounce) in the December 
quarter to A$1,387 per ounce (US$988 per ounce) in the March quarter due to lower capital expenditure and increased gold sold, 
partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Head grade mined decreased by 7 per cent from 6.49 grams per tonnes to 6.04 grams per tonne due to lower grade stopes mined at both 
Waroonga (FBH) and New Holland (Sheba) in the March quarter as per the mine plan.  Gold mined decreased by 9 per cent from 62,000 
ounces in the December quarter to 56,600 ounces in the March quarter.  In the March quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 
160,200 tonnes at 7.4 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 131,500 tonnes at 4.4 grams per tonne from New Holland.  This compared with 
153,800 tonnes at 8.2 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 143,600 tonnes at 4.6 grams per tonne from New Holland in the December quarter.  

Tonnes processed increased marginally from 279,800 tonnes in the December quarter to 281,000 tonnes in the March quarter.  The combined 
yield decreased by 9 per cent from 6.93 grams per tonne to 6.30 grams per tonne due to the lower grades mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 7 per cent from A$55 million (US$39 million) in the December quarter to 
A$59 million (US$42 million) in the March quarter.  The increase was due to a gold inventory charge to costs of A$5 million 
(US$4 million) in the March quarter compared with a credit of A$2 million (US$2 million) in the December quarter, partially offset by 
lower mining cost of A$3 million (US$2 million) as a result of lower operational development in the March quarter. 

Capital expenditure increased by 48 per cent from A$27 million (US$20 million) to A$40 million (US$29 million) mainly due to increased 
expenditure on a new accommodation village in the March quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 25 per cent from A$1,413 per ounce (US$1,013 per ounce) in the December 
quarter to A$1,760 per ounce (US$1,253 per ounce) in the March quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation 
and higher capital expenditure as well as lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 71,000 ounces in the December quarter to 69,300 ounces in the March quarter mainly due to 
lower tonnes processed.  

Ore mined from underground decreased by 14 per cent from 461,900 tonnes to 398,400 tonnes due to a decrease in production stoping 
fronts as a result of the geotechnically controlled mining sequence.  The impact of these mining sequence changes was accounted for in 
the 2019 guidance.  Head grade mined increased by 12 per cent from 5.15 grams per tonne in the December quarter to 5.76 grams per tonne 
in the March quarter in line with the mining sequence.  As a result, overall ounces mined decreased by 4 per cent from 76,500 ounces in 
the December quarter to 73,800 ounces in the March quarter. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 14 per cent from 463,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 398,100 tonnes in the March quarter due to 
lower ore mined.  The yield increased by 14 per cent from 4.77 grams per tonne to 5.42 grams per tonne due to higher head grade mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 10 per cent from A$61 million (US$44 million) in the December quarter 
to A$55 million (US$39 million) in the March quarter mainly due to a decrease in mining costs as a result of decreased ore mined.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$21 million (US$15 million).  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost were similar at A$1,204 per ounce (US$857 per ounce).

First gold remains scheduled for the June 2019 quarter, in line with the guidance issued in April 2018. The final forecast capital 
(FFC) cost estimate remains at A$621 million (level of accuracy range + 2 per cent/-2 per cent) as reported by the joint venture 
partners on 30 July 2018.

In accordance with the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition, Gold Fields will fund up to 10 per cent of 
costs overruns, excluding scope changes and force majeure costs.  This translates to approximately A$51 million.  Consequently, Gold 
Fields share of the FFC is A$337 million with A$264 million having been incurred up to the end of March 2019.  As at end March 2019, 
overall project construction and commissioning was 96.2 per cent complete, with EPC construction and commissioning (process plant and 
associated infrastructure) 93.9 per cent complete.

Mining activity is well under way with a further 3.5 million tonnes of waste cleared during the quarter.  First ore was mined during 
the March quarter with 0.8 million tonnes of ore at 0.8 grams per tonne stockpiled for processing in subsequent quarters.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF GOLD FIELDS 

2018 in review
2018 marked the second year of the reinvestment programme embarked on by Gold Fields at the end of 2016.  The key driver of the 
reinvestment plan was to ensure that our portfolio of mines continues to generate cash sustainably into the foreseeable future, by 
lowering group all-in costs and extending the average mine life. 

Having spent total project capital of US$502m over the past two years, primarily on Damang and Gruyere, Gold Fields is now on track to 
ensure that our international operations will be producing over 2Moz a year for the next decade.  This milestone is expected to be 
reached for the first time in 2019 as Damang grows production; Gruyere commences production and our Asanko JV contributes for the full 
year.  Gold Fields is expected to increase production by 4% to 7% in 2019.

The longer-term future of the Group also looks positive as we continue to invest in near-mine exploration at our Australian mines, 
which yet again enabled us to put back into reserves what was depleted last year and add beyond that.  A positive feasibility study for 
the Salares Norte project has been completed and a maiden reserve of 3.5Moz has been declared. 

While South Deep had a difficult year, the large scale restructuring completed at the end of 2018, places the mine on an improved 
footing from which to gradually build-up production, having removed over R800m out of our cost base and R400m of capital expenditure 
with a significantly reduced footprint.

During 2018, we have seen a continued improvement in our health and safety performance as stringent safety culture and standards become 
entrenched at our operations and projects.  Gold Fields? Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) fell below two recordable 
injuries per million hours worked for the first time in 2018, a 24% YoY improvement and the lowest level ever recorded for the Group.  
However, we still recorded one fatality last year (three in 2017), which served as a tragic reminder that we have lots more work to do 
to eliminate all fatalities and further reduce injuries.

Attributable gold equivalent production for 2018 was 2.04Moz (FY17: 2.16Moz), exceeding revised guidance of 2.00Moz.

All-in sustaining costs (AISC) and all-in costs (AIC) were US$981/oz (FY17: US$955/oz) and US$1,173/oz (FY17: US$1,088/oz), 
respectively, both below the lower end of the guidance range provided in February 2018 - AISC: US$990-1,010/oz and AIC: US$1,190-
1,210/oz.  All operations, apart from South Deep, exceeded guidance for the year, once again highlighting the quality of the portfolio, 
with these operations being higher on production and lower on costs.

Headline earnings for 2018 were US$61m or US$0.07 per share (2017: US$210m or US$0.26 per share).  Net loss for the year was US$348m or 
US$0.42 per share (2017: US$19m or US$0.02 per share). Normalised profit for the year was US$27m or US$0.03 per share (2017: US$154m or 
US$0.19 per share).

In line with our dividend policy of paying out 25% to 35% of net earnings as dividends, we declared a final dividend of 20 SA cents per 
share. This takes the total dividend for the year to 40 SA cents per share (FY 2017: 90 SA cents per share).

As expected, 2018 was another higher capital expenditure year, with a total of US$814m spent in the year given that 2018 was the peak 
year of capital spend on new projects.  As a result, the net cash outflow for the year was US$132m, compared to US$2m in 2017. Mine 
cash flow for the year, which excludes project capital, was US$334m, compared to US$441m in 2017.

Largely on the back of the net cash outflow for the year and the US$165m payment for the acquisition of the 45% in Asanko Gold Mine, 
the net debt at 31 December 2018 increased to US$1,612m, compared to US$1,303m at the end of FY 2017.  This implies a net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA of 1.45x, compared to 1.03x at the end of December 2017 and well within our covenant of 2.5x.  This increase was 
anticipated, given the significant spend on projects in 2018, however, we expect the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to reduce in 
2019.

Despite the heavy capital expenditure over the past two years, Gold Fields balance sheet remains in a comfortable position.  As the 
group continuously reviews its funding and maturity profile, it is considering opportunities to access the US$ international bond 
markets primarily to refinance its debt facilities - including potentially the US$1bn 4.875% 144A/RegS bond maturing in October 2020. 

Update on the projects
Damang Reinvestment project
The reinvestment project, which commenced on 23 December 2016, continued to track well against plan during 2018.  Total tonnes mined 
were 45.9Mt (2017: 39.7Mt) in 2018 vs. the project schedule of 41.5Mt, driven by a good performance by both of the contractors (BCM and 
E&P).  Gold produced of 180.8koz (2017: 143.6koz) was 13% higher than guidance of 160.0koz, underpinned by high-grade material from the 
Amoanda pit, while AIC of US$1,506/oz (2017: US$1,827/oz) was below guidance of US$1,520/oz. Project capital of US$125m was spent 
during 2018, on top of the US$115m spent during 2017.

The project is on track to begin sourcing higher-grade ore from the Saddle area of the DPCB early in 2019 and then reach the reef 
horizon of the main pit in early 2020.  The Amoanda pit has been the main ore source during the cutback of the main Damang pit, with 
positive grade reconciliation from Amoanda being a key driver to the outperformance of the project over the past 24 months. 

The Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF), which will provide cost effective life of mine tailings capacity of 44Mt, was 
commissioned during Q4 2017, on time and within budget. Decommissioning of the East Tailings Storage Facility (ETSF) commenced during 
Q1 2018, and was completed during 2018, with all tailings now being deposited on the FETSF.

Gruyere
During 2018, the JV partners announced a slight delay to project completion and an increase in the final forecast capital (FFC) cost 
estimate.  First gold is now expected to be poured during the June 2019 quarter (previously the March 2019 quarter) whilst the FCC 
estimate is A$621m, a 17% increase from the previous FCC estimate of A$532m. 

As at end-December 2018, engineering was largely complete, whilst construction progress was 86.7% vs. budget of 86.4%, with all major 
equipment and materials for effective construction already delivered to site.  During 2018, civil works on the tailings storage 
facility and installation of the tailings decant recovery pipelines were completed and the power station was fully commissioned.  All 
civil and concrete works for the process plant were completed by year-end, with structural steel, plate steel and tankage nearing 
completion.  Post year-end, the remaining work focused on piping, electrical and instrumentation and delivery of plant systems for 
commissioning of the plant which is expected during Q2 2019.

Mining contractor, Downer EDI, began mobilising their workforce during Q1 2018 to begin construction of the mining infrastructure.  
Mining activities commenced in November 2018, focusing on completing the pre-strip and second stage ROM pad development.  First ore 
was mined and crushed post year-end.

During 2018, A$306m (US$230m) (100% basis) was spent on the project, bringing the cumulative costs incurred as at end-December 2018 to 
A$492m (US$374m).  The remaining project capital of A$129m (US$97m) (100% basis) has been budgeted for 2019, the majority of which will 
be spent during the first half of the year. 

First gold is forecast for Q2 2019 with production of 59koz (Gold Fields 50% share) forecast for the year.  A relatively quick ramp up 
is anticipated, with steady state run rate expected by year-end.

Salares Norte
The feasibility study for the project was completed and peer reviewed during 2018.  The key elements of the feasibility study include:
-  Initial 11.5-year life of mine
-  Annual throughput of 2mt
-  Life of mine production of 4.0Moz gold equivalent which will be front-end loaded
-  Annual production of 355koz gold equivalent over life of mine (annual production of 450koz for first 7 years)
-  AISC of US$545 per gold equivalent ounce (AISC of US$465/oz for first 7 years)
-  Project capital of US$850m (+/-5%)
-  IRR of 25% at US$1,300/oz gold price with a 2.2 year payback period, from commencement of first production 
-  NPV is US$654m (discount rate 7.5%) from full notice to proceed
-  Strip ratio 13.9 (including pre-strip) and 11.7 (excluding pre-strip)

In December 2018, Gold Fields updated the project?s Mineral Resources and Reserves, reporting a total Mineral Resource of 25.6Mt of 
gold at a grade of 4.76g/t to give 3.9Moz, and 43.7Moz of silver at an average grade of 53.1g/t.  More pertinently, a maiden Reserve 
has been declared with 3.5Moz of gold (21.1Mt at 5.1g/t) and 39.3Moz of silver at 57.9g/t.

The project envisages open pit operations with a processing plant that includes both CIP and Merrill Crowe processes, due to the high 
silver content. In addition, given the scarcity of water in the area, dry stack tailings are expected to be used. 

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was accepted for review on 11 July 2018. Gold Fields anticipates the EIA review to take 
18 - 24 months to complete.  Given the declaration of the maiden reserve together with the positive results of the feasibility study, 
management is confident that the project will be developed.  However there is sufficient time to consider funding options and whether 
or not to bring in a partner to develop the asset. 

Regional performance in FY 2018
Australia
Gold Fields? Australian operations delivered another strong operational performance in 2018.  Gold production at 886koz was better than 
full year guidance of 865koz, with Granny Smith, St Ives and Agnew all outperforming both production and cost guidance.  Production was 
5% lower than in 2017 (935koz), which included three quarters of production from Darlot. AIC for the region was 4% higher YoY at 
A$1,262/oz (FY17: A$1,210/oz) but marginally higher in US$ terms at US$926/oz (FY17: US$948/oz).  The region had another strong year of 
cash generation, with net cash inflow of US$194m (FY17: US$189m), excluding Gruyere capital.

In an important development for Agnew, Gold Fields made the decision to invest in a new camp (we previously rented rooms from BHP 
Billiton in Leinster 26 km away from site) and hybrid power station on site.  The first buildings for the camp arrived on 15 December 
2018 and construction commenced in January 2019.  Commissioning of 450 rooms and the central facilities is targeted for May 2019. The 
new power station will entail a combination of gas, solar and wind power generation.  Commissioning of the gas and solar components is 
scheduled for June 2019, with wind generation to follow in Q1 2020.

West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region, which includes Asanko Gold Mine?s (AGM) contribution from 1 August 2018, 
increased 6% to 680koz (FY17: 639koz).  Excluding the AGM contribution, attributable production would have decreased by 1% to 635koz, 
however this was 4% ahead of guidance for the year.  Damang materially outperformed guidance of 160koz, producing 181koz due to 
continued outperformance from the Amoanda pit. AIC for the region decreased by 2% to US$1,098/oz (FY17: US$1,119/oz), and beat guidance 
of US$1,100/oz.  The good cost performance was mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower sustaining capital expenditure, 
partially offset by lower gold sold and higher project capital at Damang. Despite the increase in project capital at Damang (US$125m in 
FY18 vs. US$115m in FY17), the region generated net cash flow of US$24m (FY17: US$64m).

During the year, Tarkwa transitioned from owner mining to contractor mining in an attempt to address cost inflation in the region.  
The mining contract was demarcated into two zones and awarded to two local contractors: BCM for Zone 1 (Pepe, Mantraim, Atuabo and 
Teberebe Pits) and E&P for Zone 2 (Akontansi and Kottraverchy Pits).  BCM mobilised and started operations in Zone 1 on 24 March 2018, 
with E&P following in the Zone 2 area on 7 April 2018.  As part of the tender process, the contractors undertook to purchase all fleet 
from Gold Fields, which largely covered the retrenchment costs incurred through the process.

South America
Cerro Corona in Peru had another solid year in 2018, with attributable gold-equivalent production of 313koz (2017: 305koz).  This was 
12% higher than the gold-equivalent production guidance for the year of 280koz, underpinned by the higher copper price ratio and higher 
copper production due to a higher copper head grade as a result of higher grade areas mined.  AISC and AIC were US$282/oz in 2018 
compared to US$203/oz in 2017 and, on a gold equivalent basis, US$699/oz in 2018 (2017: US$673/oz).  The increase in AISC and AIC was 
primarily due to lower by-product credits, lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.  Both AISC 
and AIC comfortably beat guidance for the year of US$585/oz and, on a gold equivalent basis US$810/oz.  On the back of the strong 
operating performance, Cerro Corona generated net cash flow of US$114m (FY17: US$117m).

South Africa
South Deep got off to a tough start in 2018, with production in Q1 2018 impacted by a slow build up after the seasonal holidays, two 
labour restructuring processes that took place at the end of 2017 and during Q1 2018, and a change in the underground working shift 
arrangements implemented in an attempt to increase productivity.  In addition, low mobile equipment reliability, the intersection of 
active geological features (faults and dykes) in the high-grade corridor 3 and poor ground conditions in the even higher grade 
composites (far western part of the orebody) slowed production rates.  Production was further impacted by a 22-day DMR related safety 
stoppage during April 2018.  As a result of these factors, guidance for the mine was downgraded to 7,600kg (244koz) with the release of 
our Q1 2018 production update on 25 April 2018, from the original guidance of 10,000kg (321koz).

Despite the two restructuring processes, South Deep continued to face a number of organisational and structural challenges that 
directly affected performance during Q2 2018, with production during the quarter only marginally higher than Q1 2018 at 1,518kg 
(49koz).  As a result, on 14 August 2018, Gold Fields announced a material restructuring of the mine, to right-size the cost base to 
match existing levels of output. 

As part of the restructuring, Gold Fields served a Section 189 notice to its trade unions (the NUM and UASA) on 14 August 2018.  
The consultation period ended on 31 October 2018 and Gold Fields formally served the NUM and UASA with a list of employees that were 
to be given notice of termination as per the Section 189 process.  The majority union (NUM) embarked on a strike on 2 November 2018 
which lasted six weeks.  The NUM eventually suspended the strike on 18 December 2018 and signed a settlement agreement.  Through the 
restructuring, a total of 1,092 permanent employees exited the business, of which 904 were retrenched, 183 opted for voluntary 
separation packages and five resigned. Gold Fields also reduced its underground fleet through the restructuring, with the aim of 
decongesting the working areas.  In this regard, the number of Cat 1 machines was reduced by 33% from 98 to 66 (drill rigs, loaders 
and trucks).  

Given the slow start to the year together with the impacts of the strike with very little production in Q4 2018, South Deep?s 
production decreased 44% YoY to 4,885kg (157koz) and was 36% below revised guidance of 7,600kg (244koz). AIC of R854,049/kg were also 
significantly higher than expected (guidance: R540,000/kg) underpinned by the significantly lower amount of gold sold during the year.  
The mine recorded a net cash outflow of R1,891m (US$141m) which includes R148m in retrenchment payments. 

In the wake of the restructuring, which has seen our employee workforce fall by 38% from 3,983 to 2,460 and the number of contractors 
from 2,294 to 1,725, we are in a position to significantly reduce South Deep?s pre-restructuring cash-burn during 2019.  We expect to 
build-up gradually to a sustainable production profile from this restructured position.  The key enablers for sustainable improvements 
at South Deep are:
-  Accelerate backfill placement
-  More robust and timely ground support
-  Improved drill and blast to improve stope design and reduce underbreak and overbreak
-  Improved fleet availability and utilisation
-  Flatter organisational structure
-  Rigorous performance management linked to line of sight performance
-  Improved stakeholder management, including government, unions and surrounding communities. 

Asanko JV
In March 2018, Gold Fields entered into an agreement to form a 50:50 incorporated joint venture (JV) with Asanko Gold. In the deal 
which went unconditional on 31 July 2018, Gold Fields acquired a 50% stake in Asanko Gold Ghana?s 90% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine 
(AGM), associated properties and exploration rights in Ghana.  While Asanko remains operators of the asset, a JV committee has been 
established in which Gold Fields actively contributes from a geotechnical, modelling and planning perspective. 

The purchase consideration included an upfront payment of US$165m and a deferred payment of US$20m payable on the earlier of an agreed 
Esaase development milestone or 31 December 2019. In addition, Gold Fields purchased 9.9% of Asanko Gold?s issued equity through a 
private placement for a total consideration on US$17.6m.

During 2018, AGM produced 223koz (100% basis) at an AISC of US$1,069/oz and AIC of US$1,175/oz. Guidance for 2019 is 225,000oz to 
245,000oz (100% basis) at AISC of US$1,040/oz to US$1,060/oz and AIC of US$1,090/oz to US$1,110/oz.  Included in the guidance is first 
production from oxide material from the Esaase deposit which will be trucked to the processing plant.

Mineral Reserves 
Gold Fields has increased its focus on growing its Reserve base outside of South Africa. During 2018, there were some significant 
developments in this regard, including:
-  A maiden gold equivalent reserve of 4.0Moz was declared at Salares Norte in Chile
-  There was a 0.3Moz (4% YoY) increase in the Australian region?s reserves, net of depletion.  Notably, this includes an 11% YoY 
   increase in St Ives? reserves net of depletion
-  There was a net decrease of 4.6Moz at South Deep due to geotechnical re-design, adjusted loss factors and an increased cut-off 
   grade

As at end-2018, 20.5Moz of Gold Fields? Reserves (excluding Gold Fields? 45% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine) were outside South 
Africa, representing 41% of the Group?s Reserve base.

Eskom power crisis
We note that Eskom is in a crisis, placing the whole country at risk. While there is no silver bullet, we want security of supply 
restored, especially for the mining industry.  South Deep is currently operating below capacity, which does provide the mine with 
some flexibility on power usage. We have short, medium and long-term strategies in place to mitigate the risk, including, scheduling 
of activities, additional off-grid power and longer term renewables. We continue to engage through industrial associations to provide 
assistance where possible.

2019 outlook and guidance
2019 is set to be an important year for Gold Fields, with the Damang project approaching completion and Gruyere commencing production. 
In addition, Asanko will contribute for a full year for the first time since acquisition.  This will allow the Group to increase 
production by 4 - 7% in 2019.  This also means that our capital expenditure will fall quite aggressively through 2019 and the amount 
of project capex reduces.  The year will however, be one of two halves, with both production and cash flow being weighted to 2H 2019. 

For 2019, Gold Fields has undertaken certain gold price hedging, in order to secure short-term cash flow and protect the balance sheet 
from the volatility of the gold price as we complete our investment phase and ramp up the projects.

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2019 is expected to be between 2.13Moz and 2.18Moz.  AISC is expected to be 
between US$980/oz and US$995/oz.  AIC is planned to be between US$1,075/oz and US$1,095/oz.  These expectations assume exchange rates 
of R/US$:13.80 and A$/US$:0.75.

Production for South Deep is expected to be 6,000kg (193koz), with AIC of R610,000/kg (US$1,372/oz). 

Capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$633m. Sustaining capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$490m and growth 
capital expenditure is planned at US$143m.  The US$143m growth capital expenditure comprises US$69m for Damang and A$99m (US$74m) for 
Gruyere.  Expenditure on Salares Norte is expected to be US$57m in 2019.  The capital expenditure above excludes the Group?s share of 
Asanko?s total capital expenditure of US$25m for 2019.

RESULTS FOR THE GROUP 

Safety
Sadly, South Deep recorded a fatality during October 2018 which was a machine related incident.  This is the first fatality South Deep 
has recorded since February 2017 and was also the only fatality reported for the Group in 2018.  The Group?s fatality injury frequency 
rate improved from 0.05 in 2017 to 0.02 in 2018.  The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group improved by 24 per 
cent from 2.42 in 2017 to 1.83 in 2018, the best achieved by the Group.

The strategy of the Group will focus on eliminating fatalities and serious injuries.  In addition, an increased focus is being put on 
leading indicators to take safety to the next level, including increased visible leadership, reporting and close out of hazards and 
full roll out of critical control management through design, engineering and procedural control, as well as behaviour change. 

The CEO, executives and senior managers from all regions met in October 2018 to develop a group-wide safety strategy.  While the 
details are being fine-tuned, it was agreed that the strategy?s pillars should be: safety leadership, safe behaviour and systems and 
processes.  The forum agreed that implementing a courageous safety leadership programme would refocus and strengthen our safety efforts 
and complement existing programmes.  Stuart Matthews, our Group Head of Australia, will be responsible for leading this global effort 
to finalise and guide the strategy?s group-wide rollout. 

1  Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically 
   Treated Injuries4) x 1,000,000/ number of man-hours worked.
2  A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend work for a period 
   of one or more days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform any functions.
3  A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the employee or 
   contractor being unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the day after the injury 
   occurred. The employee or contractor can still perform some of his duties.
4  A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which does not incapacitate that 
   employee and who, after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately resume his/her normal duties on the next 
   calendar day, immediately following the treatment/re-treatment.


FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017

Revenue
Attributable equivalent gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 2.160 million ounces in 2017 to 2.036 million ounces in 2018, 
almost exclusively due to the decline in production at South Deep.  

Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, decreased by 44 per cent from 8,748 kilograms (281,300 ounces) to 4,885 kilograms 
(157,100 ounces).

Attributable gold production at the West African operations increased by 6 per cent from 639,000 ounces in 2017 to 679,700 ounces in 
2018 due to higher production at Damang as well as the inclusion of 44,500 ounces from Asanko for the five months ending December 2018.  
This was partially offset by lower production at Tarkwa.  Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru increased by 
2 per cent from 305,200 ounces in 2017 to 312,500 ounces in 2018.  Gold production at the Australian operations decreased by 5 per cent 
from 934,600 ounces in 2017 to 886,400 ounces in 2018 due to marginally lower production at Agnew and Granny Smith, partially offset by 
higher production at St Ives but mainly due to the exclusion of Darlot in 2018.  The 934,600 ounces in 2017, included 39,200 ounces for 
nine months only at the discontinued operation, Darlot.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep decreased by 44 per cent from 8,748 kilograms (281,300 ounces) in 2017 to 
4,885 kilograms (157,100 ounces) in 2018 due to decreased volumes and grades.  This was mainly due to the industrial action, the 
restructuring process as well as the fatal accident, further exacerbated by poor ground conditions in the high grade areas of the mine.

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa decreased by 7 per cent from 566,400 ounces in 2017 to 524,900 ounces in 
2018 mainly due to lower volumes mined in line with the 2018 planned strategy to reduce mining and optimise margins and cash flow.  
At Damang, managed gold production increased by 26 per cent from 143,600 ounces in 2017 to 180,800 ounces in 2018 mainly due to higher 
head grade and yield.  Production at Asanko amounted to 44,500 ounces for the 5 months ended December 2018.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona increased by 2 per cent from 306,700 ounces in 
2017 to 314,100 ounces in 2018 mainly due to the higher copper price relative to the gold price (price factor) and higher copper 
production as a result of higher copper head grade.  

At the Australia region, St Ives? gold production increased by 1 per cent from 363,900 ounces in 2017 to 366,900 ounces in 2018.  
At Agnew, gold production decreased by 1 per cent from 241,200 ounces in 2017 to 239,100 ounces in 2018 mainly due to decreased ore 
processed.  At Granny Smith, gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 290,300 ounces in 2017 to 280,400 ounces in 2018 due to lower 
grades mined.  In 2017, gold production at Darlot amounted to 39,200 ounces for the nine months to September 2017.

The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group decreased marginally from US$1,255 per equivalent ounce in 2017 to US$1,251 per 
equivalent ounce in 2018.  The average rand gold price decreased by 1 per cent from R538,344 per kilogram to R531,253 per kilogram.  
The average Australian dollar gold price increased by 3 per cent from A$1,640 per ounce to A$1,694 per ounce.  The average US dollar 
gold price for the Ghanaian operations (including Asanko) increased by 1 per cent from US$1,255 per ounce in 2017 to US$1,265 per ounce 
in 2018.  The average equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment and refining charges, for Cerro Corona decreased by 6 per cent 
from US$1,252 per equivalent ounce in 2017 to US$1,174 per equivalent ounce in 2018.  The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate 
strengthened by 1 per cent from R13.33 in 2017 to R13.20 in 2018.  The average Australian/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 3 per 
cent from A$1.00 = US$0.77 in 2017 to A$1.00 = US$0.75 in 2018.

Revenue decreased by 7 per cent from US$2,762 million in 2017 to US$2,578 million in 2018 due to the lower ounces sold.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation
Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 1 per cent from US$1,357 million in 2017 to US$1,375 million in 2018. 

At the South Africa region, at South Deep, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 12 per cent from 
R4,062 million (US$305 million) in 2017 to R3,586 million (US$272 million) in 2018 mainly due to lower production as a result of 
industrial action, lower expenditure on consumables, contractors, labour and utility costs, partially offset by a R127 million 
(US$10 million) gold inventory charge to cost in 2018 compared with a credit to cost of R21 million (US$2 million) in 2017.

At the West Africa region, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 10 per cent from US$428 million in 2017 to 
US$471 million in 2018.  At Tarkwa, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 1 per cent from US$306 million to 
US$309 million due to a gold-in-process charge to cost, partially offset by lower mining costs in line with lower operational tonnes 
mined.  The US$10 million gold-in-process charge to costs in 2018 compared with a credit to costs of US$42 million in 2017.  In 2017, 
higher volumes were mined and stockpiled.  At Damang, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 2 per cent from 
US$122 million in 2017 to US$124 million in 2018 mainly due to higher operating tonnes mined, partially offset by a gold-in-process 
credit to costs of US$19 million in 2018 compared with a charge to costs of US$1 million in 2017.  Cost of sales before amortisation 
and depreciation at Asanko amounted to US$37 million in 2018.

At the South America region, at Cerro Corona, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased marginally from 
US$154 million in 2017 to US$155 million in 2018 mainly due to higher tonnes mined in 2018.

At the Australia region, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 13 per cent from A$613 million 
(US$469 million) in 2017 to A$690 million (US$516 million) in 2018.  At St Ives, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, 
increased by 20 per cent from A$207 million (US$159 million) in 2017 to A$249 million (US$186 million) in 2018 mainly due to increased 
underground mining cost as a result of increased ore tonnes mined, less cheaper open pit tonnes mined, increased processing maintenance 
cost and a lower gold inventory credit to costs. 

At Agnew, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 10 per cent from A$197 million (US$150 million) in 2017 to 
A$216 million (US$162 million) in 2018 mainly due to increased mining cost and a gold-in-process charge to cost of A$2 million 
(US$2 million) in 2018 compared with a credit to costs of A$6 million (US$5 million) in 2017.  At Granny Smith, cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation, increased by 7 per cent from A$210 million (US$160 million) in 2017 to A$225 million (US$168 million) 
in 2018 mainly due to increased mining cost as a result of mining deeper zones.

Amortisation and depreciation
Amortisation and depreciation for the Group decreased by 11 per cent from US$748 million in 2017 to US$668 million in 2018.  
This decrease was mainly due to the increase in reserves at Cerro Corona in line with the life extension and at South Deep due to 
lower production. 

Other
Net interest expense for the Group increased by 6 per cent from US$63 million in 2017 to US$67 million in 2018.  Interest expense of 
US$92 million was partially offset by interest income of US$8 million and interest capitalised of US$17 million.  In 2017 interest 
expense of US$92 million was partially offset by interest income of US$6 million and interest capitalised of US$23 million.

The share of equity accounted losses increased from US$1 million in 2017 to US$13 million in 2018 mainly due to the US$12 million 
write-off of deferred costs and other non-recoverable amounts at Far Southeast project (FSE) as well as a loss of US$1 million related 
to the Group?s share of equity accounted loss on Asanko.  

The gain on foreign exchange of US$6 million in 2018 compared with a loss of US$4 million in 2017.  These gains and losses on foreign 
exchange related to the conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies.

The gain on financial instruments decreased by 38 per cent from US$34 million 2017 to US$21 million 2018. In 2018, the US$21 million 
comprised US$17 million on hedges and US$4 million on the mark to market on warrants.  The US$17 million included US$54 million 
realised gains, partially offset by US$37 million unrealised losses.  The gold hedge gains are analysed as follows: at the Australian 
operations (a loss of US$5 million/A$5 million), the Ghanaian operations (a gain of US$22 million) and South Deep (a loss of 
US$3 million/R43 million).  It also included realised and unrealised gains and losses on the oil hedges taken out at the Ghanaian and 
Australian operations (a gain of US$2 million and US$1 million/A$2 million, respectively), as well as the copper hedge taken out at 
Cerro Corona (gain of US$9 million).  In addition, a currency hedge taken out at the Australian operations resulted in a loss of 
US$9 million (A$12 million). 

Share-based payments for the Group increased by 41 per cent from US$27 million in 2017 to US$38 million in 2018 and related to the 
current valuation of the share scheme and changes in its composition.  Long-term employee benefits decreased by 80 per cent from 
US$5 million to US$1 million due to the current valuation of the plan. 

Other costs for the Group increased by 25 per cent from US$44 million to US$55 million. 

Exploration and project costs
Exploration and project costs decreased by 5 per cent from US$110 million in 2017 to US$104 million in 2018 mainly due a decrease in 
the write-off of brownfields exploration costs at the Australian operations from A$64 million (US$48 million) in 2017 to A$51 million 
(US$38 million) in 2018, partially offset by an increase in expenditure at Salares Norte from US$53 million in 2017 to US$61 million in 
2018.  The write-off of brownfields exploration is a non-cash item.  The balance of US$5 million mainly related to various exploration 
office costs.

Non-recurring items
Non-recurring expenses of US$633 million in 2018 compared with US$224 million in 2017. 

The non-recurring expenses for 2018 included:
-  impairment of R6.471 billion (US$482 million) in respect of the South Deep cash-generating unit.  The after tax impairment was 
   R4.819 billion (US$359 million).  The impairment was recognised in June 2018 and given that impairment indicators still existed at 
   31 December 2018, a further impairment assessment was performed.  

There were no further impairments at 31 December 2018 using the following assumptions:
   -  Gold price of R525,000 per kilogram for 2019 and R550,000 per kilogram thereafter;
   -  Reserve ounces used in discounted cash flow of 32.4 million ounces;
   -  Resource price of US$17 per ounce at a Rand/US dollar exchange rate of R14.63;
   -  Resource ounces of 24.5 million ounces;
   -  Life of mine 75 years; and
   -  Nominal discount rate of 13.5 per cent. 
-  restructuring costs at Tarkwa (US$89 million) with the transition to contractor mining;
-  restructuring costs at Damang (US$14 million);
-  restructuring costs at South Deep (US$11 million/R148 million);
-  losses on the sale of mining fleet and heavy machinery equipment and inventory at Tarkwa as part of the transition to contractor 
   mining, amounted to US$38 million and US$9 million, respectively; 
-  silicosis provision adjustment (US$5 million/R60 million); 
-  loss on sale of APP (US$15 million); 
-  impairment of FSE of US$37 million.  The impairment of FSE was based on the fair value less cost of disposal of the investment which 
   was directly derived from the market value of Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company; and
-  Gain on the acquisition of Asanko Gold mine of US$52 million.

The non-recurring expenses in 2017 included mainly:
-  Cash generating unit impairment of R3.495 billion (US$278 million) at South Deep.  The impairment calculation is based on the 2017 
   life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
   -  Gold price decreased from a long-term R600,000 per kilogram to R525,000 per kilogram;
   -  Resource price decreased from R842 per ounce to R216 per ounce due to a decrease in the dollar price per ounce from US$60 per 
      ounce to US$17 per ounce and a stronger Rand/Dollar exchange rate from R14.03 to R12.58.  This was partially offset by an 
      increase in resource ounces of 3.8 million ounces from 25.2 million ounces to 29.0 million ounces;
   -  Life of mine: 77 years; and
   -  Discount rate: 13.5 per cent nominal.

The above assumptions do not affect the steady state production target of circa 500,000 ounces by 2022.  
-  Silicosis provision raised (US$30 million);
-  Write-off of parked fleet at Tarkwa (US$7 million);
-  Retrenchment costs (US$9 million) mainly at Tarkwa (US$5 million), South Deep (US$2 million) and Damang (US$2 million); 
-  Write-off of Damang assets (US$3 million); and
-  Impairment of investments (US$4 million).

This was partially offset by:
-  Reversal of cash-generating unit impairment: gross US$53 million, tax US$15 million, net US$38 million at Cerro Corona.  The 
   impairment calculation is based on the 2017 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
   -  Gold price 2018: US$1,200 per ounce, 2019 onwards: US$1,300 per ounce;
   -  Copper price 2018: US$2.50 per pound, 2019 onwards: US$2.80 per pound;
   -  Resource price: US$41 per ounce;
   -  Life of mine: 13 years; and 
   -  Discount rate: 4.8 per cent.

The reversal of the impairment is due to a higher net present value as a result of the completion of a pre-feasibility study in 2017 
extending the life of mine from 2023 to 2030 by optimising the tailings density and increasing tailings capacity by using in-pit 
tailings after mining activities end.
-  Reversal of the APP impairment (US$39 million); 
-  Profit on the sale of Darlot (US$24 million/A$31 million); and
-  Lower rehabilitation provisions of US$13 million mainly at St Ives due to a new mine closure plan (A$15 million/US$11 million).

Royalties
Government royalties for the Group increased marginally from US$62 million in 2017 to US$63 million in 2018.

Taxation
The taxation credit for the Group of US$66 million in 2018 compared with a charge of US$173 million in 2017.  Normal taxation decreased 
from US$205 million to US$146 million.  The deferred tax credit of US$212 million in 2018 compared with US$32 million in 2017. 

The significant deferred tax credit arose due to the taxation credit of R1.652 billion (US$123 million) on the impairment of South 
Deep.  In addition, as a result of the settlement of the South Deep tax dispute, Gold Fields has recognised an additional 
R2.708 billion (US$205 million) of capital allowances with a tax effect of R812 million (US$62 million). 

Discontinued operation - Darlot
The net loss in 2017 from the discontinued operation, Darlot, net of tax of US$13 million was a result of revenue of A$64 million 
(US$49 million), cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation of A$62 million (US$47 million) with the balance relating to other 
costs.  The revenue of A$64 million (US$49 million) related to 39,200 ounces sold at a gold price of A$1,637 per ounce (US$1,252 per 
ounce).

Loss/profit 
Net loss attributable to owners of the parent of US$348 million or US$0.42 per share in 2018 compared with a loss US$19 million or 
US$0.02 per share in 2017.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$61 million or US$0.07 per share in 2018 compared with headline earnings 
of US$210 million or US$0.26 per share in 2017. 

Normalised profit of US$27 million or US$0.03 per share in 2018 compared with US$154 million or US$0.19 per share in 2017. 

Normalised profit
Normalised profit reconciliation for the Group is calculated as follows:
                                                                          Year ended

Normalised profit is considered an important measure by Gold Fields of the profit realised by the Group in the ordinary course of 
operations.  In addition, it forms the basis of the dividend pay-out policy.  Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are 
considered as pro forma financial information as per the JSE Listing Requirements.  The pro forma financial information is the 
responsibility of the Group?s Board of Directors and is presented for illustration purposes only and because of its nature, normalised 
profit should not be considered as a representation of earnings.  

This pro forma financial information has been reported on by KPMG Inc. in terms of ISAE 3420 and their unmodified report is available 
for inspection on the Gold Fields website (http://www.goldfields.com).  

Cash flow 
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$613 million in 2018 compared with US$832 million in 2017, a 26 per cent decrease due to 
lower gold sold and higher restructuring costs.  

Dividends paid/advanced of US$55 million in 2018 compared with US$69 million in 2017.  Dividends paid to owners of the parent decreased 
from US$63 million in 2017 to US$46 million in 2018.  Dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders of US$10 million in 2018 
compared with US$6 million in 2017.  

Cash outflow from investing activities decreased from US$909 million in 2017 to US$896 million in 2018 due to a decrease in sustaining 
capital expenditure mainly at South Deep, Tarkwa and St Ives, partially offset by an increase in growth capital expenditure at Gruyere, 
Damang and South Deep.  Capital expenditure decreased from US$834 million in 2017 to US$814 million in 2018 due to lower sustaining 
capital expenditure as planned.  Growth expenditure of US$125 million was incurred on the Damang reinvestment project and A$180 million 
(US$134 million) was incurred on Gruyere.  In accordance with the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of acquisition, 
Gold Fields will fund up to 10 per cent of the cost overrun, excluding scope changes and force majeure costs.  The Gruyere overruns of 
10 per cent will be funded in 2019.  This compared with growth expenditure of US$115 million on the Damang reinvestment project and 
A$106 million (US$81 million) on Gruyere.  Proceeds on disposal of assets of US$79 million in 2018 compared with US$23 million in 2017 
and related to disposal of assets as part of the conversion to contractor mining at Tarkwa in 2018 and Damang in 2017.  Purchase of 
investments of US$19 million in 2018 compared with US$80 million in 2017.  In 2018, it related mainly to the purchase of shares in 
Asanko.  

Purchase of Asanko of US$165 million related to the Joint Venture transaction with Asanko Gold (Asanko) which was completed on 
31 July 2018.  Gold Fields acquired a 50 per cent stake in Asanko?s 90 per cent interest in the Asanko Gold mine in Ghana.  

Proceeds on disposal of assets held for sale of US$40 million in 2018 related to the sale of APP.

Cash outflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure, environmental payments and finance lease payments of 
US$132 million in 2018 compared with an outflow of US$2 million in 2017.  The US$132 million outflow in 2018 comprised: US$191 million 
net cash generated by the seven mining operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less 
US$77 million of net interest paid, US$77 million for exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields 
exploration which is included in the US$191 million above), US$163 million (AS$218 million) at Gruyere [capital expenditure of 
US$134 million (A$180 million) and an investment into working capital of US$29 million (A$38 million), mainly due to timing of cash 
calls from the EPC contractor], as well as US$6 million on non-mine based costs.  Included in the US$191 million above is 
US$125 million capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project and US$18 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure. 
If these two amounts are excluded, then the mining operations generated US$334 million in net cash.  Adding back the negative 
US$141 million for South Deep, the core international operations generated US$475 million. 

The US$2 million outflow in 2017 comprised: US$309 million net cash generated by the seven mining operations (after royalties, taxes, 
capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$72 million of net interest paid, US$58 million for exploration mainly at 
Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which is included in the US$309 million above), US$141 million 
(A$184 million) at Gruyere [capital expenditure of US$81 million (A$106 million) and an investment into working capital of 
US$60 million (A$78 million), mainly due to cash calls on the balance of the deferred payment balance and stamp duty], as well as 
US$40 million on non-mine based costs.  Included in the US$309 million above is US$115 million capital expenditure on the Damang 
reinvestment project and US$17 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure. If these two amounts are excluded, then the mining 
operations generated US$441 million. 

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure decreased from R1,099 million (US$82 million) in 2017 to R770 million 
(US$58 million) in 2018 mainly due to lower expenditure on fleet and surface infrastructure. 

At the West Africa region, (excluding Asanko), capital expenditure decreased from US$313 million to US$295 million.  At Tarkwa, 
capital expenditure decreased from US$181 million to US$156 million due to lower capital waste stripping and lower fleet expenditure 
as a consequence of the revised optimised life of mine plan and the conversion from owner mining to contractor mining.  Capital 
expenditure at Damang increased from US$132 million to US$139 million mainly due to higher expenditure on the Damang reinvestment 
project (US$125 million).  

Capital expenditure at Asanko amounted to US$13 million for the 5 months ended December 2018.  The Asanko capital expenditure is not 
included in the Group capital expenditure.

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased from US$34 million to US$33 million mainly due to lower 
expenditure on the construction of the tailings dam and waste storage facilities.

At the Australia region, capital expenditure decreased from A$414 million (US$317 million) in 2017 to A$373 million (US$279 million) 
in 2018.  At St Ives, capital expenditure decreased from A$204 million (US$156 million) in 2017 to A$170 million (US$127 million) in 
2018 due to lower expenditure at the open pits following completion of activities at Invincible open pit stage 5.  At Agnew, capital 
expenditure increased from A$96 million (US$74 million) in 2017 to A$98 million (US$73 million) in 2018.  At Granny Smith, capital 
expenditure decreased from A$114 million (US$87 million) in 2017 to A$105 million (US$79 million) in 2018 due to completion of the 
VR8 ventilation shaft in 2017.  

Capital expenditure at the discontinued operation, Darlot, amounted to A$9 million (US$7 million) in 2017.  

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$257 million in 2018 compared with US$84 million in 2017.  The inflow in 2018 related 
to a drawdown of US$692 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$432 million on offshore and local loans and US$3 million from 
finance lease payments.  The inflow in 2017 related to a drawdown of US$780 million, partially offset by the repayment of 
US$696 million on offshore and local loans.

The net cash outflow for the Group of US$72 million in 2018 compared with US$62 million in 2017.  The cash balance of US$400 million 
in 2018 compared with US$479 million in 2017. 

All-in sustaining and total all-in cost
The Group all-in sustaining costs increased by 3 per cent from US$955 per ounce in 2017 to US$981 per ounce in 2018 mainly due to 
lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower sustaining capital expenditure.  
Total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from US$1,088 per ounce in 2017 to US$1,173 per ounce in 2018 for the same reasons as for 
all-in sustaining costs and due to higher non-sustaining capital expenditure and higher exploration, feasibility and evaluation costs. 

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs increased by 41 per cent from R574,406 per kilogram (US$1,340 per 
ounce) to R807,688 per kilogram (US$1,903 per ounce) mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation and lower sustaining capital expenditure.  The total all-in cost increased by 42 per cent from 
R600,109 per kilogram (US$1,400 per ounce) to R854,049 per kilogram (US$2,012 per ounce) due to the same reasons as for all-in 
sustaining costs as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure. 

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 3 per cent from US$958 per ounce in 2017 to US$926 per ounce in 2018 
mainly due to higher gold sold and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation 
and depreciation.  Results for Asanko were included for 5 months in 2018.  Total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from US$1,119 per 
ounce in 2017 to US$1,098 per ounce in 2018 due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs and higher non-sustaining capital 
expenditure of US$125 million on the Damang reinvestment project and US$5 million at Asanko.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 39 per cent from US$203 per ounce to US$282 per 
ounce mainly due to lower gold sold, lower by-product credits, and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially 
offset by lower capital expenditure.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 4 per cent from 
US$673 per equivalent ounce to US$699 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above as well as lower equivalent ounces 
sold.

At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 4 per cent from A$1,210 per ounce (US$926 per 
ounce) in 2017 to A$1,262 per ounce (US$943 per ounce) in 2018 mainly due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation 
and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure. 

Statement of financial position
Net debt (borrowings plus the current portion of borrowings less cash and cash equivalents) increased from US$1,303 million for the

Regrettably, a tragic accident occurred on 12 October 2018 fatally injuring Mr. Ananias Mosololi.  The mine was issued with a Section 
54 instruction, halting mobile machinery and secondly to conduct an investigation.  A partial upliftment was issued on 18 October 2018 
with a full upliftment on 31 October 2018.  18 days of production was either lost or significantly impacted.  The fatality occurred 
shortly after the mine had achieved 2 million fatality free shifts following 18 months of being fatality free.

South Deep embarked on a restructuring process on 14 August 2018 as reported in the September quarter.  The prescribed consultation 
process was concluded on 28 October 2018 culminating in the retrenchment of 1,092 permanent employee?s and 420 contractors.  The 
majority union, the NUM, obtained a certificate of non-resolution from the CCMA and issued a notice of intended industrial action on 
31 October 2018.  The protected industrial action commenced on 2 November 2018 and lasted 6 weeks.  Employees participating in the 
industrial action blocked all roads to the mine, limiting access and the ability to continue with any mining operations. Production was 
therefore suspended and essential services continued on an intermittent basis when access was possible.  Negotiations with all levels 
of the union (branch, regional and national) concluded on 18 December 2018 with the signing of a new agreement that ended the 
industrial action.  The mine gradually resumed operations from 15 December 2018.  The process had a profound impact on production with 
the operations suspended for 41 days with a preceding ""go slow"" and acts of sabotage as from the announcement of restructuring.  It 
took an additional 8 days to start-up the underground sections post 15 December 2018. 

Gold production decreased by 44 per cent from 8,748 kilograms (281,248 ounces) in 2017 to 4,885 kilograms (157,043 ounces) in 2018 due 
to decreased volumes. In addition to the above-mentioned incidences, production in 2018 was impacted by extensive rehabilitation work 
in the main access ramps during the year as well as a management restructuring process conducted in the March 2018 quarter.  Production 
was also impacted by geotechnical constraints (associated with the previous low profile destress cuts which were converted to high 
profile crush pillar design) and exacerbated by geological features in front of these cuts (Fargo 2 fault in corridor 4 and the Gray 
ghost dyke on corridor 3).  These pillars were deteriorating faster than anticipated, causing seismicity and increasingly difficult 
stoping and backfilling conditions.  A faster stoping sequence was designed to manage the deteriorating ground conditions.  To enable 
mining to progress in corridor 3, a bracket pillar was designed around the Grey ghost dyke.  Destress is planned to commence on the 
opposite side of the pillar, but in the process 92,000 ounces of gold reserves were sterilised.  Geotechnical conditions are expected 
to improve once we transition away from the low profile cuts and old pillar design. 

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 35 per cent from 1.61 million tonnes in 2017 to 1.04 million tonnes in 2018.  Underground 
ore tonnes mined decreased by 41 per cent from 1.42 million tonnes in 2017 to 0.84 million tonnes in 2018.  Underground reef grade 
increased by 3 per cent from 5.89 grams per tonne to 6.04 grams per tonne in 2018.  Underground waste mined increased by 6 per cent 
from 188,670 tonnes to 200,492 tonnes as a result of increased footwall infrastructure, capital waste development and development to 
establish infrastructure for new destress cuts.  Gold mined from underground decreased by 40 per cent from 8,364 kilograms 
(268,900 ounces) to 5,048 kilograms (162,300 ounces).  Underground grade mined (ore and waste) decreased by 6 per cent from 5.20 grams 
per tonne in 2017 to 4.87 grams per tonne in 2018 as a result of ore tonnes mined as a percentage of total tonnes mined decreasing from 
88 per cent to 81 per cent. 

Total tonnes milled decreased by 37 per cent from 2.08 million tonnes in 2017 to 1.32 million tonnes in 2018.  Underground ore tonnes 
milled decreased by 44 per cent from 1.48 million tonnes in 2017 to 0.83 million tonnes in 2018.  Underground waste milled increased by 
27 per cent from 165,000 tonnes to 210,000 tonnes.  Surface tailings material treated decreased by 35 per cent from 433,408 tonnes to 
281,607 tonnes.  Underground reef yield decreased slightly from 5.87 grams per tonne to 5.85 grams per tonne. 

Development decreased by 27 per cent from 6,897 metres in 2017 to 5,047 metres in 2018.  New mine capital development (phase one, sub 
95 level) increased by 1 per cent from 976 metres in 2017 to 988 metres in 2018.  Capital footwall development on 100 level and below 
was suspended during the restructuring process in the September quarter, as it was ahead of schedule.  On reef-plane stope access 
development and destress cut access development decreased by 31 per cent from 5,921 metres in 2017 to 4,059 metres in 2018 due to the 
suspension of development activities in 87 1W and 2W in the September quarter.  The suspension of activities in the section formed part 
of the restructuring process. Destress attributable square metres mined decreased by 44 per cent from 33,419 square metres in 2017 to 
18,793 square metres in 2018 due to the implementation of a new support standard and related backlog catch-up together with negotiation 
of geological features as well as a result of the industrial action from the restructuring process.  

Longhole stoping volume mined decreased by 40 per cent from 766,857 tonnes in 2017 to 463,348 tonnes in 2018 mainly due to the backfill 
leakages in the stopes, restructuring, as well as the industrial action.  

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 55 per cent of the ore tonnes in 2018, while the new mine (North of Wrench) 
contributed 45 per cent.

The mine implemented six key focus areas through a business improvement framework to drive improved performance and a number of 
supporting initiatives and projects are being initiated.  The six focus areas are:
-  Enabling Visible Felt Leadership (PVFL); 
-  Reinvigorating our leadership system;
-  Improving face time;
-  Effective face time
-  Enabling logistics; and 
-  Implementing of innovation and technology.

These initiatives have started to yield positive results, notably, a 45 per cent improvement in total recordable injury rates as well 
as a reduction on the lost time injuries.  In addition, there has been a marginal and steady improvement in the reliability of 
equipment (high profile rigs in particular), improvement in the shaft schedule arrangements and improvements in excavation quality and 
face advance. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 12 per cent from R4,062 million (US$305 million) in 2017 to 
R3,586 million (US$272 million) in 2018.  The decrease was mainly due to lower production exacerbated by the industrial action in the 
December quarter.  Cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciation decreased by 15 per cent from 
R4,083 million (US$306 million) in 2017 to R3,459 million (US$262 million) in 2018 due to the industrial action in November and 
December 2018.  The re-setting of the fixed cost base through the restructuring that amounted to R148 million (paid as separation 
packages) is planned to realise savings of ~R600 million in 2018 terms on the labour bill in 2019 (If the restructuring did not take 
place, the labour bill for 2019 would have been R1.9 billion against the current plan of R1.3 billion).  Consumable costs decreased as 
a result of tighter cost management through the implementation of bills of material on mining consumables and standards and norms on 
metallurgical plant consumables.  Contractor costs decreased as a result of the completion of the artisan training by various business 
partners in 2017.  Labour costs decreased due to the restructuring in 2018, control around overtime and fixed allowances and lower 
bonuses paid as a result of lower production.  Utilities were lower year on year as a result of lower production and lower consumption 
during the strike period in the December 2018 quarter.  This was partially offset by a gold inventory charge to cost of R127 million 
(US$10 million) in 2018 compared with a gold inventory credit to cost of R21 million (US$2 million) in 2017.  

Capital expenditure decreased by 30 per cent from R1,099 million (US$82 million) in 2017 to R770 million (US$58 million) in 2018.  

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 40 per cent from R874 million (US$66 million) in 2017 to R528 million (US$40 million) in 
2018 mainly due to lower spend on fleet, and surface infrastructure.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent from 
R225 million (US$17 million) to R242 million (US$18 million) due to higher expenditure on new mine development infrastructure and more 
metres developed compared to 2017.   

All-in sustaining costs increased by 41 per cent from R574,406 per kilogram (US$1,340 per ounce) in 2017 to R807,688 per kilogram 
(US$1,903 per ounce) in 2018 mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower sustaining capital expenditure and lower cost 
of sales before amortisation and depreciation. 

Total all-in cost increased by 42 per cent from R600,109 per kilogram (US$1,400 per ounce) in 2017 to R854,049 per kilogram 
(US$2,012 per ounce) in 2018 due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as higher non-sustaining capital 
expenditure.  

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 6,000 kilograms (193,000 ounces) of which 99,615 ounces of gold were hedged at an average price of R616,581 per 
   kilogram
-  Destress square metres ~ 30,000 square meters
-  Development metres ~ 6,182 meters 
-  Sustaining capital expenditure ~ R490 million (US$36 million), reduction of R280 million (US$21 million) compared with 2018;

-  Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation ~ R3.2 billion (US$238 million), reduction of R600 million (US$75 million) 
   compared with 2018, which includes a planned labour bill decrease of ~ R400 million (US$30 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ R610,000 per kilogram (US$1,394 per ounce)

As planned, gold production decreased by 7 per cent from 566,400 ounces in 2017 to 524,900 ounces in 2018 due to lower volumes and 
lower grades mined.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 14 per cent from 103.8 million tonnes in 2017 to 89.6 million tonnes in 
2018.  Ore tonnes mined decreased by 15 per cent from 16.7 million tonnes to 14.2 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined 
decreased by 30 per cent from 35.5 million tonnes to 25.0 million tonnes and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 
51.6 million tonnes to 50.4 million tonnes.  The decrease was mainly due to change in strategy to reduce mining volume from 100 million 
tonnes per annum to 85 million tonnes per annum and the focus on capital waste strip.  Head grade mined decreased by 5 per cent from 
1.32 grams per tonne to 1.26 grams per tonne.  Gold mined decreased by 20 per cent from 711,000 ounces to 572,100 ounces.  The overall 
reduction of total mined tonnes, capital stripping, ore tonnes mined and head grade mined was mainly due to a change in strategy to 
reduce mining volumes from 100 million tonnes per annum to 85 million tonnes per annum in line with the 2018 plan.  This will sustain 
a long term cost effective production profile of around 500,000 ounces per year for the next decade and likely beyond with further 
possible extension to existing pits. The strip ratio increased from 5.2 to 5.3.

The CIL plant throughput increased by 2 per cent from 13.5 million tonnes in 2017 to 13.8 million tonnes in 2018 due to increased plant 
availability.  Realised yield from the CIL plant decreased by 9 per cent from 1.30 grams per tonne to 1.18 grams per tonne due to lower 
head grade mined and processing of 2.4 million tonnes of stockpiles at 0.73 grams per tonne.  This compared with 1.2 million tonnes of 
stockpiles processed in 2017 at a grade of 0.76 grams per tonne.  Medium grade stockpiles were processed in 2018, while stockpiling 
lower grade material mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 1 per cent from US$306 million in 2017 to US$309 million in 2018 due 
to a gold-in-process charge to cost, partially offset by lower mining costs in line with lower operational tonnes mined.  The 
US$10 million gold-in-process charge to costs in 2018 compared with a credit to costs of US$42 million in 2017.  In 2017, higher 
volumes were mined and stockpiled compared to 2018.

Capital expenditure decreased by 14 per cent from US$181 million to US$156 million mainly due to lower expenditure on capital waste 
stripping and mining fleet.  Mining fleet expenditure including componentisation was US$4 million in 2018 compared with US$33 million 
in 2017.  This was mainly due to transitioning to contract mining and the transfer of the mining fleet to the mining contractors.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent from US$940 per ounce in 2017 to US$951 per ounce in 2018 due to 
higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 514,000 ounces.  The lower gold is in line with the revised life of mine plan
-  Capital expenditure ~ US$113 million
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$949 per ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$949 per ounce

Gold production increased by 26 per cent from 143,600 ounces in 2017 to 180,800 ounces in 2018 mainly due to higher head grade and 
yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 16 per cent from 39.7 million tonnes in 2017 (25.7 million tonnes from 
Amoanda and other satellite pits and 14.0 million tonnes from the Damang Pit Cut Back (DPCB) to 45.9 million tonnes in 2018 
(15.2 million tonnes from Amoanda and other satellite pits and 30.7 million tonnes from the DPCB) due to improved operational 
performance from the contractors? mining fleet and improved mining efficiencies. 

Ore tonnes mined increased by 36 per cent from 3.3 million tonnes to 4.5 million tonnes mainly from Amoanda pit area where the ore 
zones are exposed.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 47 per cent from 5.3 million tonnes to 7.8 million tonnes mainly as a 
result of mining capital waste tonnes in 2017, to align with the new mining strategy.  Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 8 per 
cent from 31.1 million tonnes in 2017 to 33.6 million tonnes in 2018 mainly due to higher volumes mined from the DPCB pits which are in 
the early stages of the current cutback.  Head grade mined increased by 46 per cent from 1.15 grams per tonne in 2017 to 1.68 grams per 
tonne in 2018 due to high grade ore mined from the Amoanda pits.  Gold mined increased by 97 per cent from 122,700 ounces to 
242,300 ounces.  The strip ratio decreased from 10.9 to 9.2 due to exposed ore surfaces mined at the Amoanda pit. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 8 per cent from 4.59 million tonnes in 2017 to 4.21 million tonnes in 2018 due to lower plant overall 
equipment availability as a result of a planned 16 day shutdown to replace the SAG mill shell.  Yield increased by 38 per cent from 
0.97 grams per tonne to 1.34 grams per tonne due to higher feed grade.  In 2018, 3.38 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were 
milled at an average grade of 1.67 grams per tonne and 0.83 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 0.74 grams 
per tonne.  This compared with 2.83 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides that was milled at an average grade of 1.16 grams per tonne 
and 1.76 million tonnes of stockpiles that was milled at an average grade of 0.68 grams per tonne in 2017.  The stockpiles at 
31 December 2018 consisted of the ROM stockpile of 0.8 million tonnes at a grade of 1.30 grams per tonne and a crushed ore stockpile 
of 0.2 million tonnes at a grade of 1.59 grams per tonne.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 2 per cent from US$122 million in 2017 to US$124 million in 2018 
mainly due to higher operating tonnes mined, partially offset by a gold-in-process credit to costs of US$19 million in 2018 compared 
with a charge to costs of US$1 million in 2017.

Capital expenditure increased by 5 per cent from US$132 million to US$139 million.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 18 per cent from US$17 million in 2017 to US$14 million in 2018, mainly due to the pre-
development work on the Damang reinvestment project in 2017.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 9 per cent from 
US$115 million to US$125 million mainly due to higher capital waste mined (34 million tonnes mined in 2018 compared with 31 million 
tonnes mined in 2017). 

All-in sustaining cost decreased by 21 per cent from US$1,027 per ounce in 2017 to US$813 per ounce in 2018 due to higher gold sold 
and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation. 

Total all-in cost decreased by 18 per cent from US$1,827 per ounce in 2017 to US$1,506 per ounce in 2018 due to the same reasons as 
for all-in sustaining cost, partially offset by increased non-sustaining capital expenditure. 

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 218,000 ounces
-  Sustaining capital expenditure ~ US$6 million
-  Growth capital expenditure ~ US$69 million
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$786 per ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$1,100 per ounce

All figures in table 100 per cent basis

Gold production for the five months ended December 2018 was 98,900 ounces.

Total tonnes mined for the five months ended December 2018 were 16.9 million tonnes. Ore tonnes mined were 2.5 million tonnes.  
Head grade mined was 1.48 grams per tonne.

Total waste tonnes mined was 14.3 million tonnes.  The strip ratio was 5.7 for the five months ended December 2018.

The plant throughput was 2.1 million tonnes for the five months ended December 2018 and yield was 1.50 grams per tonne.  

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation for the five months ended December 2018 was US$83 million.

Sustaining capital expenditure for the five months ended December 2018 was US$18 million.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure amounted 
to US$11 million and included construction of the haul road and other expenditure related to the Esaase project, which commenced 
production in early 2019. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost for the five months ended December 2018 was US$1,069 per ounce and US$1,175 per ounce, 
respectively.

Gold Fields? 45 per cent share of gold produced and gold sold for the 5 months ending December 2018 amounted to 44,500 ounces and 
45,900 ounces, respectively.  Gold Fields share of cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation amounted to US$37 million and 
that of sustaining capital expenditure and non-sustaining capital expenditure amounted to US$8 million and US$5 million, respectively.  
The above translates to a US$1 million loss related to the Group?s share of equity accounted losses.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 225,000 ounces to 245,000 ounces
-  Sustaining capital expenditure ~ US$7 million
-  Growth capital expenditure ~ US$18 million
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$1,040 per ounce to US$1,060 per ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$1,130 per ounce to US$1,150 per ounce
-  Gold Fields share of production ~ 101,000 ounces to 110,000 ounces

The large Western pushback at the Nkran pit will result in the strip ratio and mining costs remaining elevated during 2019.  However, 
the strip levels at Nkran normalise in 2020, at which point the higher-grade production from the shallow Esaase oxides will be ramping 
up, having a material positive impact on unit costs.  In addition, Gold Fields is working with our JV partners on a cost optimisation 
exercise which is expected to result in further cost reductions.  We will provide updated near-term guidance on costs when we release 
the updated life of mine plan in H2 2019.  Which update will take account of the longer term potential of the Esaase project which is 
expected to become the centre of gravity for the operation.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 159,000 ounces in 2017 to 149,900 ounces in 2018.  Copper production increased by 6 per 
cent from 30,200 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production increased by 2 per cent from 306,700 ounces to 314,100 ounces.  
The increase in equivalent gold production was due to the higher copper price ratio as well as higher copper production due to higher 
copper head grade.  Gold head grade decreased by 2 per cent from 1.08 grams per tonne to 1.06 grams per tonne and copper head grade 
increased by 8 per cent from 0.52 per cent to 0.56 per cent.  

Gold recoveries decreased by 3 per cent from 70.4 per cent to 68.1 per cent with ore processed from the south zone of the pit with a 
higher clay content, typically with different metallurgical behaviour.  Copper recoveries decreased by 1 per cent from 88.9 per cent to 
88.0 per cent.  Gold yield decreased by 4 per cent from 0.76 grams per tonne to 0.73 grams per tonne.  Copper yield increased by 9 per 
cent from 0.46 per cent to 0.50 per cent.  

In 2018, concentrate with a payable content of 141,041 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,254 per ounce and 
30,742 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,767 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared with 
164,715 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,261 per ounce and 30,377 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average 
price of US$5,546 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges in 2017.  Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 5 per cent from 
313,800 ounces in 2017 to 299,100 ounces in 2018 due to lower gold produced and higher concentrate stock on hand in December 2018.

Total tonnes mined increased by 38 per cent from 15.75 million tonnes in 2017 to 21.78 million tonnes in 2018 in line with the mining 
sequence and life extension plan.  Ore mined decreased by 3 per cent from 7.09 million tonnes to 6.85 million tonnes.  Waste tonnes 
mined increased by 72 per cent from 8.66 million tonnes to 14.93 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 1.22 to 2.18 as a 
result of the increased waste mined in 2018. 

Ore processed decreased by 2 per cent from 6.80 million tonnes in 2017 to 6.64 million tonnes in 2018 mainly due to lower plant 
throughput (802 tonnes per hour in 2018 versus 815 tonnes per hour in 2017) and lower utilisation due to harder ore.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased marginally from US$154 million in 2017 to US$155 million in 2018.  
The higher cost was due to higher mining expenditure as a result of increased tonnes mined in 2018, partially offset by a US$6 million 
credit to costs of concentrate inventory in 2018 compared with a US$3 million charge to costs in 2017. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from US$34 million to US$33 million due to lower expenditure on the tailings dam and waste 
storage facilities.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 39 per cent from US$203 per ounce in 2017 to US$282 per ounce in 2018, 
mainly due to lower by-product credits, lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.  All-in 
sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 4 per cent from US$673 per equivalent ounce to US$699 per 
equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above and lower equivalent ounces sold.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold equivalents produced ~ 291,000 ounces
-  Gold only produced ~ 153,000 ounces
-  Copper tonnes produced ~ 27,684 tonnes
-  Capital expenditure ~ US$55 million
-  Copper price ~ US$2.70 per pound*
-  Gold price ~ US$1,200 per ounce*
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$802 per equivalent ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$802 per equivalent ounce
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$566 per ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$566 per ounce
* For purposes of calculating equivalent ounces

The decrease in copper tonnes produced is due to lower copper head grades based on mining sequence.

The increase in capital expenditure is due to construction of the waste storage facilities (WSF) as part of the 2030 Lom expansion.

At the underground operations, ore mined increased by 90 per cent from 0.48 million tonnes in 2017 to 0.91 million tonnes in 2018 due 
to the commissioning of the new Invincible underground mine during 2018.  The grade mined decreased by 1 per cent from 4.13 grams per

At the open pits total ore tonnes mined decreased by 15 per cent from 3.98 million tonnes in 2017 to 3.40 million tonnes in 2018 as a 
result of the completion of mining activities at the Invincible open pit stage 5 in September 2018.  Grade mined decreased by 8 per 
cent from 2.92 grams per tonne to 2.68 grams per tonne with lower grade areas of the Neptune pit mined in 2018.  Contained gold mined 
from the open pits decreased by 22 per cent from 374,300 ounces in 2017 to 292,600 ounces in 2018.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 35 per cent from 9.03 million tonnes in 2017 to 5.84 million tonnes in 2018.  Capital waste 
tonnes mined decreased by 60 per cent from 29.12 million tonnes to 11.52 million tonnes.  The decrease in waste tonnes mined was as a 
result of the pre-strip being completed at Invincible mine.  The strip ratio decreased from 9.6 to 5.1.  

At the consolidated St Ives mine, ounces mined decreased by 6 per cent from 438,500 ounces in 2017 to 412,000 ounces in 2018.  In 2018, 
Neptune high-grade oxide material stockpiled amounted to 47,700 ounces (763,100 tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 
100 ounces (2,000 tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne) and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne).  This 
compared with stockpiles of 45,600 ounces (711,000 tonnes at 1.99 grams per tonne) at Neptune, Invincible of 7,800 ounces (109 tonnes 
at 2.21 grams per tonne) and A5 of 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne).  Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 
25 per cent oxide material blend, thus constraining the processing of Neptune ore. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 1 per cent from 4.20 million tonnes in 2017 to 4.25 million tonnes in 2018.  Yield decreased 
marginally from 2.70 grams per tonne to 2.69 grams per tonne.  Gold production from the Lefroy mill increased by 1 per cent from 
363,900 ounces in 2017 to 366,900 ounces in 2018.  

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 20 per cent from A$207 million (US$159 million) in 2017 to 
A$249 million (US$186 million) in 2018.  The higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation was due to increased underground 
mining cost as a result of increased ore tonnes mined at Invincible underground mine (A$18 million/US$14 million) and as a result of 
the loss of economies of scale at the open pits due to the large decrease in mining volumes as Invincible stage 5 moved to completion 
(completed at end of September 2018), as well as lower volumes from Neptune, increased processing maintenance cost (A$4 million/
US$3 million) and a lower gold inventory credit to costs (A$20 million/US$15 million) in 2018 compared with A$38 million 
(US$29 million) in 2017.

Capital expenditure decreased by 17 per cent from A$204 million (US$156 million) in 2017 to A$170 million (US$127 million) in 2018 
mainly due to lower capital development in the open pits following completion of mining activities at Invincible open pit stage 5 
(A$54 million/US$41 million), partially offset by increased capital development at the new Invincible underground mine 
(A$25 million/US$19 million).  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent from A$1,198 per ounce (US$916 per ounce) in 2017 to A$1,207 per 
ounce (US$902 per ounce) in 2018 due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by higher gold sold 
and lower capital expenditure. 

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 362,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$156 million (US$117 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,342 per ounce (US$1,007 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,342 per ounce (US$1,007 per ounce) 

The increase in all-in sustaining and total all-in costs is due to a forecast increase of A$59 million (US$44 million) in cost of sales 
before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by a A$14 million (US$10 million) decrease in capital expenditure. 

The increased costs is as a result of a forecasted increase in mining costs of A$29 million (US$22 million) as underground mining 
activity is planned to increase from 0.9 million tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes.  In addition, a drawdown of gold-in-process of 
A$6 million (US$5 million) is forecast for 2019 as open pit mining activity decreases.  This compared with a A$20 million 
(US$15 million) build-up of gold-in-process in 2018.

The decreased capital expenditure is due to a decrease in pre-strip, partially offset by increased underground capital development.

Gold production decreased by 1 per cent from 241,200 ounces in 2017 to 239,100 ounces in 2018. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 1.17 million tonnes in 2017 to 1.22 million tonnes in 2018.  Head grade mined 
decreased by 3 per cent from 6.72 grams per tonne to 6.49 grams per tonne due to lower grade from New Holland (3.96 grams per tonne in 
2018 to 4.78 grams per tonne in 2017).  Gold mined decreased marginally from 253,800 ounces to 253,700 ounces.  At Waroonga, ore tonnes 
mined decreased from 633,500 tonnes in 2017 to 622,400 tonnes in 2018.  Grade mined increased from 8.38 grams per tonne to 8.90 grams 
per tonne and gold mined increased from 170,700 ounces to 178,100 ounces.  At New Holland, ore tonnes mined increased from 
540,700 tonnes in 2017 to 593,400 tonnes in 2018. Grade mined decreased by 17 per cent from 4.78 grams per tonne to 3.96 grams per 
tonne and gold mined decreased from 83,100 ounces to 75,600 ounces.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 1.24 million tonnes in 2017 to 1.18 million tonnes in 2018 due to a lower throughput rate 
in 2018 as a result of downtime to perform major repairs to the crusher.  The combined yield increased by 4 per cent from 6.08 grams 
per tonne to 6.31 grams per tonne due to the processing of higher grade stockpiles in 2018, mined but not processed in 2017.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 10 per cent from A$197 million (US$150 million) in 2017 to 
A$216 million (US$162 million) in 2018 mainly due to increased mining cost at Waroonga (A$8 million/US$6 million) as a result of 
increased ground support and paste fill and a gold-in-process charge to costs of A$2 million (US$2 million) in 2018 compared with a 
credit to costs of A$6 million (US$5 million) in 2017.

Capital expenditure increased by 2 per cent from A$96 million (US$74 million) in 2017 to A$98 million (US$73 million) in 2018.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from A$1,276 per ounce (US$977 per ounce) in 2017 to A$1,374 per 
ounce (US$1,026 per ounce) in 2018 due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, higher capital expenditure and 
lower gold sold.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 221,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$98 million (US$74 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,538 per ounce (US$1,154 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,538 per ounce (US$1,154 per ounce) 
Gold sold is forecast to decrease by 8 per cent due to a 13 per cent decrease in grade mined from 6.49 grams per tonne to 5.62 grams 
per tonne, due to reducing grades in the FBH area, partially offset by a 7 per cent increase in ore tonnes mined.  The increased tonnes 
mined contributed a A$12 million (US$9 million) increase in cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, when added to the 
decreased gold sales it results in an additional A$164 per ounce to all-in sustaining and total all-in costs.

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 290,300 ounces in 2017 to 280,400 ounces in 2018 due to lower grades mined and processed. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 1.70 million tonnes to 1.76 million tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased by 
5 per cent from 5.50 grams per tonne in 2017 to 5.25 grams per tonne in 2018.  Gold mined from underground decreased by 2 per cent from 
300,700 ounces to 296,000 ounces.  

Tonnes processed increased by 3 per cent from 1.73 million tonnes to 1.78 million tonnes.  The yield decreased by 6 per cent from 
5.23 grams per tonne to 4.90 grams per tonne due to lower grades mined. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 7 per cent from A$210 million (US$160 million) in 2017 to 
A$225 million (US$168 million) in 2018 mainly due to increased mining cost (A$15 million/US$12 million) due to the increased ore tonnes 
mined from the deeper zones and an 18 per cent increase in ore development in 2018.

Capital expenditure decreased by 8 per cent from A$114 million (US$87 million) in 2017 to A$105 million (US$79 million) in 2018 due to 
the completion of the VR8 ventilation shaft in 2017.  The majority of capital expenditure related to development and infrastructure at 
the Wallaby mine, exploration and the development of a paste plant and associated infrastructure.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent from A$1,171 per ounce (US$896 per ounce) in 2017 to A$1,239 per 
ounce (US$925 per ounce) in 2018 mainly due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower gold sold, partially 
offset by lower capital expenditure.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 260,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$107 million (US$80 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,370 per ounce (US$1,028 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,370 per ounce (US$1,028 per ounce)

The increase in all-in sustaining and total all-in costs is due to a 20,400 ounce decrease in gold sold and a A$10 million 
(US$7 million) increase in mining costs.  The decrease in ounces is due to a seismic event in the December 2018 quarter which impacted 
access to higher grade mining areas in 2019.  The lower production was due to additional barrier pillars now defined in the mine plan 
combined with reduced mining rates in parts of the Z100 area as a consequence of localised geotechnical conditions.  Mining costs 
increased due to greater haulage distances and the addition of paste fill as mining depth increases.

Gruyere
First gold remains scheduled for the June 2019 quarter, in line with the guidance issued in April 2018.  The final forecast capital 
(FFC) cost estimate remains at A$621 million (level of accuracy range + 2 per cent/-2 per cent) as reported by the joint venture 
partners on 30 July 2018.

In accordance with the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition, Gold Fields will fund up to 10 per cent of 
costs overruns, excluding scope changes and force majeure costs.  This translates to approximately A$51 million.  Consequently, 
Gold Fields share of the FFC is A$337 million with A$246 million having been incurred up to the end of December 2018.  As at end 
December 2018, overall project engineering and construction was 97.2 per cent and 88.7 per cent complete, respectively, with EPC 
construction (process plant and associated infrastructure) 85.1 per cent complete.

We believe that the long-life, low-cost nature of Gruyere will improve the Gold Fields portfolio.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2019 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 118,000 ounces (100 per cent basis)
-  Gold Fields share of production ~ 59,000 ounces
-  Sustaining capital expenditure# ~ A$13 million (US$9 million)
-  Growth capital expenditure# ~ A$99 million (US$74 million) 
-  All-in sustaining costs# ~ A$1,088 per ounce (US$816 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost# ~ A$3,178 per ounce (US$2,384 per ounce)

Ghana 
The Ghana Chamber of Mines received a letter from the Government of Ghana dated 31 July 2018 indicating that the Government intended 
to exercise its right of pre-emption regarding minerals ""raised, won and obtained in Ghana and from any area covered by territorial 
waters, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf and products derived from the refining or treatment of these minerals"" in 
accordance with section 7 of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703).  In this regard, the letter stated that the Government 
intended to purchase up to 30 per cent of gold mined in Ghana from all mining companies and requested the Chamber to inform its 
members, including Gold Fields, of the Government?s decision and be prepared to engage with the Ministry to finalise measures to ensure 
implementation by 1 November 2018.  The Chamber on behalf of its Members has engaged and will continue to do so to obtain further 
information on this decision. 

In a meeting on 8 January 2019 with representatives of the Chamber, the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources indicated that 
Government would collaborate with mining companies to determine ways of adding value to Ghana?s mineral resources in a mutually 
beneficial way.  The joint committee set up to achieve this common goal would commence work once the terms of reference had been 
finalised.  The Chamber representatives pointed out that letters like the one issued on pre-emptive rights sent the wrong signals about 
Ghana and that it was better for Government to work collaboratively with the industry to adopt the best and most acceptable way to add 
value. We are yet to hear from the Ministry/Government. 

Mining charter 
On 27 September 2018, the Minister of Mineral Resources, published the Broad-Based Socio-Economic Empowerment Charter (2018 Mining 
Charter).  On 19 December 2018, the Implementation Guidelines were published together with a Gazetted amendment to the 2018 Mining 
Charter.

The Minerals Council recognises that 2018 Mining Charter is an improvement on previous draft versions in 2017 however there are still 
certain matters including renewals that require more engagements with the Minister.  We trust that the 2018 Mining Charter will promote 
a sustainable mining industry that will be supported by investment, growth, transformation and value creation.

Gold Fields continues to support the collaborative and consultative process of engagement with the Minister, the Department of Minerals 
and Resources and other stakeholders through the Minerals Council. 

Outlook for 2019

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2019 is expected to be between 2.13 million ounces and 2.18 million ounces.  
AISC is expected to be between US$980 per ounce and US$995 per ounce.  AIC is planned to be between US$1,075 per ounce and US$1,095 per 
ounce.  These expectations assume exchange rates of R/US$:13.80 and A$/US$:0.75.

Capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$633 million. Sustaining capital expenditure for the Group is planned at 
US$490 million and growth capital expenditure is planned at US$143 million. The US$143 million growth capital expenditure comprises 
US$69 million for Damang and A$99 million (US$74 million) as per above for Gruyere.  Expenditure on Salares Norte is expected to be 
US$57 million in 2019.  The capital expenditure above excludes the Group?s share of Asanko?s total capital expenditure of US$25 million 
for 2019. 

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on 
page 6.


REVIEWED PRELIMINARY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings 
Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.  The Listings Requirements require 
preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the 
information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

These condensed consolidated financial statements were authorised by the Board of Directors for issue on 15 February 2019.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are 
consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements except for the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments (IFRS 9) and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15).

Auditor?s review
The condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2018 have been reviewed by the 
company?s auditor, KPMG Inc. 

The auditor?s report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this media release. Shareholders are therefore 
advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor?s engagement they should refer to page 43 of the 
media release for a copy of the auditor?s report.

Changes in significant accounting policies
The group adopted IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15
This IFRS introduces a new revenue recognition model for contracts with customers and establishes a comprehensive framework for 
determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.

The Group assessed the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and determined the impact as follows:
-  Revenue will be recognised when the customer takes control of the gold, copper and silver. The timing of recognition of revenue 
   will no longer be when risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer; and
-  The change in timing of revenue recognition will result in revenue at the South African and Australian operations being recognised 
   on settlement date (date when control passes) and not contract date (previous date when risks and rewards of ownership passed). 
   There is no change to the revenue recognition at any of the other operations given that the date of control is the same date as when 
   risks and rewards of ownership pass. The change in timing of revenue recognition for the South African and Australian operations is 
   that revenue will be recognised approximately two days later than it was previously recognised. 
   The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with the effect of initially 
   applying this standard at the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). Accordingly, the information presented for prior 
   periods has not been restated. The impact on opening retained earnings has been disclosed in the statement of changes in equity 
   (this had no impact on the non-controlling interest).

There was no material impact on the Group?s income statement and statements of financial position and cash flows for the year ended 
31 December 2018. 

IFRS 9
This IFRS sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell 
non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

This IFRS contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which the 
assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. The three principal classification categories for financial assets are: 
amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The new classification does not have a significant impact on the Group accounting for financial assets. The Group?s available-for-sale 
financial assets will be designated as FVOCI.

Given the historically low risk of impairment in respect of receivables and the nature of receivables, the change from the ""incurred 
loss"" model to the ""expected credit loss"" model did not have a material impact on the measurement of financial assets.

There was no material impact on the Group?s income statement and statements of financial position and cash flows for the year ended 
31 December 2018. 

Credit facilities successfully refinanced
R1,500 million Nedbank revolving credit facility
On 13 April 2018, Gold Fields Operations Limited and GFI Joint Venture Holdings (Proprietary) Limited entered into a R1,500 million 
revolving credit facility with Nedbank Limited which became available on 8 May 2018. The purpose of this facility was to fund 
(i) capital expenditure of the Gold Fields group, and (ii) general corporate and working capital requirements of the Gold Fields group. 
The final maturity date of this facility is five years from the financial close date, namely 8 May 2023.

US$100 million Senior Secured revolving credit facility
On 12 June 2017, Gold Fields Ghana Limited and Abosso Goldfields Limited (as Borrowers) entered into a US$100 million senior secured 
revolving credit facility with the Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (acting through its Isle of Man branch) (as Original Lender 
and Agent) and Stanbic Ghana Limited (as Security Agent) which became available on 17 July 2017. The purpose of this facility was 
(i) to refinance the outstanding balance of US$45 million under the US$70 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which 
matured on 17 July 2017); (ii) to finance working capital requirements; (iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) for capital 
expenditure purposes of each borrower. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the financial close date, namely 
17 July 2020. On 22 March 2018, the Borrowers, the Original Lender and the Security Agent entered into an Amendment and Restatement 
Agreement to release any and all security interests created in favour of the Security Agent (the Security). The effective date of the 
release of the Security was 22 March 2018.

On 23 November 2018, Gold Fields Ghana Limited and Abosso Goldfields Limited and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (acting 
through its Isle of Man branch) entered into the Fifth Amendment and Restatement Agreement which further amended the facility 
agreement. The effective date of the Fifth Amendment and Restatement Agreement was 30 November 2018. The final maturity date is the 
date falling three years after the effective date, namely 30 November 2021.

US$1,290 million term loan and revolving credit facilities 
-  US$360 million facility extension (Facility B).  On 29 June 2018, the termination date of 96.18 per cent of the total commitment 
   under the US$360 million revolving credit facility (i.e. US$346.25 million) was extended by one year from 6 June 2020 to 6 June 
   2021.
-  US$380 million facility extension (Facility A). On 8 November 2018, the termination date of the US$380 million term loan was 
   extended by one year from 6 June 2019 to 6 June 2020.

Non-recurring items
Asset impairments and write-offs 
Asset impairments and write-offs recognised by the Group during 2018 include:

South Deep
-  impairment of R6.471 billion (US$482 million) in respect of the South Deep cash-generating unit.  The after tax impairment was 
   R4.819 billion (US$359 million).  The impairment was recognised in June 2018, firstly allocated against goodwill and then against 
   other assets, and given that impairment indicators still existed at 31 December 2018, a further impairment assessment was performed.

There were no further impairments at 31 December 2018 using the following assumptions:
-  Gold price of R525,000 per kilogram for 2019 and R550,000 per kilogram thereafter;
-  Resource price of US$17 per ounce at a Rand/US dollar exchange rate of R14.63;
-  Resource ounces of 24.5 million ounces;
-  Life of mine 75 years; and
-  Nominal discount rate of 13.5 per cent. 

Impairment of investments and assets
The impairment of US$39 million related mainly to the impairment of FSE which was based on the fair value less cost of disposal of the 
investment which was directly derived from the market value of Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company.

Loss on sale of inventory and assets
The loss on sale of inventory and assets related to the sale of mining fleet and heavy machinery equipment and inventory at Tarkwa as 
part of the transition to contractor mining and amounted to US$9 million and US$38 million, respectively. 

Restructuring costs
The restructuring costs of US$114 million comprised restructuring costs at Tarkwa of US$89 million with the transition to contractor 
mining as well as restructuring costs at Damang and South Deep of US$14 million and US$11 million, respectively.

Acquisition of a 45 per cent interest in Asanko
On 29 March 2018, the Group entered into certain definitive agreements (the JV Transaction) with Asanko Gold Inc. (Asanko) pursuant to 
which, among other things:
-  Gold Fields and Asanko will each own a 45 per cent interest in Asanko Gold Ghana Limited (AGGL), the Asanko subsidiary that 
   currently owns the Asanko Gold Mine, with the Government of Ghana continuing to retain a 10 per cent free-carried interest in AGGL 
   (the Joint Arrangement);
-  Gold Fields and Asanko will each own a 50 per cent interest in Adansi Gold Company Ghana Limited (Adansi Ghana), the Asanko 
   subsidiary that currently owns a number of the Company?s exploration licenses; and
-  Gold Fields and Asanko will each acquire a 50 per cent interest in a newly formed entity (Shika Group Finance Limited (JV Finco)).

On 20 June 2018, Gold Fields and Asanko received approval of the JV Transaction from the Ghanaian Minister of Lands and Natural 
Resources and the JV Transaction closed on 31 July 2018 once all conditions precedent were met. 

In consideration for its interests in the Joint Arrangement, Gold Fields:
-  contributed US$165.0 million, representing its initial US$164.9 million redeemable share investment in JV Finco, as well as its 
   initial US$0.1 million equity investments in AGGL, Adansi Ghana and JV Finco, respectively; and
-  will contribute an additional US$20.0 million redeemable share investment to JV Finco based on an agreed Esaase development 
   milestone, but in any event no later than 31 December 2019. 

Recognition and measurement
Gold Fields and Asanko have joint control as each party has 50 per cent of the voting rights.  The Asanko transaction is structured as 
a separate vehicle and the Group has a residual interest in the net assets of Asanko. Accordingly, the Group has classified its 
interest in Asanko as a joint venture.

Fair value measured on a provisional basis
The fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been performed on a provisional basis, pending completion of review and sign off 
of the life of mine model, including the Reserves and Resources, by the Group Competent Person.  Any changes to the acquisition life of 
mine model and/or Reserves and Resources could result in a material change to the cash flows used to determine the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. 

If new information is obtained within one year from the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of 
acquisition and adjustments are required to be made to the provisional fair values of the identifiable net assets, or if any additional 
provisions that existed at the date of acquisition are identified, then the accounting for the acquisition will be revised.

Consideration transferred
The following table summarises the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred:

Gain on acquisition of Asanko
The gain on acquisition was determined as follows:

-  The redeemable preference shares have the following conditions:
   -  Redeemable at the option of the issuer; and
   -  Non-interest bearing. 

The redeemable preference shares were recognised as an investment in an equity financial instrument measured at fair value. The key 
assumptions used to determine the fair value of the redeemable preference shares of US$129.9 million at acquisition were as follows:
Par value of the preference shares               US$/m            165.0
Market related interest rate                              7,85 per cent
Expected redemption period                                      5 years

-  The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired were as follows:
US$ gold price - 2018 to 2019                   US$/oz            1,200
US$ gold price - 2020 onwards                   US$/oz            1,300
Discount rate                                            10.27 per cent
Life of mine                                                   12 years

-  The excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired over the consideration is recognised immediately in profit or 
   loss as a gain on acquisition.

Silicosis and tuberculosis class and individual actions
As previously reported, the Gold Working Group (comprising African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, 
Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwater) (the ""GWG Parties"") concluded a settlement agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement"") with the attorneys 
representing claimants in the silicosis and tuberculosis class action litigation on 3 May 2018. The Settlement Agreement provides 
meaningful compensation to all eligible workers suffering from silicosis and/or tuberculosis who worked in the GWG Parties? mines from 
12 March 1965 to the effective date of the Settlement Agreement.

The Settlement Agreement is subject to certain suspensive conditions, including that an unconditional order of court, sanctioning the 
Settlement Agreement to make the Settlement Agreement an order of court, is obtained from the High Court of South Africa (Gauteng Local 
Division, Johannesburg) (the ""Court"").

The first stage of the Court approval application comprised an ex parte application which was heard on 13 December 2018. Following this 
hearing, the Court issued an order setting out how members of the settling classes and other interested parties should be informed of 
the proposed settlement and how they may make representations to the Court regarding the settlement, should they wish.

The second stage of the approval application makes provision for members of the settling classes and interested parties to make 
submissions to the Court, if they so wish, on the settlement.  The hearing of the second stage of the approval application will take 
place from 29 to 31 May 2019. Should there be no notifications of objections to the settlement, this hearing will take place on 3 April 
2019.

If and when the Court has approved the settlement, there will then be a period in which members of the settling classes may indicate 
whether they wish to opt out of the settlement. The Settlement Agreement provides that any member of the settlement classes who doesn?t 
opt out is automatically eligible to submit a claim.

In terms of the settlement, a settlement trust will be constituted. A website (http://www.SilicosisSettlement.co.za) and a Facebook page 
(http://www.facebook.com/silicosissettlement) were established where miners, ex-miners or their dependants can register an interest in making 
a claim from the settlement trust once it is established, and learn more about the settlement.

Provision raised
Gold Fields has provided for the estimated cost of the above settlement based on actuarial assessments and the provisions of the 
Settlement Agreement. At 31 December 2018, the provision for Gold Fields? share of the settlement of the class action claims and 
related costs amounts to US$25 million (R368 million). The nominal value of this provision is US$35 million (R507 million).

This provision compares to the initial amount raised in June 2017 of US$30 million (R390 million). The decrease is due to a change in 
the timing of expected cash flows.

The ultimate outcome of this matter remains uncertain, with a possible failure to fulfil all the suspensive conditions, including the 
Settlement Agreement being approved by the Court.  The provision is consequently subject to adjustment in the future.

South Deep tax dispute
During the September 2014 quarter, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued a Finalisation of Audit Letter stating that SARS has 
disallowed GFI Joint Venture Holdings (Pty) Ltd?s (GFIJVH) additional capital allowance claim.

The Group objected to SARS? decision and vigorously defended its position. After no resolution was achieved during a Tax Court sitting 
in 2017, GFIJVH appealed to the High Court. 

The Group announced that on 30 May 2018 GFIJVH and SARS entered into a confidential settlement agreement (as provided for in the Tax 
Administration Act) in full and final settlement of this matter. As a result of the settlement GFIJVH has recognised an additional 
R2,708 million (US$185 million) of capital allowances with a tax effect on this amount of R785 million (US$54 million).

HEDGING/DERIVATIVES (REVIEWED)
The Group?s policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken as follows:
-  to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
-  for specific debt servicing requirements; and 
-  to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.
Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

Regrettably, a tragic accident occurred on 12 October 2018 fatally injuring Mr. Ananias Mosololi.  The mine was issued with a Section 
54 instruction, halting mobile machinery and secondly to conduct an investigation.  A partial upliftment was issued on 18 October 2018 
with a full upliftment on 31 October 2018.  18 days of production was either lost or significantly impacted. 

South Deep embarked on a restructuring process as reported in the September quarter.  The prescribed consultation process was concluded 
on 28 October 2018 culminating in the retrenchment of 1,092 permanent employee?s and 420 contractors.  The majority union, the NUM, 
obtained a certificate of non-resolution from the CCMA and issued a notice of intended industrial action on 31 October 2018.  The 
protected industrial action commenced on 2 November 2018 and lasted 6 weeks.  Employees participating in the industrial action blocked 
all roads to the mine, limiting access and the ability to continue with any mining operations. Production was therefore suspended and 
essential services continued intermittently when access was possible.  Negotiations with all levels of the union (branch, regional and 
national) concluded on 18 December 2018 with the signing of a new agreement that ended the industrial action.  The mine resumed 
operations gradually from 15 December 2018.  The process had a profound impact on production with the operations suspended for 41 days 
with a preceding ""go slow"" and acts of sabotage.  It took an additional 8 days to start-up the underground sections post 15 December 
2018. 

Gold production subsequently decreased by 78 per cent from 1,539 kilograms (49,489 ounces) in the September quarter to 343 kilograms 
(11,019 ounces) in the December quarter.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 75 per cent from 319,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 79,000 tonnes in the December 
quarter.  Ore tonnes mined decreased by 78 per cent from 277,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes, while underground waste mined decreased by 
60 per cent from 42,000 tonnes to 17,000 tonnes.  Access development in the reef areas decreased by 76 per cent from 48,800 tonnes to 
11,800 tonnes.  It was constrained by continued ground support and rehabilitation requirements.  Underground reef grade mined decreased 
by 24 per cent from 6.14 grams per tonne to 4.67 grams per tonne due to a decrease in stoping grade from 7.11 grams per tonne in the 
September quarter to 4.78 grams per tonne in the December quarter as a result of loading the remainder of the broken stoping volume 
from the suspended lower grade 87 1W area.  Total gold mined from underground decreased by 84 per cent from 1,697 kilograms 
(54,600 ounces) in the September quarter to 280 kilograms (9,000 ounces) in the December quarter, in line with volumes and grade.

Total tonnes milled decreased by 59 per cent from 387,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 159,000 tonnes in the December quarter.  
Reef yield decreased 6 per cent from 5.63 grams per tonne to 5.30 grams per tonne in line with the lower reef grade.  

Surface tailings material treated decreased by 4 per cent from 73,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes.

Gold recovered from underground amounted to 333 kilograms (10,700 ounces) and included 53 kilograms (1,700 ounces) released from 
gold-in-process. In addition, 10 kilograms (320 ounces) were recovered from the treatment of surface material.

Destress mining decreased by 70 per cent from 4,356 square metres in the September quarter to 1,323 square metres in the December 
quarter partly due to a new destress support design implemented in October 2018.  In addition to the normal tendon and mesh support the 
design includes for shotcrete to be applied on the side walls over the mesh. This design will improve support effectiveness, excavation 
durability, reduce support rehabilitation cycles and reduce rock burst risk.  Implementing the new design and catching up with the 
backlog of ground support in previously mined excavations, impacted destress progress negatively.  However, the benefits of the new 
support protocols are expected to be significant.

Longhole stoping decreased by 84 per cent from 188,300 tonnes to 29,700 tonnes.  Development decreased by 62 per cent from 1,190 metres 
in the September quarter to 452 metres in the December quarter. Development in the current mine areas decreased by 58 per cent from 
518 metres in the September quarter to 217 metres in the December quarter.  Development North of Wrench decreased by 54 per cent from 
512 metres in the September quarter to 235 metres in the December quarter. New mine capital development on 100 level was suspended from 
the end of July 2018 as this activity was ahead of schedule and crews were re-allocated. New mine development amounted to 160 meters in 
the September quarter and to nil meters in the December quarter.

The current mine contributed 69 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the December quarter compared with 53 per cent in the September 
quarter with the balance from North of Wrench.  The decrease in the North of Wrench contribution was mainly due to lower destress 
performance as discussed above.  The tonnage contribution from longhole stoping decreased by 14 per cent from 59 per cent in the 
September quarter to 45 per cent in the December quarter due to lower stope availability. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 19 per cent from R941 million (US$66 million) to R763 million 
(US$52 million).  Cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciation decreased from R975 million 
(US$69 million) in the September quarter to R638 million (US$43 million) in the December quarter mainly due to lower salaries and 
wages, contractors and consumable costs in the December quarter due to the industrial action.  This was partially offset by a 
gold-in-process charge to cost of R125 million (US$9 million) in the December quarter compared with a credit to cost of R34 million 
(US$3 million) due to the drawdown of stockpiles in the December quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 17 per cent from R214 million (US$15 million) in the September quarter to R177 million (US$12 million) 
in the December quarter. 

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 5 per cent from R146 million (US$10 million) in the September quarter to R153 million 
(US$11 million) in the December quarter due to an increase in major component and rebuild costs for the mine?s fleet.  Non-sustaining 
capital expenditure decreased by 65 per cent from R69 million (US$5 million) to R24 million (US$1 million) due to the suspension of the 
new mine development.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 142 per cent from R758,304 per kilogram (US$1,663 per ounce) in the September quarter to 
R1,834,112 per kilogram (US$3,906 per ounce) in the December quarter mainly due to lower gold sold and higher sustaining capital 
expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Total all-in cost increased by 134 per cent from R804,998 per kilogram (US$1,764 per ounce) in the September quarter to R1,881,395 per 
kilogram (US$3,986 per ounce) in the December quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs, partially offset by lower 
non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 6 per cent from 126,500 ounces in the September quarter to 134,000 ounces in the December quarter mainly 
due to higher yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital waste stripping, increased by 2 per cent from 22.0 million tonnes in the September quarter to 
22.5 million tonnes in the December quarter.  Ore tonnes mined increased by 14 per cent from 3.5 million tonnes to 4.0 million tonnes 
due to increased mining volumes at Pepe and Akontansi pits in line with the mining plan.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 12 per cent from 6.7 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes due to accelerated mining at 
Akontansi and Pepe pits to expose ore.  Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 11.8 million tonnes to 11.0 million 
tonnes.  Mined grade increased by 2 per cent from 1.21 grams per tonne to 1.23 grams per tonne.  Gold mined increased by 15 per cent 
from 136,400 ounces to 157,200 ounces as a result of increased ore tonnes mined.  The strip ratio decreased from 5.3 to 4.7. 

The CIL plant throughput was similar at 3.5 million tonnes.  Yield increased by 6 per cent from 1.14 grams per tonne to 1.21 grams per 
tonne mainly due to higher grade ore mined and processed.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 9 per cent from US$76 million to US$83 million mainly due to increased 
operational tonnes mined, partially offset by a gold-in-process credit to costs of US$4 million in the December quarter compared with a 
charge to costs of US$3 million in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 11 per cent from US$38 million to US$34 million due to lower capital stripping.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent from US$972 per ounce in the September quarter to US$924 per 
ounce in the December quarter due to higher gold sold and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by increased cost of sales before 
amortisation and depreciation.

Gold production decreased by 22 per cent from 51,300 ounces in the September quarter to 40,000 ounces in the December quarter mainly 
due to lower head grade and tonnes processed as a consequence of a planned 16 day plant shutdown to replace the SAG mill shell.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 7 per cent from 11.4 million tonnes in the September quarter to 
10.6 million tonnes in the December quarter mainly due to space constraints at the Amoanda pit given its level of maturity, which was 
factored in to the operational plan. 

Ore tonnes mined increased by 8 per cent from 1.32 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.43 million tonnes in the December 
quarter mainly from Amoanda pit area where the ore zones are exposed.  Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 9 per cent from 
10.1 million tonnes to 9.2 million tonnes in line with the operational plan.  Capital waste tonnes included in total waste tonnes 
decreased by 16 per cent from 8.1 million tonnes to 6.8 million tonnes due to lower stripping volumes from the Amoanda and Saddle pits 
which are at the later stages of the current cutback.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 20 per cent from 2.0 million tonnes 
to 2.4 million tonnes also in line with the operational plan.  In the December quarter total tonnes mined at Amoanda pit were 
2.4 million tonnes and at DPCB were 8.2 million tonnes.

Head grade mined decreased by 13 per cent from 1.72 grams per tonne to 1.50 grams per tonne due to lower grade mined at the south of 
Amoanda pit.  Gold mined decreased by 5 per cent from 72,700 ounces to 68,800 ounces.  The strip ratio decreased from 7.7 to 6.4 due 
to exposed ore surfaces mined at the Amoanda pit.

Tonnes processed decreased by 10 per cent from 1.08 million tonnes in the September quarter to 0.97 million tonnes in the December 
quarter due to lower plant overall equipment availability as a result of a planned shutdown to replace the SAG mill shell.  Yield 
decreased by 17 per cent from 1.55 grams per tonne to 1.28 grams per tonne due to lower feed grade mined as a consequence of an 
increase in stockpiled tonnes processed.  The SAG mill shell replacement was completed ahead of schedule during December, by which time 
the target of 2018 has been achieved.  The strategic decision was taken to feed additional tonnes from low grade stockpile in order not 
to jeopardise the 2019 plan, which required a high-grade stockpile as per the 2019 plan.  In the December quarter, tonnes milled were 
sourced as follows: 0.84 million tonnes at 1.44 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.13 million tonnes at 1.03 grams per tonne from 
stockpiles.  This compared with 1.02 million tonnes at 1.75 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.06 million tonnes at 1.07 grams per 
tonne from stockpiles in the September quarter. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 14 per cent from US$29 million to US$33 million mainly due to higher 
operating tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 11 per cent from US$35 million in the September quarter to US$31 million in the December quarter as a 
result of lower capital waste tonnes mined.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 25 per cent from US$4 million to US$3 million.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure 
decreased by 10 per cent from US$31 million to US$28 million mainly due to lower capital waste mined (6.8 million tonnes in the 
December quarter compared with 8.1 million tonnes mined in the September quarter).

All-in sustaining costs increased by 37 per cent from US$682 per ounce in the September quarter to US$937 per ounce in the December 
quarter mainly due to lower gold sold and higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower 
sustaining capital expenditure. 

All-in costs increased by 24 per cent from US$1,288 per ounce in the September quarter to US$1,601 per ounce in the December quarter 
due to the same reasons above, partially offset by lower non-sustaining capital expenditure. 

At the end of the December 2018 quarter, and 24 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project (DRP), total material mined amounted to 
86 million tonnes, 23 per cent ahead of the project schedule.  Gold produced during the same period was 324,300 ounces, 38 per cent 
above the DRP ounces of 235,574.  The new SAG mill shell has been installed successfully.  The project capital spent to date is 
US$271 million versus the original DRP budget of US$228 million.

Gold production increased by 19 per cent from 40,700 ounces in the September quarter to 48,400 ounces in the December quarter due to 
higher grades mined and processed.  Copper production increased by 5 per cent from 8,437 tonnes to 8,849 tonnes due to higher grade 
mined and processed.  Equivalent gold production increased by 12 per cent from 83,200 ounces to 93,200 ounces mainly due to higher 
grade processed in line with the mining sequence. 

Gold head grade increased by 18 per cent from 1.14 grams per tonne to 1.35 grams per tonne and gold recoveries increased from 66.1 per 
cent to 68.3 per cent, in line with the mining sequence.  Copper head grade increased by 3 per cent from 0.58 per cent to 0.60 per cent 
and copper recoveries increased from 86.2 per cent to 90.3 per cent.  Gold yield increased by 27 per cent from 0.77 grams per tonne to 
0.98 grams per tonne due to higher head grade and recovery.  Copper yield increased by 14 per cent from 0.51 per cent to 0.58 per cent 
due to higher head grade and recovery.

In the December quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 45,494 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,227 per ounce 
and 8,369 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,426 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared 
with 38,980 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,206 per ounce and 8,191 tonnes of copper that was sold at an 
average price of US$5,335 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the September quarter. 

Total tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 5.44 million tonnes in the September quarter to 5.25 million tonnes in the December 
quarter mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence.  Ore mined increased by 5 per cent from 1.74 million tonnes 
to 1.82 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.70 million tonnes to 3.43 million tonnes in line 
with the mining plan.  The strip ratio decreased from 2.12 to 1.89.

Ore processed decreased by 6 per cent from 1.71 million tonnes to 1.60 million tonnes due to lower plant utilisation as a result of the 
planned plant shutdown in the December quarter. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 3 per cent from US$39 million to US$38 million mainly due to a 
US$5 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the December quarter compared with US$1 million in the September quarter as a result of 
an increase in stockpiles.

Capital expenditure increased by 18 per cent from US$11 million to US$13 million due to an increase in construction activities at the 
tailings dam and reallocation of infrastructure related to expansion to 2030.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 43 per cent from US$443 per ounce in the September quarter to 
US$252 per ounce in the December quarter mainly due to higher by-product credits and increased gold sold, partially offset by increased 
capital expenditure.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 6 per cent from US$691 per 
equivalent ounce to US$649 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above, as well as higher gold equivalent ounces sold.

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined decreased by 11 per cent from 83,300 tonnes in the September quarter to 
73,800 tonnes in the December quarter.  Head grade increased by 10 per cent from 3.41 grams per tonne to 3.76 grams per tonne with 
higher grade stopes mined during the December quarter as per the mining schedule.  Gold mined from Hamlet underground decreased by 
2 per cent from 9,100 ounces to 8,900 ounces.

Operations at the Invincible underground mine continued to grow.  Ore tonnes mined increased by 30 per cent from 192,000 tonnes in the 
September quarter to 249,400 tonnes in the December quarter.  Head grade mined decreased by 10 per cent from 4.16 grams per tonne to 
3.76 grams per tonne due to development carried out in December quarter in lower grade areas of the mine, resulting in a decrease in 
grades from development ore.  Gold mined from Invincible underground increased by 17 per cent from 25,700 ounces to 30,100 ounces.

Total tonnes mined at the open pits, decreased by 30 per cent from 4.7 million tonnes in the September quarter to 3.3 million tonnes in 
the December quarter.  

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 50 per cent from 0.6 million tonnes in the September quarter to 0.3 million 
tonnes in the December quarter with Neptune open pit the only source of ore, following the completion of mining activities at the 
Invincible open pit stage 5 in the September quarter.  

Grade mined from open pits, decreased by 40 per cent from 2.35 grams per tonne to 1.40 grams per tonne reflecting the lower grade ore 
mined from Neptune and no high grade ore delivered from Invincible following the completion of stage 5.  Gold mined from the open pits 
decreased by 69 per cent from 41,600 ounces to 13,100 ounces.  In the December quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 
0.3 million tonnes at 1.40 grams per tonne from Neptune and nil from Invincible.  This compared with 0.3 million tonnes at 3.28 grams 
per tonne from Invincible and 0.3 million tonnes at 1.15 grams per tonne from Neptune in the September quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 55 per cent from 1.1 million tonnes in the September quarter to 0.5 million tonnes in the 
December quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 17 per cent from 3.0 million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes.  The decrease 
in waste tonnes mined was due to the completion of Invincible stage 5 with the mining fleet utilised at Neptune open pit and also 
performing rehabilitation works at historic waste rock dumps.  Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 30 per cent from 
4.7 million tonnes to 3.3 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 7.4 to 10.6 driven by pre strip activity at Neptune.

Ounces mined at the total St Ives complex decreased by 32 per cent from 76,500 ounces in the September quarter to 52,200 ounces in the 
December quarter due to a 50 per cent reduction in ore tonnes mined at the open pits with the completion of mining activities at 
Invincible open pit stage 5.  At the end of the December quarter, stockpiled Neptune high-grade oxide material amounted to 
47,700 ounces (763,100 tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 100 ounces (2,000 tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne) and 
A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne).  This compared with Neptune high-grade oxide material which 
amounted to 65,300 ounces (997,700 tonnes at 1.57 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 32,200 ounces (227,200 tonnes at 2.55 grams 
per tonne) and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne), at the end of the September quarter.  Currently, 
Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide material blend.  The excess Neptune oxide material is stockpiled and fed to the mill 
so as to maintain the optimum blend. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill was similar at 1.08 million tonnes.  Yield decreased by 2 per cent from 2.58 grams per tonne to 
2.53 grams per tonne due to lower grades mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 28 per cent from A$65 million (US$48 million) to A$83 million 
(US$60 million).  The increase was due to a gold inventory charge to costs of A$16 million (US$12 million) in the December quarter 
compared with A$nil (US$nil) in the September quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 6 per cent from A$50 million (US$36 million) to A$47 million (US$34 million) due to lower capital 
development at Hamlet underground. Capital expenditure at Hamlet of A$nil (US$nil) in the December quarter compared with A$3 million 
(US$2 million) in the September quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 13 per cent from A$1,355 per ounce (US$993 per ounce) in the September 
quarter to A$1,533 per ounce (US$1,109 per ounce) in the December quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 2 per cent from 61,300 ounces in the September quarter to 62,400 ounces in the December quarter mainly due 
to higher grades mined and processed.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 1 per cent from 301,800 tonnes in the September quarter to 297,400 tonnes in the December 
quarter.  Head grade mined decreased by 7 per cent from 6.97 grams per tonnes to 6.49 grams per tonne mainly due to a decrease in ore 
mined from Waroonga?s high grade Bengal area in the December quarter.  Gold mined decreased by 8 per cent from 67,700 ounces to 
62,000 ounces due to lower grades mined.  In the December quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 153,800 tonnes at 8.2 grams per 
tonne from Waroonga and 143,600 tonnes at 4.6 grams per tonne from New Holland.  This compared with 153,200 tonnes at 10.2 grams per 
tonne from Waroonga and 148,600 tonnes at 3.7 grams per tonne from New Holland in the September quarter.  

Tonnes processed decreased by 10 per cent from 310,400 tonnes in the September quarter to 279,800 tonnes in the December quarter due to 
planned mill maintenance and unplanned jaw crusher maintenance in the December quarter.  The combined yield increased by 13 per cent 
from 6.15 grams per tonne to 6.93 grams per tonne due to the processing of high grade stockpiled material sourced from Waroonga?s 
Bengal area in the September quarter, and the processing of a historic New Holland stockpile which returned a positive grade

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 6 per cent from A$52 million (US$38 million) in the September quarter 
to A$55 million (US$39 million) in the December quarter mainly due to an increase in mining costs at Waroonga (A$3 million/
US$2 million) as a result of increased ore development in the December quarter and mill maintenance cost (A$1 million/US$1 million) 
following the mill and crusher maintenance shutdown in the December quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 13 per cent from A$24 million (US$18 million) to A$27 million (US$20 million) mainly due to increased 
expenditure on a new accommodation village in the December quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 9 per cent from A$1,300 per ounce (US$945 per ounce) in the September 
quarter to A$1,413 per ounce (US$1,013 per ounce) in the December quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation and higher capital expenditure as well as lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 72,100 ounces in the September quarter to 71,000 ounces in the December quarter mainly due 
to lower tonnes processed. 

Ore mined from underground increased marginally from 460,800 tonnes to 461,900 tonnes. Head grade mined increased by 4 per cent from 
4.94 grams per tonne in the September quarter to 5.15 grams per tonne in the December quarter in line with the geotechnical sequencing.  
As a result, overall ounces mined increased by 5 per cent from 73,200 ounces in the September quarter to 76,500 ounces in the December 
quarter. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 3 per cent from 478,700 tonnes in the September quarter to 464,000 tonnes in the December quarter due to 
timing of milling campaigns quarter on quarter.  The yield increased by 2 per cent from 4.68 grams per tonne to 4.77 grams per tonne 
due to higher head grade mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 2 per cent from A$60 million (US$44 million) in the September quarter 
to A$61 million (US$44 million) in the December quarter mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) increase in mining costs as a result 
of increased ore mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 27 per cent from A$30 million (US$22 million) to A$22 million (US$15 million).  The lower expenditure 
was due to lower mine capital development expenditure of A$3 million (US$2 million) with focus on ore development, lower exploration 
cost (A$3 million/US$2 million) and lower infrastructure expenditure following final payments for the new paste plant in the September 
quarter (A$3 million/US$2 million).

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 8 per cent from A$1,311 per ounce (US$957 per ounce) to A$1,204 per ounce 
(US$862 per ounce) due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by increased cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation 
and lower gold sold.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR?S REVIEW REPORT ON CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the shareholders of Gold Fields Limited
 
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited, contained in the accompanying preliminary 
report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 and the condensed consolidated 
income statement and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then 
ended, and selected explanatory notes, and the segmental financial results as set out on pages 19 - 29.

Directors? Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in the ""Basis for preparation"" note 
to the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.

Auditor?s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with International 
Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information performed by the independent auditor of 
the entity.  ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial 
statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard 
also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily 
consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and 
evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements 
of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2018 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in the ""Basis for preparation"" note to the 
financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

MEDIA RELEASE

Trading statement for FY 2018

Johannesburg, 6 February 2019: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that headline earnings per share for
the 12 months ended 31 December 2018 (FY 2018) is expected to
range from US$0.05-0.09 per share, 65-81% (US$0.17-0.21 per
share) lower than the headline earnings of US$0.26 per share
reported for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 (FY 2017).

Basic loss per share for FY 2018 is expected to range from
US$0.40-0.44 per share, 1900-2100% (US$0.38-0.42 per share)
higher than the basic loss of US$0.02 per share reported for FY
2017.

Normalised earnings per share for FY 2018 is expected to range
from US$0.01-0.05 per share, 74-95% (US$0.14-0.18 per share)
lower than the normalised earnings of US$0.19 per share reported
for FY 2017.

The basic loss for FY 2018 was higher than FY 2017 mainly due to
lower revenue and higher non-recurring costs, partially offset
by lower cost of sales.

Revenue in FY 2018 was lower than in FY 2017 primarily due to
lower gold sold at South Deep as a result of the restructuring
and industrial action in Q4 2018, as well as the sale of Darlot
in 2017. The rest of the operations within the portfolio
exceeded guidance for FY 2018.

Cost of sales in FY 2018 was lower than in FY 2017 mainly due to
lower amortisation primarily at Cerro Corona and South Deep.

Non-recurring costs in FY 2018 were higher than in FY 2017
mainly due to:
Higher impairment charge at South Deep as reported in H1 2018.
There was no additional impairment at year-end;
Higher retrenchment costs in FY 2018 compared to FY 2017, mainly
at Tarkwa and South Deep;
Higher loss on sale of inventory and assets in FY 2018 compared
to FY 2017, mainly at Tarkwa due to the conversion to contractor
mining in FY 2018.
This was partially offset by:
A tax credit as a result of the South Deep Tax Dispute
Settlement in FY 2018;
An accounting credit as a result of the acquisition of Asanko in
FY 2018.

For Q4 2018, attributable gold equivalent production is expected
to be 509koz (Q3 2018: 533koz), with all-in sustaining costs
(AISC) of US$1,016/oz (Q3 2018: US$977/oz) and all-in costs
(AIC) of US$1,213/oz (Q3 2018: US$1,140/oz).

Attributable gold equivalent production for 2018 is expected to
be 2.04Moz (FY17: 2.16Moz), exceeding revised guidance (provided
in November 2018) of 2.00Moz. Excluding Asanko, attributable
production for 2018 was 96% of original guidance (provided in
February 2018), almost exclusively due to the impact of the
lower production at South Deep, a significant proportion of
which is attributable to the strike. AISC and AIC are expected
to be US$981/oz (FY17: US$955/oz) and US$1,173/oz (FY17:
US$1,088/oz), respectively, both below the lower end of the
guidance range provided in February 2018  AISC: US$990-1,010/oz
and AIC: US$1,190-1,210/oz.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed, and reported on, by the Company's

South Deep and NUM reach agreement to end strike action


Johannesburg, 18 December 2018: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announced that it has reached
agreement with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) to
officially end the 45-day strike at its South Deep mine in South
Africa.

Employees have been returning to work since last Thursday (13
December 2018) when the NUM called off the strike, but the formal
settlement agreement to end the strike was only signed today after
a mass meeting held by the NUM.

In terms of the agreement, the retrenchments of 1,082 employees
will go ahead, with most of these retrenchments having already
been processed. Retrenched employees have been offered portable
skills training to assist in their future job searches.

To alleviate the financial burden of employees who were on the no-
work no-pay strike, South Deep has agreed to deduct the lost
earnings over four months and to pay all non-management
employees an ex-gratia payment of 20% of basic pay should they
have returned to work by the 15 December 2018. They can also earn
back part of their lost earnings if monthly gold production targets
are exceeded in January and February next year.

In the interest of the long-term operational and financial
sustainability of South Deep, the two parties have also agreed to:
    - Renegotiate and modernise the collective and other
        agreements, which govern the working relationship between
        the two parties.
    - A facilitated relationship building programme to address the
        difficult relationship between the NUM branch leadership
        and management.

Gold Fields embarked on a business restructuring and Section 189
retrenchment process at South Deep in mid-August 2018 in response
to continued high financial losses of around R100m a month.
The NUM branch at South Deep commenced its strike action on 2 November 2018 to protest the
retrenchments and used violence and intimidation to illegally block access to the mine. This prevented
South Deep from starting production, though critical essential services were maintained during the
strike. The mine experienced a cash burn of around R6m per day.

""With the strike over and our cost base adjusted to the reduced operating footprint and output, we
believe that we are well positioned to put South Deep on a sustainable road to recover and
significantly reduce our monthly cash losses at the mine,"" said Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland. ""We now
need to put this difficult period behind us and work together to build a sustainable future for our
employees, our communities, our shareholders and other stakeholders.""

Production is expected to build-up gradually from now on with the mine set to run production during
the Christmas/New Year break. In the meantime, the mine is ensuring that all safe start-up operating
processes have been completed.

""Detailed mine planning is currently under way and once the full impact of the mine planning exercise
and restructuring are complete, we expect to provide guidance for 2019 with our 2018 financial results
release in February 2019,"" Holland said.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF GOLD FIELDS 

Quarter overview 
Q3 2018 was characterised by the international assets posting another strong operating performance and South Deep negatively impacted 
by the restructuring announced in August 2018. Group attributable equivalent gold production was 533koz (+6% QoQ) for the quarter at 
AISC of US$977/oz and AIC of US$1,140/oz.

Despite our strong focus on safety, regrettably, there was a fatality at South Deep post quarter end and after the mine had achieved 
2 million fatality free shifts over 18 months. We are deeply saddened to announce that our colleague Ananias Mosololi, an underground 
LHD operator, tragically succumbed to his injuries on Saturday 13 October, following an accident that occurred underground at South 
Deep on Friday 12 October. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Mosololi.

South Deep
On 14 August, Gold Fields announced a proposed restructuring at South Deep, which could potentially affect 1,102 permanent employees 
and 460 contractors. The company has proposed to suspend mining activities in loss making areas of the mine and reduce operational and 
support staff commensurately, as well as suspend development activities in the New Mine area. Both trade unions were served with 
section 189 notices in terms of the Labour Relations Act on 14 August, which is when the legislated minimum 60-day consultation period 
commenced. Progress with the majority union (the NUM) was slow and confrontational during the consultation period and characterised by 
a lack of consensus. This resulted in low morale in the workforce and uncertainty about job security and as such, the restructuring 
process has had a negative impact on productivity at South Deep. During Q3 2018, the mine produced 1,539kg (50koz).

The consultation period ended on 30 October. The retrenchment process is now underway, with retrenchment letters having been issued to 
affected employees. As a consequence, the NUM has embarked on industrial action. While it is a protected strike, the no-work, no-pay 
principle will apply. As is always the case, the safety and security of our employees remains our main objective during the industrial 
action. 

Damang 
The reinvestment project at Damang continues to track ahead of plan. During Q3 2018, total tonnes mined were 20% ahead of plan at 
11.4Mt, whilst gold produced of 51koz at AISC of US$682/oz and AIC of US$1,288/oz was also ahead of expectations. Year-to-date, Damang 
has produced 141koz and is well on track to achieve full-year guidance of 160koz. 

Gruyere
Construction at Gruyere continued to make steady progress during Q3 2018 and the project remains on track for first production in 
Q2 2019. As at end-September 2018, overall project engineering and construction were 95% and 69% complete, respectively. EPC 
construction (process plant and associated infrastructure) was 55% complete. Downer, which was awarded a five-year mining contract in 
December 2017, has completed work on the mine workshops and supporting infrastructure and begun mobilising the mining fleet and 
operating team for commencement of mining operations in November 2018.

Salares Norte
The feasibility study at Salares Norte is on track for completion by the end of 2018. Results of the feasibility study are not expected 
to differ materially from the interim results which Gold Fields released in February 2018. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
was accepted for review on 11 July 2018. We anticipate a period of 18 to 24 months for the review to be completed.

Term loan maturity extended by 12 months
The Group has successfully extended the maturity of the US$380m term loan by 12 months to 6 June 2020 (from 6 June 2019) on the same 
terms, which results in no material debt maturities in 2019. The extension has been approved by the syndicate of lending banks. Gold 
Fields continues to proactively manage the balance sheet and will consider further refinancing of its debt during the course of 2019. 

Outlook for 2018
On 6 February 2018, the Group gave guidance for the year as follows: attributable equivalent gold production of between 2.08 million 
ounces and 2.10 million ounces.  AISC of between US$990 per ounce and US$1,010 per ounce and AIC of between US$1,190 per ounce and 
US$1,210 per ounce. These expectations assumed exchange rates of R/US$:12.00 and A$/US$:0.80.

On 24 April 2018, with the release of the Q1 results, the guidance was revised as result of the lower production outlook at South Deep 
due to the revised South Deep production outlook from 10,000 kilograms (321,000 ounces) to 7,600 kilograms (244,000 ounces). 
Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2018 was guided down to between 2.00 million ounces and 2.05 million ounces, 
with AISC and AIC unchanged.  

On 16 August 2018, the Group guided that attributable equivalent gold production for 2018 were expected to be on track with original 
guidance given in February, with the inclusion of Asanko, as Gold Fields expected to account for its contribution of 
43,000 attributable ounces from 31 July 2018. AISC was expected to be between US$990 per ounce and US$1,010 per ounce and AIC was 
planned to be between US$1,190 per ounce and US$1,210 per ounce, both as guided originally in February.

Taking into consideration the challenges we have been facing at South Deep, including as a result of the strike and go-slow post the 
announcement of the restructuring and assuming that the strike continues until the end of the year with the consequence of no further 
production from November month onwards at South Deep. Gold production for the year is currently estimated to be 4,800 kilograms 
(154,600 ounces).

The international operations (including our 45 per cent share of Asanko) are expected to produce 1.85 million attributable ounces, 
compared with original guidance of 1.75 million attributable ounces. This includes 45,000 attributable ounces from Asanko for 5 months.

As a consequence, Group attributable production is expected to be 2.00 million ounces. We are still on track to make our guidance on 
AISC of between US$990 per ounce and US$1,010 per ounce and AIC of between US$1,190 per ounce and US$1,210 per ounce.

Gold production increased by 1 per cent from 1,518 kilograms (48,800 ounces) in the June quarter to 1,539 kilograms (49,500 ounces) 
in the September quarter.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 326,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 319,000 tonnes in the September 
quarter. Ore tonnes mined increased by 15 per cent from 242,000 tonnes to 277,000 tonnes due to increased stoping output while 
underground waste mined decreased by 50 per cent from 84,000 tonnes to 42,000 tonnes.  The decline in underground waste was due to 
temporarily suspending New Mine Development, which is ahead of schedule, in order to curtail capital expenditure to reduce cash 
deficits in the business and to provide more focus on current mining activities to improve performance.  There was also a decrease in 
on reef access development from 58,600 tonnes to 48,800 tonnes, due to increased ground support and rehabilitation requirements. 
Underground reef grade mined decreased by 5 per cent from 6.48 grams per tonne to 6.14 grams per tonne due to lower destress and 
development grades.  Total gold mined from underground increased by 8 per cent from 1,567 kilograms (50,400 ounces) to 1,697 kilograms 
(54,600 ounces) mainly due to increased stoping output, partially offset by reduced development and destress contributions.

Total tonnes milled decreased by 2 per cent from 393,000 tonnes to 387,000 tonnes.  Underground ore tonnes milled increased by 5 per 
cent from 258,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 271,000 tonnes in the September quarter in line with ore production from underground.  
Underground waste milled decreased by 28 per cent from 60,000 tonnes to 43,000 tonnes due to reduced waste development as indicated 
above.  Surface tailings material treated decreased by 4 per cent from 75,000 tonnes to 73,000 tonnes.  Underground reef yield 
decreased by 4 per cent from 5.85 grams per tonne to 5.63 grams per tonne in line with reduced reef grade mined.

Gold recovered from underground was 1,529 kilograms (49,200 ounces) with 10 kilograms (320 ounces) being recovered from treatment of 
the surface material. 

Destress mining decreased by 28 per cent from 6,053 square metres in the June quarter to 4,356 square metres in the September quarter 
due to increased ground support and rehabilitation requirements related to slower than planned stope turnover.  

Longhole stoping increased by 57 per cent from 120,000 tonnes to 188,300 tonnes due to improved stope availability and improvements in 
drill and blast discipline.  The current mine contributed 65 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the September quarter compared with 
85 per cent in the June quarter with the balance from North of Wrench.  Total tonnes mined from longhole stoping of total tonnes broken 
increased from 37 per cent in the June quarter to 59 per cent in the September quarter. 

Development decreased by 33 per cent from 1,789 metres in the June quarter to 1,190 metres in the September quarter.  New mine capital 
development on 100 level decreased by 67 per cent from 492 metres to 160 metres due to the decision to suspend New Mine Development as 
from the end of July 2018, as well as a decrease in on reef access development.  Development in the current mine areas decreased by 
31 per cent from 747 metres to 518 metres due to additional ground support compounded by low equipment availability.  Development North 
of Wrench decreased by 7 per cent from 550 metres to 512 metres.

On 14 August, the company announced a proposed restructuring, which has affected 1,102 permanent employees and 460 contractors.  The 
company has suspended mining activities in loss making areas of the mine and reduced operational and support staff commensurately, as 
well as suspended New Mine Development activities.  This aims to reduce the cash deficit of the mine.  The mines two registered trade 
unions, the NUM and UASA were served with section 189 notices in terms of the Labour Relations Act.  The company elected to have 
consultations facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).  In terms of the legislation, these 
consultations took place over the minimum period of 60 days.  The consultations have been completed and focused on the business 
rational, alternatives to avoid job losses, selection criteria, severance packages and assistance to affected employees.  Progress with 
the majority union, the NUM, was very slow and confrontational and characterised by lack of consensus.  The proposed restructuring has 
had a negative impact on productivity due to uncertainty, low morale and the disruptive nature of the engagements with the majority 
union. 

The restructuring process was completed at the end of October and retrenchment letters were served on the affected 1,102 employees. 
Affected employees were offered voluntary separation packages and 171 took up the offer.  

Taking into consideration the challenges we have been facing at South Deep, including as a result of the strike and go-slow post the 
announcement of the restructuring and assuming that the strike continues until the end of the year with the consequence of no further 
production from November month onwards at South Deep. Gold production for the year is currently estimated to be 4,800 kilograms 
(154,600 ounces).

The aim of the restructuring is to move the mine closer to breakeven and it is hoped that the strike action will be concluded before 
year-end.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 1 per cent from R931 million (US$74 million) to R941 million 
(US$66 million) mainly due to increased electricity costs as a result of higher winter tariff, partially offset by a gold-in-process 
credit to costs of R34 million (US$3 million) in the September quarter compared with a charge of R12 million (US$1 million) in the 
June quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 4 per cent from R223 million (US$18 million) in the June quarter to R214 million (US$15 million) in 
the September quarter. 

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 11 per cent from R132 million (US$11 million) in the June quarter to R146 million 
(US$10 million) in the September quarter due to an increase in major component and rebuild costs for the mines fleet.  Non-sustaining 
capital expenditure decreased by 25 per cent from R91 million (US$7 million) to R68 million (US$5 million) due in part to the 
suspension of the new mine development.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 9 per cent from R697,450 per kilogram (US$1,736 per ounce) in the June quarter to R758,304 per 
kilogram (US$1,663 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to lower gold sold, higher cost of sales before amortisation and 
depreciation and higher sustaining capital expenditure. 

Total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent from R755,930 per kilogram (US$1,882 per ounce) in the June quarter to R804,998 per kilogram 
(US$1,764 per ounce) in the September quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs, partially offset by lower non-
sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 53,500 ounces in the June quarter to 51,300 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to 
lower head grade mined and processed from Amoanda pit.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 8 per cent from 12.4 million tonnes in the June quarter to 11.4 million 
tonnes in the September quarter in line with the operational plan.

Ore tonnes mined increased by 27 per cent from 1.04 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.32 million tonnes in the September quarter.  
Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 11 per cent from 11.4 million tonnes to 10.1 million tonnes in line with the operational plan.  
Capital waste tonnes included in total waste tonnes decreased by 8 per cent from 8.8 million tonnes 8.1 million tonnes due to lower 
stripping volumes from the Amoanda pit which is at the later stages of the current cutback.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased 
by 23 per cent from 2.6 million tonnes to 2.0 million tonnes also in line with the operational plan.   

Head grade mined decreased by 13 per cent from 1.97 grams per tonne to 1.72 grams per tonne due to lower grade mined south of the 
Amoanda pit due to re configuration of the main ramp to further optimise the pit. Gold mined increased by 10 per cent from 
66,100 ounces to 72,700 ounces.  The strip ratio decreased from 10.9 to 7.7 due to exposed ore surfaces mined at the Amoanda pit. 

Tonnes processed increased by 3 per cent from 1.05 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.08 million tonnes in the September quarter 
due to higher plant overall equipment efficiency.  Yield decreased by 2 per cent from 1.58 grams per tonne to 1.55 grams per tonne due 
to lower head grade mined.  In the September quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as follows: 1.02 million tonnes at 1.75 grams per 
tonne from the pits and 0.06 million tonnes at 1.07 grams per tonne from stockpiles.  This compared with 0.89 million tonnes at 
1.94 grams per tonne from the pits and 0.16 million tonnes at 0.60 grams per tonne from stockpiles in the June quarter. 

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 15 per cent from US$34 million to US$29 million mainly due to a 
decrease in cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciation due to lower operating tonnes mined, as well 
as a higher gold-in-process credit to cost of US$7 million in the September quarter compared with US$4 million in the June quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from US$36 million in the June quarter to US$35 million in the September quarter as a 
result of lower capital waste tonnes mined.

Sustaining capital expenditure was similar at US$4 million.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from 
US$32 million to US$31 million mainly due to lower capital waste mined (8.1 million tonnes in the September quarter compared with 
8.8 million tonnes mined in the June quarter).

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 9 per cent from US$746 per ounce in the June quarter to US$682 per ounce in the September quarter 
mainly due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially offset by lower gold sold. 

All-in costs decreased by 4 per cent from US$1,347 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,288 per ounce in the September quarter due to 
the same reasons as above as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure. 

At the end of the September 2018 quarter and 21 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project (DRP), total material mined amounted to 
75 million tonnes, 25 per cent ahead of the project schedule.  Gold produced during the same period was 284,300 ounces, 45 per cent 
above the DRP ounces of 196,100.  All major projects are on schedule.  The SAG mill shell replacement is on track with installation and 
commissioning planned for the December 2018 quarter. The project to date capital spent is US$240 million.

Gold production increased by 32 per cent from 30,900 ounces in the June quarter to 40,700 ounces in the September quarter due to higher 
grades mined and processed as well as higher ore processed.  Copper production increased by 15 per cent from 7,317 tonnes to 
8,437 tonnes due to higher grade and increased ore processed.  Equivalent gold production increased by 21 per cent from 69,000 ounces 
to 83,200 ounces mainly due to higher grade ore processed in line with the mining sequence, partially offset by the lower price factor. 

Gold head grade increased by 28 per cent from 0.89 grams per tonne to 1.14 grams per tonne and gold recoveries decreased from 69.7 per 
cent to 66.1 per cent, in line with the mining sequence and the operational plan. Copper head grade increased by 7 per cent from 
0.54 per cent to 0.58 per cent and copper recoveries decreased from 87.6 per cent to 86.2 per cent.  Gold yield increased by 28 per 
cent from 0.60 grams per tonne to 0.77 grams per tonne due to higher head grade, partially offset by lower recoveries.  The lower 
recoveries were due to high clay content, which required higher lime.  Copper yield increased by 11 per cent from 0.46 per cent to 
0.51 per cent due to higher head grade.

In the September quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 38,980 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,206 per 
ounce and 8,191 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,335 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This 
compared with 28,475 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,302 per ounce and 7,105 tonnes of copper that was sold 
at an average price of US$6,244 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the June quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 5.24 million tonnes in the June quarter to 5.44 million tonnes in the September quarter 
mainly due to higher ore mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined increased by 7 per cent from 1.62 million tonnes to 
1.74 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 2 per cent from 3.62 million tonnes to 3.70 million tonnes in line 
with the mining plan.  The strip ratio decreased from 2.24 to 2.12.  As previously mentioned the strip ratio is higher than previous 
averages due to the need to accelerate mining in line with the 2030 life extension project.

Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.67 million tonnes to 1.71 million tonnes due to lower ore hardness.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 3 per cent from US$40 million to US$39 million mainly due to a 
US$1 million gold-in-process credit to cost as a result of an increase in stockpiles in the September quarter compared with a charge 
of US$2 million due to a drawdown of stockpiles in the June quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 57 per cent from US$7 million to US$11 million due to an increase in construction activities at the 
tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the dry season.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce increased by 40 per cent from US$316 per ounce in the June quarter to 
US$443 per ounce in the September mainly due to higher capital expenditure and lower by-product credits due to the lower copper price 
received, partially offset by increased gold sold.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 
13 per cent from US$795 per equivalent ounce to US$691 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above, as well as higher gold 
equivalent ounces sold, partially offset by higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 94,600 ounces in the June quarter to 89,200 ounces in the September quarter. 

Total ore tonnes mined decreased by 27 per cent from 1.1 million tonnes in the June quarter to 0.8 tonnes in the September quarter.

Total underground ore tonnes mined increased by 52 per cent from 181,600 tonnes in the June quarter to 275,300 tonnes in the September 
quarter.

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 86,200 tonnes in the June quarter to 83,300 tonnes 
in the September quarter.  Head grade decreased by 14 per cent from 3.96 grams per tonne to 3.41 grams per tonne with lower grade 
stopes mined during the September quarter as per the mining schedule.  Gold mined from Hamlet underground decreased by 17 per cent from 
11,000 ounces to 9,100 ounces.

Operations at the Invincible underground mine continued to grow with ore tonnes mined increasing by 101 per cent from 95,400 tonnes in 
the June quarter to 192,000 tonnes in the September quarter.  Head grade mined decreased by 22 per cent from 5.34 grams per tonne to 
4.16 grams per tonne due to lower development ore grades, as development is no longer going through these high-grade areas, as 
anticipated. Gold mined from Invincible underground increased by 58 per cent from 16,300 ounces to 25,700 ounces.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 33 per cent from 0.9 million tonnes in the June quarter to 0.6 million tonnes 
in the September quarter with the completion of mining activities at the Invincible open pit stage 5 on 28 August 2018 as scheduled. 

Grade mined from open pits, decreased by 11 per cent from 2.63 grams per tonne to 2.35 grams per tonne due to the lower proportion of 
high grade ore delivered from Invincible following the completion of stage 5.  Gold mined from open pits decreased by 46 per cent from 
77,700 ounces to 41,600 ounces due to lower tonnes mined.  In the September quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.3 million 
tonnes at 3.28 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.3 million tonnes at 1.15 grams per tonne from Neptune.  This compared with 
0.6 million tonnes at 3.17 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.3 million tonnes at 1.52 grams per tonne from Neptune in the June 
quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 50 per cent from 2.2 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.1 million tonnes in the 
September quarter and capital waste tonnes mined increased by 30 per cent from 2.3 million tonnes to 3.0 million tonnes due to the 
completion of Invincible stage 5 and relocation of the mining fleet to Neptune open pit for pre-strip activity.  Total material 
movements at the open pits decreased by 15 per cent from 5.4 million tonnes to 4.7 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 
4.9 to 7.4 driven by pre strip activity at Neptune.

Ounces mined at the total St Ives complex decreased by 27 per cent from 105,100 ounces in the June quarter to 76,500 ounces in the 
September quarter due to a 40 per cent reduction in ore tonnes mined at the open pits with the completion of mining activities at 
Invincible open pit stage 5.  At the end of the September quarter, stockpiled Neptune high-grade oxide material amounted to 
65,300 ounces (997,700 tonnes at 1.57 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 32,200 ounces (227,200 tonnes at 2.55 grams per tonne) 
and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne).  This compared with Neptune high-grade oxide material 
stockpiles of 77,600 ounces (1,142,000 tonnes at 2.34 grams per tonne), Invincible stockpiles of 44,500 ounces (375,000 tonnes at 
2.81 grams per tonne) and A5 stockpiles of 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne), at the end of the June quarter.  
Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide material blend.  The excess Neptune oxide material is stockpiled and fed 
to the mill so as to maintain the optimum blend. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 6 per cent from 1.02 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.08 million tonnes in the 
September quarter with higher plant availability during the quarter, following a scheduled major maintenance shutdown in the June 
quarter.  Yield decreased by 11 per cent from 2.89 grams per tonne to 2.58 grams per tonne mainly due to stockpile movements quarter-
on-quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 3 per cent from A$63 million (US$48 million) to A$65 million 
(US$48 million).  The increase was due to a gold inventory credit to costs of A$nil (US$nil) in the September quarter compared with 
A$9 million (US$6 million) in the June quarter, partially offset by reduced mining costs at the open pits in the September quarter 
(A$4 million/US$3 million) due to lower operational tonnes mined, and lower processing costs (A$3 million/US$2 million) following the 
major maintenance shutdown in the June quarter.  

Capital expenditure increased by 39 per cent from A$36 million (US$27 million) to A$50 million (US$36 million) due to increased capital 
development at Invincible underground and Neptune open pit (A$8 million/US$7 million), and increased exploration drilling costs at 
Invincible underground (A$4 million/US$3 million). 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 23 per cent from A$1,103 per ounce (US$839 per ounce) in the June quarter to 
A$1,355 per ounce (US$993 per ounce) in the September quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, higher 
capital expenditure at Invincible and Neptune as planned and lower gold sold.

Gold production increased by 8 per cent from 56,800 ounces in the June quarter to 61,300 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to 
higher grades mined and processed.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 7 per cent from 323,900 tonnes in the June quarter to 301,800 tonnes in the September quarter.  
This was largely due to a change in the mining sequence in the FBH area at Waroonga following updated geotechnical recommendations that 
have reduced available stoping fronts for the quarter.  Head grade mined increased by 16 per cent from 6.01 grams per tonnes to 
6.97 grams per tonne with increased material mined from the high grade Bengal area at Waroonga.  Gold mined increased by 8 per cent 
from 62,600 ounces to 67,700 ounces.  In the September quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 153,200 tonnes at 10.2 grams per 
tonne from Waroonga and 148,600 tonnes at 3.7 grams per tonne from New Holland.  This compared with 168,000 tonnes at 8.3 grams per 
tonne from Waroonga and 155,900 tonnes at 3.6 grams per tonne from New Holland in the June quarter.  

Tonnes processed increased by 2 per cent from 304,900 tonnes in the June quarter to 310,400 tonnes in the September quarter.  The 
combined yield increased by 6 per cent from 5.79 grams per tonne to 6.15 grams per tonne due to the higher grades mined, as a result 
of increased material from the high grade Bengal area as discussed above.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 4 per cent from A$50 million (US$37 million) in the June quarter to 
A$52 million (US$38 million) in the September quarter mainly due to an increase in mining costs of A$1 million (US$1 million) as a 
result of the increased ore development metres advanced in the September quarter.  In addition, a gold-in-circuit credit of A$nil 
(US$nil) in the September quarter compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter.  The credit to cost in the June quarter 
was primarily due to a build-up of stockpiles with more ore mined than processed.   

Capital expenditure decreased by 4 per cent from A$25 million (US$19 million) to A$24 million (US$18 million) mainly due to decreased 
capital development expenditure with less capital development and increased ore development costs in the September quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent from A$1,383 per ounce (US$1,044 per ounce) in the June quarter 
to A$1,300 per ounce (US$945 per ounce) in the September quarter due to lower capital expenditure and higher gold sold, partially 
offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Gold production increased by 7 per cent from 67,400 ounces in the June quarter to 72,100 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to 
increased ore tonnes mined and processed. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 9 per cent from 423,700 tonnes to 460,800 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 6 per cent from 
5.23 grams per tonnes in the June quarter to 4.94 grams per tonne in the September quarter in line with the geotechnical sequencing 
inherent in the plan.  As a result of the 9 per cent increase in tonnes mined and the 6 per cent decrease in grade, overall ounces 
mined increased by 3 per cent from 71,300 ounces in the June quarter to 73,200 ounces in the September quarter. 

Tonnes processed increased by 18 per cent from 406,400 tonnes in the June quarter to 478,700 tonnes in the September quarter due to 
increased availability of mined ore and the timing of milling campaigns quarter on quarter.  The yield decreased by 9 per cent from 
5.16 grams per tonne to 4.68 grams per tonne due to lower head grade mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 11 per cent from A$54 million (US$41 million) in the June quarter to 
A$60 million (US$44 million) in the September quarter mainly due to a A$4 million (US$3 million) increase in mining costs as a result 
of increased ore mined and a A$2 million (US$2 million) gold-in-circuit charge to costs in the September quarter compared with 
A$1 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$30 million (US$22 million).  During the September quarter, A$22 million (US$17 million) was 
spent on mine development and infrastructure projects and A$8 million (US$5 million) was spent on exploration activities.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost was similar at A$1,311 per ounce (US$957 per ounce).  The increase in cost of sales 
before amortisation and depreciation of A$6 million (US$3 million) was offset by increased gold sold.

Gruyere
First gold remains scheduled for the June 2019 quarter, in line with the guidance issued in April 2018. The final forecast capital 
(FFC) cost estimate remains at A$621 million (level of accuracy range + 2 per cent/-2 per cent) as reported by the joint venture 
partners on 30 July 2018.

In accordance with the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition, Gold Fields will fund up to 10 per cent 
of costs overruns, excluding scope changes and force majeure costs.  This translates to approximately A$51 million.  Consequently, 
Gold Fields share of the FFC is A$337 million with A$203 million having been incurred up to the end of September 2018. As at 
30 September 2018, overall project engineering and construction was 95 per cent and 69 per cent complete, respectively, with EPC 
construction (process plant and associated infrastructure) 55 per cent complete.

We believe that the long-life, low-cost nature of Gruyere will improve the Gold Fields portfolio.

MEDIA RELEASE


NUM gives strike notice at South Deep mine


Johannesburg, 1 November 2018: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) yesterday received a notice by the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) of its intention to embark on a protected strike at its South Deep
operation in South Africa to protest retrenchments at the mine. Under South
African labour law, the union is required to give 48 hours notice of its
intention to strike. The strike is set to commence tomorrow (2 November
2018) afternoon.

About 80% of the mines workforce are members of the union and, should the
strike proceed, it is expected to impact adversely on production during its
duration. Safety of employees is paramount and, if deemed necessary, South
Deep would also consider cessation of production for a limited period of
time.

As part of a wide-ranging restructuring announcement to stem South Deeps
significant cash losses and consolidate current operations, Gold Fields
commenced a Section 189 process with the mines two registered trade unions,
the NUM and UASA, on 14 August 2018. Under the auspices of the Commission
for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), mine management has
engaged the branch leadership of the two unions since then about various
matters related to the section 189 process.

Consultations have been extensive with various options explored to improve
the sustainability of the mine and limit job losses. This included an offer
of voluntary severance packages, which was taken up by 177 employees.

Despite these efforts South Deep still has to reduce its workforce by
approximately 1,100 staff members and retrenchment letters were sent to
these employees on 31 October 2018. In addition, the mine will reduce the
number of contractors by approximately 420 people.

The selection criteria used to determine which employees would be affected
were part of the Section 189 consultations and included length of service,
performance and competency criteria and attendance records. Prior to the
commencement of the Section 189 process South Deep employed 3,614 full-time
employees and 2,214 contractors.

""We have reached a critical stage in the restructuring at South Deep, which
follows on previous unsuccessful initiatives to improve productivity,"" said
Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland. ""The restructuring will help to reduce the
risk of continuing operating losses and consolidates the current mining
operations as a first step to building a sustainable, long-term operation.
Unfortunately, the retrenchments and the reduction in contractor numbers
have become essential to ensure this and save the remaining 3,500 jobs.""

""South Deep has a substantial and well-understood ore body and we believe
that we can bring this into profitable production over the next few years
which will benefit all stakeholders, including the Westonaria communities
and the South African government,"" Holland added.

The no work, no pay principle will apply for the strike. ""We respect the
laws that allow for a peaceful, legal strike, but we are very concerned
about the further impact that industrial action will have on the mine - and
on our employees, with potentially more job losses,"" Holland said.

Gold Fields will announce South Deeps latest production performance as part
of the Groups Q3 2018 operational update to be released on 9 November 2018.

JOHANNESBURG. 16 August 2018: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) today announced losses attributable to owners of the parent from
continuing operations for the six months to 30 June 2018 of US$367m (US$0.45 cent per share). This compared with profit of
US$54m (US$0.07 cent per share) for the six months to 30 June 2017. Normalised profit from continuing operations of US$43m for the
six months to 30 June 2018 compared with US$78m for the six months to 30 June 2017.

An interim dividend of 20 SA cents per share (gross) is payable on 10 September 2018.

Statement by Nick Holland,
Chief Executive Officer
of Gold Fields

H1 2018 Performance
Safety remains our number one priority and we are pleased to report a fatal free period for the six months ended June 2018. In
addition, the total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) for the Group improved by 10% YoY to 2.13. Our drive toward zero harm
continues.

The international operations continued to perform well for the six months ended June 2018 generating c.US$190m in net cash flow
(before project capex) for the group.

Gold Fields is in a strong financial position, with the integrity of the balance sheet remaining intact after funding cumulative
project expenditure (Damang and Gruyere) of US$330m over the past 18 months.
As reported in the recent trading statement, attributable gold equivalent production from continuing operations, for the six months
ended 30 June 2018, was 994koz (for the six months ended June 2017: 1,022koz). All-in sustaining costs for the period were US$965/oz
(for the six months ended June 2017: US$967/oz), with all-in costs of US$1,169/oz (for the six months ended June 2017: US$1,092/oz) as
a result of the higher project capital, as was planned.

Normalised profit from continuing operations for the six months ended June 2018 was US$43m or US$0.05 per share, compared with
US$78m or US$0.09 per share in for the six months ended June 2017. Normalised profit was impacted by higher exploration expenditure
this half year particularly as activities at Salares Norte have increased to complete the feasibility study by year end.

In line with our dividend policy of paying out between 25% and 35% of normalised profit as dividends, we have declared an interim
dividend of 20 SA cents per share which compared with the 2017 interim dividend of 40 SA cents per share.



Net cash flow for continuing operations from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments was an
outflow of US$79m, compared with an outflow of US$102m for the six months ended June 2017, mainly due to the growth capital spent at
Gruyere, Damang and Salares Norte. We previously indicated that we expected to be cash negative in 2017and 2018 as a consequence of
building two new mines in the Group and our ongoing study at Salares Norte. Excluding the project capital of US$179m for the half year,
the net cash flow would have been an inflow of US$100m for the six months ended June 2018.

The net debt balance increased by US$90m to US$1,393m from US$1,303m at the end of FY 2017, with the net debt to EBITDA ratio
marginally higher at 1.07x (December 2017: 1.03x) but still well below the debt covenant level of 2.5x.

Update on projects
Damang
The Damang reinvestment project continued to track well against plan for the six months ended June 2018. Total tonnes mined increased
26% YoY to 23.9Mt for the six months ended June 2018 which was slightly ahead of plan. Gold produced increased 16% YoY to 89.5koz,
driven by higher grade material mined and processed during the half year.

Capital expenditure was 9% higher YoY at US$73m, with US$61m spent on capital waste stripping and the balance spent on engineering
projects, Amoanda Phase 2 infill drilling and construction of the Far East TSF. AISC decreased 18% YoY to US$829/oz while AIC decreased
7% YoY to US$1,585/oz.

The potential at Amoanda continues to increase, following a successful drilling campaign, which will provide additional flexibility to
the operation when the main Damang pit commences production in Q2 2019.

Gruyere
As reported by the joint venture partners (on 30 July 2018), the independent third party review of the Definitive Estimate (DE) for the
Gruyere Gold Project including the Final Forecast Capital (FFC) cost estimate has been completed. First gold remains scheduled for the
June 2019 quarter which is in line with the guidance issued in April 2018. However, the FFC is now estimated to be A$621m (level of
accuracy range -2% / +2%) which includes scope changes and force majeure costs of A$30m along with a contingency of A$30m. This compares
with the original budget of A$532m, with A$329m spent on the project to date. A$185 m is expected to be spent in the second part of the
year.

As per the Joint Venture agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition, Gold Fields will fund up to 10% of costs overruns,
excluding scope changes and force majeure costs. This translates to approximately A$51m. Consequently, Gold Fields share of the FFC is
A$337m, with A$164m having been incurred up to the end of June 2018.
As at 27 July 2018, overall Project engineering and construction was 94% and 61% complete respectively with EPC construction (process
plant and associated infrastructure) 39% complete.

Despite the increased capital for the project, we believe that the long-life, low-cost nature of Gruyere will subsequently improve the
Gold Fields portfolio.

Salares Norte
The feasibility study for Salares Norte is on track for completion at the end of 2018. As previously guided, the mine is expected to
produce 3.5Moz gold equivalent ounces over a 10-year life, with average AISC of around US$575/oz and initial capex of US$850m.
On 5 July 2018, the Environment Impact Assessment was accepted for evaluation by the Chilean regulatory authorities.

Regional performance
Australia
Gold production for the Australia region for the six months ended June 2018 was 1% lower YoY at 442koz, mainly due to lower production
at Granny Smith, partially offset by increased production at St Ives. AIC for the region (excluding Gruyere) was 2% lower YoY in
A$ terms at A$1,166/oz and 1% higher YoY in US$ terms at US$900/oz. Net cash flow from the region for the six months ended June 2018,
excluding the US$79m spent on Gruyere, was an inflow of US$86m.

During the six months ended June 2018, A$40m of the exploration budget was spent, with 387,800 metres drilled during the period. There
have been encouraging results at all operations including extensions at Wallaby at Granny Smith, both laterally and at depth, as well
as extensions at the Greater Invincible complex at St Ives. The prefeasibility study on the Paleochannel Project at St Ives continued
in the six months ended June 2018, with progress being made on the mining method. At Agnew, drilling at Waroonga North continued to
yield positive results and Redeemer is emerging as a potential new ore source for the future.

West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region decreased by 1% YoY for the six months ended June 2018 at 319koz due to lower
production at Tarkwa, partially offset by increased production at Damang. AIC for the region decreased 2% YoY to US$1,114/oz due to
lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and sustaining capital. Project capex for the Damang reinvestment was
US$66m for the six months ended June 2018, compared with US$53m for the six months ended June 2017. The AISC for the Ghana region
(which excludes the project capex for Damang) decreased 7% YoY to US$924/oz. The region generated a net cash outflow of US$2m for the
six months to June 2018. Again, if the project capex for Damang is excluded, the region would have generated a net cash inflow of
US$64m.

South America
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona increased marginally YoY to 137koz. AIC increased by 9% YoY to US$737 per
equivalent ounce, mainly due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower equivalent ounces sold. Despite
this, the mine generated net cash flow of US$41m for the six months ended June 2018.

South Deep
Gold Fields announced   a material restructuring of its South Deep operation on 14 August 2018. The mine has had a number of operational
challenges since Gold   Fields acquired it in 2006. The key challenge has been the difficulty in transitioning the mine from one run with
a conventional mining   mindset and practices to mining with a modern, bulk, mechanised mining approach. South Deep is a complex and
unique mine, that has   faced persistent issues that need to be addressed in a holistic manner.

Despite numerous interventions to address these challenges, including optimising the mining method, extensive training and skills
development, changing shift and work configurations, and outsourcing functions, the mine continues to make losses (R4bn over the past
five years). Management believes that the mine can no longer sustain these cash losses and that the cost structure needs to be
realigned with the current lower level of production.

During Q1 2018, South Deep completed phase 2 of its organisational restructuring plan, focusing on the lower levels of the
organisation, through a voluntary retrenchment programme, which resulted in 261 employees leaving the company This followed the
restructuring in Q4 2017 (phase 1) at the more senior levels of the business, which comprised a 25% reduction (47 employees) in the
management level.

Although this restructuring was mostly voluntary in   nature, it nonetheless had a significant negative impact on morale and consequently
productivity and output during the six months ended   30 June 2018. In addition, continued low mobile equipment reliability and
productivity, the intersection of active geological   features (faults and dykes) in the high-grade corridor 3 and poor ground conditions
in the composites (far western part of the orebody)   slowed production rates.

For the six months to 30 June 2018, production at South Deep decreased by 19% YoY to 3,003kg (97koz) from 3,710kg (119koz)) for the six
months ended June 2017 driven by decreased volumes and grade. AIC for the six months ended June 2018 increased 8% YoY to R715,373/kg
(US$1,816/oz), mainly due to lower gold sold. Net cash outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2018 was R656m (US$54m).

These challenges have resulted in an underperformance on development and destress mining and has impacted stope availability and
output. Stope availability and output has also been adversely affected as a result of slow loading and backfilling. These challenges
will not only impact the mines 2018 performance but the knock-on effect will carry through into 2019 and beyond.

Section 189 process commenced
Management has commenced with consultations in terms of Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. It is envisaged that approximately
1,100 permanent employees could potentially be impacted by the proposed restructuring. In addition, approximately 460 contractors could
also potentially be impacted. South Deep currently employs 3,614 full-time employees and 1,940 contractors. Section 189 notices have
been served on its two representative trade unions, the National Union of Mineworkers and UASA. This will be followed by a 60-day
consultation process, which will be facilitated by the CCMA. The Minister of Mineral Resources has been informed of these developments.

Focus on securing the future with intensive near term initiatives
In support of returning the mine to sustainable profitability we propose to:
- Temporarily suspend mining activities at 87 Level and redeploy these mining crews into the 4W corridor;
- Service the eastern part of the mine from the Twin Shafts and re-staff the South Shaft operations to a single shift per day.
   South Shaft will facilitate the provision of the following services to the full mining operation: Water and Backfill reticulation,
   Water Pumping, Ventilation;
- Reduce growth capital expenditure for the next 18 months to reduce the cash burn. New mine development has outperformed the plan in
   recent years, which allows us some flexibility to reduce this activity for the near term.

Given the significant impact of the restructuring from late 2017 and early 2018, we are unable to quantify the impact of the proposed
large scale restructuring on production in 2019 and beyond.

Consequently, the previously guided build-up plan for the mine (released in February 2018) has a high degree of risk and uncertainty
and can no longer be relied upon.

South Deep impairment
The underperformance of the mine in 2018 and the resultant knock-on impact has necessitated a further impairment of South Deep. As
discussed above, we are unable to provide guidance for 2019 and beyond. However, for the purpose of the impairment calculation, we
have used a number equivalent to extrapolating the six months ended 30 June 2018 production for 2019 of 6,100kg (196koz).

As a result, South Deep has been further impaired by R4.8bn (US$359m) (net of tax) to a carrying value of R20.7bn (US$1.5bn). The
information underlying the impairment calculation may be subject to further adjustments in the future. These adjustments could be as
a result of further information becoming available to management during Gold Fields production planning processes.

Joint Venture with Asanko Gold
The Joint Venture transaction with Asanko Gold (Asanko) was completed on 31 July 2018, with Gold Fields acquiring a 50% stake in
Asankos 90% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine in Ghana. Gold Fields is expected to equity account its share in the Joint Venture,
with attributable production and costs incorporated into the Group numbers from completion. Asankos published guidance for 2019-2023
is average annual production of 253koz (100% basis).

Gold Fields and Asanko have established various working groups to ensure that the Asanko Gold Mine continues to operate in an efficient
manner.

FY18 guidance adjusted
Attributable equivalent gold production for 2018, including Asanko, is expected to be within the original guidance (14 February 2018)
of between 2.08Moz and 2.10Moz. AISC is expected to be between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce and AIC is expected to be
between US$1,190 per ounce to US$1,210 per ounce, both as previously guided.

The South Deep production guidance factored into the Group production guidance is unchanged from the 7,600kg provided in April 2018
(with Q1 2018 results). However, given the potential volatility related to the proposed restructuring, there is an increased level of
uncertainty with this forecast.

Gold Fields will account for its contribution from the Asanko Joint Venture from 31 July 2018. As such, production of 43koz is expected
to be attributable to Gold Fields from the JV.

Change   in Directorship
Mr Don   Ncube retired after the AGM in May 2018, having spent over 12 years on the Board, of which he has been Chair of the Social,
Ethics   and Transformation Committee for the past 5 years. I would like to thank Don for his service to Gold Fields and wish him well
in his   future endeavours.

RESULTS FOR THE GROUP

Safety
The Groups fatality injury frequency rate improved from 0.07 for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 0.00 for the six months ended
30 June 2018. The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group improved by 10 per cent from 2.37 for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to 2.13 for the six months ended 30 June 2018.

1   Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically
    Treated Injuries4) x 1,000,000/ number of man-hours worked.
2   A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend work for a period
    of one or more days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform any functions.
3   A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the employee or
    contractor being unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the day after the injury
    occurred. The employee or contractor can still perform some of his duties.
4   A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which does not incapacitate that
    employee and who, after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately resume his/her normal duties on the next
    calendar day, immediately following the treatment/re-treatment.

For the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with the six months ended 30 June 2017

Revenue
Attributable equivalent gold production from continuing operations decreased by 3 per cent from 1,022,000 ounces for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to 994,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018. South Deep, Tarkwa and Granny Smith produced less gold in
the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with the six months ended June 2017.

Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, decreased by 19 per cent from 3,710 kilograms (119,300 ounces) to 3,003 kilograms
(96,500 ounces).

Attributable gold production at the West African operations decreased by 1 per cent from 322,600 ounces for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to 318,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to decreased production at Tarkwa, partially offset by
increased production at Damang. Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru increased marginally from
136,300 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 136,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Gold production at
the Australian operations decreased by 1 per cent from 444,300 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 442,400 ounces for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower production at Granny Smith, partially offset by increased production at St Ives.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep decreased by 19 per cent from 3,710 kilograms (119,300 ounces) for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to 3,003 kilograms (96,500 ounces) due to decreased volumes and grades. Production was negatively impacted by
labour restructuring and the implementation of a new shift system on 1 March 2018, along with the effect of remediation of ground
conditions in predominantly high grade areas of the mine. Gold sold decreased by 13 per cent from 3,740 kilograms (120,200 ounces) to
3,240 kilograms (104,200 ounces).

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa decreased by 6 per cent from 281,500 ounces for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to 264,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower yield. At Damang, managed gold production
increased by 16 per cent from 76,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 89,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June
2018 mainly due to higher grade material mined and processed. Gold produced and gold sold are the same for both Tarkwa and Damang.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona increased marginally from 137,000 ounces for
the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 137,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to a higher conversion factor,
partially offset by lower gold sold. Gold equivalent ounces sold decreased by 3 per cent from 135,700 ounces to 131,700 ounces.

At the Australia region, St Ives gold production increased by 3 per cent from 184,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to

184,100 ounces to 190,200 ounces. At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production decreased marginally from 115,500 ounces for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to 115,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Gold sold increased by 1 per cent from 115,500 ounces to
116,900 ounces. At Granny Smith, gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 144,700 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to 137,200 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to decreased tonnes mined and processed. Gold sold decreased by 5 per cent
from 144,700 ounces to 137,300 ounces.

ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,306 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The average rand gold price decreased by
1 per cent from R525,042 per kilogram to R518,504 per kilogram. The average Australian dollar gold price increased by 4 per cent from
A$1,642 per ounce to A$1,707 per ounce. The average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations increased by 7 per cent from
US$1,232 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,318 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The average
equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment and refining charges, for Cerro Corona increased by 1 per cent from US$1,221 per
equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,228 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The
average US dollar/Rand exchange rate strengthened by 7 per cent from R13.24 for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to R12.25 for the
six months ended 30 June 2018. The average Australian/US dollar exchange rate strengthened by 3 per cent from A$1.00 = US$0.75 to
A$1.00 = US$0.77.

Gold equivalent ounces sold decreased by 3 per cent from 1.06 million ounces to 1.03 million ounces.

Revenue increased by 4 per cent from US$1,305 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,351 million for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 due to the higher gold price, partially offset by decreased gold sold.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation
Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 1 per cent from US$678 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$688 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018.

At the South Africa region, at South Deep, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 6 per cent from
R1,997 million (US$151 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to R1,882 million (US$154 million) for the six months ended
30 June 2018 mainly due to lower production as well as lower expenditure on consumable costs, contractor costs and consulting costs.

At the West Africa region, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 2 per cent from US$218 million for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 to US$213 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This decrease was mainly due to continued business
process re-engineering, partially offset by a gold-in-process drawdown of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared
with a build-up of US$16 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

At the South America region, at Cerro Corona, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation increased by 11 per cent from
US$70 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$78 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to higher waste tonnes
mined.

At the Australia region, cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation decreased by 1 per cent from A$318 million (US$239 million)
for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$316 million (US$244 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to a higher
gold inventory credit to cost at St Ives of A$36 million (US$28 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with
A$2 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017, partially offset by increased costs from A$113 million
(US$85 million) to A$137 million (US$106 million) as a result of higher mining volumes.

Amortisation and depreciation
Amortisation and depreciation for the Group increased by 7 per cent from US$325 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
US$347 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The US$22 million increase in amortisation was due to higher amortisation of
US$15 million in local currencies and the exchange rate effect of US$7 million on translation into US dollars at a 7 per cent stronger
rand and a 3 per cent stronger Australian dollar. The higher amortisation in local currencies related to an increase at Damang due to
increased production and at St Ives due to increased open pit mining.

Other
Net interest expense for the Group increased by 3 per cent from US$32 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$33 million
for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Interest expense of US$44 million, partially offset by interest income of US$4 million and
interest capitalised of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with interest expense of US$44 million, partially
offset by interest income of US$3 million and interest capitalised of US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

The share of results of equity accounted investees after taxation increased from US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to sundry asset write-offs at Far Southeast project (FSE).
The gain on foreign exchange of US$3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with a loss of US$4 million for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 related to the conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies.

The gain on financial instruments of US$24 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 includes realised gains/losses and the mark to
market of the gold hedges taken out at the Australian operations (a gain of A$1 million/US$1 million), the Ghanaian operations (a gain
of US$10 million) and South Deep (a loss of US$1 million/R14 million), the oil hedges taken out at the Ghanaian and Australian
operations (a gain of US$7 million and A$5 million/US$4 million, respectively), as well as the copper hedge taken out at Cerro Corona
(gain of US$4 million). In addition, a currency hedge taken out at the Australian operations resulted in a loss of US$1 million
(A$1 million). This compared with a gain of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Share-based payments for the Group increased from US$11 million to US$20 million and related to the current valuation of the share
scheme. The long-term incentive plan decreased from US$3 million to US$1 million due to the current valuation of the plan.

Other costs for the Group increased from US$21 million to US$30 million and mainly related to increased community spend.

Exploration and project expenses increased by 19 per cent from US$47 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$56 million
for the six months ended 30 June 2018, mainly due to increased costs at Salares Norte (increased from US$24 million to US$30 million)
and increased write-off of exploration (US$21 million to US$25 million) at the Australian operations.

Non-recurring items
Non-recurring expenses of US$661 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with US$38 million for the six months ended
30 June 2017. The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly included:

-   impairment of R6.471 billion (US$482 million). The after tax impairment is R4.819 billion (US$359 million) in respect of the
    South Deep cash-generating unit. The impairment calculation is based on the 2018 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
    - Gold price of R525,000 per kilogram;
    - Resource price of US$17 per ounce at a Rand/Dollar exchange rate of R13.44;
    - Resource ounces of 29.0 million ounces;
    - Life of mine: 77 years; and
    - Discount rate: 13.5 per cent nominal.
    The impairment is due to a deferral of production. The underperformance of the mine in 2018 and the resultant knock-on impact has
    necessitated a further impairment of South Deep. For the purpose of the impairment calculation, we have used a number equivalent to
    extrapolating the six months ended 30 June 2018 production for 2019 of 6,100kg (196koz). The carrying value after impairment is
    R20.7bn (US$1.5bn). The information underlying the impairment calculation may be subject to further adjustments in the future. These
    adjustments could be as a result of further information becoming available to management during Gold Fields production planning
    processes.
-   restructuring costs at Tarkwa (US$81 million) with the transition to contractor mining;
-   restructuring costs at Damang (US$15 million);
-   restructuring costs at South Deep (US$4 million/R53 million);
-   losses on the sale of mining fleet and heavy machinery equipment and inventory at Tarkwa as part of the transition to contractor
    mining, amounted to US$38 million and US$9 million, respectively; and
-   impairment of FSE amounted to US$20 million and other losses on the sale of assets amounted to US$16 million. The impairment of
    FSE was based on the fair value less cost of disposal of the investment which was directly derived from the market value of Lepanto
    Consolidated Mining Company.

The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly related to the silicosis provision raised of US$30 million and
US$7 million for the write-off of parked up fleet at Tarkwa. Retrenchment payments at Tarkwa were largely offset by receipts on the
disposal of the fleet to the contractor.
Royalties
Government royalties for the Group increased by 10 per cent from US$30 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$33 million
for the six months ended 30 June 2018 in line with higher revenue.

Taxation
The taxation credit for the Group of US$129 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with a charge of US$62 million for
the six months ended 30 June 2017. Normal taxation decreased by 11 per cent from US$83 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$74 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The deferred tax credit of US$201 million for the six months ended 30 June
2018 compared with US$21 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The high effective tax rate for the six months ended 30 June
2018 is due to the non-deduction of certain interest payments of US$35 million and exploration costs at Salares Norte of US$30 million.
 The significant deferred tax credit arose due to the taxation credit of R1.652 billion (US$123 million) on the impairment of South
Deep, as well as the settlement of the South Deep tax dispute with SARS. GFIJVH has recognised an additional R2,338 million
(US$191 million) of capital allowance with a tax effect on this amount of R701 million (US$57 million).

Discontinued operation - Darlot
The net loss in the six months ended 30 June 2017 from the discontinued operation, Darlot, net of tax of US$3 million was a result of
revenue of A$40 million (US$30 million), cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation of A$40 million (US$30 million) with the
balance relating to other costs. The revenue of A$40 million (US$30 million) related to 24,500 ounces sold at a gold price of
A$1,641 per ounce (US$1,234 per ounce).

(Loss)/profit
Net loss attributable to owners of the parent for the Group of US$367 million or US$0.45 per share for the six months ended 30 June
2018 compared with net profit of US$51 million or US$0.07 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent for the Group of US$67 million or US$0.08 per share for the six months ended
30 June 2018 compared with headline earnings of US$68 million or US$0.08 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Normalised profit for the Group of US$43 million or US$0.05 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with US$75 million
or US$0.09 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Normalised profit is considered an important measure by Gold Fields of the profit realised by the Group in the ordinary course of
operations. In addition, it forms the basis of the dividend pay-out policy. Non-IFRS measures such as normalised results are
considered as pro forma financial information as per the JSE Listing Requirements. The pro forma financial information is the
responsibility of the Groups Board of directors and is presented for illustration purposes only and because of its nature, normalised
profit should not be considered as a representation of the income statement.

Cash flow
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$263 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with US$276 million for the six
months ended 30 June 2017. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the sum of:

-   profit before royalties, tax and non-recurring items,
-   non-recurring items,
-   amortisation and depreciation; and
-   other non-cash items.

In addition, royalties and taxation paid decreased from US$196 million to US$169 million and a release of working capital of
US$6 million compared with an investment into working capital of US$25 million.

Dividends paid of US$35 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with US$43 million for the six months ended 30 June
2017. Dividends paid to owners of the parent decreased from US$38 million to US$35 million and related to the final dividends paid for
2016 and 2017, respectively. No dividends were paid to non-controlling interest holders for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared
with US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

At the discontinued operation, Darlot, cash flows from operating activities amounted to US$6 million in the six months ended 30 June
2017.

Cash outflow from investing activities of US$320 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with a cash outflow of
US$439 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Capital expenditure increased from US$383 million to US$411 million. Proceeds on
disposal of fixed assets increased from US$21 million to US$77 million and purchase of investments decreased from US$60 million to
US$18 million. Proceeds on disposal of assets held for sale amounted to US$40 million and environmental payments decreased from
US$10 million to US$7 million. The US$28 million higher capital expenditure was due to higher expenditure of US$20 million in local
currencies and the exchange rate effect of US$8 million on translation into US dollars at a 7 per cent stronger rand and a 3 per cent
stronger Australian dollar.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from US$286 million to US$253 million, while non-sustaining capital expenditure increased from
US$96 million to US$157 million. At South Deep, growth expenditure increased from R62 million (US$4 million) to R149 million
(US$12 million). Growth expenditure on the reinvestment plan at Damang increased from US$53 million to US$66 million and at Gruyere it
increased from US$37 million (A$49 million) to US$66 million (A$86 million), respectively.

Environmental payments decreased from US$10 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$8 million for the six months ended
30 June 2018.

Cash outflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments of US$79 million for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 compared with an outflow of US$102 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to lower net capital
expenditure (sum of additions and disposals), lower taxation paid and a release of working capital.

The US$79 million outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2018 comprised: US$71 million net cash generated by the seven mining
operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$18 million of net interest paid,
US$35 million at Salares Norte on exploration, US$79 million (A$103 million) at Gruyere with [US$66 million (A$86 million) on capital
expenditure and US$13 million (A$17 million) on working capital, as well as US$18 million on non-mine based costs mainly due to working
capital movements. Included in the US$71 million above is US$66 million capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project and
US$12 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure.

The US$102 million outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 comprised: US$52 million net cash generated by the eight mining
operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$33 million of net interest paid,
US$24 million at Salares Norte on exploration, US$60 million (A$80 million) at Gruyere [US$37 million (A$49 million) on capital
expenditure and US$23 million (A$31 million) on working capital], as well as US$37 million on non-mine based costs mainly due to
working capital movements. Included in the US$52 million above is US$53 million capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project
and US$4 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure.

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure decreased by 11 per cent from R427 million (US$32 million) for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 to R379 million (US$31 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to lower expenditure on fleet and
major components.

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure decreased by 5 per cent from US$164 million to US$156 million. At Tarkwa, capital
expenditure decreased by 13 per cent from US$97 million to US$84 million due to lower capital expenditure on mining equipment and
components as a result of the transition to contractor mining. Capital expenditure at Damang increased by 9 per cent from US$67 million
to US$73 million and included US$66 million spent on the Damang re-investment project for the six months ended 30 June 2018.

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased by 17 per cent from US$12 million to US$10 million.
The majority of the expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings storage facility.

At the Australia region, capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from A$180 million (US$135 million) for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to A$174 million (US$134 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 At St Ives, capital expenditure decreased by
22 per cent from A$95 million (US$72 million) to A$74 million (US$57 million) due to lower capital waste mined in the open pits. At
Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure increased by 21 per cent from A$38 million (US$29 million) to A$46 million (US$35 million) due to
increased decline development at Waroonga including development to the Waroonga North orebody. At Granny Smith, capital expenditure
increased by 15 per cent from A$47 million (US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$54 million (US$42 million) for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to increased capital development.

Proceeds on disposal of capital equipment of US$77 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 related to Tarkwas sale of fleet to
the contractor as part of the conversion to contractor mining. This compared with US$21 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
which related to the conversion to contractor mining at Damang.

Purchase of investments of US$18 million related to Gold Fields subscription to a 9.9 per cent share interest in Asanko Gold by way of
a private placement of 22,354,657 Asanko shares for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This compared with purchase of investments of
US$60 million which related mainly to the purchase of 74,284,070 shares in Gold Road Resources (Gold Fields now holds a 10 per cent
interest) in Gold Road Resources Limited for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Proceeds on disposal of assets held for sale comprised US$40 million cash and royalty (2 per cent NSR (net smelter return)) on all
metals and related to the disposal of APP.

At the discontinued operation, Darlot, capital expenditure amounted to A$9 million (US$6 million) for the six months ended 30 June
2017.

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$115 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with US$161 million for the
six months ended 30 June 2017. The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2018 related to a drawdown of US$358 million, partially
offset by the repayment of US$243 million on offshore and local loans. The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 related to a
drawdown of US$285 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$125 million on offshore and local loans.

The net cash inflow for the Group of US$24 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with an outflow of US$45 million for
the six months ended 30 June 2017. After accounting for a negative translation adjustment of US$5 million on non-US dollar cash
balances, the cash inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2018 was US$19 million. The cash balance at 30 June 2018 of US$498 million
compared with US$493 million at 30 June 2017.

All-in sustaining and total all-in cost
The Group all-in sustaining costs for continuing operations decreased marginally from US$967 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June
2017 to US$965 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower sustaining capital expenditure, higher by-product
credits and lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation partially offset by lower gold sold. Total all-in cost increased
by 7 per cent from US$1,092 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,169 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018
due to higher non-sustaining capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project (US$66 million versus US$53 million) as well as
higher capital expenditure on the Gruyere project [A$86 million (US$66 million) versus A$49 million (US$37 million)] along with higher
exploration, feasibility and evaluation costs.

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs increased by 4 per cent from R646,526 per kilogram (US$1,521 per
ounce) to R669,306 per kilogram (US$1,699 per ounce) mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before
amortisation and depreciation and lower sustaining capital expenditure. The total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from
R662,973 per kilogram (US$1,557 per ounce) to R715,373 per kilogram (US$1,816 per ounce) due to the same reasons as for all-in
sustaining costs as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 7 per cent from US$995 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$924 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and
lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by decreased gold sold. Total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from
US$1,142 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,114 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to
the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs, partially offset by non-sustaining capital expenditure of US$66 million as a result of
expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project in the six months to 30 June 2018, compared with US$53 million in the six months to
30 June 2017.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 22 per cent from US$253 per ounce to US$197
per ounce mainly due to higher copper by-product credits and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by higher cost of sales before
amortisation and depreciation and lower gold sold. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by
9 per cent from US$677 per equivalent ounce to US$737 per equivalent ounce due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and
depreciation and lower equivalent ounces sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

At the Australia region excluding the discontinued operation Darlot and the Gruyere project, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 2 per
cent from A$1,184 per ounce (US$891 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$1,166 per ounce (US$900 per ounce) for the
six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower sustaining capital
expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 19 per cent from 3,710 kilograms (119,300 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 3,003 kilograms
(96,500 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to the impact of labour restructuring and new shift system
implementation on 1 March 2018. In addition, continued low mobile equipment reliability, the intersection of active geological
features (faults and dykes) in the high-grade corridor 3 and poor ground conditions in the composites (far western part of the orebody)
slowed production rates. Production for the month of April 2018 was further impacted by a 22-day DMR safety related stoppage to re-
support back areas in two of the critical new mine access ramps, which account for half of total production for the mine. The mine is
tracking the revised guidance given for the year on 25 April 2018.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 18 per cent from 780,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 639,000 tonnes for
the six months ended 30 June 2018. The average reef grade mined increased by 11 per cent from 5.59 grams per tonne to 6.18 grams per
tonne.

Total tonnes milled decreased by 18 per cent from 0.97 million tonnes to 0.80 million tonnes, mainly due to less tonnes mined as a
result of the reasons above. Underground reef tonnes milled decreased by 15 per cent from 0.67 million tonnes for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to 0.57 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Total tonnes milled for the six months ended 30 June 2018
included 92,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 139,000 tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 81,000 tonnes of
underground waste mined and 217,000 tonnes of surface tailings material for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Underground reef yield
decreased by 2 per cent from 5.50 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 5.24 grams per tonne for the six months
ended 30 June 2018. The 5.50 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was as a result of high grade ore mined in 2016, but
only processed in the six months ended 30 June 2017. In addition, the decrease in grade for the six months ended June 2018 was
exacerbated by backfill re-mining which was included in the ore stream.

Development increased by 19 per cent from 2,853 metres for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 3,406 metres for the six months ended
30 June 2018. New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 103 per cent from 406 metres to 828 metres.
Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above increased by 4 per cent from 1,604 metres to 1,670 metres, while reef
horizon development north of wrench increased by 8 per cent from 843 metres to 908 metres. Longhole stoping volume mined decreased by
39 per cent from 387,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 236,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018.
Destress mining decreased by 19 per cent from 16,134 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 13,114 square metres for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to geological feature intersections.

The current mine contributed 4 per cent more ore tonnes at 58 per cent of total tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018, while
North of Wrench decreased by 4 per cent and contributed 42 per cent of total ore tonnes mined for the six months ended June 2018. This
compared with the current mine contributing 54 per cent and the North of Wrench 46 per cent, respectively, for the six months ended
30 June 2017.

The mine has identified six key focus areas to drive improved performance and a number of initiatives and projects are being initiated.
The six focus areas are:

-   Enabling Visible Felt Leadership (PVFL);
-   Reinvigorating our leadership system;
-   Improving face time;
-   Effective face time
-   Enabling logistics; and
-   Implementing of innovation and technology.

These initiatives have started to yield positive results, notably, a 45 per cent improvement in total recordable injury rates as well
as a reduction on the lost time injuries. The marginal and steady improvement in the reliability of equipment (high profile rigs in
particular), improvement in the shaft schedule arrangements and improvements in total meters developed.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 6 per cent from R1,997 million (US$151 million) for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to R1,882 million (US$154 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower
production, lower expenditure on consumable costs, contractor costs, consulting costs, partially offset by a gold inventory charge of
R36 million (US$3 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with a gold inventory credit to cost of R63 million
(US$5 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Capital expenditure decreased by 11 per cent from R427 million (US$32 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to R379 million
(US$31 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018, as explained below.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 37 per cent from R365 million (US$28 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
R230 million (US$19 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to lower expenditure on fleet and major components. Non-
sustaining capital expenditure increased by 140 per cent from R62 million (US$4 million) to R149 million (US$12 million). This
increase is mainly due to acceleration of new mine development, the progress on the 100 and 110 level conveyor belts and expenditure
on the 80 level fridge plant. These three projects accounted for R83 million (US$7 million) of the variance.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 4 per cent from R646,526 per kilogram (US$1,521 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to R669,306 per kilogram (US$1,699 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by
lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from R662,973 per kilogram (US$1,557 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
R715,373 per kilogram (US$1,816 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs
as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

The steady but marginal improvement in performance remains below requirements and expectations. Management have initiated an
organisational restructuring process, with specific focus on aligning organisational structures and costs to the current level of
output. This intervention is planned to reposition the business to succeed, reinforce and embed accountability and delivery and build
a high performance culture. This process is expected to impact on the remainder of the years output and costs, the effect of which
cannot be quantified at this time.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 281,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 264,400 ounces for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower yield as a result of lower grade ore mined and feed of low grade ore from stockpiles in
accordance with the schedule.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 15 per cent from 53.3 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June
2017 to 45.2 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to lower planned tonnes in accordance with a re-optimised life
of mine plan that will see the mine maintain an average of at least 500,000 ounces per annum at all in costs of between US$900 per
ounce and US$950 per ounce. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 16 per cent from 8.0 million tonnes to 6.7 million tonnes. Operational
waste tonnes mined decreased by 45 per cent from 19.6 million tonnes to 10.8 million tonnes due to the decision to reduce annual mining
volumes from 100 million tonnes to 87 million tonnes as well as focusing on capital waste stripping in line with the plan. Capital
waste tonnes mined increased by 8 per cent from 25.7 million tonnes to 27.7 million tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 4 per cent
from 1.34 grams per tonne to 1.29 grams per tonne due to suspension of mining at the relatively high grade zone of the Underlap pit.
Mining operations at the Underlap pit has resumed. The strip ratio was similar at 5.7.

The CIL plant throughput increased marginally from 6.85 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 6.88 million tonnes for
the six months ended 30 June 2018. Realised yield from the CIL plant decreased by 7 per cent from 1.28 grams per tonne to 1.19 grams
per tonne due to lower ore mined and feed to the plant.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 5 per cent from US$158 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$150 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 as a result of lower tonnes mined, partially offset by a higher gold-in-process
charge. The US$11 million drawdown of stockpiles for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with a build-up of US$15 million for
the six months ended 30 June 2017. In 2017, higher volumes were mined and stockpiled. These stockpiles were drawn down during the six
months to 30 June 2018 and further drawdowns are planned for the remainder of 2018 with focus on capital waste stripping and lower ore
tonnes mined. At the end of June 2018, 4.8 million tonnes at 0.86 grams per tonne remained on the ROM stockpile and 4.3 million tonnes
at 0.64 grams per tonne on the low grade stockpile.

Capital expenditure decreased by 13 per cent from US$97 million to US$84 million mainly due to lower capital expenditure on mining
equipment and components as a result of the transition to contract mining. Capital expenditure on mining equipment and components of
US$22 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 4 per cent from US$989 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
US$954 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower
capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production increased by 16 per cent from 76,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 89,500 ounces for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to higher grade material mined and processed.
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 26 per cent from 19.0 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June
2017 to 23.9 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to the acceleration of the Damang reinvestment project in line
with the 2018 operational plan.

Ore tonnes mined increased by 6 per cent from 1.7 million tonnes to 1.8 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by
26 per cent from 2.7 million tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes due to the acceleration of the Damang reinvestment project. Total capital
waste tonnes increased by 28 per cent from 14.6 million tonnes to 18.7 million tonnes. Capital waste of 4.4 million tonnes was mined at
Amoanda pit and 14.3 million tonnes at the Damang complex for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This compared with 8.3 million tonnes
mined at Amoanda pit, 5.6 million tonnes at the Damang complex and 0.6 million tonnes at Lima South pit for the six months ended
30 June 2017. Head grade mined increased by 44 per cent from 1.24 grams per tonne to 1.79 grams per tonne in line with the 2018
operational plan with higher grade ore from the Amoanda pits. The strip ratio increased from 10.4 to 12.7 due to the accelerated
mining of the Damang reinvestment project resulting in higher capital waste stripped.

Tonnes processed decreased by 6 per cent from 2.29 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 2.16 million tonnes for the
six months ended 30 June 2018 as a result of higher percentage oxide material fed in the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with
the six months ended 30 June 2018. Yield increased by 24 per cent from 1.04 grams per tonne to 1.29 grams per tonne due to higher
mined grade material treated from Amoanda pit. For the six months ended 30 June 2018, tonnes milled were sourced as follow:
1.52 million tonnes at 1.75 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.64 million tonnes at 0.63 grams per tonne from stockpiles. This compared
with 0.98 million tonnes at 1.40 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.37 million tonnes at 0.97 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and
0.95 million tonnes at 0.66 grams per tonne from stockpiles for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 5 per cent from US$60 million to US$63 million mainly due to
US$7 million increase in cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciation as a result of higher operating
tonnes mined, partially offset by gold-in-process credit to cost of US$5 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared with
US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Capital expenditure increased by 9 per cent from US$67 million to US$73 million, with US$61 million spent on capital waste stripping
and the balance of US$12 million spent on engineering projects, Amoanda Phase 2 infill drilling and construction of the Far East
Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF).

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 50 per cent from US$14 million to US$7 million mainly due to timing of expenditure.

Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 25 per cent from US$53 million to US$66 million mainly due to acceleration of Damang
investment project.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 18 per cent from US$1,017 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$829 per ounce for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to higher gold sold and lower sustaining capital, partially offset by higher cost of sales before
amortisation and depreciation.

All-in costs decreased by 7 per cent from US$1,702 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to US$1,585 per ounce for the six
months ended 30 June 2018 due to the same reasons above, as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 13 per cent from 69,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 60,800 ounces for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 due to mining of lower grade zones in line with the mining sequence. Copper production increased by 2 per cent from
14,431 tonnes to 14,678 tonnes. Equivalent gold production increased marginally from 137,000 ounces to 137,600 ounces. Gold head grade
decreased from 0.95 grams per tonne to 0.85 grams per tonne due to mining of lower grade zones in line with the mining sequence and
copper head grade increased from 0.50 per cent to 0.52 per cent. Gold recoveries decreased slightly from 69.7 per cent to 69.5 per
cent mainly due to the reduction of the Au head grade during the six months ended 30 June 2018. Copper recoveries decreased from
88.4 per cent to 87.6 per cent. Gold yield decreased from 0.66 grams per tonne to 0.59 grams per tonne due to lower grades mined and
copper yield increased from 0.44 per cent to 0.46 per cent.

For the six months ended 30 June 2018, concentrate with a payable content of 56,567 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of
US$1,310 per ounce and 14,181 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$6,217 per tonne, net of treatment and refining
charges. This compared with 70,156 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,239 per ounce and 14,138 tonnes of copper
that was sold at an average price of US$5,119 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, for the six months ended 30 June 2017.
Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 3 per cent from 135,700 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 131,700 ounces for the
six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower gold sold resulting from lower gold production as explained above.

Total tonnes mined increased by 52 per cent from 7.31 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 11.09 million tonnes for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 in line with the mine sequencing. Ore mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.53 million tonnes to
3.29 million tonnes. Waste tonnes mined increased by 106 per cent from 3.78 million tonnes to 7.79 million tonnes mainly due to the
new mine sequence resulting from the expansion of the life of mine to 2030. The strip ratio increased from 1.07 to 2.37.

Ore processed decreased by 3 per cent from 3.44 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 3.33 million tonnes for the
six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to lower plant throughput (799 tonnes per hour for the six months ended 30 June 2018 versus
810 tonnes per hour for the six months ended 30 June 2017) resulting from higher ore hardness.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 11 per cent from US$70 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017
to US$78 million for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The higher cost was mainly due higher waste tonnes mined in line with the 2018
plan.

Capital expenditure decreased by 17 per cent from US$12 million to US$10 million mainly due to delayed construction activities at the
tailings dam as a result of more severe rainy season during the six months ended 30 June 2018.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 22 per cent from US$253 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
US$197 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This was mainly due to higher copper by-product credits and lower capital
expenditure, partially offset by higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower gold sold. All-in sustaining
costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 9 per cent from US$677 per equivalent ounce to US$737 per equivalent
ounce due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower equivalent ounces sold, partially offset by lower
capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 184,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 189,800 ounces for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 due to higher volumes processed.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 39 per cent from 21.4 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 13.1 million tonnes for
the six months ended 30 June 2018 with tonnes mined at Invincible open pit decreasing by 5.2 million tonnes and Neptune open pit
decreasing by 3.1 million tonnes in line with the operational plan.

At the underground operations, ore mined increased by 11 per cent from 0.28 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
0.31 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018. This was due to the commencement of stope ore mining at the Invincible
underground mine. Total underground grade mined increased by 1 per cent from 4.47 grams per tonne to 4.53 grams per tonne.

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 53 per cent from 1.67 million tonnes for the six   months ended 30 June
2017 to 2.56 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Grade mined decreased by 3 per cent from 2.98   grams per tonne to
2.90 grams per tonne. The increased ore mined was due to Neptune open pit operating at full production capacity    during the six months
ended 30 June 2018 compared with mainly pre-strip activities being performed during the six months ended 30 June   2017.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 30 per cent from 3.26 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 4.25 million
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 63 per cent from 16.2 million tonnes to
6.0 million tonnes due to Neptune moving into a primary production phase compared with primarily pre-stripping in the six months ended
30 June 2017. The strip ratio decreased from 11.7 to 4.0. Total material movement was 39 per cent lower in line with the mine plan
with the mining contractor at Neptune demobilising to reflect the lower levels of open pit mining activity as the Invincible open pit
comes to an end. The Neptune and Invincible pits are planned to be mined using the existing owner mining fleet.

At the consolidated St Ives mine, ounces mined increased by 41 per cent from 200,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
283,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2018. By 30 June 2018, Neptune high-grade oxide material stockpiled amounted to
77,600 ounces (1,142,000 tonnes at 2.34 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 44,500 ounces (375,000 tonnes at 2.81 grams per tonne)
and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne). This compared with the 30 June 2017 stockpiles at Neptune of
21,400 ounces (523,000 tonnes at 0.71 grams per tonne), Invincible of 3,700 ounces (39,000 tonnes at 4.78 grams per tonne) and A5 of
7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne. Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide material blend, thus
constraining the processing of Neptune ore.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 2 per cent from 2.04 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 2.09 million
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Yield increased marginally from 2.81 grams per tonne to 2.82 grams per tonne.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 8 per cent from A$111 million (US$83 million) for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to A$102 million (US$78 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018. The lower cost of sales before amortisation and
depreciation were mainly due to a higher gold inventory credit of A$36 million (US$28 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018
compared with A$2 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The higher gold inventory credit was due to the
increased value of stockpiled material. The impact of the higher gold inventory credit on cost of sales before amortisation and
depreciation was partially offset by a A$18 million (US$14 million) increase in mining costs, due to higher volumes of ore and
operating waste mined, a A$2 million (US$1 million) increase in surface cartage costs and a A$3 million (US$2 million) increase in
processing costs.

Capital expenditure decreased by 22 per cent from A$95 million (US$72 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$74 million
(US$57 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to lower capital waste tonnes mined in the open pits.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 17 per cent from A$1,184 per ounce (US$891 per ounce) for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to A$988 per ounce (US$763 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to higher gold sold, lower
cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and lower capital expenditure.

Ore mined from underground increased by 9 per cent from 568,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 616,600 tonnes for the
six months ended 30 June 2018 with increased production from the New Holland mine. Ore mined from Waroonga decreased by 1 per cent from
320,000 tonnes at 7.58 grams per tonne to 315,400 tonnes at 8.62 grams per tonne. At New Holland, ore mined increased by 21 per cent
from 248,000 tonnes at 5.56 grams per tonne to 301,200 tonnes at 3.78 grams per tonne with lower grade bulk stopes at Sheba replacing
higher grade areas in Cinderella. Head grade mined decreased by 7 per cent from 6.70 grams per tonne to 6.26 grams per tonne mainly
due to lower grades mined at New Holland. In the six months ended 30 June 2018 tonnes ounces mined were sourced as follows:
87,400 ounces from Waroonga (315,000 tonnes at 8.6 grams per tonne) and 36,600 ounces from New Holland (301,000 tonnes at 3.8 grams
per tonne). This compared with 78,000 ounces from Waroonga (320,000 tonnes at 7.6 grams per tonne) and 44,4000 ounces from New Holland
(248,000 tonnes at 5.6 grams per tonne) in the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Tonnes processed decreased by 6 per cent from 624,300 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 587,800 tonnes for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 due to an extended maintenance shutdown during the March quarter. The combined yield increased by 6 per cent from
5.75 grams per tonne to 6.11 grams per tonne mainly due to high grade ore mined late in June 2017 not being processed until July and
the preferential treatment of high grade ore in the six months ended 30 June 2018 with more ore mined than processed.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 8 per cent from A$102 million (US$76 million) for the six months ended
30 June 2017 to A$110 million (US$85 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due higher processing costs associated with
the extended shutdown in the March quarter and a gold-in-process charge to cost of A$5 million (US$4 million) for the six months ended
30 June 2018 compared with a credit of A$nil million (US$nil million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The charge to cost in the
six months to 30 June 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of stockpiled ore and gold-in-circuit.

Capital expenditure increased by 21 per cent from A$38 million (US$29 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$46 million
(US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Capital expenditure was higher than the previous year due to an increase in
decline development at Waroonga including development to the Waroonga North ore body.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 9 per cent from A$1,275 per ounce (US$960 per ounce) for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to A$1,393 per ounce (US$1,075 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to higher cost of sales before
amortisation and depreciation and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by increased gold sold.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 4 per cent from 867,000 tonnes to 832,300 tonnes due to additional waste movement and increased
depth of mining. Head grade mined increased by 1 per cent from 5.41 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to
5.47 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2018.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 879,200 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to 835,700 tonnes for the six months
ended 30 June 2018 due to the reduction in ore mined and the timing of the campaign milling in the respective periods. Yield decreased
marginally from 5.12 grams per tonne to 5.11 grams per tonne.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 1 per cent from A$106 million (US$80 million) to A$105 million
(US$81 million) mainly due to a gold inventory charge of A$nil million (US$nil million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 compared
with A$3 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Capital expenditure increased by 15 per cent from A$47 million (US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 to A$54 million
(US$42 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 due to more capital development being incurred to open up the lower levels at the
Wallaby mine.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 10 per cent from A$1,110 per ounce (US$835 per ounce) for the six months
ended 30 June 2017 to A$1,219 per ounce (US$942 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 mainly due to higher capital
expenditure and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation.

Ghana
The Ghana Chamber of Mines received a letter from the Government of Ghana dated 31 July 2018 indicating that the Government intended
to exercise its right of pre-emption regarding minerals raised, won and obtained in Ghana and from any area covered by territorial
waters, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf and products derived from the refining or treatment of these minerals
in accordance with section 7 of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703). In this regard, the Letter stated that the Government
intended to purchase up to 30 per cent of gold mined in Ghana from all mining companies and requested the Chamber to inform its
members, including Gold Fields, of the Governments decision and be prepared to engage with the Ministry to finalise measures to ensure
implementation by 1 November 2018.

The Chamber on behalf of its Members has engaged and will continue to do so to obtain further information on this decision. Discussions
are ongoing.

Mining charter
On 17 June 2018, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) published the draft Mining Charter 2018. Parties were given 30 days to
respond to the draft at the time. The South African Minerals Council (formerly the Chamber of Mines), of which Gold Fields is a
member, is representing the mining industry in the negotiations with the DMR and stakeholders on the draft Mining Charter 2018.
The Minerals Council recognises that the draft Mining Charter 2018 is an improvement of the 2017 Mining Charter however believes that
much more work is required to create a Mining Charter that promotes competitiveness, investment, growth and transformation for the
growth and prosperity of South Africa.

At a Mining Charter Summit organised by the DMR and held on 7 and 8 July 2018, the Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe, noted
that ongoing engagement between stakeholders was essential especially with the Minerals Council and mining-affected communities. The
Minister announced an extended comment and consultation process until the end of August 2018 and noted the draft Mining Charter 2018
was only likely to come into effect in November 2018.

Gold Fields supports the approach by the Minerals Council to continue to engage the DMR and other stakeholders and the need by all
parties to improve the competitiveness of the industry to ensure investment, growth and the transformation of the mining sector.

Outlook for 2018

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2018 is expected to be on track with original guidance given in February,
with the inclusion of Asanko. AISC is expected to be between US$990 per ounce and US$1,010 per ounce and AIC is planned to be between
US$1,190 per ounce and US$1,210 per ounce, both as previously guided.

The South Deep production guidance factored into the Group production guidance is unchanged from the 7,600kg provided in April 2018
(with Q1 2018 results). However, given the potential volatility related to the proposed restructuring, there is an increased level of
uncertainty with this forecast.

Capital expenditure for the Group for 2018 is forecast at US$854 million, which is higher than the guidance of US$835 million, mainly
due to increased expenditure at the Damang reinvestment project and the Gruyere project.

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on
page 5.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these interim financial statements are in terms of International Financial
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements except for the adoption of
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15).

Auditors review
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for the period ended 30 June 2018 have been reviewed
by the companys auditor, KPMG Inc.

The auditors report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this media release. Shareholders are therefore
advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditors engagement they should refer to page 39 of the
media release for a copy of the auditors report.

Changes in significant accounting policies
The group adopted IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15
This IFRS introduces a new revenue recognition model for contracts with customers and establishes a comprehensive framework for
determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.

The Group assessed the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and determined the impact as follows:

-   Revenue will be recognised when the customer takes control of the gold, copper and silver. The timing of recognition of revenue
    will no longer be when risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer; and
-   The change in timing of revenue recognition will result in revenue at the South African and Australian operations being recognised
    on settlement date (date when control passes) and not contract date (previous date when risks and rewards of ownership passed).
    There is no change to the revenue recognition at any of the other operations given that the date of control is the same date as when
    risks and rewards of ownership pass. The change in timing of revenue recognition for the South African and Australian operations is
    that revenue will be recognised approximately two days later than it was previously recognised.

The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with the effect of initially applying
this standard at the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). Accordingly, the information presented for prior periods has
not been restated. The impact on opening retained earnings has been disclosed in the statement of changes in equity (this had no impact
on the non-controlling interest).

There was no material impact on the Group interim income statement and statements of financial position and cash flows for the six
month period ended 30 June 2018.

IFRS 9
This IFRS sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell
non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

This IFRS contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which the
assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. The three principal classification categories for financial assets are:
amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The new classification does not have a significant impact on the Group accounting for financial assets. The Groups available-for-sale
financial assets will be designated as FVOCI.

Given the historically low risk of impairment in respect of receivables and the nature of receivables, the change from the incurred
loss model to the expected credit loss model did not have an impact on the measurement of financial assets.

There was no material impact on the Group interim income statement and statements of financial position and cash flows for the six
month period ended 30 June 2018.

Correction of methodology
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group corrected the amortisation methodology for the mineral rights asset at the Australian
operations to reduce the level of estimation required in calculating amortisation. Prior to the correction of the methodology, the
total mineral rights asset capitalised at the Australian operation was depreciated on a units-of-production basis over a useful life
that exceeded proved and probable reserves. The amortisation estimation methodology was corrected in order to divide the total mineral
rights asset capitalised at the respective operations into a depreciable and a non-depreciable component. The mineral rights are
initially capitalised to the mineral rights asset as a non-depreciable component. The depreciable component is amortised over the
estimated proved and probable ore reserves on a units-of-production method.

As a result of this correction of the methodology, management identified an understatement of the amortisation and depreciation charge
relating to prior periods as set out in note 40 to the 31 December 2017 financial statements.

The 30 June 2017 results as published, have been accordingly restated to reflect the impact of the correction of the amortisation
methodology.

Credit facilities successfully refinanced
R1,500 million Nedbank revolving credit facility
On 13 April 2018, Gold Fields Operations Limited and GFI Joint Venture Holdings (Proprietary) Limited entered into a R1,500 million
revolving credit facility with Nedbank Limited which became available on 8 May 2018. The purpose of this facility was to fund (i)
capital expenditure of the Gold Fields group, and (ii) general corporate and working capital requirements of the Gold Fields group.
The final maturity date of this facility is five years from the financial close date, namely 8 May 2023.
US$100 million Senior Secured revolving credit facility
On 12 June 2017, Gold Fields Ghana Limited and Abosso Goldfields Limited (as Borrowers) entered into a US$100 million senior secured
revolving credit facility with the Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (acting through its Isle of Man branch) (as Original Lender
and Agent) and Stanbic Ghana Limited (as Security Agent) which became available on 17 July 2017. The purpose of this facility was (i)
to refinance the outstanding balance of US$45 million under the US$70 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which matured
on 17 July 2017); (ii) to finance working capital requirements; (iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) for capital expenditure
purposes of each borrower. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the financial close date, namely 17 July 2020.
On 22 March 2018, the Borrowers, the Original Lender and the Security Agent entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement to
release any and all security interests created in favour of the Security Agent (the Security). The effective date of the release of the
Security was 22 March 2018.

Non-recurring items
Asset impairments and write-offs
Asset impairments and write-offs recognised by the Group during 2018 include:

South Deep
- Impairment of R6.471 billion (US$482 million). The after tax impairment is R4.819 billion (US$359 million) in respect of the
   South Deep cash-generating unit. The impairment calculation is based on the 2018 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
   - Gold price of R525,000 per kilogram;
   - Resource price of US$17 per ounce at a Rand/Dollar exchange rate of R13.44;
   - Resource ounces of 29.0 million ounces;
   - Life of mine: 77 years; and
   - Discount rate: 13.5 per cent nominal.
      The impairment is due to a deferral of production. The underperformance of the mine in 2018 and the resultant knock-on impact has
      necessitated a further impairment of South Deep. For the purpose of the impairment calculation, we have used a number equivalent
      to extrapolating the six months ended 30 June 2018 production for 2019 of 6,100kg (196koz). The carrying value after impairment
      is R20.7bn (US$1.5bn). The information underlying the impairment calculation may be subject to further adjustments in the future.
      These adjustments could be as a result of further information becoming available to management during Gold Fields production
      planning processes.

Impairment of investments and assets
The impairment of US$20 million related to the impairment of FSE which was based on the fair value less cost of disposal of the
investment which was directly derived from the market value of Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company.

Restructuring costs
The restructuring costs of US$100 million comprised restructuring costs at Tarkwa of US$81 million with the transition to contractor
mining as well as restructuring costs at Damang and South Deep of US$15 million and US$4 million, respectively.

Subsequent events
On 29 March 2018, the Group entered into certain definitive agreements (the JV Transaction) with Asanko Gold Inc. (Asanko) pursuant to
which, among other things:

-   Gold Fields and Asanko will each own a 45 per cent interest in Asanko Gold Ghana Limited   (AGGL), the Asanko subsidiary that
    currently owns the Asanko Gold Mine, with the Government of Ghana continuing to retain a   10 per cent free-carried interest in AGGL
    (the Joint Arrangement);
-   Gold Fields and Asanko will each own a 50 per cent interest in Adansi Gold Company Ghana   Limited (Adansi Ghana), the Asanko
    subsidiary that currently owns a number of the Companys exploration licenses; and
-   Gold Fields and Asanko will each acquire a 50 per cent interest in a newly formed entity   (JV Finco).
On 20 June 2018, Gold Fields and Asanko received approval of the JV Transaction from the Ghanaian Minister of Lands and Natural
Resources and the JV Transaction closed on 31 July 2018 once all conditions precedent were met.

In consideration for its interests in the Joint Arrangement, Gold Fields:

-   contributed US$165.0 million, representing its initial US$164.9 million redeemable share investment in JV Finco, as well as its
    initial US$0.1 million equity investments in AGGL, Adansi Ghana and JV Finco, respectively; and
-   will contribute an additional US$20.0 million redeemable share investment to JV Finco based on an agreed Esaase development
    milestone, but in any event no later than 31 December 2019.

In addition to the US$185.0 million investment described above, Gold Fields purchased a 9.9 per cent interest in the common shares of
Asanko via a private placement on 4 April 2018. Gold Fields purchased 22,354,657 common shares of the Company at US$0.79 per common
share, equal to the 5-day volume-weighted average price as of market close on 27 March 2018, for US$17.6 million.

The above transactions will be accounted for as follows from 31 July 2018:

-   Equity investments in AGGL, Adansi Ghana and JV Finco - these will be equity accounted in terms of the requirements of IAS 28
    Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures given that these entities will be classified as joint ventures; and
-   Redeemable share investment in JV Finco - these will be accounted for as a financial asset in terms of the requirements of IFRS 9.

The investment in Asanko common shares - have been accounted for as a financial asset in terms of the requirements of IFRS 9.

Silicosis and tuberculosis class and individual actions
As previously disclosed, a consolidated application has been brought against several South African mining companies, including Gold
Fields, for certification of a class action on behalf of current or former mineworkers (and their dependants) who have allegedly
contracted silicosis and/or tuberculosis while working for one or more of the mining companies listed in the application.
On 3 May 2018, the Gold Working Group representing African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony
and Sibanye-Stillwater entered into a settlement agreement with the claimants in the silicosis and tuberculosis class action
litigation.

The Settlement Agreement provides meaningful compensation to all eligible workers suffering from silicosis and/or tuberculosis who
worked in these companies mines from 12 March 1965 to date. This is the very first class action settlement of its kind in South
Africa.

The settlement is subject to certain suspensive conditions, including the Settlement Agreement being approved by the South Gauteng High
Court. The parties respective legal teams are working together to prepare the necessary paperwork in order that the Court may review
the agreement and approve the process whereby all interested and affected parties will be given notice of the settlement and an
opportunity to comment and make submissions before the Court considers issuing its final approval.

The parties believe the settlement represents a fair outcome for claimants and a sustainable outcome for the companies.

An effective date of the agreement will be set based on a date after court approval.

A new website - www.SilicosisSettlement.co.za and a Facebook page - www.facebook.com/silicosissettlement - have been launched to assist
former mineworkers and their dependents who may be entitled to compensation if they worked at one of the six gold-mining companies that
have made provisions for a trust to pay mineworkers who contracted silicosis and/or TB at work.

In addition to the class action, an individual silicosis-related action has been instituted against Gold Fields and another mining
company. In February 2018, the defendants (including Gold Fields) and the plaintiff entered into a confidential settlement agreement
in full and final settlement of this matter.
Provision raised
As at 30 June 2017, as a result of the ongoing work of the Working Group and engagements with affected stakeholders since 31 December
2016, Gold Fields provided an amount of US$30 million (R390 million) in the statement of financial position for its share of a possible
settlement of the class action claims and related costs. The nominal value of this provision was US$40 million (R509 million).

Gold Fields believe that this remains a reasonable estimate of its share of the settlement of the class action claims and related
costs. This provision, of US$28 million (R378 million) at 30 June 2018 compares to the amount raised in June 2017 of US$30 million
(R390 million) in June 2017 and the decrease is due to a change in the timing of expected cash flows and the effect of translation
offset by the effect of unwinding. The nominal value of this provision is US$38 million (R511 million).

The ultimate outcome of this matter remains uncertain, with a possible failure to fulfil all the suspensive conditions, including the
Settlement Agreement being approved by the South Gauteng High Court. The provision is consequently subject to adjustment in the
future.

South Deep tax dispute
During the September 2014 quarter, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued a Finalisation of Audit Letter stating that SARS
has disallowed GFI Joint Venture Holdings (Pty) Ltds (GFIJVH) additional capital allowance claim.

The Group objected to SARS decision and vigorously defended its position. After no resolution was achieved during a Tax Court sitting
in 2017, GFIJVH appealed to the High Court.

The Group is pleased to announce that on 30 May 2018 GFIJVH and SARS entered into a confidential settlement agreement (as provided for
in the Tax Administration Act) in full and final settlement of this matter. As a result of the settlement GFIJVH has recognised an
additional R2,338 million (US$191 million) of capital allowance with a tax effect on this amount of R701 million (US$57 million).

HEDGING/DERIVATIVES (REVIEWED)
The Groups policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken as follows:
- to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
- for specific debt servicing requirements; and
- to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

Gold production increased by 2 per cent from 1,485 kilograms (47,700 ounces) in the March quarter to 1,518 kilograms (48,800 ounces) in
the June quarter mainly due to higher volumes mined.

Total underground tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 313,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 326,000 tonnes in the June quarter.
Ore tonnes mined decreased by 5 per cent from 255,000 tonnes to 242,000 tonnes due to lower ore tonnes mined in the current mine, while
underground waste mined increased by 45 per cent from 58,000 tonnes to 84,000 tonnes due to increased New mine development.
Underground reef grade mined increased by 10 per cent from 5.89 grams per tonne to 6.48 grams per tonne due to higher grade areas
mined. Total gold mined from- underground increased by 4 per cent from 1,504 kilograms (48,400 ounces) to 1,567 kilograms
(50,400 ounces).

Total tonnes milled decreased by 3 per cent from 407,000 tonnes to 393,000 tonnes. Underground ore tonnes milled decreased by 17 per
cent from 311,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 258,000 tonnes in the June quarter due to processing of backlog tonnes in the March
quarter. Underground waste milled increased by 88 per cent from 32,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes. Surface tailings material treated
increased by 17 per cent from 64,000 tonnes to 75,000 tonnes. Underground reef yield increased by 23 per cent from 4.74 grams per tonne
to 5.85 grams per tonne due to increased volumes mined from higher grade areas.

Ore milled was higher than ore mined due to tramming of additional underground stocks, but much less in the June quarter than in the
March quarter.

Gold recovered from underground was 1,509 kilograms (48,500 ounces) with 9 kilograms (300 ounces) being recovered from treatment of the
surface material.

Destress mining decreased by 14 per cent from 7,061 square metres in the March quarter 6,053 square metres in the June quarter mainly
due to delayed start-up after additional ground support installation as a result of intersection of geological features and mining
through highly stressed ground.

Longhole stoping increased by 3 per cent from 116,300 tonnes to 120,000 tonnes due to improved stope availability. The current mine
contributed 85 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the June quarter compared with 78 per cent in the March quarter due to increased
tonnes from 90 3W and 95 1W in the current mine and a reduction in 100 2A and 100 4W in the North Wrench area. Total tonnes mined from
longhole stoping was similar and accounted for 37 per cent of total tonnes broken.

Development increased by 11 per cent from 1,617 metres in the March quarter to 1,789 metres in the June quarter. New mine capital
development on 100 level increased by 46 per cent from 337 metres to 492 metres. Development in the current mine areas decreased by
19 per cent from 923 metres to 747 metres due to lower metres achieved in 95-2W as a result of crew re-allocation to assist with the
2W and 3W ramp re-support. The decrease was compounded by lower equipment availability in the 87 1W and 87 2W corridors. Development
North of Wrench increased by 54 per cent from 357 metres to 550 metres.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 2 per cent from R952 million (US$79 million) to R931 million
(US$74 million) mainly due to lower bonuses and a decrease in the gold-in-process charge from R25 million (US$2 million) in the March
quarter to R12 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter.
Capital expenditure increased by 43 per cent from R156 million (US$13 million) in the March quarter to R223 million (US$18 million) in
the June quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 35 per cent from R98 million (US$8 million) in the March quarter to R132 million
(US$11 million) in the June quarter and non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 57 per cent from R58 million (US$5 million)

Gold production increased by 1 per cent from 131,200 ounces in the March quarter to 133,100 ounces in the June quarter mainly due to
higher tonnes processed and higher plant recovery.

Total tonnes mined, including capital waste stripping, decreased by 18 per cent from 24.8 million tonnes in the March quarter to
20.3 million tonnes in the June quarter due to the transition to contractor mining. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 11 per cent from
3.5 million tonnes to 3.1 million tonnes due to lower planned ore tonnes.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 20 per cent from 6.0 million tonnes to 4.8 million tonnes and capital waste tonnes mined
decreased by 19 per cent from 15.3 million tonnes to 12.4 million tonnes in line with the operational plan. Mined grade increased by
2 per cent from 1.28 grams per tonne to 1.31 grams per tonne. Gold mined decreased by 9 per cent from 146,100 ounces to 132,500 ounces
as a result of lower ore tonnes mined. The strip ratio decreased from 6.0 to 5.5.

The CIL plant throughput increased by 3 per cent from 3.4 million tonnes to 3.5 million tonnes due to improved milling rate and higher
plant utilisation. Yield decreased by 1 per cent from 1.19 grams per tonne to 1.18 grams per tonne. This was mainly due to more ore
fed from stockpile to augment the ex-pit ore tonnes mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 4 per cent from US$77 million to US$74 million mainly due to lower
tonnes mined, partially offset by a bigger gold-in-process drawdown of US$9 million in the June quarter compared with US$2 million in
the March quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 13 per cent from US$39 million to US$44 million due to timing of capital expenditure on the gravity
circuit installation.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased marginally from US$952 per ounce in the March quarter to US$955 per ounce in
the June quarter due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation and
increased gold sold.

Gold production increased by 49 per cent from 36,000 ounces in the March quarter to 53,500 ounces in the June quarter mainly due to
higher head grade mined and processed from Amoanda pit.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 8 per cent from 11.5 million tonnes in the March quarter to 12.4 million
tonnes in the June quarter due to an increase in contractor mining fleet capacity and efficiency in the Damang complex pits.

Ore tonnes mined increased by 46 per cent from 0.71 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.04 million tonnes in the June quarter
mainly from the Amoanda pit area where the ore zones are exposed. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 6 per cent from 10.8 million
tonnes to 11.4 million tonnes due to improved efficiencies from contractor mining fleet. Capital waste tonnes included in total waste
tonnes decreased by 12 per cent from 10.0 million tonnes to 8.8 million tonnes as a result of timely exposure of the ore zones at
Amoanda pit in line with operational plan. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 225 per cent from 0.8 million tonnes to
2.6 million tonnes in line with the operational plan.


Head grade mined increased by 29 per cent from 1.53 grams per tonne to 1.97 grams per tonne due to higher grade mined from Amoanda pit.
Gold mined increased by 90 per cent from 34,700 ounces to 66,100 ounces. The strip ratio decreased from 15.3 to 10.9.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 1.11 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.05 million tonnes in the June quarter due
to lower plant overall equipment efficiency. Yield increased by 56 per cent from 1.01 grams per tonne to 1.58 grams per tonne due to
higher head grade mined. In the June quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as follows: 0.89 million tonnes at 1.94 grams per tonne from
the pits and 0.16 million tonnes at 0.60 grams per tonne from stockpiles. This compared 0.63 million tonnes at 1.47 grams per tonne
from the pits and 0.48 million tonnes at 0.66 grams per tonne from stockpiles in the March quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 17 per cent from US$29 million to US$34 million mainly due to an
increase in cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciations as a result of higher operating tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from US$37 million in the March quarter to US$36 million in the June quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 33 per cent from US$3 million to US$4 million due to cost incurred on the Gyratory Crusher
replacement. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 6 per cent from US$34 million to US$32 million mainly due to lower
capital waste mined (8.8 million tonnes in the June quarter compared with 10.0 million tonnes mined in the March quarter).

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 22 per cent from US$951 per ounce in the March quarter to US$746 per ounce in the June quarter
mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher sustaining capital expenditure and higher cost of sales before
amortisation and depreciation.

All-in costs decreased by 30 per cent from US$1,934 per ounce in the March quarter to US$1,347 per ounce in the June quarter due to the
same reasons as above as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.
At the end of the June 2018 quarter (18 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project, DRP), total material mined amounted to 64 million
tonnes, 24 per cent ahead of the project schedule. Gold produced during the same period was 233,000 ounces, 46 per cent above the DRP
plan of 160,000 ounces. All major projects are on schedule. Installation of the Jaw Crusher commenced in the June 2018 quarter. The
SAG mill shell replacement is on track with installation and commissioning planned for the December 2018 quarter.

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 29,900 ounces in the March quarter to 30,900 ounces in the June quarter due to higher
yield. Copper production decreased by 1 per cent from 7,361 tonnes to 7,317 tonnes. Equivalent gold production increased marginally
from 68,700 ounces to 69,000 ounces mainly due to higher gold head grade in line with the mining sequence.

Gold   head grade increased by 7 per cent from 0.83 grams per tonne to 0.89 grams per tonne and gold recoveries increased from 69.3 per
cent   to 69.7 per cent, in line with the mining sequence and the operational plan. Copper head grade increased from 0.52 per cent to
0.54   per cent and copper recoveries decreased slightly from 87.7 per cent to 87.6 per cent. Gold yield increased by 3 per cent from
0.58   grams per tonne to 0.60 grams per tonne due to higher head grade and higher recoveries and copper yield remained similar at
0.46   per cent, in line with the mining sequence.

In the June quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 28,475 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,302 per ounce and
7,105 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$6,244 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This compared with
28,093 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,317 per ounce and 7,076 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average
price of US$6,191 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the March quarter.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 10 per cent from 5.85 million tonnes in the March quarter to 5.24 million tonnes in the June quarter
mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined decreased by 4 per cent from 1.68 million tonnes to
1.62 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 13 per cent from 4.17 million tonnes to 3.62 million tonnes in line
with the 2018 mining plan. The strip ratio decreased from 2.49 to 2.24 due to lower waste mined.

Ore processed was similar at 1.67 million tonnes.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 5 per cent from US$38 million to US$40 million mainly due to a
US$2 million charge to costs as a result of a drawdown in stockpiles in the June quarter compared with a credit of US$2 million due to
a build-up of stockpiles in the March quarter.
Capital expenditure increased by 133 per cent from US$3 million to US$7 million due to an increase in construction activities at the
tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the dry season.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce increased by 321 per cent from US$75 per ounce in the March quarter to
US$316 per ounce in the June quarter mainly due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by increased gold sold. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 17 per cent from US$677 per equivalent ounce to US$795 per
equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above and increased gold equivalent ounces sold.

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 100,500 tonnes in the March quarter to
86,200 tonnes in the June quarter due to a reduction in ore development. Head grade increased by 15 per cent from 3.44 grams per
tonne to 3.96 grams per tonne with higher grade stopes mined during the June quarter as per the mining schedule. Gold mined from
Hamlet underground remained similar at 11,000 ounces.

Development at the Invincible underground operation continued with ore tonnes mined increasing by 210 per cent from 30,800 tonnes in
the March quarter to 95,400 tonnes in the June quarter with the first stopes mined in the June quarter. Head grade mined decreased by
26 per cent from 7.18 grams per tonne to 5.34 grams per tonne due to an increase in ore development which reduced total ore head grade.
Gold mined from Invincible underground increased by 130 per cent from 7,100 ounces to 16,300 ounces.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 44 per cent from 1.6 million tonnes in the March quarter to 0.9 million
tonnes in the June quarter with focus given to operational waste removal at Neptune stages 5 and 6.

Grade mined from open pits, decreased by 14 per cent from 3.05 grams per tonne to 2.63 grams per tonne mainly due to lower grade mined
at Neptune in line with the mining plan. Gold mined from open pits decreased by 51 per cent from 160,200 ounces to 77,700 ounces.
This reduction is in line with the mine plan with the mining contractor at Neptune demobilising to reflect the lower levels of open pit
mining activity as Invincible open pit comes to an end. The Neptune and Invincible pits will now be mined using the existing owner
mining fleet. In the June quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.6 million tonnes at 3.17 grams per tonne from Invincible
and 0.3 million tonnes at 1.52 grams per tonne from Neptune. This compared with 0.9 million tonnes at 2.48 grams per tonne from
Invincible and 0.7 million tonnes at 3.78 grams per tonne from Neptune in the March quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 10 per cent from 2.0 million tonnes in the March quarter to 2.2 million tonnes in the June
quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 38 per cent from 3.7 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes with no further pre-strip
activities planned at Invincible open pit during 2018. Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 25 per cent from
7.3 million tonnes to 5.4 million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 3.5 to 4.9 driven by the stages 5 and 6 at Neptune.

Ounces mined at the consolidated St Ives mine decreased by 41 per cent from 178,400 ounces in the March quarter to 105,100 ounces in
the June quarter. At the end of the June quarter, Neptune high-grade oxide material stockpiled amounted to 77,600 ounces
(1,142,000 tonnes at 2.34 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 44,500 ounces (375,000 tonnes at 2.81 grams per tonne) and
A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.46 grams per tonne). This compared with 90,600 ounces (1,136,000 tonnes at 2.48 grams
per tonne) at Neptune, Invincible amounted to 28,700 ounces (368,000 tonnes at 2.43 grams per tonne) and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces
(174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne), at the end of the March quarter. Currently, Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide
material blend. The excess Neptune oxide material is stockpiled and fed to the mill so as to maintain the optimum blend.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 1.07 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.02 million tonnes in the
June quarter due to a scheduled major maintenance shutdown in the June quarter. Yield increased by 5 per cent from 2.76 grams per
tonne to 2.89 grams per tonne.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 62 per cent from A$39 million (US$30 million) to A$63 million
(US$48 million). The increase in cost of sales before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciations was the result of the
commencement of stope mining at Invincible (A$4 million/US$3 million) and costs incurred in the major maintenance shutdown
(A$5 million/US$3 million), partially offset by reduced mining costs at Hamlet underground (A$3 million/US$2 million). In addition, a
gold
inventory credit of A$9 million (US$6 million) in the June quarter compared with A$27 million (US$21 million) in the March quarter.
This decreased net stockpile credit of A$18 million (US$15 million) adds to the A$6 million (US$3 million) increase in cost of sales
before gold inventory change and amortisation and depreciations for an overall A$24 million (US$18 million) increase in cost of sales
before amortisation and depreciation.

Capital expenditure decreased by 5 per cent from A$38 million (US$30 million) to A$36 million (US$27 million) mainly due to lower
capital waste tonnes mined in the open pits.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 26 per cent from A$873 per ounce (US$686 per ounce) in the March quarter to
A$1,103 per ounce (US$839 per ounce) in the June quarter due to higher cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, partially
offset by lower capital expenditure and higher gold sold.

62,600 ounces. In the June quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 168,000 tonnes at 8.3 grams per tonne from Waroonga and
155,900 tonnes at 3.6 grams per tonne from New Holland. This compared with 147,400 tonnes at 9.0 grams per tonne from Waroonga and
145,300 tonnes at 4.0 grams per tonne from New Holland in the March quarter.
Tonnes processed increased by 8 per cent from 282,900 tonnes in the March quarter to 304,900 tonnes in the June quarter.   The combined
yield decreased by 10 per cent from 6.44 grams per tonne to 5.79 grams per tonne due to the lower grades mined.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, decreased by 17 per cent from A$60 million (US$47 million) in the March quarter to
A$50 million (US$37 million) in the June quarter due to a decrease in mining costs of A$2 million (US$2 million) as a result of the mix
between ore and capital development. In addition, a gold-in-circuit credit of A$2 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter compared
with a gold-in-circuit charge of A$6 million (US$5 million) in the March quarter. The credit to cost in the June quarter was primarily
due to a build-up of stockpiles with more ore mined than processed. During the March quarter, there was a 900 ounce drawdown of gold-
in-circuit and a decrease in the average cost of stockpiled ore and gold-in-circuit.

Capital expenditure increased by 19 per cent from A$21 million (US$16 million) to A$25 million (US$19 million) mainly due to increased
capital development expenditure with more capital development and less ore development in the June quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 1 per cent from A$1,402 per ounce (US$1,103 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,383 per ounce (US$1,044 per ounce) in the June quarter due to lower cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation,
partially offset by higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 69,800 ounces in the March quarter to 67,400 ounces in the June quarter mainly due to
lower grades mined and a decrease in ore tonnes processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 408,500 tonnes to 423,700 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 8 per cent from
5.71 grams per tonne in the March quarter to 5.23 grams per tonnes in the June quarter due to spatial compliance and geotechnical
sequencing constraints in the zone 110 and zone 120 ore bodies. As a result, ounces mined decreased by 5 per cent from 75,000 ounces
in the March quarter to 71,300 ounces in the June quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 429,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 406,400 tonnes in the June quarter due to timing
of milling campaigns quarter on quarter. The yield increased by 2 per cent from 5.06 grams per tonne to 5.16 grams per tonne due to a
drawdown of 3,500 ounces of gold-in-circuit in the June quarter compared with a build-up of 4,600 ounces in the March quarter.

Cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation, increased by 6 per cent from A$51 million (US$40 million) in the March quarter to
A$54 million (US$41 million) in the June quarter due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) increase in contractor mining and ground support
costs required in the lower zones and a A$1 million (US$1 million) gold-in-circuit charge in the June quarter compared with a gold-in-
circuit credit of A$1 million (US$1 million) in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 25 per cent from A$24 million (US$19 million) to A$30 million (US$23 million). The increase in
capital from the previous quarter was primarily due to increased exploration of A$2 million (US$2 million), increased underground and
TSF development of A$3 million (US$2 million) and the purchase of an additional Jumbo development drill rig of A$1 million
(US$1 million).

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent from A$1,131 per ounce (US$890 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,311 per ounce (US$995 per ounce) in the June quarter due to higher capital expenditure, higher cost of sales before amortisation
and depreciation and lower gold sold.

MEDIA RELEASE

 South Deep Restructuring and Trading Statement

Johannesburg, 14 August 2018: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) announces a restructuring at its South Deep
operation and provides a further trading statement relating to its H1
2018 results, due for release on Thursday, 16 August 2018.

South Deep has had a number of operational challenges since Gold
Fields acquired it in 2006. The key challenge has been the difficulty
in transitioning the mine from one run with a conventional mining
mindset and practices to mining with a modern, bulk, mechanised
mining approach. South Deep is a complex and unique mine, that
has faced persistent issues that need to be addressed in a holistic
manner which include:
    - Rising operating and overhead costs, which are not aligned
        with the profile of a high-volume, medium-grade operation or
        with current output levels;
    - Consistent failure to meet mining and production targets;
    - Unique and complex mining method, long hole stoping mining
        at 3,000m with attendant challenging geotechnical and
        ground conditions requiring extensive support;
    - Extensive infrastructure and support services required to
        underpin mining activities, which continue to operate sub-
        optimally impacting backfill and stope turn over;
    - Poor equipment reliability and productivity impacted by poor
        maintenance practices and operational conditions;
    - The operation is staffed and resourced for a much higher
        production rate than is currently being achieved; and
    - Overall labour productivity is significantly below industry
        average.
Despite numerous interventions to address these challenges,
including optimising the mining method, extensive training and skills
development, changing shift and work configurations, and
outsourcing functions, the mine continues to make losses (R4bn over
the past five years). Gold Fields has invested a total of approximately

R32bn (including the R22bn acquisition cost) since acquiring the mine in 2006. Management believes
that the mine can no longer sustain these cash losses and that the cost structure needs to be realigned
with the current lower level of production.

During Q1 2018, South Deep completed phase 2 of its organisational restructuring plan, focusing on
the lower levels of the organisation, through a voluntary retrenchment programme, which resulted in
261 employees leaving the company This followed the restructuring in Q4 2017 (phase 1) at the more
senior levels of the business, which comprised a 25% reduction (47 employees) in the management
level.

Although this restructuring was mostly voluntary in nature, it nonetheless had a significant negative
impact on morale and consequently productivity and output during H1 2018. In addition, continued low
mobile equipment reliability and productivity, the intersection of active geological features (faults and
dykes) in the high-grade corridor 3 and poor ground conditions in the composites (far western part of
the orebody) slowed production rates.

These challenges have resulted in an underperformance on development and destress mining and has
impacted stope availability and output. Stope availability and output has also been adversely affected
as a result of slow loading and backfilling. These challenges will not only impact the mines 2018
performance but the knock-on effect will carry through into 2019 and beyond.

Despite the most recent restructuring, South Deep continues to face a number of organisational and
structural challenges that directly impacts both short and consequently long term performance. The
mine did not see much improvement in Q2 2018 post the restructuring and shift changes, with
production only marginally higher at 1,518kg (49koz) from 1,485kg (48koz) in Q1 2018. Similarly, the
cash burn continued into Q2 2018 at R295m (US$24m) compared to R361m (US$30m) in Q1 2018.

South Deep needs to be operated and scheduled as a safe, deep-level, capital-intensive, but highly
mechanised and efficient operation. This will require a reduction in fleet and the associated labour
complement as well as an improvement in effectiveness and productivity to build sufficient margin in
the business to carry the high fixed cost base and deliver sustainable profitability.

South Deep has over a number of years embarked on a host of initiatives to improve the productivity
and deliver sustainable profitability, which to date have not had the desired impact. In the context of
continued negative cash flow, management believes that the best course of action to address these
issues includes further restructuring at the mine. The proposed restructuring at South Deep aims to
consolidate mining activity to increase focus and to match the cost structure to the current level of
performance.

Section 189 process commences
Management intends to commence with consultations in terms of Section 189 of the Labour Relations
Act. It is envisaged that approximately 1,100 permanent employees could potentially be impacted by
the proposed restructuring. In addition, approximately 460 contractors could also potentially be
impacted. South Deep currently employs 3,614 full-time employees and 1,940 contractors.

Section 189 notices will be served on its two representative trade unions, the National Union of
Mineworkers and UASA. This will be followed by a 60-day consultation process, which will be
facilitated by the CCMA. The Minister of Mineral Resources has been informed of these developments.

Focus on securing the future with intensive near term initiatives
In support of returning the mine to sustainable profitability we propose to:
    - Temporarily suspend mining activities at 87 Level and redeploy these mining crews into the 4W
       corridor;
   -   Service the eastern part of the mine from the Twin Shafts and restaff the South Shaft
       operations to a single shift per day. South Shaft will facilitate the provision of the following
       services to the full mining operation: Water and Backfill reticulation, Water Pumping,
       Ventilation;
   -   Reduce growth capital expenditure for the next 18 months to reduce the cash burn. New mine
       development has outperformed the plan in recent years, which allows us some flexibility to
       reduce this activity for the near term.
Given the significant impact of the restructuring from late 2017 and early 2018, we are unable to
quantify the impact of the proposed large scale restructuring on production in 2019 and beyond.
Consequently, the previously guided build-up plan for the mine (released in February 2018) has a high
degree of risk and uncertainty and can no longer be relied upon.

In addition, based on the current situation, detailed mine planning will be undertaken over the next few
months. Once the full impact of the mine planning exercise and proposed restructuring is completed,
we will provide guidance for 2019 and beyond.

The underperformance in 2018 and the resultant knock-on impact has necessitated a further
impairment of South Deep. As discussed above, we are unable to provide guidance for 2019 and
beyond. However, for the purpose of the impairment calculation, we have used a number equivalent to
extrapolating H1 2018 production for 2019 of 6,100kg (196koz).

As a result, South Deep has been further impaired by R4.8bn (US$359m) (net of tax) to a carrying
value of R20.7bn (US$1.5bn). The information underlying the impairment calculation may be subject to
further adjustments in the future. These adjustments could be as a result of further information
becoming available to management during Gold Fields production planning processes.

Trading statement
Further to the trading statement issued on 8 August, shareholders are advised that headline earnings
per share (HEPS) for the six months ended 30 June 2018 (H1 2018) are expected to be unchanged at
US$0.08 per share from the US$0.08 per share reported for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (H1
2017).

The basic loss per share for H1 2018 is expected to be US$0.45 per share, a drop of US$0.52 per
share (743%) from the basic earnings of US$0.07 per share reported for H1 2017.

Normalised earnings for H1 2018 are expected to be US$0.05 per share, 44% (US$0.04 per share)
lower than the US$0.09 per share reported for H1 2017.

The net loss for the Group for H1 2018 is impacted by the following non-recurring items:
- US$482m (R6.5bn) (gross) or US$359m (R4.8bn) (net of tax) impairment related to South Deep;
   and
- US$96m related to the change to contractor mining in Ghana (US$65m retrenchment and US$31m
   impairment of fleet and inventory).

Attributable Group gold-equivalent production for Q2 2018 is expected to be 504koz (Q1 2018:
490koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$973/oz (Q1 2018: US$955/oz) and all-in costs (AIC)
of US$1,187/oz (Q1 2018: US$1,150/oz).

For H1 2018, attributable gold equivalent production is expected to be 994koz (H1 2017: 1,047koz),
with AISC of US$965/oz (H1 2017: US$980/oz) and AIC of US$1,169/oz (H1 2017: US$1,103/oz).

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and reported
on, by the Companys external auditors.
Gold Fields will release H1 2018 financial results on Thursday, 16 August 2018, at 12pm.

NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE IN AUDITOR


The Board of Directors of Gold Fields (the Board), through the Audit
Committee, wishes to inform Shareholders that after a formal tender
process to appoint a new firm of external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc have been appointed as the Companys
external auditors, with Mr. Pieter Hough as the designated audit
partner for the financial year ending 31 December 2019.

KPMG Incs appointment as external auditors will end on conclusion of
its responsibilities relating to the 31 December 2018 financial year
audit, which is expected to be concluded on or about the end of April
2019 and PricewaterhouseCoopers Incs appointment as external auditor
will be effective immediately after KPMG Incs appointment so
concludes, subject to shareholder approval at the annual general
meeting for the year ending 31 December 2018, the Board having
resolved to fill the vacancy in the office of auditor that so arises
with PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc.

The audit reports of KPMG Inc on the consolidated financial statements
of Gold Fields Limited and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
31 December 2017 and 2016 did not contain any adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During Gold
Fields financial years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 and through
the subsequent interim period on or prior to 23 July 2018, there were
no disagreements between Gold Fields and KPMG Inc on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to
their satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference in
connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the
disagreement, or reportable events.

The Board and the Audit Committee are satisfied that KPMG Inc
delivered an audit of satisfactory quality for the financial year
ended 31 December 2017

Statement by Nick Holland
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

Q1 2018 Performance
2018 is the second year of Gold Fields' reinvestment programme. Following a strong year in 2017, in Q1 2018 the Damang reinvestment
project continued to progress according to plan, the Gruyere project has been impacted by severe weather and South Deep performed below
expectation. However, the international operations continue to perform well, in most cases exceeding their budgets for the quarter.

Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 1% lower YoY (10% lower QoQ) at 490koz (production in Q1 2017 included
14koz from Darlot, which was divested in Q4 2017). All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were 6% lower YoY (flat QoQ) at US$955/oz and all-in
costs (AIC) were 3% higher YoY (3% higher QoQ) at US$1,150/oz. The average US$ gold price achieved in the quarter was 8% or US$100/oz
higher YoY (3% higher QoQ) at US$1,316/oz. The average Australian dollar for the quarter was 0.79 (5% stronger YoY and 3% stronger
QoQ), while the average South African rand for the quarter was 12.01 (9% stronger YoY and 12% stronger QoQ).

Despite the higher level of project capital being spent by the Group as well as the payment of the FY17 dividend during the quarter,
there was only a modest increase in the net debt balance to US$1,373m from US$1,303m at 31 December 2017.

Regional performance
Managed production in Ghana for Q1 2018 was 167koz, down 4% YoY (down 4% QoQ), with AIC of US$1,163/oz, up 1% YoY (up 10% QoQ), as
spending on the Damang reinvestment project continued during the quarter. Gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona was flat YoY (14%
lower QoQ) at 69koz, with AIC of US$677 per equivalent ounce, up 8% YoY (down 5% QoQ). The Australian region (continuing operations)
produced 224koz for the quarter, up 6% YoY (down 2% QoQ), with AIC of A$1,094/oz (US$861/oz), down 11% YoY (down 19% QoQ).

South Deep
South Deep had a tough start to 2018, with production in Q1 2018 4% higher YoY but 41% lower QoQ at 1,485kg (48koz). AIC for the
quarter was R677,495/kg, down 13% YoY (up 18% QoQ).

Production for the quarter was impacted by the slow production build up after the seasonal holidays; two labour restructuring processes
that took place at the end of 2017 and during the quarter; and a change in underground working shift arrangements implemented to
increase productivity. Although necessary to create a platform for sustainable and consistent performance, these changes have
inevitably created workforce uncertainty and a disruption of operations. The labour restructuring comprised 47 personnel at managerial
levels and approximately 260 personnel at lower levels. The restructuring was done to streamline organisational levels and increase
spans of control and was effected through a combination of voluntary and statutory processes. The change in underground shift
arrangements effected in early April have provided a longer shift of 11.5 hours instead of the previous 9.5 hours. The intention is to
increase the effective time on the face and it will take some time to see the impact of the change.

In addition continued low mobile equipment reliability, the intersection of active geological features (faults and dykes) in the
high-grade corridor 3 and poor ground conditions in the composites (far western part of the orebody) slowed production rates.
Production for the month of April 2018 was further impacted by a 22-day DMR safety related stoppage to re-support back areas in two of
the critical new mine access ramps, which account for half of total production for the mine.

The mine team is currently developing a recovery plan aimed at mobilising the workforce post the restructuring and bedding down the new
underground shift cycles. Management is implementing programmes to improve and integrate the critical aspects of the mining value
chain. Backfill placement programmes continue to be implemented to improve both the quantity and quality of backfill used to fill open
stopes and significant emphasis is being placed on developing integrated plans, short interval controls and the required discipline to
execute these plans and schedules.

Based on the above factors, we do not expect the production guidance provided at the start of the year (10,000kg or 321koz) to be
achieved and we are currently forecasting production of 7,600 kg or 244koz for the year. The reduced full year guidance is attributable
to the ongoing impact of poor equipment reliability, the slower advance rates in Corridor 3 and delayed extraction in the composites as
well as slower rates of destress in the March quarter, again a symptom of the lower productivity related to uncertainty around the
labour restructuring

Additional artisans have been sourced from the equipment manufacturers to urgently address equipment availabilities. Poor ground
conditions are mostly a symptom of the transition to more effective pillar designs as recommended by the independent geotechnical
review board; lack of timeous and effective stope cleaning and backfill, as well as timeous and effective secondary support. These
constraints are receiving urgent attention.

Wage negotiations concluded at South Deep
South Deep has concluded a three-year wage agreement with organised labour (NUM and UASA). The agreement provides for an average annual
increase of 7.3%.

Update on projects
Damang Reinvestment Project
At the end of the March 2018 quarter (15 months into the reinvestment project), total material mined was 22% ahead of the project
schedule. Gold produced during the same period was 180koz, 35% above plan. All major projects are on schedule. The FETSF was
commissioned on time during January 2018 and the jaw crusher installation is in progress and anticipated to be commissioned in the
June 2018 quarter. The SAG mill shell replacement is on track as per the original schedule with installation and commissioning planned
for the December 2018 quarter. Project spend to date amounted to US$169m.

Gruyere
At Gruyere, the previously flagged abnormal rainfall events in Q1 2018 have impacted the schedule and costs of the project. Guidance
from the provisional definitive cost estimate and schedule review indicates that the project capex is likely to be 10% higher than
previously provided guidance (A$532m), with first production expected to move into Q2 2019 (previously Q1 2019). At the end of the
quarter, overall project engineering and construction were 84% and 44% complete respectively, with EPC (process plant and associated
infrastructure) construction 17% complete. Mining contractor, Downer EDI has commenced site mobilisation in preparation for mining
activities. The gas pipeline and power plant are progressing well. Project spend to date amounted to A$205m.

Tarkwa transition to contract mining completed
The mining contract was demarcated into two zones and awarded to two local contractors: BCM for Zone 1 (Pepe, Mantraim, Atuabo and
Teberebe Pits) and E&P for Zone 2 (Akontansi and Kottraverchy Pits). On 24 March 2018, BCM mobilised and started operations in the
Zone 1 area, with E&P following on 7 April in the Zone 2 area. As part of the conditions for the tender process, the successful
contractors were expected to acquire our existing fleet and inventory. The total consideration for the fleet was US$96m, with 26% of
the total amount paid in Q1 and the remaining amount expected to be paid in Q2. A contracts implementation manager has been appointed
to oversee the two contractors.

All Mining and Heavy Maintenance Equipment (HME) and some support services staff have been retrenched and both contractors are
currently in the process of re-engaging most of the affected employees. Below is a breakdown of labour numbers:

 Mining and HME: 1,309 retrenched, with 431 ex-Gold Fields employees re-hired by BCM and 778 ex-Gold Fields employees re-hired by E&P.
 Other Departments: 765 retrenched and 505 re-engaged on fixed-term contract basis. This excludes 69 national senior officials on
 regular employment status and 12 expatriates.

The High Court, Accra (Labour Division) on 2 March 2018, dismissed an injunction application filed by the Ghana Mineworkers Union,
which sought to restrain Gold Fields from issuing severance letters to workers to be affected by the change in business model from
owner mining to contract mining.

AIC guidance for 2018 of US$970/oz provided in February 2018 is unchanged and assumed the change to contractor mining would be
completed in Q2 2018.

Gold Fields enters Joint Venture with Asanko
As announced on 29 March 2018, Gold Fields entered into a joint venture with Asanko Gold, by agreeing to acquire a 50% stake in Asanko
Gold Ghana Limiteds (AGG) 90% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine, associated properties and exploration rights in Ghana (AGM). The
purchase consideration comprises an upfront payment of US$165m on closing of the transaction and a deferred payment of US$20m.

In addition, Gold Fields subscribed to a 9.9% share placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657 Asanko shares at a
price of approximately US$0.79, for a total consideration of US$17.6m (completed on 5 April 2018).

Update on gold hedging
The Group entered into additional gold price hedges during the quarter. Below is a summary of the gold hedges for 2018:

  In Ghana, 489koz (72% of FY 2018 gold production guidance) has been hedged for the period January to December 2018 using zero-cost
  collars with an average floor price of US$1,300/oz and an average cap price of US$1,418/oz.

  In Australia 674koz (78% of FY 2018 gold production guidance) has been hedged for the period February to December 2018 using a
  combination of forward sales agreements and zero-cost collars. The average forward rate on 221koz for the period February to December
  2018 is A$1,713.83; and the average collar strike price on 453koz for the period March to December 2018 is A$1703/oz for the floor
  and A$1,766.75/oz for the cap.

  In South Africa, 64koz has been hedged for the period January to December 2018 using zero-cost collars with a floor price of
  R600,000/kg and a cap price of R665,621/kg.

Revised outlook for 2018
As a result of the revised South Deep production outlook mentioned above, attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for
2018 is expected to be between 2.00Moz and 2.05Moz.

Gold production decreased by 41 per cent from 2,512 kilograms (80,800 ounces) in the December quarter to 1,485 kilograms
(47,700 ounces) in the March quarter mainly due to lower volumes mined partially attributable to labour restructuring and new
shift system implementation with the associated disruptions in terms of crew briefings and transition to the new shift cycles.
Over and above these factors, the March quarter is characterised by the extended Christmas break, typical of South African based mines.

On 1 March 2018 the shift roster was changed from 9.5 hours to 11.5 hours to optimise face time. There were initial teething problems
and the benefits are yet to be realised. D and E band restructuring commenced in October 2017 and was concluded by end January 2018
with 25 per cent of employees in this category exiting the business. Subsequently, a further 260 employees from the bargaining unit
also exited the business.

In December 2017 there was no voluntary production work conducted over the Christmas Break as planned engineering maintenance work was
required on critical infrastructure.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 21 per cent from 394,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 313,000 tonnes in the March
quarter. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 24 per cent from 336,000 tonnes to 255,000 tonnes, while underground waste mined remained
similar at 58,000 tonnes. Total gold mined from underground decreased by 25 per cent from 2,006 kilograms (64,500 ounces) to
1,504 kilograms (48,400 ounces). Grade mined decreased by 6 per cent per cent from 5.10 grams per tonne to 4.80 grams per tonne
mainly due to more waste mined in New Mine Development and lower volumes mined from higher grade areas.

Total tonnes milled decreased by 27 per cent from 557,000 tonnes to 407,000 tonnes. Underground ore tonnes milled decreased by
25 per cent from 414,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 311,000 tonnes in the March quarter. Underground waste milled decreased
by 18 per cent from 39,000 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes. Surface tailings material treated decreased by 38 per cent from 104,000 tonnes
to 64,000 tonnes. Underground reef yield decreased by 22 per cent from 6.04 grams per tonne to 4.74 grams per tonne due to more waste
mined in New Mine Development and lower volumes mined from higher grade areas.

Ore milled was higher than ore mined due to tramming of additional underground stocks.

Gold recovered from underground was 1,475 kilograms (47,400 ounces) with 10 kilograms (300 ounces) being recovered from treatment
of the surface material.
Destress mining decreased by 27 per cent from 9,619 square metres in the December quarter to 7,061 square metres in the March quarter
mainly due to geological feature intersections and the impact of the extended Christmas break.

Longhole stoping decreased by 33 per cent from 173,400 tonnes to 116,300 tonnes due to constraints associated with secondary stopes
and the introduction of more rigid quality control procedures and compliance to planned extraction. The current mine contributed
78 per cent of the total ore tonnes in the March quarter compared with 73 per cent in the December quarter. The longhole stoping
method accounted for 37 per cent of total tonnes mined in the March quarter compared with 44 per cent in the December quarter.

Development decreased by 16 per cent from 1,935 metres in the December quarter to 1,617 square metres in the March quarter. New mine
capital development on 100 level increased by 11 per cent from 304 metres to 337 metres. New mine development is focused on
infrastructure projects exclusively on 100 level and related to haulage extensions, crusher excavations and conveyor extensions.
Development in the current mine areas increased by 11 per cent from 833 metres to 923 metres. Development North of Wrench decreased by
55 per cent from 798 metres to 357 metres largely due to insufficient power capacity and as a result of Corridor 3 Cut 4 that was
stopped as it approached the abutment of Corridor 3 Cut 3.

Net operating costs decreased by 7 per cent from R1,027 million (US$75 million) to R952 million (US$79 million) mainly due to lower
production, lower bonuses, overtime and consumables cost and a decrease in the gold-in-process charge from R51 million (US$4 million)
in the December quarter to R25 million (US$2 million) in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 62 per cent from R412 million (US$30 million) in the December quarter to R156 million (US$13 million)
in the March quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 68 per cent from R303 million (US$22 million) in the December quarter to R98 million
(US$8 million) in the March and non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 47 per cent from R109 million (US$8 million) to
R58 million (US$5 million), both due to scheduling.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 21 per cent from R532,573 per kilogram (US$1,209 per ounce) in the December quarter to
R643,021 per kilogram (US$1,666 per ounce) in the March quarter mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net
operating costs and lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost increased by 18 per cent from R576,043 per kilogram (US$1,310 per ounce) in the December quarter to R677,495 per
kilogram (US$1,755 per ounce) in the March quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs and lower non-sustaining
capital expenditure.

17 per cent from 4.2 million tonnes to 3.5 million tonnes due to suspension of mining in the ore zone at Underlap as a result of
geotechnical challenges. The footwall of Underlap pit experienced slope deformation caused by development of tension cracks along a
known fault zone at the footwall area of the pit. Mining at Underlap was suspended and a safety bund was constructed at the toe of the
footwall wall to render the area safe. Mining at Underlap resumed subsequent to the March quarter end.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 7.0 million tonnes to 6.0 million tonnes, while capital waste tonnes mined
increased by 18 per cent from 13.0 million tonnes to 15.3 million tonnes due to increased focus on capital waste stripping to expose
ore. Mined grade decreased by 2 per cent from 1.30 grams per tonne to 1.28 grams per tonne. Gold mined decreased by 17 per cent from
176,700 ounces to 146,100 ounces as a result of lower ore tonnes and grade mined. The strip ratio increased from 4.7 to 6.0 due to
higher capital waste tonnes mined.

The CIL plant throughput increased by 3 per cent from 3.3 million tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes due to higher plant overall equipment
and processing efficiencies. Yield decreased by 9 per cent from 1.31 grams per tonne to 1.19 grams per tonne. This was mainly due to
lower grade mined and low grade stockpiles processed due to late delivery of higher grades to the plant.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 7 per cent from US$72 million to US$77 million mainly due to a
gold-in-process drawdown of US$2 million in the March quarter compared with a build-up of US$16 million in the December quarter, this
was partially offset by lower mining costs in line with lower ore and operational waste tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 7 per cent from US$42 million to US$39 million due to lower expenditure on components change-out and
nil expenditure on fleet replacements as a result of transition to contract mining.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 9 per cent from US$871 per ounce in the December quarter to US$952 per ounce
in the March quarter due to higher net operating costs and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

Tarkwa mining operation concluded the planned transition from owner mining to contract mining in early April 2018. The transition went
smoothly.

Gold production increased by 4 per cent from 34,500 ounces in the December quarter to 36,000 ounces in the March quarter mainly due to
higher head grade mined and processed from Amoanda pit.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 2 per cent from 11.3 million tonnes in the December quarter to
11.5 million tonnes in the March quarter due to an increase in contractor drilling and digging fleet capacity in the Damang complex
pits.

Ore tonnes mined decreased by 5 per cent from 0.75 million tonnes in the December quarter to 0.71 million tonnes in the March quarter
as a result of higher strip ratio areas mined in line with operational plan. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 3 per cent from
10.5 million tonnes to 10.8 million tonnes due to improved efficiencies from contractor mining fleet. Capital waste tonnes included
in total waste tonnes increased by 14 per cent from 8.8 million tonnes to 10.0 million tonnes as a result of improved mining fleet
capacity and recovery of delayed capital waste strip for timely exposure of the orebody in line with operational plan. Operational
waste tonnes mined decreased by 53 per cent from 1.7 million tonnes to 0.8 million tonnes due to mining of higher strip ratio areas,
in line with operational plan.

Head grade mined increased by 44 per cent from 1.06 grams per tonne to 1.53 grams per tonne due to higher grade mined from Amoanda pit.
Gold mined increased by 35 per cent from 25,700 ounces to 34,700 ounces. The strip ratio increased from 14.0 to 15.3.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 1.17 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.11 million tonnes in the March quarter
due to lower plant overall equipment efficiency. Yield increased by 10 per cent from 0.92 grams per tonne to 1.01 grams per tonne due
to higher grade mined. In the March quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as follows: 0.63 million tonnes at 1.47 grams per tonne from
the pits and 0.48 million tonnes at 0.66 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings. This compared with 0.67 million tonnes at 1.07 grams
per tonne from the pits, 0.06 million tonnes at 0.93 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 0.44 million tonnes at 0.77 grams per
tonne from stockpiles in the December quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 12 per cent from US$33 million to US$29 million mainly due to
a decrease in operating cost from US$32 million in the December quarter to US$30 million in the March quarter as a result of lower
operating tonnes mined in addition to a credit of US$1 million in the March quarter for the ROM stockpile recognition compared with
a cost of US$1 million in the December quarter for the depletion of 44,000 tonnes from the crushed ore stockpile.

Capital expenditure increased by 32 per cent from US$28 million in the December quarter to US$37 million in the March quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased from US$nil million to US$3 million due to cost incurred on the SAG mill shell replacement.
Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 21 per cent from US$28 million to US$34 million mainly due to higher capital waste
mined (10.0 million tonnes in the March quarter compared with 8.8 million tonnes mined in the December quarter) and the timing of
Amoanda Resource infill drilling projects.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 4 per cent from US$991 per ounce in the December quarter to US$951 per ounce in the March quarter
mainly due to increased gold sold and lower net operating cost, partially offset by increased sustaining capital expenditure.

All-in costs increased by 7 per cent from US$1,802 per ounce in the December quarter to US$1,934 per ounce in the March quarter due to
the same reasons as above, offset by higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

At the end of the March 2018 quarter (15 months into the Damang Reinvestment Project, DRP), total material mined is 22   per cent ahead
of the project schedule. Gold produced during the same period is 179,600 ounces, 35 per cent above the progressive DRP   plan of
133,400 ounces. All major projects are on schedule. FETSF was commissioned on time during January 2018 and jaw crusher   installation is
in progress and anticipated to be commissioned in the June 2018 quarter. The SAG mill shell replacement is on track as   per the original
schedule with installation and commissioning planned for the December 2018 quarter. A one month CIL plant downtime was   planned for this
shutdown, but plans are in progress to mitigate the impact of this planned shutdown.

Gold production decreased by 28 per cent from 41,300 ounces in the December quarter to 29,900 ounces in the March quarter due to
lower yield and lower ore tonnes mined. Copper production increased by 1 per cent from 7,317 tonnes to 7,361 tonnes. Equivalent gold
production decreased by 14 per cent from 80,000 ounces to 68,700 ounces mainly due to lower gold head grade in line with the mining
sequence.

Gold head grade decreased by 25 per cent from 1.10 grams per tonne to 0.83 grams per tonne and gold recoveries decreased from
73.3 per cent to 69.3 per cent, in line with the mining sequence and the operational plan. Copper head grade increased by 2 cent
from 0.51 per cent to 0.52 per cent and copper recoveries decreased from 89.3 per cent to 87.7 per cent. Gold yield decreased by
28 per cent from 0.81 grams per tonne to 0.58 grams per tonne due to lower head grade and lower recoveries and copper yield remained
the same at 0.46 per cent, in line with the mining sequence.

In the March quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 28,093 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,317 per ounce
and 7,076 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$6,191 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This compared
with 46,459 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,267 per ounce and 7,830 tonnes of copper that was sold at an
average price of US$6,165 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the December quarter.

Total tonnes mined increased by 42 per cent from 4.12 million tonnes in the December quarter to 5.85 million tonnes in the March
quarter mainly due to higher waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined decreased by 4 per cent from 1.75 million tonnes
to 1.68 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 76 per cent from 2.37 million tonnes to 4.17 million tonnes due to
additional waste stripping required to access the ore at depth. This strategy is in line with the life extension as announced in the
previous quarter. The strip ratio increased from 1.35 to 2.49, in line with the 2018 plan.

Ore processed was similar at 1.66 million tonnes.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 16 per cent from US$45 million to US$38 million mainly due to a
credit to costs relating to oxide stockpile sales. In addition, a US$2 million credit to cost as a result of a build-up in concentrate
in the March quarter compared with a US$5 million charge to cost in the December quarter.

During 2017, Cerro Corona entered into an agreement with Minera Coimolache to sell 7 million tonnes of oxide stocks to be processed at
the neighbouring Tantahuatay facilities in Cajamarca over the next 3 to 4 years. The total estimated value of this agreement is around
US$30 million. The initial agreement was for only 100,000 tonnes in order to run some industrial tests. As a result of favourable
preliminary test results the sales continued and during the March quarter 250,000 tonnes were sold for US$1 million.
Capital expenditure decreased by 75 per cent from US$12 million to US$3 million due to a decrease in construction activities at the
tailings dam and waste storage facilities during the rainy season.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 64 per cent from US$209 per ounce in the December quarter to
US$75 per ounce in the March quarter mainly due lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold
sold. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce decreased by 5 per cent from US$712 per equivalent ounce to
US$677 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

Gold production increased by 5 per cent from 90,300 ounces in the December quarter to 95,200 ounces in the March quarter due to an
increase in tonnes processed and an increase in yield.

Total ore tonnes mined increased by 64 per cent from 1.1 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.8 million tonnes in the
March quarter.

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 97,000 tonnes in the December quarter to
100,500 tonnes in the March quarter. Head grade decreased by 3 per cent from 3.55 grams per tonne to 3.44 grams per tonne with limited
availability of high grade areas. Gold mined from Hamlet underground decreased by 3 per cent from 11,400 ounces to 11,100 ounces.

Development at the Invincible underground operation continued with ore tonnes mined increasing by 927 per cent from 3,000 tonnes in
the December quarter to 30,800 tonnes in the March quarter. Development in the December quarter was largely undertaken to reach the ore
body while substantial development through ore occurred in the March quarter. Head grade mined increased by 193 per cent from
2.45 grams per tonne to 7.18 grams per tonne in line with the mining sequence. Gold mined from Invincible underground increased by
3,450 per cent from 200 ounces to 7,100 ounces. All the ore mined was from development with the first stope scheduled to be mined in
the June quarter.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 60 per cent from 1.0 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.6 million
tonnes in the March quarter with mining being undertaken in low strip areas of the Neptune and Invincible pits. Heavy rains during the
March quarter restricted access to areas of pre- stripping at the Neptune pit which are primarily in lake sediments which turn to mud
in wet weather. During this period mining activity moved to areas of primary ore which were in areas with more competent rock.

Grade mined increased marginally from 3.04 grams per tonne to 3.05 grams per tonne. Gold mined from open pits increased by 61 per cent
from 99,200 ounces to 160,200 ounces. In the March quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.9 million tonnes at 2.48 grams per
tonne from Invincible and 0.7 million tonnes at 3.78 grams per tonne from Neptune. This compared with 0.55 million tonnes at 2.5 grams
per tonne from Invincible and 0.46 million tonnes at 3.7 grams per tonne from Neptune in the December quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 29 per cent from 2.8 million tonnes in the December quarter to 2.0 million tonnes in the
March quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 42 per cent from 6.4 million tonnes to 3.7 million tonnes due to the reasons
discussed in the open pit ore tonnes mined section above. Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 28 per cent from
10.2 million tonnes to 7.3 million tonnes. The decrease was planned with ore mined significantly exceeding available mill capacity as
it did during the December quarter. The strip ratio decreased from 9.1 to 3.5.

Ounces mined at the consolidated St Ives mine increased by 61 per cent from 110,600 ounces in the December quarter to 178,400 ounces
in the March quarter. At the end of the March quarter, Neptune high-grade oxide material stockpiled amounted to 90,600 ounces
(1,136,000 tonnes at 2.48 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 28,700 ounces (368,000 tonnes at 2.43 grams per tonne) and
A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne). This compared with 45,600 ounces (710,900 tonnes at 1.99 grams
per tonne) of Neptune high-grade oxide material stockpiled, 7,800 ounces (109,000 tonnes at 2.21 grams per tonne) of Invincible
material and 7,900 ounces (174,000 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne) of A5 material, at the end of the December quarter. Currently,
Lefroy mill can only sustain a 25 per cent oxide material blend. The excess Neptune oxide material is stockpiled and fed to the mill
so as to maintain the optimum blend. Work is ongoing to debottleneck the mill throughput.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 3 per cent from 1.04 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.07 million tonnes in the
March quarter due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown in the December quarter. Yield increased by 2 per cent from 2.70 grams per tonne
to 2.76 grams per tonne.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 30 per cent from A$56 million (US$43 million) to A$39 million
(US$30 million). The gold inventory credit for the March quarter of A$27 million (US$21 million) compared with A$12 million
(US$9 million) in the December quarter. This increased stockpile credit of A$15 million (US$12 million) was primarily responsible for
the net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreasing by 30 per cent from A$56 million (US$43 million) to
A$39 million (US$30 million). A similar combined volume of ore and operational waste was mined for similar mining costs. However, while
total ore and operational waste tonnes were similar, the higher ratio of ore to waste mined resulted in a 67,800 ounces increase in
ounces mined and placed onto stockpiles. The ore mined in the December quarter significantly exceeded mill capacity and therefore
additional ore was added to surface stockpiles. Ore and operational waste mined from the open pits in the March quarter totalled
3.6 million tonnes compared with 3.8 million tonnes in the December quarter with similar mining costs.

Capital expenditure decreased by 38 per cent from A$61 million (US$47 million) to A$38 million (US$30 million) mainly due to lower
capital waste tonnes mined in the open pits, lower capital development and lower exploration activity in the immediate post-Christmas
period.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 35 per cent from A$1,351 per ounce (US$1,035 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$873 per ounce (US$686 per ounce) in the March quarter due to lower net operating costs, lower capital expenditure and
higher gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 8 per cent from 63,900 ounces in the December quarter to 58,600 ounces in the March quarter mainly due to
lower tonnes processed and the impact of high grade stockpiles processed in the December quarter.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 6 per cent from 313,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 292,700 tonnes in the March quarter
as a result of lower ore tonnes from Waroonga due to sequencing. Head grade mined increased by 6 per cent from 6.18 grams per tonnes
to 6.52 grams per tonne with improved grades at Waroonga and New Holland. Gold mined decreased by 1 per cent from 62,200 ounces to
61,400 ounces due to the mining mix. In the March quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 147,400 tonnes at 9.0 grams per tonne
from Waroonga and 145,300 tonnes at 4.0 grams per tonne from New Holland. This compares with 165,000 tonnes at 8.8 grams per tonne from
Waroonga and 148,000 tonnes at 3.3 grams per tonne from New Holland in the December quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 296,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 282,900 tonnes in the March quarter due to a
scheduled maintenance shutdown in the March quarter. The combined yield decreased by 4 per cent from 6.73 grams per tonne to 6.44 grams
per tonne due to the processing of higher grade stockpiles processed in the December quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 15 per cent from A$52 million (US$40 million) in the December
quarter to A$60 million (US$47 million) in the March quarter mainly due to increased mining costs as a result of the mix between ore
and capital development, increased processing cost related to frequent power disruptions due to inclement weather and the planned
maintenance shutdown that was extended to complete additional works. In addition, a gold-in-circuit charge of A$6 million
(US$5 million) in the March quarter compared with a gold-in-circuit credit to cost of A$nil million (US$nil million) in the December
quarter. The charge to cost in the March quarter was partially due to a 900 once drawdown of gold-in-circuit. The balance was the
result of a reduction in the average cost of stockpiled ore and gold-in-circuit during the March quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 30 per cent from A$30 million (US$23 million) to A$21 million (US$16 million) mainly due to the
crushing facility purchased for A$5 million (US$4 million) in the December quarter and reduced expenditure in the immediate post-
Christmas period.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 5 per cent from A$1,336 per ounce (US$1,029 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$1,402 per ounce (US$1,103 per ounce) in the March quarter due to higher net operating costs and lower gold sold, partially
offset by lower capital expenditure.

Tonnes processed increased by 2 per cent from 419,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 429,000 tonnes in the March quarter due to
timing of milling campaigns quarter on quarter. The yield decreased by 9 per cent from 5.55 grams per tonne to 5.06 grams per tonne
due to a drawdown of 5,200 ounces of gold-in-circuit during the December quarter as opposed to a build-up of 4,600 ounces in the March
quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 11 per cent from A$57 million (US$44 million) in the December
quarter to A$51 million (US$40 million) in the March quarter mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) credit to cost in the March
quarter compared with A$4 million (US$3 million) gold-in-circuit charge in the December quarter associated with the 5,200 ounce
drawdown noted above.

Capital expenditure decreased by 43 per cent from A$42 million (US$32 million) to A$24 million (US$19 million) mainly due to mobile
equipment purchases of A$5 million (US$4 million) and early works on underground cooling and paste plants of A$7 million (US$5 million)
in the December quarter as well as a A$3 million (US$2 million) reduction in exploration costs.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 17 per cent from A$1,370 per ounce (US$1,054 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$1,131 per ounce (US$890 per ounce) in the March quarter mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower capital
expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

CATEGORY 2 TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENT: Joint Venture in Ghana with Asanko
Gold, Inc

1. Introduction

Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce
that it has, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a definitive
agreement with Canadas Asanko Gold, Inc (TSX/NYSE AMERICAN: AKG)
(Asanko), subject to certain customary conditions, to form a 50:50
incorporated joint venture (the Joint Venture Transaction) with a
subsidiary of Asanko, being Asanko Gold Ghana Limited (AGG). The Gold
Fields subsidiary has agreed to acquire a 50% stake in AGGs 90% interest
in the Asanko Gold Mine, associated properties and exploration rights in
Ghana (the AGM). The AGM is a multi-deposit complex, with two main
deposits, Nkran and Esaase, and nine known satellite deposits. The
purchase consideration comprises an upfront payment of US$165m on closing
of the transaction and a deferred payment of US$20m.

In addition, Gold Fields subsidiary has agreed to subscribe for a 9.9%
share placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657
Asanko shares at a price of approximately US$0.79, equal to the five-day
VWAP on the day prior to date of this announcement, for a total
consideration of US$17.6m. The subscription will close shortly after the
date of this announcement, and is not conditional on completion of the
Joint Venture Transaction.

The Joint Venture Transaction and the subscription for shares in Asanko
will be funded from cash and/or by drawing down on Gold Fields existing
debt facilities. Importantly, the AGM is an in-production asset that
generates EBITDA and cash flow and does not require any additional
investment by the JV partners.

2. Description of the business carried out by Asanko

Asanko is a Canadian-based gold producer (listed on the TSX and NYSE) with
operations in Ghana. Asankos principal assets are the Obotan operation
(which includes the Nkran deposit) and the Esaase deposit (collectively
the AGM), which are situated 100km north of Gold Fields Damang operation
along the prospective and under explored Asankrangwa greenstone belt in
Ghana.

Following Asankos acquisition of PMI Gold Inc. in 2014, Asanko combined
its Esaase gold project with PMIs Obotan gold project to form the AGM and
pursued a phased development and expansion strategy. The construction of
the first phase, essentially the Obotan gold project, including a 3 Mtpa
carbon-in-leach processing facility and associated infrastructure, was
completed in early 2016. Commercial production was declared on 1 April
2016, and the operation reached steady-state production levels by the end
of the second quarter of 2016.

3. Particulars of the Proposed Transaction


Upon completion, Gold Fields will hold a 45% interest in AGG  the
Ghanaian company that holds the assets of the AGM. The remaining AGG
shareholders will be Asanko (45% through its existing offshore holding
structure) and the Ghana Government (10% free carried). In addition, Gold
Fields will hold a 9.9% listed stake in Asanko.

The aggregate consideration comprises:

-    Upfront consideration: US$165m payable on closing of the Joint
     Venture Transaction, which will be used to immediately retire the
     AGGs existing external debt, being a loan from the Red Kite group of
     US$164m, leaving Asanko debt free.
-    Deferred consideration: US$20m payable on the earlier of an agreed
     Esaase development milestone or 31 December 2019.
-    Share placement: Gold Fields will subscribe for a 9.9% share
     placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657
     Asanko shares at a price of approximately US$0.79, equal to the five-
     day VWAP on the day prior to date of this announcement, for a total
     consideration of US$17.6m.

Gold Fields and Asanko will establish a 50:50 incorporated joint venture
in respect of their 90% interest in the AGM. Asanko will continue to
manage the operations and will remain the operator. A joint venture
management committee, comprising representatives from Asanko and Gold
Fields, will be formed for purposes of overseeing the operation of the
mine, with material decisions (including budgets, capital expenditure)
requiring unanimous approval. A technical sub-committee will also be
formed to provide technical advisory services to the management committee.

Asanko and Gold Fields have provided warranties and indemnities to each
other that are standard to a transaction of this nature.

    4. Rationale for the Acquisition


Portfolio management is one of Gold Fields strategic objectives, as we
continually seek to improve the quality of our portfolio (by lowering our
all-in costs (AIC) and extending mine lives) to enhance Gold Fields cash
generation.

The Asanko Joint Venture will give immediate access to low cost production
ounces, increasing the quality of the Gold Fields portfolio  Asankos
guidance for 2019-2023 is average annual production of 253koz (100% basis)
at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$860/oz, with a life-of-mine of at
least 15 years. Further, the sizeable resource base of the asset is
immediately accretive to Gold Fields in terms of life, with the potential
for further discoveries on the large, relatively unexplored, tenement
package held by Asanko.

The transaction is also in line with our current growth strategy of
focusing on jurisdictions in which we already have an established
footprint. As the AGM is located in Ghana, we are adding an asset in a
country where Gold Fields has extensive experience, having operated in
Ghana for over 20 years.
The transaction exceeds our requirement of a return of 15% at a gold price
of US$1,300/oz, with a payback period of five years out of an anticipated
life-of-mine of at least 15 years.


  5. Conditions Precedent


The transaction is subject to customary conditions precedent including,
among others, no Asanko material adverse event, and Ghanaian Ministerial
approval for the indirect (by way of change of control) transfer of the
various mining properties.


  6. Completion Date of the Joint Venture Transaction

The Completion Date of the acquisition and formation of the Asanko Joint
Venture will be the fifth business day after the conditions precedent have
been satisfied. Completion is anticipated to occur in Q3 2018.
  7. Pro Forma Financial effects

Net asset value and profit attributable to the acquisition of a        45%
interest in AGG

The net asset value of AGG and its subsidiaries that would be attributable
to Gold Fields at 31 December 2017 was approximately:

Net asset value                                                     US$m
Net asset value excluding shareholder loans                         198.4
Shareholder loans                                                 (196.1)
Net asset value                                                       2.3

Profit after tax for AGG and its subsidiaries that would be attributable
to Gold Fields for the year ended 31 December 2017 was approximately
US$6.8m before any acquisition accounting entries.

The aforementioned information of AGG and its subsidiaries was extracted
from Asankos consolidation workings which agreed to the audited
consolidated financial statements of Asanko for year ended 31 December
2017 issued on 13 March 2018. The audited consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards. The above information is extracted from unpublished
management accounts of Asanko and the Company confirms that it is
satisfied with the quality of such management accounts.

Acquisition of a 9.9% interest in Asanko

The net asset value of the 9.9% interest acquired in Asanko at 31 December
2017, being Asankos most recent reporting period, was approximately
US$42.5m before any acquisition accounting entries. The profit after tax
attributable to the 9.9% interest acquired in Asanko for the year ended 31
December 2017 was approximately US$0.6m before any acquisition accounting
entries. The aforementioned information has been extracted from the
audited consolidated financial statements of Asanko for the year ended 31
December 2017, prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards. The 9.9% interest will be disclosed by Gold Fields as
an asset carried at fair value through other comprehensive income.
    8. Classification of the Transaction
The Acquisition is classified as a Category 2 Transaction in terms of the
Listing requirements of the JSE Limited.


    9. Conclusion
The transaction exceeds our requirement of a return of 15% at a gold price
of US$1,300/oz, with a payback period of five years out of an anticipated
life-of-mine of 15 years. The transaction is demonstrably accretive to Gold
Fields. We are comfortable that despite our current investment programme
(Damang and Gruyere) this acquisition is well within our balance sheet
capacity, particularly as it is a producing asset.

Correction of methodology

The financial statements in this report contain modifications to
the preliminary reviewed condensed consolidated financial
statements published on SENS on 14 February 2018.

Subsequent to 14 February 2018, as a result of a Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) comment letter received by the Company
in August 2017, the Company concluded that prior years
understatement of the amortisation of the mineral rights asset at
the Australian operations was material to the 2017 consolidated
financial statements and therefore restated the prior years
consolidated financial statements in terms of IAS 8, Accounting
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. In the
preliminary reviewed condensed consolidated financial statements
the prior years understatement was accounted for in the 2017
financial year and not in the prior years, as subsequently
concluded.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group corrected the
amortisation methodology for the mineral rights assets at the
Australian operations. Prior to the correction in methodology,
the total mineral rights asset capitalised at the Australian
operations was amortised on a units-of-production basis over a
useful life that exceeded Proved and Probable reserves. The
amortisation methodology was revised in order to divide the total
mineral rights asset capitalised at the respective operations
into a depreciable and a non-depreciable component. The
depreciable component is then amortised over the estimated Proved
and Probable reserves of the respective Australian mines on the
units-of-production method. For further details, refer to
accounting policies.

An amount of US$23.2 million (US$16.3 million after taxation),
representing 3% of the total amortisation and depreciation
charge, was included in the preliminary reviewed consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 in
respect of correcting the understatement of amortisation relating
to prior years. In the 2017 annual financial statements this has
been reversed from the 2017 year and recognised in prior years.

The impact on the consolidated income statements, in respect of
each of the affected financial statement line items, of the
restatements is as follows:

JOHANNESBURG. 14 February 2018: Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) announced normalised earnings from continuing
operations of US$141 million for the year ended December 2017 compared with US$190 million for the year ended 
December 2016.  

A final dividend number 87 of 50 SA cents per share (gross) is payable on 12 March 2018, giving a total dividend for
the year ended December 2017 of 90 SA cents per share (gross).

Statement by Nick Holland, 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields
Operational outperformance and higher prices drive internal funding of growth projects

At the end of 2016, Gold Fields entered into a period of reinvesting into the business. 2017 was set to be a tough
year, with the Group expecting a cash outflow for the year given the increased level of project capital expenditure.
Today, we are pleased to announce that the Group was largely cash neutral for FY17, on the back of better than expected 
metal prices and outperformance from the international operations. Despite incurring project capital of US$115m at Damang,
A$106m (US$81m) at Gruyere, R225m (US$17m), at South Deep, US$53m on the feasibility study at Salares Norte as well as
A$78m (US$60m) in respect of the deferred portion of the purchase price of our 50% in Gruyere, the net cash outflow was
limited to US$2m during 2017. Importantly, cash flow from the operations excluding growth projects was US$329m. If South
Deep growth and the Damang reinvestment of US$17m and US$115m, respectively, are excluded, then the mining operations
generated US$441m. This places Gold Fields in a comfortable position to take on another high capex year in 2018 as both
Gruyere and Damang progress toward completion. 

For the fifth consecutive year, we have met or exceeded our production and cost guidance for the year. 
Attributable gold equivalent production for 2017 was 2.16Moz (FY16: 2.15Moz), exceeding guidance of 2.10-2.15Moz. 
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) and all-in costs (AIC) were US$955/oz (FY16: US$980/oz) and US$1,088/oz (FY16: US$1,006/oz), 
respectively, both below the lower end of the guidance range provided in February 2017 - AISC: US$1,010-1,030/oz and 
AIC: US$1,170-1,190/oz. The international operations all exceeded guidance for the year, once again highlighting 
the quality of these assets. 

South Deep was unable to recover from the tough Q1 2017 which was impacted by two fatalities and three falls of ground
in the high grade corridors, with production for the year 11% below original guidance (costs were only 3% above
guidance), as flagged in Q3 2017 operating results in October 2017. 

As per our trading statement released on 8 February 2018, headline earnings for 2017 were US$194m or US$0.24 per
share. Net loss for the year was US$35m or US$0.04 per share. Normalised earnings for the year was US$138m or US$0.17 
per share.

In line with our dividend policy of paying out 25% to 35% of net earnings as dividends, we declared a final dividend
of 50 SA cents per share.  This takes the total dividend for the year to 90 SA cents per share (FY16: 110 SA cents per
share). 

On the back of the cash break even position from operating activities achieved for the year, the net debt at 
31 December 2017 was US$1,303m, compared to US$1,166m at the end of FY16. This implies a net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
of 1.03x, compared to 0.95x at the end of December 2016 and largely in line with our target of 1.0x. Gold Fields balance 
sheet remains in a strong position to complete its reinvestment phase. 

Update on projects

Damang
The Damang reinvestment project, which commenced on 23 December 2016, got off to a strong start and is currently
tracking well against the project plan. During 2017, total tonnes mined were 40Mt vs. the original project schedule 
of 33Mt, driven by better than expected productivity. Gold produced of 144koz was 29% higher than guidance of 120koz,
underpinned by additional volumes at higher grades from the Amoanda pit, while AIC of US$1,827/oz was significantly below
guidance of US$2,250/oz.  

Project capital of US$115m (included in the costs above) was spent during 2017, compared to the budget of US$120m. 
The cash outflow for the year was US$45m. Construction of the Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) commenced 
during Q1 2017, and the facility was commissioned by year-end, on time and within budget. The FETSF is planned to provide
cost effective tailings capacity of 44Mt which is 10 years of capacity at steady state production. Decommissioning of the
East Tailings Storage Facility (ETSF) commenced during Q1 2018.

Guidance for 2018 is production of 160koz at AIC of US$1,520/oz which includes project capital of US$105m. First ore
from the main Damang pit is on track for Q2 2019.

Gruyere
Early work at Gruyere began in December 2016, with Gold Fields taking over management of the project on 1 February 2017.
The project construction schedule remains unchanged, with engineering progress in line with budget at 72% and construction 
progress at 32% also in line with plan as at end-December 2017. The Gruyere village, which includes 648 rooms, offices 
and recreational facilities, was commissioned during H1 2017. 

Costs incurred to date are also in line with the project budget, which was slightly increased to A$532m (US$400m)
(100% basis) during H1 2017 following a detailed review of the feasibility study. A$477m (US$358m) of the total capital 
cost has been committed and priced, with A$186m (US$143m) already spent. 

The Bulk Earthworks contract was awarded to MACA Civil in May 2017. The 28km Gruyere main access road and sealed
airstrip have been completed, while the pit and tailings storage facility (TSF) areas were cleared during Q4 2017. 
Construction of the TSF embankment walls is scheduled for completion during H1 2018. The engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) contract for the Gruyere CIL processing plant and the associated infrastructure was awarded to Amec 
Foster Wheeler Cimvec JV.  Construction of the seven carbon-in-leach tanks is progressing to plan. The SAG mill has been 
delivered while the Ball mill components, which are currently in Perth undergoing final inspection, is planned to be 
delivered in Q1 2018.

During H1 2017, a power supply contract was signed with APA Group, a leading Australian energy infrastructure
business.  APA has received final approval from the Western Australian Department of Mines for the 198km Yamarna gas 
pipeline from Laverton, which is scheduled for completion in H1 2018. Civil and structural works have also begun at 
the 45MW gas-powered Gruyere plant (build, own, operate model over life), which will be connected to the gas pipeline, 
and will supply the mines energy needs for the life of mine.  

The Yeo borefield is planned to serve as the main water source for the Gruyere processing plant. All 32 boreholes
have been drilled and installation of the 95km water pipeline to the processing plant has commenced. Installation 
of the 22kV overhead power line servicing the borefield is scheduled to commence in Q2 2018. 

Finally, the mining services contract, which has a cost of A$400m (US$300m) over a five-year term, was executed with
Downer EDI in Q4 2017. Downer began mobilising their workforce during Q1 2018 to begin construction of the mining
infrastructure. Mining activities are planned to commence in Q4 2018. 

Total project capital of A$311m (US$249m) (100% basis) has been budgeted for 2018. Gold Fields budget for Gruyere in
2018 is A$181m, which includes items not picked up in the JV such as capitalised interest on the Gruyere debt facility
drawn down to fund the project. Gruyere remains on track for first production during Q1 2019.  

Salares Norte
The feasibility study for the Salares Norte project is tracking well for completion by the end of 2018. The interim
results from the feasibility study indicate the following metrics for the project:
- Resource of 23.3Mt at 4.9g/t Au and 66.0g/t Ag, with 95% in the indicated category (majority of which are oxide
  material); 
- Annual throughput: 2mtpa;
- Life of mine gold equivalent production: c.3.5Moz - front ended;
- AISC: US$575 per gold equivalent ounce; and
- Project capex: US$850m (+/-5%).

The project envisages open pit operations with a processing plant that includes both CIP and Merrill Crowe processes,
due to the high silver content. Dry stack tailings are expected to be used. Water and Land Rights are already secured
and permitted for the future operational stage. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) is expected to be lodged with
the Chilean authorities during April 2018.

US$83m is budgeted for 2018, which includes US$13m for district exploration. 

Regional performance in FY17

Australia 
Gold production in the Australia region for FY2017 was 1% lower YoY at 935koz (FY16: 942koz), but exceeded original
guidance of 910koz, which included Darlot for the full year. All operations (excluding Darlot) performed better than
plan.  AIC for the region was 2% lower YoY in A$ terms at A$1,239/oz (FY16: A$1,261/oz) and marginally higher YoY in US$
terms at US$948/oz (FY16: US$941/oz). The region had another strong year of cash generation, with net cash flow of US$189m
for FY17 (FY16: US$256m), excluding Gruyere.

There were a number of important developments in the region during 2017:
- As previously announced, the sale of Darlot to Red 5 was completed on 2 October 2017. Gold Fields received the
  relevant cash sums as well as the issue of new shares as part of the consideration and as a consequence of the partial
  underwriting of a rights issue by the Group. The net result is that Gold Fields has a 19.9% shareholding in Red 5.
- The brownfields exploration programme in Australia continued to show positive results in 2017, with the increase in
  reserves more than replacing depletion in 2017. For the first time in four years, Agnew more than replaced depletion, 
  with the future looking positive from the current exploration activities. The total exploration spend for the year was
  A$95m.
- Mining at Invincible underground commenced in Q4 2017. The Invincible complex continues to grow and is expected to
  remain a key contributor to production at St Ives for many years to come.
- A favourable advanced scoping study on the Paleochannel project at St Ives has moved the project into prefeasibility
  stage. The first part of the study will focus on evaluating a viable mining method and is expected to be completed by
  end 2018. The inventory being assessed on this project exceeds 2-3Moz.
- Following a positive feasibility study of Zone 110/120, the board has approved the development of this extension to
  the Wallaby underground mine at Granny Smith. This includes mineral reserves of 1.3Moz and will extend Granny Smiths 
  life to 2027 with tangible upside beyond that.

West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region decreased by 1% YoY to 639koz (FY16: 644koz) due to lower
production at both Tarkwa and Damang. However, Damang materially outperformed guidance of 120koz, producing 144koz 
due to better than expected performance from Amoanda. AIC for the region increased by 10% YoY to US$1,119/oz (FY16:
US$1,020/oz) mainly as a result of the project capex spent on the Damang reinvestment project. Despite the increase 
in capex for the year, the region generated net cash flow of US$64m for FY2017 (FY16: US$100m). 

During Q4 2017, a decision was made to move Tarkwa to contractor mining. The rationale for the change includes
unsustainable wage increases and demands, increase in operational costs as the pits get deeper and haulage distances get
longer; as well as the need to replace aging fleet. As part of the process and in terms of the Ghanaian labour law a
retrenchment process will be initiated, though the contractor has agreed to re-employ a large number of the 1,700 affected
employees. This decision by the operation was met with resistance from the Ghana Mineworkers Union, who have subsequently
approached the court on grounds that the redundancy process is not lawful. A hearing has been set down for mid-February
2018. An update regarding the hearing will be provided once the legal process has run its course.

South America
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona increased by 13% YoY to 305koz (FY16: 269koz), mainly due to
higher copper prices, higher gold head grades and higher gold recovery. AIC decreased by 59% YoY to US$203 per gold
ounce (FY16: US$499 per gold ounce). AIC per equivalent ounce decreased by 12% YoY to US$673 per equivalent ounce 
(FY16: US$762 per equivalent ounce). On the back of the strong performance from the operation, Cerro Corona generated 
net cash flow of US$117m (FY16: US$77m). 

We are pleased to announce the successful extension of Cerro Coronas life to 2030. The life extension is to be
achieved by a combination of a higher density factor along with an increase in the dam walls of the current tailings 
dam to 3,803m above sea level (which adds two years to the existing TSF) and in-pit tailings (which adds five years). The
increased tailings storage comes at minimal additional capex and allows for an increase in reserves of 1.4Moz eq (40.1Mt at
0.5g/t Au and 0.4% Cu) (a 58% net increase), which converts 80% of resources. Cerro Corona remains a key asset for the
Group and the life extension provides longevity for this highly cash generative region. Work on a scoping study for further
life extension will be undertaken in 2018. As a result of the increased life, a previous impairment of US$53m (gross)
has been reversed.

South Deep 
2017 was a year of two halves for South Deep, with Q1 2017 negatively impacted by two fatal accidents and three falls
of ground in the higher grade section of the mine which resulted in a deferral of mining higher grade areas. Production
recovered through the rest of the year, with production in H2 2017 increasing by 36% to 5,038kg (162koz) from 3,710kg
(119koz) in H1 2017.

Production for the year was 11% below original guidance, as flagged in the Q3 2017 operating results in October 2017,
at 8,748kg (281koz), compared to 9,032kg (290koz) in FY16. AIC increased 3% YoY to R600,109/kg (US$1,400/oz) from
R583,059/kg (US$1,234/oz) in FY16, 3% higher than guidance of R585,000/kg. Performance of key activities included:
- The mine recorded net cash outflow of R804m (US$60m) in 2017 compared with the rebase plan which forecast an outflow
  of R830m.
- Development decreased by 1% to 6,897 metres in 2017 from 6,933 metres in 2016. New mine development increased by 20%
  YoY to 976 metres from 811 in 2016.
- Longhole stoping volumes increased by 3% to 767kt in FY17 (FY16: 745kt).
- Destress mining increased by 3% YoY to 33,419m2 (FY16: 32,333m2).
- Backfill placed was 11% lower YoY at 333m3.

While good progress has been made on the technical front, with the implementation of the mining method receiving
positive feedback from the Geotechnical Review Board (GRB - a group of pre-eminent international recognised geotechnical
experts), the execution of the full mining value chain remains sub-optimal. 

The goodwill impairment of R3.5bn (US$278m) (gross and after tax) related to the slow start of the rebase plan
(announced in February 2017) over the past year and a reduction in the gold price and resource price assumptions used 
in the life of mine model.  It is expected that the ramp-up will be more gradual. The steady state production target 
of c.500koz in 2022 has not changed.  Post this impairment, the carrying value of South Deep is R24.7bn (US$1.96bn). 

As a result of the slow start to the rebase plan in 2017, we expect a more gradual build up to steady state production
of c.500koz by 2022. In October 2017, we noted that there would be a knock-on impact on 2018 production. We expect
production for 2018 to be 10,000kg (322koz), 10% lower than the rebase plan. However, we expect AIC to be R540,000/kg,
compared to R567,910/kg in the rebase plan. 

Outlook for 2018
Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2018 is expected to be between 2.08Moz and 2.10Moz with the
main difference between 2017 and 2018 due to the sale of Darlot. AISC is expected to be between US$990/oz and
US$1,010/oz. AIC for the Group is planned to be between US$1,190/oz and US$1,210/oz. These expectations assume exchange 
rates of R/US$:12.00 and A$/US$:0.80. AISC is planned to increase by between 4 to 6%, ~4% of which is due to stronger 
exchange rates and ~2% of which is due to increases in costs in local currency. AIC is planned to increase by between 
9 to 11%, ~4% of which is due to stronger exchange rates and ~6% which is due increases in growth capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$835m. Sustaining capital expenditure for the Group is planned at
US$549m and growth capital expenditure is planned at US$286m. The US$286m of growth capital expenditure comprises US$105m
for Damang, A$181m (US$145m) for Gruyere, as well as R434m (US$36m) for South Deep. In addition, US$83m is planned for
Salares Norte.

In 2017, total capital expenditure was US$840m with sustaining capital expenditure of US$624m and growth capital
expenditure of US$216m. Expenditure on Salares Norte of US$53m in 2017.

Sale of Arctic Platinum 
Post year-end (as announced on 24 January 2018), Gold Fields completed the sale of its palladium-rich, polymetallic
Arctic Platinum Project (APP) in northern Finland to a Finnish subsidiary of private equity fund CD Capital Natural
Resources Fund III.  The purchase consideration comprises US$40m cash and royalty (2% NSR (net smelter return) on all 
metals, with 1% capped at US$20 million and 1% uncapped).

Results for the Group 
(Continuing and discontinued operations)

SAFETY
The Group's fatality injury frequency rate regressed from 0.02 in 2016 to 0.05 in 2017. The total recordable 
injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group regressed by 7 per cent from 2.27 in 2016 to 2.42 in 2017.

1 Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work
  Injuries3 + Medically Treated Injuries4) x 1,000,000/number of man-hours worked.

2 A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend
  work for a period of one or more days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform 
  any functions.

3 A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the
  employee or contractor being unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the
  day after the injury occurred. The employee or contractor can still perform some of his duties.

4 A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which does not
  incapacitate that employee and who, after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately resume his/her
  normal duties on the next calendar day, immediately following the treatment/re-treatment.


FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016

The discussion of financial and operating results below is an analysis of total Gold Fields operations (continuing and
discontinued). Due to the fact that the discontinued operation does not have a material impact on the Group's results,
it has not been discussed separately. The discussion is based on the Income statement and Statement of cash flows on
pages 5 and 6, respectively.

REVENUE
Attributable equivalent gold production increased by 1 per cent from 2.146 million ounces in 2016 to 2.160 million
ounces in 2017.  

Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, decreased by 3 per cent from 9,032 kilograms (290,400 ounces) to 
8,748 kilograms (281,300 ounces).

Attributable gold production at the West African operations decreased by 1 per cent from 644,200 ounces in 2016 to
639,000 ounces in 2017 due to lower production at both Tarkwa and Damang. Attributable equivalent gold production 
at Cerro Corona in Peru increased by 13 per cent from 268,900 ounces in 2016 to 305,200 ounces in 2017. Gold 
production at the Australian operations decreased by 1 per cent from 942,300 ounces in 2016 to 934,600 ounces in 
2017 due to higher production at all the operations except Darlot which is only included for nine months, up to 
the date of disposal.  

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep decreased by 3 per cent from 9,032 kilograms (290,400 ounces) in
2016 to 8,748 kilograms (281,300 ounces) in 2017 due to decreased volumes, partially offset by increased grades.  

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa decreased marginally from 568,100 ounces in 2016 to
566,400 ounces in 2017 mainly due to lower plant throughput and recovery. At Damang, managed gold production decreased 
by 3 per cent from 147,700 ounces in 2016 to 143,600 ounces in 2017 mainly due to lower head grade and yield.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona increased by 14 per cent from
270,200 ounces in 2016 to 306,700 ounces in 2017 mainly due to the higher copper price relative to the gold price (price
factor), higher gold head grades and higher gold recovery.  

At the Australia region, St Ives' gold production increased marginally from 362,900 ounces in 2016 to 363,900 ounces
in 2017. At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production increased by 5 per cent from 229,300 ounces in 2016 to 241,200 ounces in 2017
mainly due to increased ore processed. At Darlot, gold production decreased by 41 per cent from 66,400 ounces for the
12 months to December 2016 to 39,200 ounces for the 9 months to September 2017 mainly due to lower grades mined. At
Granny Smith, gold production increased by 2 per cent from 283,800 ounces in 2016 to 290,300 ounces in 2017 due to
increased ore tonnes mined and processed. 

The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased by 1 per cent from US$1,241 per equivalent ounce in
2016 to US$1,255 per equivalent ounce in 2017. The average rand gold price decreased by 8 per cent from R584,894 per
kilogram to R538,344 per kilogram.  The average Australian dollar gold price decreased by 2 per cent from A$1,674 per 
ounce to A$1,640 per ounce. The average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations increased by 1 per cent from
US$1,247 per ounce in 2016 to US$1,255 per ounce in 2017. The average equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment 
and refining charges, for Cerro Corona increased by 4 per cent from US$1,199 per equivalent ounce in 2016 to US$1,252 per
equivalent ounce in 2017. The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate strengthened by 9 per cent from R14.70 in 2016 to
R13.33 in 2017. The average Australian/US dollar exchange rate strengthened by 3 per cent from A$1.00 = US$0.75 in 2016 
to A$1.00 = US$0.77 in 2017.

Revenue increased by 2 per cent from US$2,750 million in 2016 to US$2,811 million in 2017 mainly due to the higher
ounces sold.

NET OPERATING COSTS
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 1 per cent from US$1,388 million in 2016 to
US$1,404 million in 2017. The US$16 million higher net operating costs, were due to the negative exchange rate effect 
of US$59 million on translation into US$ dollar, partially offset by US$43 million lower cost in local currency. The
gold-in-process credit to cost of US$69 million in 2017 compared with US$46 million in 2016.

At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep increased by 2 per cent from R3,993 million (US$272
million) in 2016 to R4,062 million (US$305 million) in 2017 mainly due to annual salary increases, electricity rate 
increase and an increase in employees in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation.

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 8 per cent from US$463 million in 2016 to US$428 million
in 2017. This decrease in net operating costs was mainly due to lower production, benefits realised as a result of the
incorporation of the development agreement which is now fully embedded at the operations following ratification in March
2016, continued business process re-engineering, as well as a build-up of inventory of US$41 million in 2017 compared
with US$18 million in 2016. At Tarkwa, net operating costs decreased by 6 per cent from US$327 million to US$306 million
due to a significant build-up of gold-in-process of US$42 million in 2017 compared with US$18 million in 2016. At
Damang, net operating costs decreased by 10 per cent from US$136 million to US$122 million due to lower operating 
tonnes mined. 

At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona increased by 10 per cent from US$140 million in 2016
to US$154 million in 2017 mainly due to a drawdown of concentrate inventory of US$3 million in 2017 compared with a
build-up of US$4 million in 2016, as well as higher mining and power costs.

At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 2 per cent from A$689 million (US$514 million) in 2016 to
A$675 million (US$517 million) in 2017. At St Ives, net operating costs decreased by 15 per cent from A$244 million
(US$182 million) in 2016 to A$207 million (US$159 million) in 2017 mainly due to a gold inventory credit to cost of 
A$38 million (US$29 million) in 2017 compared with A$15 million (US$11 million) in 2016, as well as a decrease in 
mining cost of A$19 million (US$14 million) in 2017, following reduced operational tonnes mined from the open pits 
and cost improvements at the open pits and Hamlet. 

At Agnew, net operating costs increased by 4 per cent from A$189 million (US$141 million) in 2016 to A$197 million
(US$150 million) in 2017, mainly due to higher mining costs as a result of a 16 per cent increase in ore development 
metres achieved. At Granny Smith, net operating costs increased by 17 per cent from A$179 million (US$134 million) to 
A$210 million (US$160 million). Mining costs increased by A$11 million (US$8 million) due to the additional volumes 
and net operating costs were also impacted by a release of A$15 million (US$11 million) from gold-in process. 
A gold-in-process charge to cost of A$5 million (US$4 million) in 2017 compared with a credit of A$10 million 
(US$7 million) in 2016.  Net operating costs at Darlot decreased by 19 per cent from A$77 million (US$58 million) 
for twelve months to December 2016 to A$62 million (US$47 million) for nine months to September 2017.

AMORTISATION AND DEPRECIATION
Amortisation and depreciation for the Group increased by 14 per cent from US$679 million in 2016 to US$775 million in
2017. This increase of US$96 million was due to amortisation and depreciation increases of US$80 million due to the
increase in production at Cerro Corona and the Australian operations, a decrease in depreciable reserves at Tarkwa 
and St Ives and a change in the depreciation calculation at Cerro Corona, as well as the negative exchange rate effect 
of US$16 million. 

OTHER
Net interest expense for the Group increased by 5 per cent from US$59 million in 2016 to US$62 million in 2017. 
Interest expense of US$91 million, partially offset by interest income of US$6 million and interest capitalised of 
US$23 million in 2017 compared with interest expense of US$83 million, partially offset by interest income of 
US$9 million and interest capitalised of US$15 million in 2016.

The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 50 per cent from US$2 million in 2016 to US$1 million in 2017 mainly
due to downscaling of activities at Far Southeast project (FSE).  

The loss on foreign exchange decreased by 33 per cent from US$6 million in 2016 to US$4 million in 2017. These gains
and losses on foreign exchange related to the conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies.

The gain on financial instruments increased by 150 per cent from US$14 million in 2016 to US$35 million in 2017. 
In 2017, it mainly related to the South Deep gold hedge gain of US$10 million, Australian gold hedge gain (US$15
million/A$20 million), the oil hedge gain in Ghana (US$10 million) and Australia (US$6 million/ A$7 million), partially 
offset by the copper hedge loss taken out at Cerro Corona (US$6 million). Of the US$35 million, US$14 million was 
realised and US$21 million was unrealised.

Share-based payments for the Group increased by 93 per cent from US$14 million in 2016 to US$27 million in 2017 
due to a new allocation in 2017 as well as mark to market adjustments relating to the free cash flow margin portion. 
Long-term employee benefits decreased by 55 per cent from US$11 million to US$5 million due to mark to market 
adjustments relating to the share price portion of the incentive scheme. 

Other costs for the Group decreased by 10 per cent from US$49 million to US$44 million.

EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS
Exploration and project costs increased by 21 per cent from US$92 million in 2016 to US$111 million in 2017 mainly due
to an increase at Salares Norte from US$39 million in 2016 to US$53 million in 2017 and the write-off of brownfields
exploration costs at the Australian operations which increased from A$64 million (US$48 million) in 2016 to A$69 million
(US$53 million) in 2017. This write-off is a book entry and non-cash. The balance of US$5 million mainly related to
expenditure at APP and FSE.

NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring expenses of US$200 million in 2017 compared with US$17 million in 2016. 

The non-recurring expenses in 2017 included mainly:
- Cash generating unit impairment of R3.495 billion (US$278 million) at South Deep.  The impairment calculation is based
  on the 2017 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
  - Gold price decreased from a long-term R600,000 per kilogram to R525,000 per kilogram;
  - Resource price decreased from R842 per ounce to R216 per ounce due to a decrease in the dollar price per ounce from
    US$60 per ounce to US$17 per ounce and a stronger Rand/Dollar exchange rate from R14.03 to R12.58.  This was partially
    offset by an increase in resource ounces of 3.8 million ounces from 25.2 million ounces to 29.0 million ounces;
  - Life of mine: 77 years; and
  - Discount rate: 13.5 per cent nominal.

The above assumptions do not affect the steady state production target of circa 500,000 ounces by 2022.  
- Silicosis provision raised (US$30 million);
- Write-off of parked fleet at Tarkwa (US$7 million);
- Retrenchment costs (US$9 million) mainly at Tarkwa (US$5 million), South Deep (US$2 million) and Damang 
  (US$2 million); 
- Write-off of Damang assets (US$3 million); and
- Impairment of investments (US$4 million).

This was partially offset by:

- Reversal of cash-generating unit impairment: gross US$53 million, tax US$15 million, net US$38 million at Cerro
  Corona. The impairment calculation is based on the 2017 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
  - Gold price 2018: US$1,200 per ounce, 2019 onwards: US$1,300 per ounce;
  - Copper price 2018: US$2.50 per pound, 2019 onwards: US$2.80 per pound;
  - Resource price: US$41 per ounce;
  - Life of mine: 13 years; and 
  - Discount rate: 4.8 per cent.

The reversal of the impairment is due to a higher net present value as a result of the completion of a Pre-feasibility
study in 2017 extending the life of mine from 2023 to 2030 by optimising the tailings density and increasing tailings
capacity by using in-pit tailings after mining activities end.
- Reversal of the APP impairment (US$39 million); 
- Profit on the sale of Darlot (US$24 million/A$31 million); and
- Lower rehabilitation provisions of US$13 million mainly at St Ives due to a new mine closure plan 
  (A$15 million/US$11 million).

The non-recurring expenses in 2016 included mainly:

- Cash-generating unit impairment of US$66 million at Cerro Corona. The impairment calculation was based on the 
  2016 life of mine plan. The impairment was due to a reduction in gold and copper reserves due to depletion, a decrease 
  in the gold and copper price assumptions for 2017 and 2018, a lower resource price and an increase in the Peru tax rate; 
- Impairment of fleet relating to the disposal of fleet to the contractor and inoperable assets at Damang 
  (US$10 million);
- Retrenchment costs (US$12 million), mainly at Damang (US$10 million) and Granny Smith (A$2 million/US$1 million); and
- Other: US$5 million.

This was partially offset by:

- Profit on sale of royalties as part of the Maverix transaction (US$48 million);
- Profit on buy-back of the bond (US$18 million); and
- A decrease in rehabilitation provision (US$10 million) mainly due to decreases in base cases associated with a
  reduction in the diesel price at the Australian operations (A$10 million/US$7 million).

ROYALTIES
Government royalties for the Group decreased by 21 per cent from US$80 million in 2016 to US$63 million in 2017 mainly
due to the introduction of the sliding scale royalty formula in Ghana.

TAXATION
The taxation charge for the Group of US$172 million in 2017 compared with US$192 million in 2016. Normal taxation
increased from US$205 million to US$207 million.  The deferred tax credit of US$35 million in 2017 compared with 
US$13 million in 2016.

The taxation charge in 2017 appears significant in relation to the profit before tax due to the goodwill impairment of
US$278 million and reversal of impairment of APP of US$39 million which do not attract tax. Excluding those
adjustments, profit before tax would have been US$367 million.

In Peru, tax depreciation is recognised using the straight line depreciation method for the majority of assets over
periods longer than the life of mine. At 31 December 2016, Cerro Corona had a life of mine to 2023, and a significant
portion of the assets would not be fully depreciated for tax purposes by the end of the life of the mine. During 2017,
deferred tax of US$11 million was impaired relating to fixed asset additions in 2017. However, during 2017, the Group
completed a pre-feasibility study, which resulted in extending the life of mine from 2023 to 2030 by optimising the tailings
density and increasing tailings capacity by using in-pit tailings after mining activities end. Based on the Group's best
estimate at 31 December 2017, it is likely that Cerro Corona will earn taxable profits in order to utilise a portion of
the deductible temporary differences that reverse after 2023. As a result of the above, the Group recognised an amount
of US$15 million (2016: US$15 million impairment) related to deferred tax assets that were now recoverable at Cerro
Corona at 31 December 2017. 

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol (Soles) and the functional currency for accounting
purposes is the US dollar. For accounting purposes, unutilised tax allowances must be converted from Soles to dollars at
the closing rate at the period end. Therefore, the US dollar equivalent of unutilised taxation allowances fluctuate due
to movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar. This resulted in a change in the
temporary taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation. A deferred tax credit of US$4 million (2016: 
US$2 million charge) arose due to the strengthening of the exchange rate from 3.40 Nuevo Sol in 2016 to 3.27 Nuevo Sol 
in 2017 (3.38 Nuevo Sol in 2015 to 3.40 Nuevo Sol in 2016). It has no cash effect.

LOSS/EARNINGS 
Net loss attributable to owners of the parent of US$35 million or US$0.0.04 per share in 2017 compared with a profit
of US$163 million or US$0.20 per share in 2016.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$194 million or US$0.24 per share in 2017 compared with
headline earnings of US$208 million or US$0.26 per share in 2016. 

Normalised earnings of US$138 million or US$0.17 per share in 2017 compared with US$191 million or US$0.24 per share
in 2016. 

CASH FLOW 
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$832 million in 2017 compared with US$957 million in 2016, a 13 per cent
decrease.  This decrease was mainly due to an investment into working capital of US$64 million in 2017, as a result of 
the build-up of ore stockpiles at Tarkwa and St Ives, compared with US$3 million in 2016, as well as an increase in
royalties and taxation paid from US$235 million in 2016 to US$309 million in 2017. 

Dividends paid/advanced of US$69 million in 2017 compared with US$39 million in 2016.  Dividends paid to owners of the
parent increased from US$39 million in 2016 to US$63 million in 2017.  Dividends paid to non-controlling interest
holders of US$6 million in 2017 compared with US$nil million in 2016.  Dividends of US$5 million and US$1 million 
were paid to non-controlling interest holders at Tarkwa and Cerro Corona, respectively. 

Cash outflow from investing activities increased from US$868 million in 2016 to US$909 million in 2017 mainly due to
an increase in capital expenditure from US$650 million in 2016 to US$840 million in 2017 as planned.  This was mainly 
due to growth expenditure of US$115 million on the Damang reinvestment project and A$106 million (US$81 million) on
Gruyere.  Proceeds on disposal of assets of US$23 million in 2017 compared with US$2 million in 2016.  The US$23 million
related to proceeds on disposal of fleet at Damang.  Purchase of investments of US$80 million in 2017 compared with 
US$13 million in 2016.  In 2017, it related mainly to the purchase of shares in Gold Road (US$55 million/A$71 million) 
as well as the purchase of shares and options in Cardinal Resources (US$20 million/A$28 million).  Environmental 
payments increased from US$15 million in 2016 to US$17 million in 2017.  In 2016, purchase of Gruyere Gold project 
amounted to US$197 million (A$266 million).  

Cash outflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments of US$2 million in 2017
compared with an inflow of US$294 million in 2016.  This decrease was mainly due to higher capital expenditure and
negative working capital adjustments.  The US$2 million outflow in 2017 comprised: US$309 million net cash generated by 
the eight mining operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$72 million 
of net interest paid, US$58 million for exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields
exploration which is included in the US$309 million above), US$141 million (A$184 million) at Gruyere [capital expenditure 
of US$81 million (A$106 million) and an investment into working capital of US$60 million (A$78 million), mainly due to
cash calls on the balance of the deferred payment balance and stamp duty], as well as US$40 million on non-mine based
costs.  Included in the US$309 million above is US$115 million capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project and
US$17 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure. If these two amounts are excluded, then the mining operations
generated US$441 million. The US$294 million in 2016 comprised: US$444 million net cash generated by the eight mining
operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$69 million of net interest 
paid, US$47 million for exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which 
is included in the US$444 million above) and US$34 million on non-mine based costs.  Included in the US$444 million is 
US$8 million on South Deep growth capital expenditure. 

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure decreased from R1,145 million (US$78 million) in 2016 to
R1,099 million (US$82 million) in 2017 due to lower expenditure on fleet. 

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure increased from US$206 million to US$313 million.  At Tarkwa, capital
expenditure increased from US$168 million to US$181 million due to higher fleet expenditure in 2017.  Capital 
expenditure in 2016 was mainly incurred on pre-stripping.  Capital expenditure at Damang increased from US$38 million 
to US$132 million mainly due to expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project (US$115 million). 

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased from US$43 million to US$34 million mainly
due to lower expenditure on the construction of the tailings dam and waste storage facilities.

At the Australia region, capital expenditure decreased from A$431 million (US$322 million) in 2016 to A$423 million
(US$324 million) in 2017. At St Ives, capital expenditure increased from A$188 million (US$140 million) in 2016 to A$204
million (US$156 million) in 2017 due to expenditure on the new Invincible underground mine. At Agnew/Lawlers, capital
expenditure increased from A$94 million (US$70 million) to A$96 million (US$74 million) in 2017 mainly due to expenditure
on a crushing facility. At Darlot, capital expenditure decreased from A$29 million (US$21 million) to A$9 million
(US$7 million) in 2017 and at Granny Smith, capital expenditure decreased from A$121 million (US$90 million) in 2016 
to A$114 million (US$87 million) in 2017.

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$84 million in 2017 compared with US$37 million in 2016. The inflow in
2017 related to a drawdown of US$780 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$696 million on offshore and local
loans. The inflow in 2016 related to a drawdown of US$1.299 billion and proceeds on the issue of shares of 
US$0.151 billion, partially offset by the repayment of US$1.413 billion of offshore and local loans.

The net cash outflow for the Group of US$62 million in 2017 compared with an inflow of US$87 million in 2016.  The
cash balance of US$479 million in 2017 compared with US$527 million in 2016. 

All-in sustaining and total all-in cost
The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 3 per cent from US$980 per ounce in 2016 to US$955 per ounce in 2017
mainly due to higher by-product credits, lower royalties and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by
higher net operating costs and lower gold sold.  Total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from US$1,006 per ounce in 
2016 to US$1,088 per ounce in 2017 due to higher non-sustaining capital expenditure and higher exploration, feasibility 
and evaluation costs. 

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs increased by 1 per cent from R570,303 per kilogram
(US$1,207 per ounce) to R574,406 per kilogram (US$1,340 per ounce) mainly due to higher net operating costs and lower
gold sold, partially offset by lower sustaining capital expenditure.  The total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent from
R583,059 per kilogram (US$1,234 per ounce) to R600,109 per kilogram (US$1,400 per ounce) due to the same reasons as for
all-in sustaining costs as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.  

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 6 per cent from US$1,020 per ounce in 2016 to US$958
per ounce in 2017 mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by
lower gold sold.  Total all-in cost increased by 10 per cent from US$1,020 per ounce in 2016 to US$1,119 per ounce in
2017 mainly due to non-sustaining capital expenditure of US$115 million on the Damang reinvestment project.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 59 per cent from US$499 per
ounce to US$203 per ounce mainly due to higher by-product credits, lower capital expenditure and higher gold sold,
partially offset by higher net operating costs.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce 
decreased by 12 per cent from US$762 per equivalent ounce to US$673 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons 
as above.

At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from A$1,261 per ounce
(US$941 per ounce) in 2016 to A$1,239 per ounce (US$948 per ounce) in 2017 mainly due to lower net operating costs and
lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Balance sheet 
Net debt (borrowings plus the current portion of borrowings less cash and deposits) increased from US$1,166 million
for the year ended December 2016 to US$1,303 million for the year ended December 2017.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 57 per cent of the ore tonnes in 2017, while the new mine (North of
Wrench) contributed 43 per cent.

Net operating costs increased by 2 per cent from R3,993 million (US$272 million) in 2016 to R4,062 million 
(US$305 million) in 2017 due to annual salary increases, electricity rate increase and an increase in employees 
in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation.  These were partially offset by lower 
expenditure on contractors.

Capital expenditure decreased by 4 per cent from R1,145 million (US$78 million) in 2016 to R1,099 million (US$82
million) in 2017.  

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from R1,030 million (US$70 million) in 2016 to R874 million (US$66 million)
in 2017 mainly due to lower spend on fleet. Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased from R115 million 
(US$8 million) to R225 million (US$17 million) due to higher expenditure on new mine development infrastructure and 
refrigeration infrastructure.   

All-in sustaining costs increased by 1 per cent from R570,303 per kilogram (US$1,207 per ounce) in 2016 to R574,406 per 
kilogram (US$1,340 per ounce) in 2017 mainly due to lower gold sold and higher net operating costs, partially offset
by lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent from R583,059 per kilogram (US$1,234 per ounce) in 2016 to R600,109 per
kilogram (US$1,400 per ounce) in 2017 due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustainable costs as well as higher
non-sustaining capital expenditure.

711,000 ounces. The strip ratio decreased from 6.3 to 5.2 as a result of mining Akontansi cut 7 and Pepe Cut 7 south due 
to their relatively low strip ratio to ensure ore supply to the process plant. In order to mitigate any potential future
problems, spatial compliance regarding waste stripping at Teberebie pits is one of the main focus areas in 2018. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased by 1 per cent from 13.6 million tonnes in 2016 to 13.5 million tonnes in 2017 which
is in line with nameplate capacity. Realised yield from the CIL plant was similar at 1.30 grams per tonne.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 6 per cent from US$327 million to US$306 million 
due to benefits realised as a result of the incorporation of the development agreement, as well as a significant
build-up of gold-in-process to US$42 million in 2017 compared with US$18 million in 2016. 

Capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent from US$168 million to US$181 million mainly due to higher expenditure on
mining fleet. Mining fleet expenditure including componentisation in 2017 was US$33 million compared with US$23 million
in 2016.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from US$959 per ounce in 2016 to US$940 per

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 111 per cent from 18.8 million tonnes in 2016 (16.4 million 
tonnes from Amoanda and other satellite pits and 2.4 million tonnes from the Juno/Huni pits) to 39.7 million tonnes
in 2017 (25.7 million tonnes from Amoanda and other satellite pits and 14.0 million tonnes from the Damang Pit Cut Back)
due to a change in mining strategy with the implementation of the Damang reinvestment plan.  Ore tonnes mined increased
by 18 per cent from 2.8 million tonnes to 3.3 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 35 per cent
from 8.2 million tonnes to 5.3 million tonnes as a result of mainly mining capital waste tonnes in 2017, to align with
the new mining strategy. Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 299 per cent from 7.8 million in 2016 to 31.1 million
in 2017. Head grade mined decreased by 13 per cent from 1.32 grams per tonne in 2016 to 1.15 grams per tonne in 2017 due
to 1.56 million tonnes of relatively lower grade ore mined from the satellite pits (Lima South, Tomento east and Abosso
tailings). Gold mined increased by 3 per cent from 119,400 ounces to 122,700 ounces. The strip ratio increased from
5.7 to 10.9.

Tonnes processed increased by 7 per cent from 4.27 million tonnes in 2016 to 4.59 million tonnes in 2017. Yield
decreased by 10 per cent from 1.08 grams per tonne to 0.97 grams per tonne due to an increase in lower grade stockpiles
treated whilst stripping the various pits.  In 2017, 2.83 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average
grade of 1.16 grams per tonne and 1.76 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 0.68 grams per
tonne. This compared with 2.2 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.37 grams per tonne 
and 2.1 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average grade of 1.04 grams per tonne in 2016. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 10 per cent from US$136 million to US$122 million mainly 
due to benefits realised as a result of the incorporation of the development agreement, the move to contractor mining and lower 
operating tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure increased by 247 per cent from US$38 million to US$132 million with the majority spent on waste
stripping.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 55 per cent from US$38 million in 2016 to US$17 million in 2017, mainly
due to capital waste stripping being reported as growth capital with the commencement of the Damang reinvestment plan. 
Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased from US$nil million to US$115 million mainly due to the implementation of the
Damang reinvestment plan in 2017. 

All-in sustaining cost decreased by 18 per cent from US$1,254 per ounce in 2016 to US$1,027 per ounce in 2017 due to
lower net operating costs and lower non-sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold. 

Total all-in cost increased by 46 per cent from US$1,254 per ounce in 2016 to US$1,827 per ounce in 2017 due to an

Gold production increased by 6 per cent from 150,200 ounces in 2016 to 159,000 ounces in 2017. Copper production
decreased by 2 per cent from 30,667 tonnes to 30,200 tonnes. Equivalent gold production increased by 14 per cent from
270,200 ounces to 306,700 ounces.  The increase in equivalent gold production was due to the higher copper to gold price
ratio as well as higher gold head grades and higher gold recovery. Gold head grade increased by 5 per cent from 1.03 grams
per tonne to 1.08 grams per tonne and copper head grade decreased by 2 per cent from 0.53 per cent to 0.52 per cent. 

Gold recoveries increased from 67.5 per cent to 70.4 per cent.  Copper recoveries increased from 86.6 per cent to 88.9
per cent. Gold yield increased from 0.70 grams per tonne to 0.76 grams per tonne.  Copper yield was similar at 0.46
per cent. The increase in the gold grade was in line with the plan and planned mining sequence.

In 2017, concentrate with a payable content of 164,715 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,261 per
ounce and 30,377 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,546 per tonne, net of treatment and refining
charges.  This compared with 149,105 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,244 per ounce and 29,905 tonnes
of copper that was sold at an average price of US$4,182 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges in 2016.  Total
equivalent gold sales increased by 17 per cent from 268,900 ounces in 2016 to 313,800 ounces in 2017 mainly due to higher gold 
produced and higher price factor.

Total tonnes mined increased by 9 per cent from 14.45 million tonnes in 2016 to 15.75 million tonnes in 2017 in line
with the mine sequencing.  Ore mined increased marginally from 7.06 million tonnes to 7.09 million tonnes. Waste tonnes
mined increased by 17 per cent from 7.39 million tonnes to 8.66 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 1.05 to
1.22. 

Ore processed decreased by 3 per cent from 6.98 million tonnes in 2016 to 6.80 million tonnes in 2017 mainly due to
lower plant throughput (815 tonnes per hour versus 832 tonnes per hour) and lower utilisation due to harder ore.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 10 per cent from US$140 million in 2016 to
US$154 million in 2017.  The higher net operating costs were mainly due to a US$3 million drawdown of concentrate inventory
in 2017 compared with a US$4 million build-up in 2016.  In addition, higher mining costs resulted from higher tonnes
mined in 2017 and higher power expenses due to a new contract with the power supplier.

Capital expenditure decreased by 21 per cent from US$43 million to US$34 million mainly due to lower expenditure on
the tailings dam and waste storage facilities during 2017 compared with 2016.  This was due to optimising the design and
scope of the tailings dam and waste storage facilities as well as the renegotiation of the construction contract during
2017.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 59 per cent from US$499 per ounce in 2016 to US$203 per
ounce in 2017, mainly due to higher by-product credits, lower sustaining capital expenditure and higher gold sold,
partially offset by higher net operating costs.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce decreased
by 12 per cent from US$762 per equivalent ounce to US$673 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2018 is as follows:
- Gold equivalents produced ~ 280,000 ounces

at Invincible Stage 6 and Neptune Stages 4 and 5.  The strip ratio decreased from 10.7 to 9.6.  

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 4 per cent from 4.05 million tonnes in 2016 to 4.20 million tonnes in 2017
mainly due to the closure of the mill for two weeks during the second half of 2016 for the installation of a new
electrical control block for the Sag mill.  Yield decreased by 3 per cent from 2.79 grams per tonne to 2.70 grams per 
tonne due to lower grades from Hamlet and increased mill feed from open pits.  Gold production from the Lefroy mill 
increased by 1 per cent from 360,400 ounces in 2016 to 363,900 ounces in 2017.  In 2016, 93,277 tonnes of toll treatment 
produced 1,945 ounces and residual leaching and irrigation of the heap leach pad produced a further 600 ounces. The residual
leaching ceased in April 2016. Total gold produced in 2016, including these other ore sources, was 362,900 ounces.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements decreased by 15 per cent from A$244 million (US$182 million)
in 2016 to A$207 million (US$159 million) in 2017 mainly due to a gold inventory credit to cost of A$38 million (US$29 million) 
in 2017 compared with a A$15 million (US$11 million) credit in 2016.  In addition, mining cost decreased by A$19 million 
(US$14 million) in 2017, following reduced operational tonnes mined from the open pits and cost improvements at the open pits 
and Hamlet.

Capital expenditure increased by 9 per cent from A$188 million (US$140 million) in 2016 to A$204 million (US$156
million) in 2017 with A$21 million (US$16 million) incurred at the new Invincible underground mine. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent from A$1,273 per ounce (US$949 per ounce) in
2016 to A$1,198 per ounce (US$916 per ounce) in 2017 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold sold, partially
offset by higher capital expenditure.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2018 is as follows:
- Gold produced ~ 360,000 ounces
- Capital expenditure ~ A$156 million (US$125 million)

Tonnes processed increased by 5 per cent from 1.18 million tonnes in 2016 to 1.24 million tonnes in 2017 due to a
shortage of mill feed early in 2016 when the mill was running below capacity.  The combined yield increased marginally 
from 6.07 grams per tonne to 6.08 grams per tonne.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 4 per cent from A$189 million (US$141 million)
in 2016 to A$197 million (US$150 million) in 2017. This was mainly due to higher mining costs as a result of a 16 per
cent increase in ore development metres achieved.

Capital expenditure increased by 2 per cent from A$94 million (US$70 million) in 2016 to A$96 million (US$74 million)
in 2017. This was mainly due to the crushing facility that was purchased for A$5 million (US$4 million) in 2017.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from A$1,301 per ounce (US$971 per ounce) in
2016 to A$1,276 per ounce (US$977 per ounce) in 2017 due to higher gold sold, partially offset by higher net operating
costs and higher capital expenditure.  

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2018 is as follows:
- Gold produced ~ 230,000 ounces
- Capital expenditure ~ A$83 million (US$66 million)
- All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,310 per ounce (US$1,050 per ounce)
- Total all-in cost ~ A$1,310 per ounce (US$1,050 per ounce)

Gold production increased by 2 per cent from 283,800 ounces in 2016 to 290,300 ounces in 2017 due to increased ore
tonnes mined and processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 12 per cent from 1.52 million tonnes to 1.70 million tonnes. Head grade mined
decreased by 17 per cent from 6.61 grams per tonne in 2016 to 5.50 grams per tonne in 2017 in line with the 2017 mining
plan. The head grade variance related to reduced ore grades from Z90 and Z100, re-sequencing Z100 ore due to geotechnical 
requirements and increased lower grade capital development ore tonnes. Gold mined from underground decreased by 7 per cent 
from 322,600 ounces to 300,700 ounces.  

Tonnes processed increased by 19 per cent from 1.45 million tonnes to 1.73 million tonnes. The yield decreased by 14 per cent

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements increased by 17 per cent from A$179 million (US$134 million)
to A$210 million (US$160 million). Mining costs increased by A$11 million (US$8 million) due to the additional volumes
and a gold-in-process charge to cost of A$5 million (US$4 million) in 2017 compared with a credit of A$10 million 
(US$7 million) in 2016.

Capital expenditure decreased by 6 per cent from A$121 million (US$90 million) in 2016 to A$114 million (US$87 million) in 2017.

R6 MILLION boost for mechanised mining 
On 22 November 2017, Gold Fields announced a R6 million, three-year partnership with the University of the
Witwatersrand (Wits University) to further the academic knowledge of mechanised mining and rock engineering in South 
Africa.

Gold Fields' funding seeks to fill the gap of mechanised mining skills in South Africa, with the company managing the
country's largest and deepest underground mechanised gold mine, South Deep.  The skills and expertise required to bring
the mine, with an expected life of over 70 years, to full production are not in abundant supply in South Africa. 

Additional Shares in cardinal Resources 
In November 2017, Gold Fields Limited (""CIH""), through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary purchased 3,676,900 ordinary shares 
(""Ordinary Shares"") of Cardinal Resources Limited (""Cardinal"") at a price of C$0.65 per Ordinary Share, for a total consideration 
of C$2,389,985. Such Ordinary Shares were purchased in connection with a public offering of Ordinary Shares in Canada conducted 
through a syndicate of underwriters (the ""Offering""). Subsequent to the purchase, Gold Fields interest in Cardinal Resources is 
19.8 per cent on a partially diluted basis (if only Gold Fields options are exercised).

MINING CHARTER 
On 15 June 2017, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and Minister Zwane (the Minister) published the 2017 mining
charter (2017 Mining Charter). The South African Chamber of Mines (Chamber), of which Gold Fields is a member,
immediately raised its concerns due to the lack of collaboration with its members and the mining industry as a whole. 

On 26 June 2017, the Chamber approached the High Court of South Africa requesting that an urgent interdict application
be heard on 8 July 2017 requesting an order to prohibit, amongst others, the Minister and the DMR from implementing or
applying the provisions of the 2017 Mining Charter in any way directly or indirectly, pending the final determination of
an application for judicial review and setting aside of the Minister's and the DMR decision to publish the 2017 Mining
Charter. 

The Minister has provided a written undertaking that the 2017 Mining Charter will not be implemented in any way until
judgement has been handed down in the Chamber's application for an urgent interdict. The written undertaking also
provides that should the Minister and/or the DMR in any way endeavour to implement the 2017 Mining Charter during that 
period, the Chamber will be entitled to bring its interdict application within 48 hours.

Gold Fields supports achieving a solution that is viable to support economic growth and create a sustainable mining
industry in South Africa in which investment is encouraged. 

Outlook for 2018

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2018 is expected to be between 2.08 million ounces and 
2.10 million ounces.  AISC is expected to be between US$990 per ounce and US$1,010 per ounce. AIC is planned to be 
between US$1,190 per ounce and US$1,210 per ounce. These expectations assume exchange rates of R/US$:12.00 and 
A$/US$:0.80.

AISC is planned to increase by between 4 to 6 per cent, ~4 per cent of which is due to stronger exchange rates and 
~2 per cent of which is due to increases in costs in local currency.  AIC is planned to increase by between 9 to 11 per
cent, ~4 per cent of which is due to stronger exchange rates and ~6 per cent which is due to increases in growth capital
expenditure in local currency.

Capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$835 million. Sustaining capital expenditure for the Group is planned at 
US$549 million and growth capital expenditure is planned at US$286 million. The US$286 million growth capital expenditure 
comprises US$105 million for Damang, A$181 million (US$145 million) for Gruyere, as well as R434 million (US$36 million) 
for South Deep. 

In 2017, total capital expenditure was US$840 million with sustaining capital expenditure of US$624 million and growth
capital expenditure of US$216 million. Expenditure on Salares Norte of US$53 million in 2017 compares with US$83 million 
planned for 2018.

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking
statement above.

Reviewed condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements 

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited
Listings Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa. The Listings
Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and
recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting
Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms of
IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the previous consolidated annual financial statements.

Auditor's review
The condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been
reviewed by the company's auditor, KPMG Inc. 

The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this media release. Shareholders are 
therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should refer to 
below the media release for a copy of the auditor's report.

Silicosis and tuberculosis class and individual actions
As previously disclosed, a consolidated application has been brought against several South African mining companies,
including Gold Fields, for certification of a class action on behalf of current or former mineworkers (and their
dependants) who have allegedly contracted silicosis and/or tuberculosis while working for one or more of the mining 
companies listed in the application. 

In May 2016, the South African South Gauteng High Court ordered, among other things, the certification of a silicosis
class and a tuberculosis class. The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought
against the mining companies. The Supreme Court of Appeal granted the mining companies leave to appeal against all aspects
of the May 2016 judgement. The appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal is scheduled to be heard between 19 and
23 March 2018.

On 10 January 2018, it was announced that attorneys representing all appellants and all respondents involved in the
above appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal have written to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Appeal
asking that the appeal proceedings be postponed until further notice.  The Supreme Court of Appeal has granted approval for
the postponement.  The joint letter written to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Appeal explained that good faith
settlement negotiations between the Occupational Lung Disease Working Group (see below) and claimants' legal representatives 
have reached an advanced stage. In view of that, all parties consider it to be in the best interests of judicial economy and 
the efficient administration of justice that the matter be postponed.

In addition to the class action, an individual silicosis-related action has been instituted against Gold Fields and
another mining company. In February 2018, the defendants (including Gold Fields) and the plaintiff entered into a
confidential settlement agreement in full and final settlement of this matter.

Occupational Lung Disease Working Group
The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group was formed in fiscal 2014 to address issues relating to compensation and
medical care for occupational lung disease in the South African gold mining industry. The Working Group, made up of
African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye - Stillwater, has had
extensive engagements with a wide range of stakeholders since its formation, including government, organised labour, other
mining companies and the legal representatives of claimants who have filed legal actions against the companies.

The members of the Working Group are among respondent companies in a number of legal proceedings related to occupational 
lung disease, including the class action referred to above.  The Working Group is however of the view that achieving
a comprehensive settlement which is both fair to past, present and future employees and sustainable for the sector, is
preferable to protracted litigation.  The Working Group will continue with its efforts to find common ground with all
stakeholders, including government, labour and the claimants' legal representatives.

Provision raised
As at 30 June 2017, as a result of the ongoing work of the Working Group and engagements with affected stakeholders
since 31 December 2016, Gold Fields provided an amount of US$30 million (R390 million) in the statement of financial
position for its share of the estimated cost in relation to the Working Group of a possible settlement of the class action
claims and related costs. The nominal value of this provision was US$40 million (R509 million).

Gold Fields believe that this remains a reasonable estimate of its share of the estimated costs in relation to the
Working Group of a possible settlement of the class action claims and related costs. As a result, Gold Fields' obligation
remains unchanged. This provision, of US$32 million (R402 million) as at 31 December 2017 compares to the amount raised
in June 2017 of US$30 million (R390 million) and the increase is due to the effect of unwinding. The nominal value of
this provision remains unchanged at US$40 million (R509 million).

The ultimate outcome of these matters remains uncertain, with a possible failure to reach a settlement or to obtain
the requisite court approval for a potential settlement. The provision is consequently subject to adjustment in the
future, depending on the progress of the Working Group discussions, stakeholder engagements and the ongoing legal proceedings.

South Deep tax dispute
The South Deep mine (""South Deep"") is jointly owned and operated by GFI Joint Venture Holdings (Pty) Limited (GFIJVH)
(50 per cent) and Gold Fields Operations Limited (GFO) (50 per cent).

At 31 December 2017, South Deep's gross deductible temporary differences amounted to US$1,834.4 million (R23,076.4
million), resulting in a deferred tax asset balance of US$550.4 million (R6,923.0 million) in addition to other taxable
temporary differences. This amount is included in the consolidated deferred tax asset of US$72.0 million on Gold Fields'
statement of financial position. South Deep's gross deductible temporary differences comprises unredeemed capital
expenditure balances of US$743.3 million (R9,350.3 million) (tax effect: US$223.0 million (R2,805.1 million)) at GFIJVH and
US$716.4 million (R9,011.9 million) (tax effect: US$214.9 million (R2,703.6 million)) at GFO, a capital allowance balance
(additional capital allowance) of US$182.2 million (R2,292.0 million) (tax effect: US$54.7 million (R687.6 million)) at
GFIJVH and an assessed loss balance of US$192.5 million (R2,422.2 million) (tax effect: US$57.8 million (R726.7 million))
at GFO.

During the September 2014 quarter, the South African Revenue Service (""SARS"") issued a Finalisation of Audit Letter 
(""the Audit Letter"") stating that SARS has restated GFIJVH's additional capital allowance balance reflected on its 2011
tax return from US$182.2 million (R2,292.0 million) to nil. The tax effect of this amount is R687.6 million (US$54.7
million), that being referred to above as the ""additional capital allowance"".

The additional capital allowance was claimed by GFIJVH in terms of section 36(11)(c) of the South African Income Tax
Act, 1962 (""the Act""). The additional capital allowance provides an incentive for new mining development and only applies
to unredeemed capital expenditure. The additional capital allowance allows a 12 per cent capital allowance over and
above actual capital expenditure incurred on developing a deep level gold mine, as well as a further annual 12 per cent
allowance on the mine's unredeemed capital expenditure balance brought forward, until the year that the mine starts earning
mining taxable income (i.e. when all tax losses and unredeemed capital expenditure have been fully utilised).

In order to qualify for the additional capital allowance, South Deep must qualify as a ""post-1990 gold mine"" as
defined in the Act. A ""post-1990 gold mine"", according to the Act, is defined as ""a gold mine which, in the opinion of 
the Director-General: Mineral and Energy Affairs, is an independent workable proposition and in respect of which a mining
authorisation for gold mining was issued for the first time after 14 March 1990"".

During 1999, the Director-General: Minerals and Energy Affairs (""DME"") and SARS confirmed, in writing, that GFIJVH is
a ""post-1990 gold mine"" as defined, and therefore qualified for the additional capital allowance. Relying on these
representations, GFIJVH subsequently filed its tax returns on this basis, as was confirmed by the DME and SARS.

In the Audit Letter, SARS stated that both the DME and SARS erred in issuing the confirmations as mentioned above and
that GFIJVH does not qualify as a ""post-1990 gold mine"" and therefore does not qualify for the additional capital
allowance.

The Group has taken legal advice on the matter and was advised by external Senior Counsel that SARS should not be
allowed to disallow the claiming of the additional capital allowance. GFIJVH has in the meantime not only formally appealed
against the position taken by SARS, but also filed an application in the High Court and will vigorously defend its
position. No resolution was achieved during the year as the Tax Court allowed SARS to amend its grounds of assessment in the
days leading up to the commencement of the trial. Consequently the Tax Court proceedings could not be completed in the
time allotted for the hearing. The continuance of the Tax Court hearing is expected to take place during 2019. 

The Group is currently reviewing all its legal remedies, which include approaching the High Court for a declaratory
order. 

Accordingly, no adjustment for any effects on the Company that may result from the proceedings, if any, has been made
in the consolidated financial statements.

CREDIT FACILITIES SUCCESSFULLY REFINANCED

A$500 million Revolving Credit Facility
On 24 May 2017, Gruyere Holdings entered into a A$500 million revolving credit facility which became available on 13
June 2017 with a syndicate of international banks and financial institutions at an interest rate of Australian BBSY +235
basis points. The purpose of this facility is to finance capital expenditure in respect of the Gruyere Gold Project and
to fund general working capital requirements. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the agreement
date, namely 13 June 2020.

US$100 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
On 12 June 2017, Gold Fields Ghana Limited and Abosso Goldfields Limited entered into a US$100 million senior secured
revolving credit facility with the Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (acting through its Isle of Man branch) which
became available on 17 July 2017. The purpose of this facility was (i) to refinance the outstanding balance of 
US$45 million under the US$70 million senior secured revolving credit facility (which matured on 17 July 2017); (ii) to 
finance working capital requirements; (iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) for capital expenditure purposes of 
each borrower. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the financial close date, namely 17 July 2020.  

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WRITE-OFFS AND REVERSALS OF IMPAIRMENT
Asset impairments and write-offs recognised by the Group during 2017 include:

- Impairment of R3.495 billion (US$278 million) in respect of the South Deep cash-generating unit. The impairment
  calculation is based on the 2017 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
  - Gold price of R525,000 per kilogram;
  - Resource price of US$17 per ounce at a Rand/Dollar exchange rate of R12.58;
  - Resource ounces of 29.0 million ounces;
  - Life of mine: 77 years; and
  - Discount rate: 13.5 per cent nominal. 
  The impairment is due to a reduction in the gold price assumptions, a lower resource price and a deferral of
  production.
- Write-off of mining assets of US$11 million; and
- Impairment of investments of US$4 million.

This was partially offset by:

- Reversal of the impairment of US$53 million in respect of the Cerro Corona cash-generating unit.  The impairment
  calculation is based on the 2017 life of mine plan using the following assumptions:
  - Gold price 2018: US$1,200 per ounce, 2019 onwards: US$1,300 per ounce;
  - Copper price 2018: US$2.50 per pound, 2019 onwards: US$2.80 per pound;
  - Resource price US$41 per ounce;
  - Life of mine: 13 years; and
  - Discount rate: 4.8 per cent. 
  The reversal of the impairment is as a result of the completion of a pre-feasibility study in 2017 extending the life
  of mine from 2023 to 2030 by optimising the tailings density and increasing tailings capacity by using in-pit tailings
  after mining activities end; and
  - Reversal of the APP impairment (US$39 million) given the recent sale to a Finnish subsidiary of private equity fund CD
    Capital Natural Resources Fund III. APP has been disclosed as an asset held for sale.

Darlot sale completed
Gold Fields sold the Darlot mine in Western Australia, through a wholly owned subsidiary, to ASX-listed Red 5 Limited
for a total consideration of A$18.5 million, comprising A$12 million in cash and 130 million Red 5 shares.  The cash
component was made up of an upfront amount of A$7 million which could be converted into participation in a Red 5 rights
issue and A$5 million deferred for up to 24 months.  The deferred consideration may be taken as additional shares in Red 5
or as cash at Gold Fields' election.  The gain on disposal of Darlot was A$31 million (US$24 million). 

The sale of Darlot was completed on 2 October 2017. Gold Fields received the relevant cash consideration (converted
into participation in a rights issue) as well as the issue of the Red 5 shares as part of the consideration.  Gold Fields
participated in the rights issue by Red 5 and received 117 million additional shares valued at A$6 million (US$5
million). Gold Fields has a 19.9% shareholding in Red 5 with a market value of A$15 million (US$11 million).

Darlot has been disclosed as a discontinued operation and as a result the 2016 comparative amounts in the income
statement and statement of cash flows have been restated.

Hedging/Derivatives (Reviewed)

The Group's policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken as follows:
- to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
- for specific debt servicing requirements; and
- to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

Gold production decreased by 1 per cent from 2,526 kilograms (81,200 ounces) in the September quarter to 2,512 kilograms 
(80,800 ounces) in the December quarter mainly due to a decrease in head grade. 

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 10 per cent from 436,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 394,000 tonnes
in the December quarter. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 388,400 tonnes to 335,700 tonnes, while
underground waste mined increased by 20 per cent from 48,300 tonnes to 57,900 tonnes. Total gold mined from underground
decreased by 19 per cent from 2,463 kilograms (79,200 ounces) to 2,006 kilograms (64,500 ounces). Grade mined decreased 
by 7 per cent from 6.37 grams per tonne to 5.95 grams per tonne due to changes in the mining mix.

Total tonnes milled increased marginally from 555,000 tonnes to 557,000 tonnes. Underground ore tonnes milled
increased by 4 per cent from 398,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 414,000 tonnes in the December quarter. Underground
waste milled decreased by 13 per cent from 45,000 tonnes to 39,000 tonnes. Surface tailings material treated decreased by 
7 per cent from 112,000 tonnes to 104,000 tonnes. Underground reef yield decreased by 5 per cent from 6.34 grams per tonne
to 6.04 grams per tonne. 

Ore milled was higher than ore mined due to the processing of stockpiles during the December quarter.

Gold recovered from underground of 2,504 kilograms (80,500 ounces) was 498 kilograms (16,000 ounces) higher than gold
mined of 2,006 kilograms (64,500 ounces) due to a release from gold-in-circuit and 22,000 tonnes of stockpiles
processed.

Destress mining increased by 25 per cent from 7,666 square metres in the September quarter to 9,619 square metres in
the December quarter mainly due to improved productivity as a result of greater machine utilisation with more machines
allocated to destress areas. 

Longhole stoping decreased by 16 per cent from 207,000 tonnes to 173,400 tonnes due to the introduction of more rigid
quality control procedures and compliance to planned extraction. The current mine contributed 57 per cent of the total
ore tonnes in the December quarter compared with 63 per cent in the September quarter. The longhole stoping method
accounted for 44 per cent of total tonnes mined in the December quarter compared with 47 per cent in the September quarter. 

Development decreased marginally from 1,965 metres in the September quarter to 1,935 metres in the December quarter.
New mine capital development on 100 level increased by 14 per cent from 266 metres in the September quarter to 304 metres
in the December quarter. New mine development is focused on infrastructure projects exclusively on 100 level and related 
to haulage extensions, crusher excavations and conveyor extensions. Reef horizon development in the current mine areas 
decreased by 26 per cent from 1,126 metres to 833 metres. Reef horizon development North of Wrench increased by 39 per cent 
from 573 metres to 798 metres. Both New mine and reef horizon development improved due to business improvement initiatives 
starting to deliver.

Net operating costs decreased by 1 per cent from R1,038 million (US$79 million) to R1,027 million (US$75 million)
mainly due to lower bonuses, overtime and consumables cost, partially offset by a gold-in-process charge of R51 million
(US$4 million) in the December quarter compared with a credit of R9 million (US$1 million) in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 59 per cent from R260 million (US$20 million) in the September quarter to 
R412 million (US$30 million) in the December quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 48 per cent from R205 million (US$15 million) in the September quarter to
R303 million (US$22 million) in the December quarter mainly due to winder, shaft and plant infrastructure upgrades.
Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 98 per cent from R55 million (US$4 million) to R109 million (US$8 million).
The higher non-sustaining capital expenditure was mainly due to increased expenditure on new mine development and fridge
plant infrastructure projects.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 5 per cent from R509,011 per kilogram (US$1,203 per ounce) in the September
quarter to R532,573 per kilogram (US$1,209 per ounce) in the December quarter mainly due to higher sustaining capital
expenditure and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs.

Total all-in cost increased by 9 per cent from R530,842 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) in the September quarter to
R576,043 per kilogram (US$1,310 per ounce) in the December quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining
costs and higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 145,100 ounces in the September quarter to 139,800 ounces in the December
quarter mainly due to lower plant throughput. 

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 8 per cent from 26.2 million tonnes in the September

tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined increased by 1 per cent from 12.9 million tonnes to 13.0 million tonnes. 
Head grade mined decreased by 2 per cent from 1.33 grams per tonne to 1.30 grams per tonne. Where tonnes mined exceeded 
mill capacity, lower grade tonnes were stockpiled. Accordingly, stockpiles at end of 2017 were 8.9 million tonnes at 
0.77 grams per tonne. Gold mined decreased by 7 per cent from 189,000 ounces to 176,700 ounces. The strip ratio 
decreased from 4.9 to 4.7. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased by 3 per cent from 3.4 million tonnes to 3.3 million tonnes in line with nameplate
capacity. Yield decreased by 2 per cent from 1.34 grams per tonne to 1.31 grams per tonne due to a build-up of
gold-in-circuit.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 5 per cent from US$76 million to US$72 million
mainly due to a gold-in-process build-up of US$16 million in the December quarter compared with a build-up of 
US$11 million in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure was similar at US$42 million.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 4 per cent from US$909 per ounce in the September quarter
to US$871 per ounce in the September quarter due to lower net operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production increased by 7 per cent from 32,200 ounces in the September quarter to 34,500 ounces in the December
quarter mainly due to higher head grade and increased tonnes processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 19 per cent from 9.5 million tonnes in the September
quarter to 11.3 million tonnes in the December quarter due to an increase in contractors drilling and digging fleet 
in Amoanda and satellite pits. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 18 per cent from 0.92 million tonnes in the September 
quarter to 0.75 million tonnes in the December quarter. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 22 per cent from 
8.6 million tonnes to 10.5 million tonnes. Capital waste tonnes (included in total waste tonnes) increased by 
14 per cent from 7.7 million tonnes to 8.8 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 89 per cent 
from 0.9 million tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes. 

Head grade mined increased by 2 per cent from 1.04 grams per tonne to 1.06 grams per tonne due to higher grade mined
at all the pits. Gold mined decreased by 16 per cent from 30,700 ounces to 25,700 ounces due to 18 per cent less ore
tonnes mined in December quarter. The strip ratio increased from 9.4 to 14.0.

Tonnes processed increased by 4 per cent from 1.13 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.17 million tonnes in
the December quarter. Yield increased by 3 per cent from 0.89 grams per tonne to 0.92 grams per tonne due to higher 
grade fed. In the December quarter, tonnes milled were sourced as follows: 0.67 million tonnes at 1.07 grams per tonne 
from the pits, 0.06 million tonnes at 0.93 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 0.44 million tonnes at 0.77 grams 
per tonne from stockpiles. This compared with 0.70 million tonnes at 1.05 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.06 million 
tonnes at 0.83 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 0.37 million tonnes at 0.60 grams per tonne from stockpiles 
in the September quarter. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 14 per cent from US$29 million to US$33 million
mainly due to an increase in operational tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from US$38 million in the September quarter to US$28 million in the
December quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from US$3 million to US$nil million. Non-sustaining capital expenditure
decreased by 18 per cent from US$34 million to US$28 million mainly due to the timing of Far-East tailings storage 
facility and Amoanda Resource Infill drilling projects.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 9 per cent from US$1,084 per ounce in the September quarter to US$991 per ounce
in the December quarter mainly due to higher gold sold and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by
higher net operating costs. 

All-in costs decreased by 16 per cent from US$2,147 per ounce in the September quarter to US$1,802 per ounce in the
December quarter due to the same reasons as above, as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 14 per cent from 47,800 ounces in the September quarter to 41,300 ounces in the December
quarter. Copper production decreased by 13 per cent from 8,452 tonnes to 7,317 tonnes. Equivalent gold production
decreased by 11 per cent from 89,600 ounces to 80,000 ounces. The decrease in gold and copper production was mainly due 
to lower head grade in line with the mining sequence. 

Gold head grade decreased by 16 per cent from 1.31 grams per tonne to 1.10 grams per tonne and copper head grade
decreased by 12 cent from 0.58 per cent to 0.51 per cent. Gold recoveries increased from 69.2 per cent to 73.3 per cent.
Copper recoveries decreased slightly from 89.4 per cent to 89.3 per cent. Gold yield decreased by 10 per cent from 
0.90 grams per tonne to 0.81 grams per tonne and copper yield decreased by 10 per cent from 0.51 per cent to 
0.46 per cent in line with the mining sequence. 

In the December quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 46,459 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of
US$1,267 per ounce and 7,830 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$6,165 per tonne, net of treatment and
refining charges. This compared with 48,100 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,287 per ounce and
8,409 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average price of US$5,689 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, 
in the September quarter. 

Total tonnes mined decreased by 5 per cent from 4.32 million tonnes in the September quarter to 4.12 million tonnes in
the December quarter mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined decreased by 3 per
cent from 1.80 million tonnes to 1.75 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 
2.52 million tonnes to 2.37 million tonnes. The strip ratio decreased from 1.40 to 1.35.

Ore processed decreased by 2 per cent from 1.69 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.66 million tonnes in the
December quarter mainly due to lower throughput (796 tonnes per hour in the December quarter compared with 831 tonnes
per hour in the September quarter), as a result of the hardness of material treated during the quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 15 per cent from US$39 million to US$45
million. Operating costs were similar due to similar tonnes mined. Net operating costs were US$6 million higher due 
to a drawdown of concentrate to offset the decrease in ounces mined as a result of the significant decrease in gold 
and copper grades. The concentrate drawdown resulted in a US$5 million charge to cost in the December quarter compared 
with a US$1 million credit to cost in the September quarter. 

Capital expenditure increased by 20 per cent from US$10 million to US$12 million due to an increase in construction
activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce increased by 69 per cent from US$124 per ounce in the
September quarter to US$209 per ounce in the December quarter mainly due to higher net operating costs, lower gold 
sold and higher capital expenditure. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased 
by 13 per cent from US$629 per equivalent ounce to US$712 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

Gold production increased by 1 per cent from 89,500 ounces in the September quarter to 90,300 ounces in the December
quarter due to higher grades of ore mined and processed from the open pit mines. 

Total ore tonnes mined decreased by 21 per cent from 1.4 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.1 million tonnes
in the December quarter. 

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 100,000 tonnes in the September
quarter to 97,000 tonnes in the December quarter. Head grade decreased by 5 per cent from 3.75 grams per tonne 
to 3.55 grams per tonne with limited availability of high grade areas. Gold mined from underground decreased by 
5 per cent from 12,000 ounces to 11,400 ounces. 

Development of the new Invincible underground mine continued, with the first 3,000 tonnes of ore produced during 
the December quarter. The Invincible open pit operations are planned to continue concurrently with the underground 
operations to the end of 2019.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 23 per cent from 1.3 million tonnes in the September 
quarter to 1.0 million tonnes in the December quarter. Grade mined increased by 10 per cent from 2.77 grams per 
tonne to 3.04 grams per tonne due to increased grade mined from Neptune Stage 3 pit. Gold mined from open pits 
decreased by 14 per cent from 115,300 ounces to 99,200 ounces. In the December quarter, tonnes mined were sourced 
as follows: 0.55 million tonnes at 2.5 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.46 million tonnes at 3.7 grams per 
tonne from Neptune. This compared with 0.61 million tonnes at 2.9 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.69 million 
tonnes at 2.6 grams per tonne from Neptune in the September quarter.

Ounces mined at the consolidated St Ives mine decreased by 13 per cent from 127,300 ounces in the September quarter 
to 110,600 ounces in the December quarter. At the end of the December quarter, Neptune high-grade oxide material
stockpiled amounted to 45,600 ounces (710,900 tonnes at 1.99 grams per tonne), Invincible amounted to 7,800 ounces 
(109,000 tonnes at 2.21 grams per tonne), and A5 amounted to 7,900 ounces (173,600 tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne). 
As the Lefroy mill can only sustain a maximum of 25 per cent oxide material blend, the excess Neptune oxide material 
is stockpiled and fed to the mill so as to maintain the optimum blend.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.0 million tonnes in the September quarter to 2.8 million
tonnes in the December quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 6.6 million tonnes to 
6.4 million tonnes. Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 6 per cent from 10.9 million tonnes to 
10.2 million tonnes. The decrease was planned with ore mined continuing to exceed available mill capacity. The strip 
ratio increased from 7.3 to 9.1. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 9 per cent from 1.1 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.0 million
tonnes in the December quarter due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown in the December quarter. Yield increased by 
9 per cent from 2.48 grams per tonne to 2.70 grams per tonne due to the higher grades mined from the open pits. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 40 per cent from A$40 million (US$32 million)
to A$56 million (US$43 million) mainly due to increased costs related to the higher operational strip ratio, increased
underground development, scheduled plant maintenance and year-end adjustments and write-offs. In addition, a lower gold
inventory credit to cost of A$12 million (US$9 million) in the December quarter compared with A$23 million (US$18 million)
in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 27 per cent from A$48 million (US$38 million) to A$61 million (US$47 million) mainly
due to increased Invincible underground development, mill infrastructure expenditure and mobile equipment rebuilds. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 26 per cent from A$1,071 per ounce (US$848 per ounce) in
the September quarter to A$1,351 per ounce (US$1,035 per ounce) in the December quarter due to higher net operating 
costs and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by higher gold sold.

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 61,800 ounces in the September quarter to 63,900 ounces in the December
quarter due to higher grade ore processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 7 per cent from 293,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 313,000 tonnes in
the December quarter with increased ore tonnes from both New Holland and Waroonga. Head grade mined decreased by 16 per
cent from 7.35 grams per tonne to 6.18 grams per tonnes due to a decrease in grade mined from New Holland in the December
quarter, with low availability of high-grade areas as new mining areas are accessed. Gold mined decreased by 10 per
cent from 69,200 ounces to 62,200 ounces. In the December quarter tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 165,000 tonnes at
8.8 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 148,000 tonnes at 3.3 grams per tonne from New Holland. This compares with 149,000
tonnes at 9.6 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 144,000 tonnes at 5.0 grams per tonne from New Holland in the September
quarter. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 6 per cent from 315,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 296,000 tonnes in the
December quarter. The combined yield increased by 10 per cent from 6.11 grams per tonne to 6.73 grams per tonne due 
to the processing of higher grade stockpiles in the December quarter, mined but not processed in the September quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 21 per cent from A$43 million (US$34 million)
in the September quarter to A$52 million (US$40 million) in the December quarter mainly due to increased mining cost 
of A$3 million (US$2 million) related to increased ore tonnes mined at lower grade for lower gold output from 
underground and higher processing costs as a result of additional maintenance. In addition, a gold-in-circuit credit 
to cost of A$nil million (US$nil million) in the December quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 7 per cent from A$28 million (US$22 million) to A$30 million (US$23 million) mainly
due to the crushing facility purchased for A$5 million (US$4 million).

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 10 per cent from A$1,215 per ounce (US$956 per ounce) in
the September quarter to A$1,336 per ounce (US$1,029 per ounce) in the December quarter mainly due to higher net 
operating costs and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by higher gold sold.

Gold production increased by 6 per cent from 70,800 ounces in the September quarter to 74,800 ounces in the December
quarter mainly due to higher grade ore processed.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 4 per cent from 424,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 408,200 tonnes in
the December quarter due to an increase in capital development and a decrease in ore development. Head grade mined
decreased by 2 per cent from 5.65 grams per tonne in the September quarter to 5.55 grams per tonnes in the December 
quarter. Ounces mined decreased by 6 per cent from 77,100 ounces in the September quarter 72,800 ounces in the 
December quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 2 per cent from 428,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 419,000 tonnes in the
December quarter due to timing of milling campaigns quarter on quarter. The yield increased by 8 per cent from 
5.14 grams per tonne to 5.55 grams per tonnes due to a release from gold-in-circuit and processing of high grade 
stockpiles which were mined in the previous quarters during the December quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 21 per cent from A$47 million (US$37 million)
in the September quarter to A$57 million (US$44 million) in the December mainly due to increased costs as a result 
of increased ounces produced, higher processing costs due to plant maintenance and year-end adjustments and write-offs. 
In addition, a gold-in-process charge to cost of A$4 million (US$3 million) in the December quarter compared with a 
credit of A$3 million (US$2 million) in the September quarter. 

Capital expenditure increased by 68 per cent from A$25 million (US$20 million) to A$42 million (US$32 million). 
The increased expenditure related to mobile equipment purchases of A$5 million (US$4 million), early works on 
underground cooling and paste plants of A$7 million (US$5 million) and increased mine development and exploration 
expenditure of A$4 million (US$3 million). 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 26 per cent from A$1,087 per ounce (US$855 per ounce) in

Independent auditor's review report on condensed consolidated financial statements

To the shareholders of Gold Fields Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited, contained in the accompanying 
preliminary report, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 
and the condensed consolidated income statement and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and selected explanatory notes, as set out on pages 17 
to 24 and marked as reviewed, and the segmental operating and financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
as set out on pages 25 to 26 and marked as reviewed.

Directors' Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, 
as set out in the ""Basis of preparation"" note to the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act 
of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance
with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information
performed by the independent auditor of the entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that the financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in 
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also requires us to comply with relevant 
ethical requirements. A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. 
We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as 
appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated
financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017 are not prepared, in all material respects,
in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in the 
""Basis of preparation"" note to the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Trading statement for year ended 31 December 2017

Johannesburg, 8 February 2018: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that headline earnings per share (HEPS)
for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 (FY 2017) is
expected to range from US$0.23-0.26 per share, 0% (US$0.00 per
share) to 12% (US$0.03 per share) lower than the US$0.26 per
share reported for the twelve months ended 31 December 2016 (FY
2016).

The basic loss per share for FY 2017 is expected to be 110-125%
(US$0.22-0.25 per share) lower than the earnings of US$0.20 per
share reported for FY 2016, at a loss of US$0.02-0.05 per share.

Normalised earnings for FY 2017 are expected to be 21-33%
(US$0.05-0.08 per share) lower than the US$0.24 per share
reported for FY 2016 at US$0.16-0.19 per share.

The net loss for the year is impacted by the following non-
recurring items:

-  US$278m (R3.5bn) (gross and after tax) impairment of
   goodwill related to South Deep. Post this impairment, the
   carrying value of South Deep is US$1.96bn (R24.7bn)
-  US$30m (R390m) (gross), US$21m (R273m) (after tax)
   provision related to the Silicosis and TB Class Action
   litigation which was accounted for in the interim financial
   statements
-  US$53m (gross), US$38m (after tax) reversal of an
   impairment of mining assets at Cerro Corona
-  US$39m (gross and after tax) reversal of an impairment at
   Arctic Platinum as a result of the sale, announced on 24
   January 2018
-  US$24m (gross), US$17m (after tax) profit on the sale of
   Darlot

The basic loss, headline earnings and normalised earnings are all
impacted by an increase in amortisation mainly at Tarkwa, Cerro
Corona and St Ives.

The South Deep impairment is based on two main factors:
-  The slow start to the rebase plan over the past year is
   expected to result in a more gradual ramp-up in the earlier
   years. The steady state production target of c.500koz in 2022
   has not changed.    The rebase plan was announced in February
   2017
-  A reduction in the gold price assumption used in the life
   of mine model to R525,000/kg from R600,000/kg

We are pleased to announce the successful life extension of the
Cerro Corona mine in Peru to 2030 from 2023. The life extension
will be achieved through the creation of additional, cost-
effective tailings capacity. As a result of the increased life, a
previous impairment of US$53m has been reversed.

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q4 2017 is expected
to be 546koz (Q3 2017: 567koz), with all-in sustaining costs
(AISC) of US$959/oz (Q3 2017: US$906/oz) and all-in costs (AIC)
of US$1,115/oz (Q3 2017: US$1,032/oz).

For FY 2017, attributable gold equivalent production is expected
to be 2,160koz (FY 2016: 2,146koz), exceeding the guidance range
of 2,100-2,150koz. AISC of US$955/oz (FY 2016: US$980/oz) and AIC
of US$1,088/oz (FY 2016: US$1,006/oz) are both below the lower
end of the guidance range provided in February 2017  AISC:
US$1,010-1,030/oz and AIC: US$1,170-1,190/oz.

The financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed, and reported on, by the Companys
external auditors.

Gold Fields will release FY 2017 financial results on Wednesday,
14 February 2018.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields
In the September 2017 quarter, Gold Fields generated net cash flow of US$85m compared with an outflow of US$67m in Q2
2017, a positive swing of US$152m.  The positive cash flow of US$85m was after taking into account growth capital
expenditure of US$34m at Damang, A$21m (US$17m) at Gruyere, US$12m at Salares Norte and R55m (US$4m) at South Deep. If 
we exclude this growth capital (US$67m), net cash flow for the quarter would have been US$152m which is also stated after
interest paid of US$19m.  Taking into account the net cash generated and interim dividend payment, the net debt balance
decreased to US$1,302m from US$1,365m at the end of June 2017. 

Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 3% higher QoQ (6% higher YoY) at 567koz. All-in sustaining 
costs (AISC) were 5% lower QoQ (12% lower YoY) at US$906/oz and all-in costs (AIC) were 5% lower QoQ (1% lower YoY) at
US$1,032/oz.  The average US$ gold price achieved in the quarter was 2% higher QoQ (4% lower YoY) at US$1,276/oz. The
average Australian dollar exchange rate for the quarter was 0.79 (5% stronger QoQ and 4% stronger YoY), while the
average South African rand for the quarter was 13.14 (1% stronger QoQ and 7% stronger YoY).

South Deep recorded another improved quarter with gold production at 2,526kg (81koz) up 10% QoQ (up 17% YoY) and AIC
at R530,842/kg or US$1,257/oz down 10% QoQ (down 11% YoY). The increase in production was driven by a 10% increase in
underground reef grade to 6.34g/t (Q2 2017: 5.74g/t).

Despite the sequential quarter-on-quarter improvement in production in Q2 and Q3, South Deep will be unable to recover
the full extent of the weak March quarter which was impacted by two fatalities that negatively impacted the mining
contribution from the high grade corridors.  As a result, full-year production for the mine is expected to be 5% to 10%
below original guidance of 9,800kg (315koz).

Managed production in Ghana for Q3 2017 was 177koz, down 4% QoQ (down 5% YoY), with AIC of US$1,134/oz flat QoQ (up
14% YoY), underpinned by US$34m in project capital spent on the Damang reinvestment project during the quarter.  Gold
equivalent production at Cerro Corona was 31% higher QoQ (46% higher YoY) at 90koz, with AIC of US$629 per equivalent 
ounce, down 13% QoQ (down 33% YoY).

The Australian region produced 237koz for the quarter, down 3% QoQ (flat YoY), with AIC of A$1,148/oz (US$904/oz),
down 3% QoQ (down 12% YoY).  Excluding Darlot, which was held as a discontinuing asset, production from continuing
operations for the quarter was 222koz at AIC of A$1,116/oz (US$881/oz).

Update on projects
Damang
The Damang reinvestment project continued its good progress into the September quarter. Year-to-date total material
moved was 28.4Mt compared to the revised plan for the year of 41Mt which we are tracking well to achieve. Total project
capex spent year-to-date of US$87m compares to the budget of US$120m for the full year. 

Gruyere
Activity at the Gruyere project increased during the quarter. As at the end of September 2017, engineering progress of
37.8% and construction progress of 19.8% were achieved. Completion of the airstrip construction and the main access
road are expected ahead of plan.  The ball mill components (one of the key long lead time items) arrived in Fremantle 
in mid-September. The awarding of the mining contractor is expected by the end of November 2017. 

As previously guided, total project capex for Gruyere is expected to be A$532m. For FY17, A$280m was expected to be
spent. As a result of the timing of certain activities and deliveries, A$80m of the forecasted capital spend for FY17 
has been deferred to FY18. Consequently, A$200m is now forecast for the year. Importantly, the project schedule is not
impacted.

Gold Fields share of the project capital is A$267m. Taking into account interest capitalised as well as other support
costs, Gold Fields total capital expenditure on Gruyere is expected to be A$322m. We guided for total capital spend on
the project for FY17 of A$153m. Year-to-date we have spent A$70m, and now forecast to spend A$116m in 2017 due to the
deferral discussed above. 

In addition, Gold Fields has paid A$59m to end September of the remaining purchase consideration of A$100m as part of
the acquisition terms. 

Salares Norte
The feasibility study is on track for completion in the second half of 2018.

Darlot sale completed
The sale of Darlot was completed on 2 October 2017. Gold Fields received the relevant cash sums as well as the issue
of new shares as part of the consideration and as a consequence of the partial underwriting of a rights issue by the
Group. The net result is that Gold Fields has a 19.9% shareholding in Red 5.

Additional purchase of shares in Cardinal Resources
Post quarter-end, Gold Fields increased its stake in Cardinal Resources to 19.9% (on a partially diluted basis - if
only Gold Fields options are exercised), through a number of on-market transactions. Cardinal Resources is an exploration
company with activities in Ghana. Namdini, Cardinals flagship deposit, has an Indicated Mineral Resource of 120Mt at
1.1g/t for 4.3Moz with an Inferred Mineral Resource of 84Mt at 1.2g/t for 3.1Moz (0.5g/t cut-off grade) for a total
resource of 7.4Moz. 

FY17 guidance intact 
Despite the lower than guided production at South Deep, due to the weak Q1 2017, Group guidance remains unchanged,
with the other regions making up for the shortfall. Attributable equivalent gold production for 2017 is expected to be
between 2.10Moz and 2.15Moz, with AISC of between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce. As previously guided, AIC is
expected to be between US$1,170 per ounce to US$1,190 per ounce.

Gold production increased by 10 per cent from 2,286 kilograms (73,500 ounces) in the June quarter to 2,526 kilograms
(81,200 ounces) in the September quarter mainly due to an increase in head grade.  

Total underground tonnes mined increased by 5 per cent from 414,400 tonnes in the June quarter to 436,700 tonnes in
the September quarter.  In the September quarter 388,400 reef tonnes was mined at a grade of 6.3 grams per tonne along
with 48,300 waste tonnes mined.  This compared with 368,700 reef tonnes at a grade of 5.7  and 45,700 waste tonnes mined 
in the June quarter.  

Gold recovered was 63 kilograms (2,000 ounces) higher than gold broken of 2,463 kilograms (79,200 ounces) in the
September quarter.  The additional gold recovered in the September quarter was as a result of loading, tramming, 
hoisting and processing of locked-up underground stocks mined in the June quarter, which also improved the reef 
yield. The remaining excess stocks of broken ore of 45,000 tonnes are expected to be recovered in the December 
quarter of 2017.

Destress mining decreased by 35 per cent from 11,732 square metres in the June quarter to 7,666 square metres in the
September quarter. Reduced face availability due to required ground support and development activities was the main
reason for the decrease. These matters are being addressed and a significant pick up is expected in Q4. 

Longhole stoping decreased by 4 per cent from 216,000 tonnes to 207,000 tonnes.  The current mine contributed 63 per
cent of the total ore tonnes in the September quarter compared with 48 per cent in the June quarter.  The longhole
stoping method accounted for 47 per cent of total tonnes mined in the September quarter compared with 52 per cent in 
the June quarter.  

Development increased by 34 per cent from 1,471 metres in the June quarter to 1,965 metres in the September quarter. 
New mine capital development on 100 level increased by 26 per cent from 211 metres in the June quarter to 266 metres in
the September quarter. New mine development is focused on infrastructure projects exclusively on 100 level and related 
to haulage extensions, crusher excavations and conveyor extensions. Reef horizon development in the current mine areas 
increased by 45 per cent from 777 metres to 1,126 metres.  Reef horizon development North of Wrench increased by 19 per 
cent from 483 metres to 573 metres.

Total tonnes milled increased by 6 per cent from 526,000 tonnes to 555,000 tonnes due to an increase in surface
tailings material. Underground reef tonnes milled were virtually unchanged at 397,000 tonnes in the June quarter compared
with 398,000 tonnes in the September quarter. Total tonnes milled in the September quarter included 45,000 tonnes of
underground development waste mined and 112,000 tonnes of surface tailings material. This compared with 47,000 tonnes of
underground development waste mined and 82,000 tonnes of surface tailings material in the June quarter.  Underground reef
yield increased by 10 per cent from 5.74 grams per tonne to 6.34 grams per tonne due to the loading, tramming, hoisting
and processing of previously locked-up underground stocks, as discussed earlier. 

Net operating costs decreased by 2 per cent from R1,057 million (US$80 million) to R1,038 million (US$79 million)
mainly due to lower bonuses and overtime costs and a gold-in-process credit of R9 million (US$1 million) in the 
September quarter compared with R8 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 3 per cent from R253 million (US$19 million) in the June quarter to R260 million
(US$20 million) in the September quarter.  

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 4 per cent from R214 million (US$16 million) in the June quarter to 
R205 million (US$15 million) in the September quarter mainly due to fleet purchases in the June quarter. Non-sustaining
capital expenditure increased by 41 per cent from R39 million (US$3 million) to R55 million (US$4 million). The higher
non-sustaining capital expenditure was mainly due to increased expenditure on new mine development and infrastructure
projects.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 11 per cent from R573,127 per kilogram (US$1,352 per ounce) in the June quarter
to R509,011 per kilogram (US$1,203 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to increased gold sold, lower net
operating costs and lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent from R590,093 per kilogram (US$1,389 per ounce) in the June quarter to
R530,842 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) in the September quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining 
costs, partially offset by higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Updated guidance: 
- Gold production 5 to 10 per cent below 9,800 kilograms (315,000 ounces),
- Destress square meters 20-25 per cent below 46,000 square meters,
- Development meters 10-15 per cent below 7,880 metres.

The long-term integrity of the rebase plan remains unaffected.

million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined increased by 2 per cent from 12.7 million tonnes to 12.9 million tonnes. 
Head grade mined was similar at 1.33 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio decreased from 5.3 to 4.9 mainly in line with the
mining sequence. 

The CIL plant throughput was similar at 3.4 million tonnes.  Yield increased by 2 per cent from 1.31 grams per tonne
to 1.34 grams per tonne due to higher grade feed.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 5 per cent from US$80 million to US$76 million
mainly due to lower tonnes mined and a US$11 million gold-in-process credit in the September quarter compared with US$8
million in the June quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 11 per cent from US$47 million to US$42 million due to replacements and
refurbishments of fleet in the June quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent from US$969 per ounce in the June quarter to
US$909 per ounce in the September quarter due to higher gold sold, lower net operating costs and lower capital 
expenditure.

mainly due to the lower grade ore mined in Amoanda pit stage 1.  In the September quarter, Amoanda pit mined 
0.53 million tonnes at 1.09 grams per tonne compared with 0.61 million tonnes mined at 1.59 grams per tonne in the June 
quarter with the decrease in tonnes and grade in line with the mining sequence. The 0.92 million ore tonnes mined in the 
September quarter also included 0.16 million tonnes from Lima South, 0.13 million tonnes from Tomento East and 
0.10 million tonnes from Abosso tailings. The strip ratio increased from 9.3 to 9.4.

Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 1.12 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.13 million tonnes in the
September quarter.  Yield decreased by 22 per cent from 1.14 grams per tonne to 0.89 grams per tonne.  The lower yield 
was due to lower grade material treated from the Amoanda, Lima and Tomento East pits.  In the September quarter, tonnes
milled were sourced as follows: 0.70 million tonnes at 1.05 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.06 million tonnes at 0.83
grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 0.37 million tonnes at 0.60 grams per tonne from stockpiles.  This compared 
with 0.66 million tonnes at 1.63 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.14 million tonnes at 0.78 grams per tonne from Abosso
tailings and 0.32 million tonnes at 0.61 grams per tonne from stockpiles in the June quarter.  The remaining Abosso 
tailings and stockpiles are approximately 0.05 million tonnes at 0.97 grams per tonne and 0.24 million tonnes at 
0.67 grams per tonne, respectively.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 6 per cent from US$31 million to US$29 million
mainly due to lower operational tonnes mined, improved efficiencies and cost control.

Capital expenditure increased by 6 per cent from US$36 million in the June quarter to US$38 million in the September
quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 25 per cent from US$4 million to US$3 million.  Non-sustaining capital
expenditure increased by 6 per cent from US$32 million to US$34 million mainly due to the commencement of Amoanda infill
drilling in the September quarter. 

All-in sustaining costs increased by 20 per cent from US$906 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,084 per ounce in
the September quarter mainly due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs and lower sustaining
capital expenditure.  All-in costs increased by 27 per cent from US$1,692 per ounce in the June quarter to US$2,147 per
ounce in the September quarter due to lower gold sold and higher non-sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by
lower net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 32 per cent from 36,100 ounces in the June quarter to 47,800 ounces in the September
quarter.  Copper production increased by 18 per cent from 7,165 tonnes to 8,452 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production
increased by 31 per cent from 68,400 ounces to 89,600 ounces.  The increase in gold and copper production was mainly 
due to higher head grades in line with the mining sequence and pit design.  

Gold head grade increased by 32 per cent from 0.99 grams per tonne to 1.31 grams per tonne and copper head grade
increased by 18 per cent from 0.49 per cent to 0.58 per cent.  Gold and copper head grades for the year are expected 
to be around 1.03 grams per tonne to 1.06 grams per tonne and 0.48 per cent to 0.51 per cent, respectively.  Gold 
recoveries increased from 68.5 per cent to 69.2 per cent.  Copper recoveries increased from 88.8 per cent to 
89.4 per cent.  Gold yield increased by 32 per cent from 0.68 grams per tonne to 0.90 grams per tonne and copper yield 
increased by 19 per cent from 0.43 per cent to 0.51 per cent. 

In the September quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 48,100 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of
US$1,287 per ounce and 8,409 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,689 per tonne, net of treatment and
refining charges.  This compared with 36,300 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,255 per ounce and
7,447 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average price of US$4,998 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, 
in the June quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 4.14 million tonnes in the June quarter to 4.32 million tonnes in the
September quarter mainly due to higher waste mined in line with the mining sequence.  Ore mined increased by 1 per cent
from 1.79 million tonnes to 1.80 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 7 per cent from 2.35
million tonnes to 2.52 million tonnes.  As a result, the strip ratio increased from 1.32 to 1.40.

Ore processed decreased by 3 per cent from 1.74 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.69 million tonnes in the
September quarter as a result of a planned maintenance shutdown in the September quarter. (94 per cent utilisation in 
the September quarter compared with 97 per cent utilisation in the June quarter).

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 3 per cent from US$38 million to US$39 million
mainly due to higher mining cost as a result of increased tonnes mined and higher statutory workers participation.  
This was partially offset by a US$1 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the September quarter compared with a 
US$2 million charge to cost in the June quarter.  

Capital expenditure increased by 43 per cent from US$7 million to US$10 million due to an increase in construction
activities at the tailings dam and waste storage facilities.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 67 per cent from US$380 per ounce in the
June quarter to US$124 per ounce in the September quarter mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by 
higher net operating costs and higher capital expenditure.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per 
equivalent ounce decreased by 13 per cent from US$724 per equivalent ounce to US$629 per equivalent ounce due to the 
same reasons as above.

Gold production decreased by 13 per cent from 102,600 ounces in the June quarter to 89,500 ounces in the September
quarter due to lower grades of ore mined and processed. 

At the Hamlet underground operation, ore tonnes mined decreased by 30 per cent from 143,000 tonnes in the June quarter
to 100,000 tonnes in the September quarter due to a significant seismic event which occurred in August.  This resulted
in limited access to stoping areas for most of the month.  Head grade decreased by 8 per cent from 4.06 grams per tonne
to 3.75 grams per due to reduced mining flexibility.  

Ounces mined at the consolidated St Ives mine increased by 14 per cent from 112,100 ounces in the June quarter to
127,300 ounces in the September quarter. Although the mine has produced more ounces, the mill is constrained in its 
ability to mill the Neptune oxide material up to a maximum of 25 per cent.  This Neptune oxide material will continue 
to sit on stockpile and be drawn down each month up to the maximum of 25 per cent addition to the mill. 

Development of the Invincible underground mine commenced during the quarter with the cutting of portals and the
commencement of the twin declines into the Invincible underground mine.  First ore from underground is expected in late
October 2017.  The open pit operations are planned to continue concurrently with the underground operations to end 2019.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 46 per cent from 0.9 million tonnes in the June quarter to
1.3 million tonnes in the September quarter with Stage 3 of Neptune pit brought into production during the quarter. 
Grade mined decreased by 16 per cent from 3.28 grams per tonne to 2.77 grams per tonne.  The lower grade was in line 
with the mining sequence.  In the September quarter, tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 0.61 million tonnes at 
2.9 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.69 million tonnes at 2.6 grams per tonne from Neptune.  This compared with 
0.68 million tonnes mined at 4.0 grams per tonne from Invincible and 0.20 million tonnes mined at 0.9 grams per tonne 
from Neptune in the June quarter.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 150 per cent from 1.2 million tonnes in the June quarter to 3.0 million
tonnes in the September quarter and capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 33 per cent from 9.9 million tonnes to 6.6
million tonnes reflecting a change from pre-strip to operating waste with Neptune Stage 3 brought to production during 
the September quarter.  Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 9 per cent from 12.0 million tonnes to 
10.9 million tonnes due to the reduction in the strip ratio as the pits deepened.  The strip ratio decreased from 
12.5 to 7.3.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 8 per cent from 1.0 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.1 million
tonnes in the September quarter due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown in the June quarter.  Yield decreased by 
19 per cent from 3.07 grams per tonne to 2.48 grams per tonne due to the lower grades mined and processed. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 13 per cent from A$46 million (US$35 million)
to A$40 million (US$32 million) due to a gold inventory credit to cost of A$23 million (US$18 million) in the September
quarter compared with A$5 million (US$4 million) in the June quarter, partially offset by an increase of A$14 million
(US$11 million) in operational open pit mining costs reflecting the change from pre-strip to operational waste.  The
gold-in-process credit reflects a quarter where ounces mined from the open pits were 28,000 ounces higher than processed 
and added to stockpiles (1.4 million tonnes were mined at 2.84 grams per tonne with 1.1 million tonnes processed at 2.74
grams per tonne).  This will not all be processed by year-end due to the reasons mentioned above.

Capital expenditure decreased by 21 per cent from A$61 million (US$45 million) to A$48 million (US$38 million) mainly
due to decreased pre-stripping at Invincible and Neptune pits.   

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 3 per cent from A$1,107 per ounce (US$831 per ounce) in the
June quarter to A$1,071 per ounce (US$848 per ounce) in the September quarter due to lower net operating costs and
lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Ore mined from underground increased by 9 per cent from 268,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 293,000 tonnes in the
September quarter with increased ore tonnes from both New Holland and Waroonga.  Head grade mined increased by 3 per 
cent from 7.13 grams per tonne to 7.35 grams per tonnes due to higher grades from Waroonga.  In the September quarter 
tonnes mined were sourced as follows: 149,000 tonnes at 9.6 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 144,000 tonnes at 
5.0 grams per tonne from New Holland.  This compares with 146,000 tonnes at 8.2 grams per tonne from Waroonga and 
122,000 tonnes at 5.9 grams per tonne from New Holland in the June quarter.  Ounces mined increased by 13 per cent 
from 61,400 ounces in the June quarter to 69,200 ounces in the September quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased marginally from 316,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 315,000 tonnes in the September
quarter.  The combined yield increased by 9 per cent from 5.62 grams per tonne to 6.11 grams per tonne due to higher 
grade ore mined and the processing of higher grade stockpiles in the September quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 14 per cent from A$50 million (US$37 million)
in the June quarter to A$43 million (US$34 million) in the September quarter mainly due to a gold-in-circuit credit to
cost of A$5 million (US$4 million) in the September quarter compared with A$1 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter
and A$3 million (US$3 million) reduction in mining cost with a greater proportion of capital development and less ore
development compared with the June quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 40 per cent from A$20 million (US$15 million) to A$28 million (US$22 million) mainly
due to increased exploration expenditure and development expenditure at Waroonga.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent from A$1,283 per ounce (US$964 per ounce) in the
June quarter to A$1,215 per ounce (US$956 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to higher gold sold and lower
net operating costs, partially offset by higher capital expenditure.

Tonnes processed increased by 2 per cent from 418,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 428,000 tonnes in the September
quarter due to timing of milling campaigns quarter on quarter.  The yield decreased by 5 per cent from 5.42 grams per
tonne to 5.14 grams per tonne due to lower grades mined and a build-up of gold in circuit at the end of the September
quarter.    

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 6 per cent from A$50 million (US$38 million) in
the June quarter to A$47 million (US$37 million) in the September quarter mainly due to a gold-in-process credit to
cost of A$3 million (US$2 million) in the September quarter compared with A$2 million (US$2 million) in the June quarter,

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF GOLD FIELDS

Projects tracking well

At the end of 2016, Gold Fields embarked on a reinvestment programme in order to sustain the current production base for the next 8 to 
10 years and to improve the all-in costs for the Group. Both the Damang and Gruyere projects progressed well during the 6 months, with 
South Deep having a slower start to the year than planned due to the fatalities and falls of ground in Q1. Having planned the year at a 
gold price of US$1,100/oz, the average gold price received of US$1,232/oz has positively impacted our results and has assisted in 
maintaining a strong balance sheet during a period of high capital expenditure. 

As reported in the recent trading statement, attributable gold equivalent production, for the six months ended 30 June 2017, was 
1.047Moz (H1 2016: 1.044Moz). All-in sustaining costs for the period were US$980/oz (H1 2016: US$992/oz), with all-in costs of 
US$1,103/oz (H1 2016: US$1,024/oz) as a result of the increased growth capital. 

As mentioned above, normalised earnings in H1 2017, decreased to US$77m, from US$103m in H1 2016 due to the impact of stronger exchange 
rates on converting local currency costs and amortisation to US dollars and secondly an increase in amortisation at Tarkwa linked to 
new reserves published in March 2017 as well as increased mining volumes at this mine. 

Normalised earnings from continuing operations were US$80m or US$0.10/share.

In line with our dividend policy, we have declared an interim dividend of 40 SA cents per share which compares with the 2016 interim 
dividend of 50 SA cents per share. 

Gold Fields reported a net cash outflow for the half year of US$102m, compared with an inflow of US$60m in H1 2016, mainly due to the 
growth capital spent at Gruyere, Damang and Salares Norte. Stripping out the project capital of US$141m at these three projects, the 
net cash flow would have been an inflow of US$39m. Consequently, the net debt balance increased to US$1,365m from US$1,166m at the end 
of FY 2016, with the net debt to EBITDA ratio edging higher to 1.12x (from 0.95x at 31 December 2016) but still well below the debt 
covenant level of 2.5x. 

Update on projects

Damang 

The Damang reinvestment project, which commenced on 23 December 2016, has got off to a strong start and is currently tracking well 
against the project plan. During H1 2017, total tonnes mined were 18.9Mt while gold production was 77koz, underpinned by high-grade 
material from the Amoanda pit. Construction of the Far East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) commenced during Q1 2017 and is on track 
for completion by the end of 2017. It will provide cost effective tailings capacity of 44Mt.
 
Given the strong start to the project total tonnes mined in 2017 are now expected to be 41Mt vs. the project schedule of 33Mt, with the 
key focus on capital stripping. 

Gruyere

During H1 2017, the Gruyere JV undertook a detailed review of the Feasibility Study, which resulted in a number of improvements and 
enhancements to the project.

The capital cost budget has been revised to A$532m to include certain other costs, including those associated with complying to the 
International Cyanide Management Code. 

The project construction schedule remains unchanged, with engineering progress at 13.5% (budget: 14.8%) and construction progress in-
line with budget at 9.3%. The Gruyere Village, which includes 648 rooms, offices and recreational facilities, was commissioned during 
H1 2017. As scheduled, Stage 1 (installation of the first 288 rooms) in March 2017 and Stage 2 (installation of a further 360 rooms) 
was completed in May 2017. Six of the eight planned boreholes at the Anne Beadell borefield were commissioned during H1 2017. These are 
expected to provide the majority of water required for construction works and potable water for the Gruyere Village.

The Bulk Earthworks contract was awarded to MACA Civil in May 2017. The contract covers the development of the main access road, 
borefield access tracks, sealed airstrip, and access roads to the process plant and the tailings storage facility. MACA began 
resourcing and mobilising its workforce in early May for an expected construction duration of 15 months. 

The Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for the design, procurement and installation of the Gruyere processing 
plant and the associated infrastructure was awarded to Amec Foster Wheeler Cimvec Joint Venture and executed in June 2017. Contracts 
for the supply of key long lead equipment items have been awarded, including the ball mill and primary crusher to FL Schmidt and the 
SAG mill to Outotec. 

During H1 2017, a power supply contract was signed with APA Group, a leading Australian energy infrastructure business. APA will 
design, build, own and operate a 198 kilometre gas pipeline and a 45 megawatt gas-fired power plant which will supply Gruyeres energy 
needs for the life of the project. Commissioning of both the pipeline and the power station is planned for Q4 2018. Procurement of the 
LPG will be undertaken by the Joint Venture.

Finally, the tender process for the mining contract is underway, with the award of the mining contract expected in Q4 2017. 
Mobilisation of the successful mining contractor is scheduled for Q1 2018.

Australia

Gold production in the Australia region for H1 2017 was 1% higher YoY at 469koz, with all operations except Darlot increasing 
production. AIC for the region was 3% lower YoY in A$ terms at A$1,228/oz and largely flat in US$ terms at US$924/oz. The net cash 
outflow from the region for H1 2017 was US$9m. However, if the US$60m spent on Gruyere is excluded, the region recorded an inflow of 
US$51m.

During H1 2017, A$47m of the exploration budget was spent, with 331,100 metres drilled during the period. There have been encouraging 
results at all operations including extensions at Wallaby at Granny Smith, both laterally and at depth, as well as extensions at 
Invincible and Invincible South at St Ives. At Agnew, infill and step-out drilling at Waroonga North yielded positive results, 
indicating that this ore body which is in close proximity and in a parallel shear zone to the high grade substantial Kim orebody, is 
increasing in size.

Subsequent to quarter end, Gold Fields announced the sale of Darlot, through a wholly owned subsidiary, to ASX-listed Red 5 Limited for 
a total consideration of A$18.5m, comprising A$12m in cash and 130m Red 5 shares. The cash component is made up of A$7m upfront and 
A$5m deferred for up to 24 months. The deferred consideration may be taken as additional shares in Red 5 or as cash at Gold Fields 
election. 

Red 5 intends to undertake a rights issue in order to assist with the funding of the cash component and general working capital 
purposes. Gold Fields will underwrite the rights issue up to A$7m. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including Red 5 
shareholder approval, and is scheduled for completion and ownership transfer in September 2017. 

West Africa

Attributable gold production from the West Africa region was 4% higher YoY at 323koz in H1 2017 due to higher production at both Tarkwa 
and Damang. However, AIC for the region increased 9% YoY to US$1,142/oz driven by the US$53m in project capital spent at Damang during 
the half. The region generated net cash flow of US$21m for the six months to June 2017. If the project capital for Damang (US$53m) is 
excluded, the region would have generated net cash flow of US$74m. 

South America

Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona increased by 7% YoY to 136koz, underpinned by slightly higher recovered grades 
and the higher copper price. Consequently, AIC decreased by 7% YoY to US$677 per equivalent ounce. The mine generated net cash flow of 
US$27m during H1 2017.

Over the last 12 months our technical and operational teams have been working on options to extend the life of Cerro Corona. At the 
present time initial studies have been completed that show by using existing mineral resources and alternative tailings disposal 
methods (specifically in-pit tailings and as an alternative, a new tailings dam) mine life could potentially be economically extended 
to 2030. This initial work has been encouraging and a pre-feasibility study is expected to be completed in early 2018. 

South Deep

After a challenging start to 2017, with a number of incidents impacting Q1, production at South Deep in Q2 2017 increased by 61% QoQ. 
The recovery continued into the July month, during which 1,008kg (32koz) was produced. Despite the slow start to the year, the 
integrity of the rebase plan is still intact and largely on track. We strongly believe that the production schedule of the rebase plan 
over the next few years is on track. 

For the six months to 30 June 2017, production at South Deep decreased by 15% to 3,710kg (119koz) from 4,356kg (140koz) in H1 2016, 
driven by decreased volumes and grade. Two fatalities and three falls of ground impacted negatively on the March quarters production 
output. However, the June quarter demonstrated a significant improvement. AIC in H1 2017 increased 7% YoY to R662,973/kg (US$1,557/oz). 

- Safety continues to be a priority at South Deep, with no fatalities reported in Q2 after a bad start in Q1. The TRIFR improved 25% 
  YoY to 2.18 in H1 2017 from 2.89 in H1 2016. 
- The net cash outflow for the period was R630m compared with an outflow of R50m in H1 2016, in part due to the lower gold price 
  received of R525,042/kg compared with R601,187/kg in H1 2016. 
- Development decreased by 7% to 2,853 metres in H1 2017 from 3,078 metres in H1 2016.
- Destress mining decreased by 19% to 16,134 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2017 from 19,845 square metres for the 
  six months ended 30 June 2016 (a change in the rib pillar design from 2016 to 2017 resulted in a change in the measurement of 
  destress square metres). Destress tonnes in H1 2017 were 109kt, compared with 163kt in H1 2016. 
- Longhole stoping volumes increased by 29% to 387kt in H1 2017 from 301kt in H1 2016, in line with the mines build-up plan, and 
  accounted for 50% of total tonnes broken.
- Secondary support increased by 19% YoY to 4,625 metres from 3,891 metres from H1 2016.
- Backfill placed was 17% lower YoY for the six months to June 2017 at 164m3 from 198m3 in H1 2016. Operational constraints in Q1 2017 
  impacted negatively on backfill placed. In addition, the rib pillar destress method requires significantly less backfill.

The improved performance from Q1 2017 to Q2 2017 is scheduled to continue for the remainder of the year. This is primarily as a result 
of additional mining cuts becoming available and improved access and infrastructure capacity particularly in the higher grade 
corridors. The forecast improvement will be further enabled by debottlenecking the ore handling infrastructure as well as improved 
primary equipment availabilities and utilisation. This is based on improved maintenance strategies and practices. 

Significant focus is being placed on integrating and optimising the overall mining cycle including the constraining ancillary 
activities of secondary support and backfill to improve overall productivity. There has been an improvement in compliance to mine 
design parameters and this is steadily translating into improved overall mining conditions, mining area availability and output.

As a result of this, we envisage steadily increasing the rate of destress mining to further improve volumes and create mining stock.

Mining Charter

We endorse the process undertaken by the Chamber of Mines with regards to the 2017 Mining Charter published on 15 June 2017. The 
interdict application is likely to be heard in mid-September 2017. Gold Fields supports achieving a solution that is viable to support 
economic growth and create a sustainable mining industry in South Africa in which investment is encouraged. A preference is to craft a 
solution through a win-win outcome for all. Unfortunately, the current envisaged charter renders this impossible. 

Silicosis 

As reported in our recent trading statement, Gold Fields has raised a provision of US$30 million (R390 million) after tax for a 
possible settlement of the silicosis class action claims. We remain committed to finding a sustainable solution for the industry and 
claimants. 

FY17 guidance intact 

Attributable equivalent gold production for 2017 is expected to be between 2.10Moz and 2.15Moz, with AISC of between US$1,010 per ounce 
and US$1,030 per ounce. As previously guided, due to the increased project capital spend, AIC is expected to be between US$1,170 per 
ounce to US$1,190 per ounce.

Looking beyond 2017, we believe that we can at least maintain our current production profile for the next 8 to 10 years. In the chart 
below, we show the five-year production and AIC profile. The benefits of the investments in Damang, Gruyere and South Deep start to 
come through from 2019 onwards, with production approaching 2.3Moz and AIC approaching sub-US$900/oz. Importantly, this profile is 
largely achieved from lower risk, less capital intensive organic projects. Any further upside and capital expenditure potential from 
Salares Norte is excluded.

Results for the Group (Continuing and discontinued operations) 

SAFETY
The Groups fatality injury frequency rate regressed from 0.00 for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 0.07 for the six months ended 
30 June 2017. The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group regressed by 8 per cent from 2.20 for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to 2.37 for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

1  Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically 
   Treated Injuries4) x 1,000,000/number of man-hours worked.
2  A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend work for a period 
   of one or more days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform any functions.
3  A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the employee or 
   contractor being unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the day after the injury 
   occurred. The employee or contractor can still perform some of his duties.
4  A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which does not incapacitate that 
   employee and who, after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately resume his/her normal duties on the next 
   calendar day, immediately following the treatment/re-treatment.

For the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with the six months ended 30 June 2016

The discussion of financial and operating results below is an analysis of total Gold Fields operations (continuing and discontinued). 
Due to the fact that the discontinued operation does not have a material impact on the Groups results, it has not been discussed 
separately. The discussion is based on the Income statement and Statement of cash flows on pages 5 and 6, respectively.

REVENUE
Attributable equivalent gold production increased marginally from 1,044,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
1,047,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017. South Deep and Darlot produced less gold in the six months ended 30 June 2017 
compared with the six months ended June 2016.

30 June 2016 to 322,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to increased production at both Tarkwa and Damang. 
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru increased by 7 per cent from 126,900 ounces for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to 136,300 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Gold production at the Australian operations increased by 
1 per cent from 466,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 468,800 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to 
higher production at all the operations except Darlot.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep decreased by 15 per cent from 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to 3,710 kilograms (119,300 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to decreased volumes and grades, 
exacerbated by two fatalities in the six months ended June 2017, whilst in the comparative period there were none. Gold sold decreased 
by 14 per cent from 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) to 3,740 kilograms (120,200 ounces).

30 June 2016 to 281,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to higher yield. At Damang, managed gold production 
increased by 7 per cent from 71,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 76,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 
mainly due to increased tonnes processed in excess of what was planned in the Damang reinvestment project.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona increased by 7 per cent from 127,500 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 137,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased gold and copper 
recoveries. Gold equivalent ounces sold increased by 14 per cent from 120,100 ounces to 135,700 ounces.
 
At the Australia region, St Ives gold production increased by 5 per cent from 175,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
184,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased volumes processed. At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production 
increased by 6 per cent from 109,300 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 115,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 
2017 mainly due to increased ore tonnes processed. At Darlot, gold production decreased by 34 per cent from 37,200 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 to 24,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to lower grades. At Granny Smith, gold 
production increased by 1 per cent from 143,700 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 144,700 ounces for the six months ended 
30 June 2017 due to increased tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by lower grades. 

The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased by 1 per cent from US$1,218 per equivalent ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,232 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The average rand gold price decreased by 
13 per cent from R601,187 per kilogram to R525,042 per kilogram. The average Australian dollar gold price decreased by 1 per cent from 
A$1,657 per ounce to A$1,642 per ounce. The average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations increased by 1 per cent from 
US$1,217 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,232 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The average 
equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment and refining charges, for Cerro Corona decreased marginally from US$1,227 per 
equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,221 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017. 
The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate strengthened by 14 per cent from R15.39 for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to R13.24 for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017. The average Australian/US dollar exchange rate strengthened by 1 per cent from A$1.00 = US$0.74 to 
A$1.00 = US$0.75.

Gold equivalent ounces sold increased by 1 per cent from 1.07 million ounces to 1.08 million ounces. Revenue increased by 2 per cent 
from US$1,305 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,335 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the higher 
gold price achieved and increased gold sold. 

NET OPERATING COSTS
Net operating costs increased by 6 per cent from US$666 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$707 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017. The US$41 million higher net operating costs were due to an increase in costs of US$13 million in local 
currencies (2 per cent) and the exchange rate effect of US$28 million on translation into US dollars at a 14 per cent stronger rand and 
a 1 percent stronger Australian dollar. 

At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep increased by 2 per cent from R1,959 million (US$127 million) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 to R1,997 million (US$151 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to annual salary 
increases and an increase in employees and contractors in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation in 
accordance with the rebase plan, partially offset by a build-up of gold-in-process of R63 million (US$5 million).

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 5 per cent from US$230 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
US$218 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. This decrease in net operating costs was mainly due to continued business process 
re-engineering, as well as a gold-in process build-up of US$16 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$8 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona increased by 11 per cent from US$63 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to US$70 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 in line with the increase in production and due to a lower build-up 
of concentrate of US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with a build-up of US$6 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016. 

At the Australia region, net operating costs increased by 6 per cent from A$337 million (US$247 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to A$357 million (US$269 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased production at all the 
operations except Darlot, as well as a gold inventory charge to cost of A$1 million (US$nil million) for the six months ended June 2017 
compared with a credit of A$15 million (US$11 million) for the six months ended June 2016. 

OPERATING PROFIT 
Operating profit for the Group decreased by 2 per cent from US$639 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$627 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the increase in net operating costs, partially offset by the increase in revenue. 


AMORTISATION 
Amortisation for the Group increased by 8 per cent from US$300 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$324 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2017. The increase in amortisation relates mainly to stronger exchange rates in South Africa and Australia 
along with an increase at Tarkwa as a result of lower reserve ounces (reported on 28 March 2017) and an increase in ore mined and 
stockpiled. The US$24 million increase in amortisation was due to higher amortisation of US$16 million in local currencies and the 
exchange rate effect of US$8 million on translation into US dollars at a 14 per cent stronger rand and a 1 per cent stronger Australian 
dollar. 

OTHER
Net interest expense for the Group increased by 3 per cent from US$31 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$32 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Interest expense of US$44 million, partially offset by interest income of US$3 million and 
interest capitalised of US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with interest expense of US$41 million, partially 
offset by interest income of US$3 million and interest capitalised of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 50 per cent from US$2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to downscaling of activities at Far Southeast project (FSE) and mainly related to recurring 
site and overhead costs. 

The loss on foreign exchange of US$4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$nil million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 and related to the conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies. 

The gain on financial instruments of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 related to the mark to market of the gold hedge 
taken out at the Australian operations (a gain of A$14 million/US$11 million) and the oil hedges taken out at the Ghanaian and 
Australian operations (a loss US$2 million and A$2 million/US$2 million, respectively). This compared to a gain of US$6 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the South Deep currency hedge. 

Share-based payments for the Group increased from US$6 million to US$12 million due to the introduction of the revised Gold Fields 2012 
share scheme. Long-term employee benefits decreased from US$20 million to US$3 million due to downward mark to market adjustments and 
no issue of benefits in 2017 due to the termination of the scheme.

Other costs for the Group decreased from US$24 million to US$22 million. 

EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS
Exploration and project costs increased from US$41 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$48 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017, mainly due to increased write-off of exploration at the Australian operations from A$20 million (US$15 million) 
to A$28 million (US$21 million). Exploration costs at Salares Norte was similar at US$24 million.

NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring expenses of US$38 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with non-recurring income of US$6 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly related to the silicosis 
provision raised of US$30 million and US$7 million for the write-off of parked up fleet at Tarkwa. The non-recurring income for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 was mainly due to a profit of US$18 million on the buy-back of the bond, partially offset by retrenchment 
costs of US$10 million at Damang.

ROYALTIES
Government royalties for the Group decreased from US$39 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$31 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017 due to the introduction of a sliding scale royalty in Ghana from 1 January 2017. The royalty rate decreased 
from 5 per cent in 2016 to an effective 3 per cent in 2017 (based on a sliding scale linked to revenue).

TAXATION
The taxation charge for the Group of US$62 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$68 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016. Normal taxation was similar at US$83 million. The deferred tax credit of US$21 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2017 compared with US$15 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The high effective tax rate for the six months ended 
30 June 2017 is mainly due to the non-deduction of certain interest payments of US$36 million and exploration costs at Salares Norte of 
US$24 million. If pre-tax profits are adjusted for these items, the normalised effective tax rate for the six months, as a percentage 
of adjusted pre-tax profits would have been 34 per cent. 

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol (Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the 
US dollar. For accounting purposes the unredeemed capital allowance balance in respect of the operation must be converted from Soles to 
dollars at the closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, the US dollar equivalent of the unredeemed capital allowance balance fluctuates 
due to movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar. This resulted in a change in the temporary 
taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation. A deferred tax credit of US$4 million arose due to the strengthening of 
the exchange rate from 3.40 Nuevo Sol to 3.27 Nuevo Sol in the six months to June 2017, compared with a deferred tax credit of 
US$5 million which arose due to the strengthening of the exchange rate from 3.38 Nuevo Sol to 3.28 Nuevo Sol in the six months to 
June 2016. It has no cash effect.

EARNINGS 
Net earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$53 million or US$0.07 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared 
with net earnings of US$115 million or US$0.14 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$70 million or US$0.09 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017 
compared with headline earnings of US$124 million or US$0.16 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Normalised earnings of US$77 million or US$0.10 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$103 million or 
US$0.13 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 


CASH FLOW 
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$276 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$384 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in operating profit of US$32 million and tax paid increased from 
US$127 million to US$196 million. The increase in tax paid is due to the top up payment of the final 2016 tax liability of A$64 million 
(US$48 million) by the Australian operations in June 2017. In addition, investment into working capital increased from US$13 million to 
US$26 million.

Dividends paid of US$43 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$11 million paid for the six months ended 
30 June 2016. Dividends paid to owners of the parent increased from US$11 million to US$37 million and related to the final dividends 
paid for 2015 and 2016, respectively. Dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders of US$6 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2017 compared with nil for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Cash outflow from investing activities increased from US$321 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$439 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2017 due to an increase in capital expenditure from US$316 million to US$389 million. The US$73 million higher 
capital expenditure was due to higher expenditure of US$64 million in local currencies and the exchange rate effect of US$9 million on 
translation into US dollars at a 14 per cent stronger rand and a 1 per cent stronger Australian dollar.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from US$316 million to US$293 million, while non-sustaining capital expenditure increased from 
US$4 million to US$96 million. This increase in non-sustaining capital expenditure is in line with the focus on reinvesting into the 
business and the future. At South Deep, growth expenditure increased from R59 million (US$4 million) to R62 million (US$4 million). 
Growth expenditure on the reinvestment plan at Damang and at Gruyere amounted to US$53 million and US$37 million (A$49 million), 
respectively. Both Damang and Gruyere had no growth expenditure in the six months ended June 2016. Environmental payments increased 
from US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$10 million for the six months ended June 2017. 

Cash outflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments of US$102 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 compared with an inflow of US$60 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower profit, higher 
capital expenditure, higher taxation paid and a bigger investment into working capital. 

The US$102 million outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 comprised: US$52 million net cash generated by the eight mining 
operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$33 million of net interest paid, 
US$24 million at Salares Norte, US$60 million (A$80 million) at Gruyere [US$37 million (A$49 million) on capital expenditure and 
US$23 million (A$31 million) on working capital], as well as US$37 million on non-mine based costs mainly due to working capital 
movements. Included in the US$52 million above is US$53 million capital expenditure on the Damang reinvestment project and US$4 million 
on South Deep growth capital expenditure. 

The US$60 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprised: US$163 million net cash generated by the eight mining operations 
(after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$37 million of net interest paid, US$28 million for 
exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which is included in the US$163 million 
above) and US$38 million on non-mine based costs mainly due to working capital movements.

The difference between the US$52 million and the US$163 million net cash generated by the eight mining operations for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 and June 2016, respectively, is due to the top up tax payment of the final 2016 tax liability by the Australian 
operations, US$52 million spent on the Damang reinvestment project in 2017 and working capital movements at all the operations.

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure decreased from R682 million (US$44 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to R427 million (US$32 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to lower expenditure on fleet, reduced 
expenditure on major components and the once-off purchase of houses from Sibanye for the six months ended June 2016. 

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure increased from US$102 million to US$164 million. At Tarkwa, capital expenditure 
increased from US$91 million to US$97 million due to construction of the TSF5 (tailings storage facility). Capital expenditure at 
Damang increased from US$11 million to US$67 million mainly due to waste stripping at Amoanda pit and the Damang pit cutback with the 
commencement of the Damang reinvestment project in the six months to June 2017. US$53 million was spent on the project for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017.

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased from US$13 million to US$12 million. The majority of the 
expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings storage facility. 

At the Australia region, capital expenditure decreased by 12 per cent from A$214 million (US$157 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to A$189 million (US$142 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. At St Ives, capital expenditure increased 
marginally from A$94 million (US$69 million) to A$95 million (US$72 million). At Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure decreased from 
A$54 million (US$40 million) to A$38 million (US$29 million) due to increased decline development and higher exploration for the six 
months to June 2016. At Darlot, capital expenditure decreased from A$14 million (US$10 million) to A$9 million (US$6 million) due to 
lower exploration expenditure and at Granny Smith, capital expenditure decreased from A$51 million (US$38 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$47 million (US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to decreased capital development. 

Purchase of investments of US$60 million related to the purchase of 74,824,070 shares in Gold Road Resources (Gold Fields now holds a 
10 per cent interest) in Gold Road Resources Limited.

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$161 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$7 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016. The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 related to a drawdown of US$285 million, partially 
offset by the repayment of US$125 million on offshore and local loans. The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 related to a 
drawdown of US$422 million and proceeds on the issue of shares of US$152 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$567 million 
on offshore and local loans.

The net cash outflow for the Group of US$45 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with an inflow of US$59 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. After accounting for a positive translation adjustment of US$11 million on non-US dollar cash 
balances, the cash outflow for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was US$34 million. The cash balance at 30 June 2017 of US$493 million 
compared with US$503 million at 30 June 2016. 

ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST
The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 1 per cent from US$992 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$980 per 
ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to lower sustaining capital expenditure and higher by-product credits, partially 
offset by higher net operating costs. Total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from US$1,024 per ounce for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to US$1,103 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 for the same reasons as all-in sustaining costs, offset by 
higher non-sustaining capital expenditure due to the inclusion of US$53 million on the Damang reinvestment project and A$49 million 
(US$37 million) on the Gruyere project. 

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs increased by 6 per cent from R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per 
ounce) to R646,526 per kilogram (US$1,521 per ounce) mainly due to decreased gold sold and higher net operating costs, partially offset 
by lower sustaining capital expenditure. The total all-in cost increased by 7 per cent from R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) 
to R662,973 per kilogram (US$1,557 per ounce) due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as higher non-sustaining 
capital expenditure. 

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 5 per cent from US$1,052 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 to US$995 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased gold sold and lower net operating costs, 
partially offset by higher capital expenditure. Total all-in cost increased by 9 per cent from US$1,052 per ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,142 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining 
costs as well as non-sustaining capital expenditure of US$53 million as a result of the commencement of the Damang reinvestment project 
in the six months to June 2017. 

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 48 per cent from US$489 per ounce to US$253 per 
ounce mainly due to higher gold sold and higher by-product credits, partially offset by higher net operating costs. All-in sustaining 
costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 7 per cent from US$728 per equivalent ounce to US$677 per equivalent 
ounce due to the same reasons as above.

At the Australia region excluding the Gruyere project, all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs decreased by 3 per cent from 
A$1,265 per ounce (US$928 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$1,228 per ounce (US$924 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to higher gold sold and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by higher net operating 
costs.

Gold production decreased by 15 per cent from 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 3,710 kilograms 
(119,300 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to decreased volumes and grades. Two fatalities and three falls of ground 
impacted negatively on the March quarters production output. However, the June quarter demonstrated a significant improvement.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 797,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 780,000 tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017. The average reef grade mined decreased by 1 per cent from 5.65 grams per tonne to 5.59 grams per 
tonne. 

Total tonnes milled decreased by 15 per cent from 1.14 million tonnes to 0.97 million tonnes, mainly due to a build-up of excess broken 
stocks underground as a result of falls of ground in the March 2017 quarter when hauling ability and access to tips were restricted. 
Underground reef tonnes milled decreased by 11 per cent from 0.75 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 0.67 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Total tonnes milled for the six months ended 30 June 2017 included 81,000 tonnes of 
underground waste mined and 217,000 tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 47,900 tonnes of underground waste mined and 
346,300 tonnes of surface tailings material for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Underground reef yield decreased by 5 per cent from 
5.77 grams per tonne to 5.50 grams per tonne due to restricted hauling from high grade areas in the March quarter.

Development decreased by 7 per cent from 3,077 metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 2,853 metres for the six months ended 
30 June 2017. New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) decreased by 10 per cent from 450 metres to 407 metres. 
Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above decreased by 16 per cent from 1,901 metres to 1,604 metres, while reef 
horizon development north of wrench increased by 16 per cent from 725 metres to 843 metres. Longhole stoping volume mined increased by 
29 per cent from 301,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 387,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 
commensurate with the mines build-up strategy.

Destress mining decreased by 19 per cent from 19,845 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 16,134 square metres for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 (a change in the rib pillar design from 2016 to 2017 resulted in a change in the measurement of 
destress square metres). Destress for the year is expected to be around 37,000 square metres.

The current mine contributed 8 per cent less ore tonnes at 54 per cent of total tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017, while 
North of Wrench increased by 8 per cent and contributed 46 per cent of total ore tonnes mined for the six months ended June 2017. 
This compared with the current mine contributing 62 per cent and the North of Wrench 38 per cent, respectively, for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016.

Net operating costs increased by 2 per cent from R1,959 million (US$127 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
R1,997 million (US$151 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The increased costs were mainly due to annual salary increases 
and additional resources (employees and contractors) in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation, 
partially offset by a gold-in-process credit to cost of R63 million (US$5 million).

An operating loss of R33 million (US$3 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with an operating profit of R668 million 
(US$43 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This was mainly due to the 14 per cent (616 kilograms) decrease in gold sold, 
partially offset by a 13 per cent weaker rand gold price.

Capital expenditure decreased by 37 per cent from R682 million (US$44 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to R427 million 
(US$32 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 41 per cent from R623 million (US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
R365 million (US$28 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to lower expenditure on fleet and major components and the once 
off purchase of houses from Sibanye for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased marginally from 
R59 million (US$4 million) to R62 million (US$4 million).

All-in sustaining costs increased by 6 per cent from R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
to R646,526 per kilogram (US$1,521 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to decreased gold sold and higher net 
operating costs, partially offset by lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost increased by 7 per cent from R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
R662,973 per kilogram (US$1,557 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the same reasons as for All-in sustaining costs 
as well as higher non-sustaining capital expenditure. 

Outlook for six months to December 2017

The improved performance from the March to the June quarter is forecast to continue for the remainder of the year. This is primarily as 
a result of additional mining cuts becoming available and improved access and infrastructure capacity particularly in the higher grade 
corridors. The forecasted improvement is expected to be enabled by the debottlenecking of ore handling infrastructure as well as 
improved primary equipment availabilities and utilisation based on improved maintenance strategies. Significant focus is being placed 
on integrating and optimising the overall mining cycle including the constraining ancillary activities of secondary support and 
backfilling to improve overall productivity. There has been an improvement in compliance to mine design parameters and this is steadily 
translating into improved overall mining conditions, mining area availability and output. As a result of this, we envisage steadily 
increasing the rate of destress mining to further improve volumes and create mining stock.

to 53.3 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Ore tonnes mined increased by 23 per cent from 6.5 million tonnes to 
8.0 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 16 per cent from 16.9 million tonnes to 19.6 million tonnes while 
capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 27.6 million tonnes to 25.7 million tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 
7 per cent from 1.44 grams per tonne to 1.34 grams per tonne. The strip ratio decreased from 6.8 to 5.7. 

The CIL plant throughput increased marginally from 6.80 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 6.85 million tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to higher plant utilisation and the improved milling rate. Realised yield from the CIL plant 
increased by 2 per cent from 1.25 grams per tonne to 1.28 grams per tonne due to higher ore feed to the plant. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 1 per cent from US$156 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to US$158 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as a result of higher tonnes mined and processed, partially offset 
by a bigger build-up of stockpiles. The US$15 million build-up of stockpiles for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with 
US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Operating profit increased by 7 per cent from US$177 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$189 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 as a result of higher gold sold, partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 7 per cent from US$91 million to US$97 million mainly due to timing of construction of the TSF5 for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased marginally from US$993 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
US$989 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to higher gold sold, partially offset by higher capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 7 per cent from 71,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 76,900 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased tonnes mined and processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 93 per cent from 9.8 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
to 18.9 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the implementation of the Damang reinvestment plan in 2017.

Ore tonnes mined increased by 21 per cent from 1.4 million tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 
46 per cent from 5.0 million tonnes to 2.7 million tonnes due to the commencement of the Damang reinvestment plan which is all capital 
stripping in the main pit. Capital waste of 8.3 million tonnes was mined at Amoanda pit, 5.6 million tonnes at the Damang complex and 
0.6 million tonnes at Lima South pit for the six months ended June 2017, giving a total of 14.6 million tonnes for the six months ended 
30 June 2017. This compared with 3.4 million tonnes mined at Amoanda pit for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Head grade mined 
decreased by 13 per cent from 1.42 grams per tonne to 1.24 grams per tonne in line with the Damang reinvestment plan. The strip ratio 
increased from 6.0 to 10.4 due to higher capital waste stripped in line with the Damang reinvestment plan.

Tonnes processed increased by 14 per cent from 2.01 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 2.29 million tonnes for the 
six months ended 30 June 2017. Yield decreased by 6 per cent from 1.11 grams per tonne to 1.04 grams per tonne due to lower grade pit 
material fed and lower grade stockpiles treated. For the six months ended 30 June 2017, tonnes milled were sourced as follow:  
0.98 million tonnes at 1.40 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.37 million tonnes at 0.97 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 
0.95 million tonnes at 0.66 grams per tonne from stockpiles. This compared with 1.15 million tonnes at 1.49 grams per tonne from the 
pits and 0.86 million tonne at 0.93 grams per tonne from stockpiles for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 19 per cent from US$74 million to US$60 million mainly due to 
lower operating tonnes mined for the six months ended 30 June 2017 and a gold-in-process credit to cost of US$1 million compared with a 
charge of US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

Operating profit increased by 169 per cent from US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$35 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 due to lower net operating costs, higher gold production and higher gold price achieved. 

Capital expenditure increased by 509 per cent from US$11 million to US$67 million, with US$46 million spent on capital waste stripping 
and the balance of US$21 million spent on waste dump pre-development work, engineering projects and construction of the Far East 
Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF).

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 27 per cent from US$11 million to US$14 million, while US$53 million was spent on the 
Damang reinvestment plan. 

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 19 per cent from US$1,260 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,017 per ounce 
for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold sold, partially offset by higher sustaining 
capital expenditure.

All-in costs increased by 35 per cent from US$1,260 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$1,702 per ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017 due to no growth capital in 2016.

Gold production decreased by 1 per cent from 70,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 69,900 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017. Copper production decreased by 2 per cent from 14,693 tonnes to 14,431 tonnes. Equivalent gold production increased 
by 7 per cent from 127,500 ounces to 137,000 ounces. Gold head grade decreased from 0.96 grams per tonne to 0.95 grams per tonne and 
copper head grade remained similar at 0.50 per cent. Gold recoveries increased from 67.4 per cent to 69.7 per cent mainly due to 
optimisation of the flotation feed size to maximise recoveries whilst maintaining throughput at acceptable levels. Copper recoveries 
increased from 86.7 per cent to 88.4 per cent. Gold yield increased from 0.65 grams per tonne to 0.66 grams per tonne and copper yield 
increased from 0.43 per cent to 0.44 per cent. 

For the six months ended 30 June 2017, concentrate with a payable content of 70,156 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of 
US$1,239 per ounce and 14,138 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,119 per tonne, net of treatment and refining 
charges. This compared with 66,847 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,220 per ounce and 13,877 tonnes of copper 
that was sold at an average price of US$4,021 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 
Total equivalent gold sales increased by 13 per cent from 120,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 135,700 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to the higher price factor and higher recoveries as explained above.


Total tonnes mined decreased by 3 per cent from 7.56 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 7.31 million tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 in line with the mine sequencing. Ore mined decreased by 1 per cent from 3.56 million tonnes to 
3.53 million tonnes. Waste tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 4.00 million tonnes to 3.78 million tonnes mainly due to the 
mining sequence. The strip ratio decreased from 1.13 to 1.07.

Ore processed decreased by 3 per cent from 3.53 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 3.44 million tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to lower plant throughput (810 tonnes per hour versus 832 tonnes per hour) resulting from higher 
ore hardness.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 11 per cent from US$63 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to US$70 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The higher cost was mainly due to a lower build-up of concentrate 
inventory of US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Operating profit increased by 13 per cent from US$85 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to US$96 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to the higher gold and copper content sold and higher prices, partially offset by higher net operating 
cost.

Capital expenditure decreased by 8 per cent from US$13 million to US$12 million with the majority of the expenditure on construction of 
further raises of the tailings storage facility. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 48 per cent from US$489 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
US$253 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2017. This was mainly due to higher gold sold and higher copper by-product credits, 
partially offset by higher net operating costs. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce decreased by 7 per 
cent from US$728 per equivalent ounce to US$677 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 15 per cent from 0.33 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 
0.28 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The six months ended 30 June 2016 included the final 0.05 million tonnes 
from the Athena mine. The grade mined decreased by 17 per from 5.40 grams per tonne to 4.47 grams per tonne due to the mining sequence.

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined decreased by 11 per cent from 1.88 million tonnes for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 to 1.67 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Grade mined increased by 20 per cent from 2.49 grams per 
tonne to 2.98 grams per tonne. The lower tonnes and higher grades in the six months to June 2017 were as a result of mining 
0.42 million tonnes of low grade ore (1.21 grams per tonne) from the A5 pit during the six months ended 30 June 2016. 

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 30 per cent from 4.64 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 3.26 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017 with waste mining at Invincible concentrated on the capital stripping of stages 5 and 6. 
Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 5 per cent from 15.5 million tonnes to 16.2 million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 
10.7 to 11.7. Total material movement was 4 per cent lower mainly due to the impact of the wet weather in the six months ended 
30 June 2017. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 5 per cent from 1.95 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 2.04 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Yield was similar at 2.81 grams per tonne. The higher throughput reflects a transition 
from campaign milling to full milling in 2017.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements increased by 3 per cent from A$108 million (US$79 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$111 million (US$83 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The higher net operating costs are mainly 
due to a lower gold inventory credit of A$2 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with a A$16 million 
(US$12 million) credit for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The reduced credit was partially offset by a A$10 million (US$8 million) 
reduction in mining costs on lower volumes of ore and operating waste mined.

Operating profit increased by 6 per cent from A$182 million (US$134 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$193 million 
(US$145 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to increased gold sold. 

Capital expenditure increased by 1 per cent from A$94 million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$95 million 
(US$72 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent from A$1,247 per ounce (US$915 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$1,184 per ounce (US$891 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased gold sold, 
partially offset by higher net operating costs and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 6 per cent from 109,300 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 115,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to increased ore mined and processed. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 7 per cent from 532,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 568,400 tonnes for the 
six months ended 30 June 2017 with increased production from the Waroonga mine. Ore mined from Waroonga increased from 254,000 tonnes 
at 8.15 grams per tonne to 320,000 tonnes at 7.58 grams per tonne. At New Holland, ore mined decreased from 278,000 tonnes at 
4.87 grams per tonne to 248,000 tonnes at 5.56 grams per tonne. Head grade mined increased by 4 per cent from 6.44 grams per tonne to 
6.70 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grades achieved at New Holland.

Tonnes processed increased by 10 per cent from 566,200 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 624,300 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017 due to higher tonnes available from the mines and the processing of ore stockpiled mined during the December 
2016 quarter. The combined yield decreased by 4 per cent from 6.00 grams per tonne to 5.75 grams per tonne mainly due to a 3,300 ounce 
increase in gold in circuit during the six months ended June 2017 compared to a 2,000 ounce drawdown in the six months ended 30 June 
2016.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 7 per cent from A$95 million (US$70 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$102 million (US$76 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to higher mining costs as a result 
of increased volumes mined and processed, partially offset by a gold-in-process credit to cost of A$nil million (US$nil million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2017 compared with a charge of A$4 million (US$3 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

Operating profit increased by 4 per cent from A$84 million (US$61 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$87 million 
(US$66 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to increased production, partially offset by higher net operating costs. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 30 per cent from A$54 million (US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$38 million 
(US$29 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. Capital expenditure was higher in the previous year due to a ramp up of decline 
development to the Cinderella ore body at New Holland and an exploration development drive towards Waroonga North that was largely 
completed in the corresponding period.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 12 per cent from A$1,456 per ounce (US$1,068 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$1,275 per ounce (US$960 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to higher gold sold and lower 
capital expenditure, partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 1 per cent from 143,700 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 144,700 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 due to increased tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by lower grades.

Ore mined from underground increased by 14 per cent from 763,000 tonnes to 867,000 tonnes reflecting the benefits of the mining 
improvement initiatives implemented over the past twelve months. Head grade mined decreased by 17 per cent from 6.52 grams per tonne 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 5.41 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the impact of the higher 
grade stopes in Z90 level which were mined in the six months ended 30 June 2016.

Tonnes processed increased by 19 per cent from 741,300 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 879,200 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2017. The yield decreased by 15 per cent from 6.03 grams per tonne to 5.12 grams per tonne due to lower head 
grades mined.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements increased by 15 per cent from A$92 million (US$67 million) to A$106 million 
(US$80 million) mainly due to increased mining and processing costs as a result of additional volumes. In addition, the gold-in-process 
charge to cost of A$3 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended June 2017 compared with a credit to cost of A$2 million 
(US$1 million) for the six months ended June 2016.

Operating profit decreased by 11 per cent from A$149 million (US$109 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$132 million 
(US$99 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to the lower Australian gold price (A$1,639 per ounce versus A$1,674 per 
ounce) and increased net operating costs.

Capital expenditure decreased by 8 per cent from A$51 million (US$38 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to A$47 million 
(US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The majority of the expenditure related to capital development at the Wallaby 
mine and exploration. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 4 per cent from A$1,068 per ounce (US$783 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$1,110 per ounce (US$835 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to the higher net operating

Gold production decreased by 34 per cent from 37,200 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 24,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 due to completion of mining from the higher grade Lords South Lower ore body during the six months ended 30 June 
2016 and the impact of the lower grades mined from remnant areas during the six months to June 2017 while the lower grade Oval ore body 
was brought into production over the past six months to 30 June 2017.

Ore mined from underground increased by 13 per cent from 204,800 tonnes to 232,200 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 44 per cent 
from 5.86 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 3.31 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2017. 
The increase in tonnes and lower grades was due to the inclusion of the bulk low grade Metzke stopes in 2017 compared with the higher 
grade Lords South Lower ore body in the six months ended 30 June 2016. Metzke stopes are remnants from higher up in the mine that have 
traditionally been low grade. 

Tonnes processed increased by 2 per cent from 230,100 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 to 234,700 tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017. The yield decreased by 35 per cent from 5.02 grams per tonne to 3.24 grams per tonne due to the lower head grade.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 2 per cent from A$41 million (US$30 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$40 million (US$30 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 mainly due to a decrease in mining costs. 

Operating profit decreased from A$21 million (US$15 million) to A$1 million (US$nil million) due to lower gold sold and the lower gold 
price received.

Capital expenditure decreased by 36 per cent from A$14 million (US$10 million) to A$9 million (US$6 million), mainly due to lower 
exploration expenditure in the six months ended 30 June 2017.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 31 per cent from A$1,554 per ounce (US$1,139 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 to A$2,040 per ounce (US$1,532 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2017 due to lower gold sold, partially 
offset by lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure.

HEDGES
OIL AND AUSTRALIAN GOLD PRICES HEDGES
Gold Fields has undertaken select hedging of the oil price and the Australian dollar gold price given volatility in commodity prices 
and exchange rates. 

The oil hedge comprises:
- Australia: 78 million litres at an equivalent Brent Crude swap price of US$49.92 per barrel for the period June 2017 to 
  December 2019;
- Ghana: 126 million litres at an equivalent Brent Crude swap price of US$49.80 per barrel for the period June 2017 to December 2019.

The volumes hedged represent 50 per cent of the estimated annualised fuel consumption for the two regions.

The Australian dollar gold price hedge comprises:
- 165,000 ounces with a floor price of A$1,695.86 and a cap of A$1,754.18 (averaged), for the period July 2017 to December 2017;
- 130,000 ounces at an average forward price of A$1,719.92 for the period July 2017 to December 2017.

The gold volumes hedged represent approximately 75 per cent of the expected production from the Australia region for the second half of 
2017. This hedging activity is in line with Gold Fields policy to protect cash flow at a time of significant capital expenditure. The 
Australian dollar gold price hedge is expected to protect the underlying cash flow of Gold Fields Australia, while the region is 
contributing towards the funding of the construction of the Gruyere gold project. 

COPPER HEDGE
Subsequent to quarter end, US$ copper price hedges were put in place at Cerro Corona for the 5 months from August to December 2017: 
8,250 tonnes at an average floor price of US$5,867 per tonne and an average cap price of US$6,300 per tonne.

A$500 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

On 24 May 2017, Gruyere Holdings entered into a A$500 million revolving credit facility which became available on 13 June 2017 with a 
syndicate of international banks and financial institutions at an interest rate of Australian BBSY +235 basis points. The purpose of 
this facility is to finance capital expenditure in respect of the Gruyere gold project and to fund general working capital 
requirements. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the agreement date, namely 13 June 2020.

US$100 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

On 12 June 2017, Gold Fields Ghana Limited and Abosso Goldfields Limited entered into a US$100 million senior secured revolving credit 
facility with the Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (acting through its Isle of Man branch) which became available on 17 July 2017. 
The purpose of this facility was (i) to refinance the outstanding balance of US$45 million under the US$70 million senior secured 
revolving credit facility; (ii) to finance working capital requirements; (iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) for capital 
expenditure purposes of each borrower. The final maturity date of this facility is three years from the financial close date. The 
US$70 million senior secured revolving credit facility matured on 17 July 2017.

CASH DIVIDEND
In line with the Companys dividend policy to pay out a dividend of between 25 and 35 per cent of its earnings, the Board has approved 
and declared an interim dividend number 86 of 40 SA cents per ordinary share (gross) in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2017. 
This translates to 32 per cent of normalised earnings. The interim dividend will be subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax of 20 per 
cent. In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a) (i) and 11.17(c) of the JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional information is 
disclosed:

- The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
- The local dividends withholding tax rate is 20 per cent (twenty per centum);
- The gross local dividend amount is 40 SA cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividends tax;
- The Dividend Withholding Tax of 20 per cent (twenty per centum) will be applicable to this dividend;
- The net local dividend amount is 32.000 SA cents per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay the dividends tax;
- Gold Fields currently has 821,532,707 ordinary shares in issue; and
- Gold Fields income tax number is 9160035607.

Shareholders are advised of the following dates in respect of the final dividend:

- Interim dividend number 86: 40 SA cents per share
- Last date to trade cum-dividend: Tuesday 5 September 2017
- Sterling and US dollar conversion date: Wednesday 6 September 2017
- Shares commence trading ex-dividend: Wednesday 6 September 2017
- Record date: Friday 8 September 2017
- Payment of dividend: Monday 11 September 2017
- Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 6 September 2017 and Friday, 8 September 2017, 
  both dates inclusive.

MINING CHARTER
On 15 June 2017, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) and Minister Zwane (the Minister) published the 2017 mining charter (2017 
Mining Charter). The South African Chamber of Mines (Chamber), of which Gold Fields is a member, immediately raised its concerns due to 
the lack of collaboration with its members and the mining industry as a whole. 

On 26 June 2017, the Chamber approached the High Court of South Africa requesting that an urgent interdict application be heard on 
8 July 2017 requesting an order to prohibit, amongst others, the Minister and the DMR from implementing or applying the provisions of 
the 2017 Mining Charter in any way directly or indirectly, pending the final determination of an application for judicial review and 
setting aside of the Ministers and the DMR decision to publish the 2017 Mining Charter. This matter is likely to be heard in mid-
September 2017.

The Minister has provided a written undertaking that the 2017 Mining Charter will not be implemented in any way until judgement has 
been handed down in the Chambers application for an urgent interdict. The written undertaking also provides that should the Minister 
and/or the DMR in any way endeavour to implement the 2017 Mining Charter during that period, the Chamber will be entitled to bring its 
interdict application within 48 hours.

Gold Fields supports achieving a solution that is viable to support economic growth and create a sustainable mining industry in South 
Africa in which investment is encouraged. 

Outlook for 2017

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2017 is expected to be between 2.10 million ounces and 2.15 million ounces, 
unchanged from the original guidance on 16 February 2017. AISC is expected to be between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce.
AIC for the Group is planned to increase significantly to between US$1,170 per ounce to US$1,190 per ounce due to increased project 
capital expenditure. 

The above is subject to a safety performance that limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on 
page 5.

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited condensed consolidated six monthly financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South 
Africa. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these six monthly financial statements are in terms of International Financial 
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements.

SILICOSIS AND TB CLASS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
As previously disclosed, a consolidated application has been brought against several South African mining companies, including Gold 
Fields, for certification of a class action on behalf of current or former mineworkers (and their dependants) who have allegedly 
contracted silicosis and/or tuberculosis while working for one or more of the mining companies listed in the application. 

In May 2016, the South African South Gauteng High Court ordered, among other things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a 
silicosis class; and (b) a tuberculosis class; and (2) that the common law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences 
suing for general damages and subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate of 
the deceased claimant. The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought against the mining 
companies. The Supreme Court of Appeal granted the mining companies leave to appeal against all aspects of the May 2016 judgement. 
The appeal hearing before the Supreme Court of Appeal is scheduled to be heard between 19 and 23 March 2018.

In addition to the class action, an individual silicosis-related action has been instituted against Gold Fields and one other mining 
company. Gold Fields is proceeding with trial preparation in the normal course.

Working Group

The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group was formed in fiscal 2014 to address issues relating to compensation and medical care for 
occupational lung disease in the South African gold mining industry. The Working Group, made up of African Rainbow Minerals, 
Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold, has had extensive engagements with a wide range of 
stakeholders since its formation, including government, organised labour, other mining companies and the legal representatives of 
claimants who have filed legal actions against the companies.

The Working Group remains of the view that achieving a comprehensive settlement which is both fair to past, present and future 
employees and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation.

The members of the Working Group are among respondent companies in a number of legal proceedings related to occupational lung disease, 
including the class action referred to above. These companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and 
they are defending these. The companies do, however, believe that they should work together to seek a solution to this South African 
mining industry legacy issue. The Working Group will continue with its efforts to find common ground with all stakeholders, including 
government, labour and the claimants legal representatives.

Provision raised

As a result of the ongoing work of the Working Group and engagements with affected stakeholders since 31 December 2016, it has now 
become possible for Gold Fields to reasonably estimate its share of the estimated cost in relation to the Working Group of a possible 
settlement of the class action claims and related costs. As a result, Gold Fields has provided an amount of US$30 million 
(R390 million) for this obligation in the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2017. The nominal value of this provision is 
US$40 million (R509 million). The ultimate outcome of these matters remains uncertain, with a possible failure to reach a settlement or 
to obtain the requisite court approval for a potential settlement. The provision is consequently subject to adjustment in the future, 
depending on the progress of the Working Group discussions, stakeholder engagements and the ongoing legal proceedings.

Hedging/Derivatives 
The Groups policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken as follows:
- to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
- for specific debt servicing requirements; and 
- to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

Gold production increased by 61 per cent from 1,424 kilograms (45,800 ounces) in the March quarter to 2,286 kilograms (73,500 ounces) 
in the June quarter mainly due to an increase in tonnes mined and in head grade. The June quarter demonstrated steady recovery from the 
incidents which impacted the March quarter performance.

Total underground tonnes mined increased by 13 per cent from 365,200 tonnes in the March quarter to 414,400 tonnes in the June quarter. 
In the June quarter 368,700 reef tonnes and 45,700 waste tonnes were mined. This compared with 328,400 reef tonnes and 36,800 waste 
tonnes mined in the March quarter. The average reef grade mined increased by 6 per cent from 5.43 grams per tonne to 5.73 grams per 
tonne due to the normalisation of the mining blend in the June quarter, after the impact of the falls of ground and fatalities in the 
March quarter.

Gold recovered was 175 kilograms (5,600 ounces) higher than gold broken of 2,111 kilograms (67,900 ounces) in the June quarter. The 
additional gold recovered was as a result of the locked-up underground stocks in the March quarter trammed in the June quarter, which 
also improved the reef yield. The remaining excess stocks of broken ore of 60,000 tonnes are expected to be recovered in the second 
half of 2017.

Destress mining increased by 167 per cent from 4,402 square metres in the March quarter to 11,732 square metres in the June quarter 
(a change in the rib pillar design from 2016 to 2017 resulted in a change in the measurement of destress square metres). 

Longhole stoping increased by 26 per cent from 171,000 tonnes to 216,000 tonnes. The current mine contributed 48 per cent of the ore 
tonnes in the June quarter, compared with 64 per cent in the March quarter. The longhole stoping method accounted for 52 per cent of 
total tonnes mined in the June quarter compared with 47 per cent in the March quarter. These ratio changes are consistent with the 
mines build-up strategy. 

Development increased by 6 per cent from 1,383 metres in the March quarter to 1,471 metres in the June quarter. New mine capital 
development increased by 8 per cent from 195 metres in the March quarter to 211 metres in the June quarter. New mine development is 
focused on infrastructure projects on 100 level and related to extending haulages, conveyor belts and completing crusher excavations. 
Development in the reef horizon current mine areas decreased by 6 per cent from 827 metres to 777 metres. Reef horizon development 
North of Wrench increased by 34 per cent from 361 metres to 483 metres.

Total tonnes milled increased by 19 per cent from 443,000 tonnes to 526,000 tonnes due to an increase in underground material milled. 
Underground reef tonnes milled increased by 45 per cent from 274,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 397,000 tonnes in the June quarter. 
Total tonnes milled in the June quarter included 47,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 82,000 tonnes of surface 
tailings material. This compared with 34,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 135,000 tonnes of surface tailings 
material in the March quarter. Underground reef yield increased by 11 per cent from 5.16 grams per tonne to 5.74 grams per tonne. 

Net operating costs increased by 13 per cent from R939 million (US$71 million) to R1,057 million (US$80 million) mainly due to higher 
production and a lower gold-in-process credit of R8 million (US$1 million) in the June quarter compared with a credit of R55 million 
(US$4 million) in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 45 per cent from R174 million (US$13 million) in the March quarter to R253 million (US$19 million) in 
the June quarter. 

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 42 per cent from R151 million (US$11 million) in the March quarter to R214 million 
(US$16 million) in the June quarter mainly due to fleet purchases. Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased by 70 per cent from 
R23 million (US$2 million) to R39 million (US$3 million). The higher non-sustaining capital expenditure was mainly due to increased 
expenditure on new mine development infrastructure projects.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 25 per cent from R761,867 per kilogram (US$1,784 per ounce) in the March quarter to R573,127 per 
kilogram (US$1,352 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher net operating costs and 
higher sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost decreased by 24 per cent from R777,497 per kilogram (US$1,821 per ounce) in the March quarter to R590,093 per 
kilogram (US$1,389 per ounce) in the June quarter due to the same reasons as for All-in sustaining costs, as well as higher non-
sustaining capital expenditure.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 2 per cent from 26.4 million tonnes in the March quarter to 27.0 million 
tonnes in the June quarter due to improved drill rig availability and blasted stocks. Ore tonnes mined increased by 13 per cent from 
3.8 million tonnes to 4.3 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 9.6 million tonnes to 
10.0 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 13.0 million tonnes to 12.7 million tonnes. Grade 
mined decreased from 1.34 grams per tonne to 1.33 grams per tonne. The strip ratio decreased from 6.0 to 5.3. 
The CIL plant throughput decreased by 3 per cent from 3.5 million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.4 million tonnes in the June quarter 
due to a change out of a SAG mill pinion. Realised yield increased by 6 per cent from 1.24 grams per tonne to 1.31 grams per tonne due 
to higher grade feed.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 3 per cent from US$78 million to US$80 million mainly due to an 
increase in operating tonnes mined, partially offset by a US$8 million gold-in-process credit in the June quarter compared with 
US$7 million in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 6 per cent from US$50 million to US$47 million due to timing of expenditure on drill rigs and other 
fleet refurbishments in the March quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 4 per cent from US$1,010 per ounce in the March quarter to US$969 per ounce 
in the June quarter due to higher gold sold and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 15 per cent from 35,800 ounces in the March quarter to 41,100 ounces in the June quarter mainly due to 
higher head grade processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 3 per cent from 9.6 million tonnes in the March quarter to 9.3 million 
tonnes in the June quarter due to challenges with wet weather conditions in oxide mining areas in the Damang pit cutback and Amoanda 
pit. Ore tonnes mined increased by 23 per cent from 0.74 million tonnes in the March quarter to 0.91 million tonnes in the 
June quarter. Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 8.9 million tonnes to 8.4 million tonnes. Capital waste tonnes 
(included in total waste tonnes) increased by 4 per cent from 7.1 million tonnes to 7.4 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes 
decreased by 44 per cent from 1.8 million tonnes to 1.0 million tonnes. Head grade mined increased by 19 per cent from 1.13 grams 
per tonne to 1.34 grams per tonne. The higher grade in the June quarter was due to an increase in ore mined at the higher grade Amoanda 
pit. In the June quarter Amoanda pit mined 0.61 million tonnes at 1.59 grams per tonne compared with 0.33 million tonnes mined at 
1.25 grams per tonne in the March quarter. The strip ratio decreased from 11.8 to 9.3.

Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 1.17 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.12 million tonnes in the June quarter. 
Yield increased by 20 per cent from 0.95 grams per tonne to 1.14 grams per tonne due to higher grade feed. The higher grade feed was 
largely driven by increased volumes of higher grade material treated from the Amoanda pit. In the June quarter, tonnes milled were 
sourced as follows: 0.66 million tonnes at 1.63 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.14 million tonnes at 0.78 grams per tonne from Abosso 
tailings and 0.32 million tonnes at 0.61 grams per tonne from stockpiles. The remaining Abosso tailings and stockpiles are 
approximately 0.19 million tonnes at 0.98 grams per tonne and 0.51 million tonnes at 0.67 grams per tonne, respectively.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 7 per cent from US$29 million to US$31 million. This was mainly 
due to a gold-in-process charge to cost of US$nil million in the June quarter compared with a credit of US$2 million in the 
March quarter. 

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 60 per cent from US$10 million to US$4 million. Non-sustaining capital expenditure 
increased by 60 per cent from US$20 million to US$32 million mainly due to the commencement of construction of the Far East Tailings 
Storage Facility (FETSF) in the June quarter as well as increased capital waste mined. 

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 21 per cent from US$1,142 per ounce in the March quarter to US$906 per ounce in the June quarter 
mainly due to increased gold sold and a reduction in sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by an increase in net operating 
costs. All-in costs decreased by 1 per cent from US$1,709 per ounce in the March quarter to US$1,692 per ounce in the June quarter due 
to the same reasons as for All-in sustaining costs as well as an increase in non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 7 per cent from 33,800 ounces in the March quarter to 36,100 ounces in the June quarter. Copper production 
decreased by 1 per cent from 7,267 tonnes to 7,165 tonnes. Equivalent gold production decreased marginally from 68,700 ounces to 68,400 
ounces. The increase in gold production was mainly due to higher head grade and the decrease in copper production was mainly due to 
lower head grade, in line with the mining sequence. Gold head grade increased by 10 per cent from 0.90 grams per tonne to 0.99 grams 
per tonne and copper head grade decreased by 2 per cent from 0.50 per cent to 0.49 per cent. Gold and copper head grades for the year 
are expected to be around 1.03 grams per tonne to 1.05 grams per tonne and 0.48 per cent to 0.50 per cent, respectively. Gold 
recoveries decreased from 71.0 per cent to 68.5 per cent. Copper recoveries increased from 87.9 per cent to 88.8 per cent. Gold yield 
increased by 6 per cent from 0.64 grams per tonne to 0.68 grams per tonne and copper yield decreased by 2 per cent from 0.44 per cent 
to 0.43 per cent. 

In the June quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 36,300 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,255 per ounce and 
7,447 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$4,998 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This compared with 
33,900 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,221 per ounce and 6,691 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average 
price of US$5,254 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the March quarter. 

Total tonnes mined increased by 31 per cent from 3.16 million tonnes in the March quarter to 4.14 million tonnes in the June quarter 
mainly due to higher waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined increased by 3 per cent from 1.74 million tonnes to 
1.79 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 65 per cent from 1.42 million tonnes to 2.35 million tonnes mainly 
with the impact of the rainy season in the March quarter behind us.

Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.71 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.74 million tonnes in the June quarter mainly 
due to higher plant utilisation (97 per cent in the June quarter compared to 95 per cent in the March quarter), resulting from a 
reschedule of the planned plant shutdown with no impact on the plant utilisation plan for 2017.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 19 per cent from US$32 million to US$38 million mainly due to a 
US$2 million gold-in-process charge to cost in the June quarter compared with a US$3 million credit in the March quarter. 

Capital expenditure increased by 40 per cent from US$5 million to US$7 million due to an increase in construction activities at the 
tailings dam and waste storage facilities following from the end of the rainy season.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce increased by 222 per cent from US$118 per ounce in the March quarter to 
US$380 per ounce in the June quarter mainly due to higher net operating costs and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by 
increased gold sold. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 16 per cent from US$626 per 
equivalent ounce to US$724 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

Gold production increased by 26 per cent from 81,600 ounces in the March quarter to 102,600 ounces in the June quarter due to increased 
tonnes mined and processed, as well as higher grade mined from the open pits. 

At the underground operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 1 per cent from 142,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 143,000 tonnes in 
the June quarter. Head grade decreased by 17 per cent from 4.87 grams per tonne to 4.06 grams per tonne due to the mining schedule. 

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 13 per cent from 785,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 886,000 tonnes in the 
June quarter. The increased tonnes were the result of eighteen days of production lost due to inclement weather and resultant wet 
conditions during the March quarter. Grade mined increased by 25 per cent from 2.63 grams per tonne to 3.28 grams per tonne with ore 
production focused on a high grade portion of the Invincible pit in line with the mining schedule.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 43 per cent from 2.1 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.2 million tonnes in the 
June quarter and capital waste tonnes mined increased by 57 per cent from 6.3 million tonnes to 9.9 million tonnes reflecting a change 
from the removal of operating waste to removal of pre-strip. Total material movements at the open pits increased by 32 per cent from 
9.2 million tonnes to 12.0 million tonnes, with the lower tonnes in the March quarter due to inclement weather. The strip ratio 
increased from 10.7 to 12.5. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 5 per cent from 995,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 1,040,000 tonnes in the June quarter 
due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown in the March quarter. Yield increased by 20 per cent from 2.55 grams per tonne to 3.07 grams 
per tonne due to higher grades mined at the open pits and higher volumes mined and processed thereby reducing the quantity of low grade 
stockpiled material processed in the June quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 29 per cent from A$65 million (US$49 million) to A$46 million 
(US$35 million) due to decreased operational waste mining in the open pits and a gold inventory credit to cost of A$5 million 
(US$4 million) in the June quarter compared with a charge of A$3 million (US$2 million) in the March quarter. 

Capital expenditure increased by 74 per cent from A$35 million (US$26 million) to A$61 million (US$45 million) mainly due to increased 
pre-stripping at Invincible and Neptune pits.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 14 per cent from A$1,280 per ounce (US$966 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,107 per ounce (US$831 per ounce) in the June quarter due to increased gold sold and lower net operating costs, partially offset

Ore mined from underground decreased by 11 per cent from 301,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 268,000 tonnes in the June quarter 
mainly due to lower than planned ore tonnes from New Holland. Head grade mined increased by 13 per cent from 6.31 grams per tonne to 
7.13 grams per tonnes due to higher grades from both Waroonga and New Holland. 

Tonnes processed increased by 3 per cent from 308,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 316,000 tonnes in the June quarter with the mill 
operating at capacity. The combined yield decreased by 5 per cent from 5.89 grams per tonne to 5.62 grams per tonne due to an increase 
of 2,900 ounces of gold-in-circuit in the June quarter and the processing of more lower grade stockpiles in the June quarter. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 4 per cent from A$52 million (US$39 million) in the March 
quarter to A$50 million (US$37 million) in the June quarter mainly due to a gold-in-circuit credit to cost of A$1 million

Capital expenditure increased by 5 per cent from A$19 million (US$14 million) to A$20 million (US$15 million) mainly due to increased 
exploration expenditure.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent from A$1,268 per ounce (US$957 per ounce) in the March quarter to 
A$1,283 per ounce (US$964 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due to decreased gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially

Ore mined from underground increased by 9 per cent from 415,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 451,000 tonnes in the June quarter due 
to increased stope availability and efficiencies. Head grade mined increased by 18 per cent from 4.94 grams per tonne in the March 
quarter to 5.84 grams per tonne in the June quarter as mining in lower grade areas was completed and the sequence returned to more 
typical Granny Smith grades.

Tonnes processed decreased by 9 per cent from 461,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 418,000 tonnes in the June quarter due to a 
milling campaign which ended early in June. The yield increased by 12 per cent from 4.85 grams per tonne to 5.42 grams per tonne 
reflecting the higher grades mined.  

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 11 per cent from A$56 million (US$42 million) in the March 
quarter to A$50 million (US$38 million) in the June quarter mainly due to a gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million 
(US$2 million) in the June quarter compared with a charge of A$5 million (US$4 million) in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$23 million (US$18 million). 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 7 per cent from A$1,153 per ounce (US$871 per ounce) in the March quarter to 
A$1,067 per ounce (US$799 per ounce) in the June quarter due to the higher gold sold and lower net operating costs.

Gold production decreased by 21 per cent from 13,700 ounces in the March quarter to 10,800 ounces in the June quarter due to lower 
volumes and grades mined. 

Ore mined from underground decreased by 4 per cent from 118,400 tonnes in the March quarter to 113,700 tonnes in the June quarter due 
to lower than planned mobile fleet availability and a higher number of loader breakdowns. Head grade mined decreased by 33 per cent 
from 3.95 grams per tonne to 2.63 grams per tonne due to thinner ore body widths. A number of stopes also experienced increased 
dilution due to localised geotechnical failures associated with intersecting fault planes in the hanging walls. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 120,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 115,000 tonnes in the June quarter due to 
decreased ore mined. The yield decreased by 18 per cent from 3.55 grams per tonne to 2.92 grams per tonne due to the lower grades 
mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, were similar at A$20 million (US$15 million).

Capital expenditure decreased by 50 per cent from A$6 million (US$4 million) to A$3 million (US$2 million) mainly due to lower 
development and infrastructure works associated with the Oval ore body. Decline development towards the Oval ore body was completed 
during the June quarter. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent from A$1,899 per ounce (US$1,434 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$2,208 per ounce (US$1,657 per ounce) in the June quarter due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.

MEDIA RELEASE

Trading statement for six months to 30 June 2017

Johannesburg, 27 July 2017: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that earnings per share (EPS) for the six
months ended 30 June 2017 (H1 2017) are expected to be 43-57%
(US$0.06-0.08) lower than the US$0.14 per share reported for the
six months ended 30 June 2016 (H1 2016), at US$0.06-0.08 per
share. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for H1 2017 are
expected to be 38-50% (US$0.06-0.08) lower than the US$0.16 per
share reported for H1 2016, at US$0.08-0.10 per share.

In addition, normalised earnings for the period are expected to be
15-31% (US$0.02-0.04) lower than the US$0.13 per share reported
for H1 2016 at US$0.09-0.11 per share.

The decreases in EPS, HEPS and normalised earnings are mainly
due to the impact of stronger exchange rates on converting local
currency costs to US dollars and an increase in amortisation. The
higher amortisation relates mainly to Tarkwa as a result of lower
reserve ounces (as reported on 28 March 2017) and an increase in
ore mined and stockpiled. In addition, EPS and HEPS are impacted
by non-recurring items, including the silicosis provision as detailed
below.

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q2 2017 is expected to be
550koz (Q1 2017: 497koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of
US$949/oz (Q1 2017: US$1,016/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of
US$1,092/oz (Q1 2017: US$1,114/oz).

For H1 2017, attributable gold equivalent production is expected to
be 1,047koz (H1 2016: 1,044koz), with AISC of US$980/oz (H1
2016: US$992/oz) and AIC of US$1,103/oz (H1 2016: US$1,024/oz).

As previously disclosed, a consolidated application was brought against several South African mining
companies, including Gold Fields, for certification of a class action on behalf of current or former
mineworkers (and their dependents) who have allegedly contracted silicosis and/or tuberculosis while
working for one or more of the mining companies listed in the application.

In May 2016, the South African South Gauteng High Court ordered, among other things: (1) the
certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class; and (b) a tuberculosis class; and (2) that the common
law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and
subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate
of the deceased claimant. The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases
brought against the mining companies. The Supreme Court of Appeal granted the mining companies
leave to appeal against all aspects of the May 2016 judgement. The appeal hearing before the
Supreme Court of Appeal is scheduled to be heard between 19 and 23 March 2018.

In addition to the class action, an individual silicosis-related action has been instituted against Gold
Fields and one other mining company. Gold Fields is proceeding with trial preparation in the normal
course.

Working Group

The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group was formed in fiscal 2014 to address issues relating to
compensation and medical care for occupational lung disease in the South African gold mining
industry. The Working Group, made up of African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold
Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold, has had extensive engagements with a wide range
of stakeholders since its formation, including government, organised labour, other mining companies
and the legal representatives of claimants who have filed legal actions against the companies.

The Working Group, remains of the view that achieving a comprehensive settlement which is both fair
to past, present and future employees and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted
litigation.

The members of the Working Group are among respondent companies in a number of legal
proceedings related to occupational lung disease, including the class action referred to above. These
companies do not believe that they are liable in respect of the claims brought, and they are defending
these. The companies do, however, believe that they should work together to seek a solution to this
South African mining industry legacy issue. The Working Group will continue with its efforts to find
common ground with all stakeholders, including government, labour and the claimants legal
representatives.

Provision raised

As a result of the ongoing work of the Working Group and engagements with affected stakeholders
since 31 December 2016, it has now become possible for Gold Fields to reasonably estimate its share
of the estimated cost in relation to the Working Group of a possible settlement of the class action
claims and related costs. As a result, Gold Fields has provided an amount of US$30.2m (R390m) for
this obligation in the Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2017. The nominal value of this
provision is US$39.5m (R509m). The ultimate outcome of these matters remains uncertain, with a
possible failure to reach a settlement or to obtain the requisite court approval for a potential settlement.
The provision is consequently subject to adjustment in the future, depending on the progress of the
Working Group discussions, stakeholder engagements and the ongoing legal proceedings.

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been reviewed, and
reported on, by the Companys external auditors.
Gold Fields will release H1 2017 financial results on Thursday, 17 August 2017.

Gold Fields hedges oil and Australian gold prices


Johannesburg, 20 June 2017: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE:
GFI) has undertaken select hedging of the oil price and the Australian
dollar gold price given recent volatility in commodity prices and exchange
rates.

The oil hedge comprises:
   - Australia: 78m litres at an equivalent Brent Crude swap price of
     US$49.92/bbl for the period June 2017 to December 2019
   - Ghana: 126m litres at an equivalent Brent Crude swap price of
     US$49.80/bbl for the period June 2017 to December 2019

The volumes hedged represent 50% of the annualised fuel consumption for the
two regions.

The Australian dollar gold price hedge comprises:
   - 165,000oz with a floor price of A$1,695.86 and a cap of A$1,754.18
     (averaged), for the period July 2017 to December 2017
   - 130,000oz at an average forward price of A$1,719.92, for the period
     July 2017 to December 2017

The gold volumes hedged represent approximately 75% of the          expected
production from the Australia region for the second half of 2017.

This hedging activity is in line with Gold Fields policy to protect cash
flow at a time of significant expenditure. The Australian dollar gold price
hedge will protect the underlying cash flow of Gold Fields Australia, while
it is funding the construction of the Gruyere gold project.

Statement by Nick Holland
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

Q1 2017 OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Gold Fields had a slow start to 2017, with two fatalities at South Deep during the quarter and significant rain events which impacted
open pit operations in Australia. While we have made good progress on safety across the Group, these incidents are tragic reminders
that we still have more work to do. Our sincere condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Bekwayo and Mr Mehlwana.

Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 3% lower YoY (12% lower QoQ) at 497koz. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were
6% higher YoY (12% higher QoQ) at US$1,016/oz and all-in costs (AIC) were 13% higher YoY (18% higher QoQ) at US$1,114/oz. The average
US$ gold price achieved in the quarter was 2% higher YoY (2% higher QoQ) at US$1,216/oz. The average Australian dollar for the quarter
was 0.75 (4% weaker YoY and similar QoQ), while the average South African rand for the quarter was 13.27 (16% weaker YoY and 4%
stronger QoQ).

At South Deep production was negatively impacted by the two fatal accidents and three falls of ground in the higher grade section of
the mine which has resulted in a deferral of mining higher grade areas. Consequently, gold production was 1,424kg (45.8koz), down 28%
YoY (43% down QoQ). All-in costs (AIC) were 26% higher YoY (56% higher QoQ) at R777,497/kg (US$1,821/oz). The challenges during the
quarter impacted tramming activities at the mine, which resulted in a more severe impact on gold production than on gold broken. Gold
broken during the quarter was 1,784kg (57.4koz), 360kg higher than gold recovered, but around 300kg (9.6koz) lower than what it needed
to be to track guidance for the year. The build-up of excess broken stocks underground is expected to be recovered in the next two
quarters while access to the higher grade areas to recover the gold deferred is expected in the June quarter. In line with the recently
announced rebase plan, ground support standards are being strengthened, where required, to reduce the risks of falls of ground and the
resultant impact on operations. Despite the slow start, the full year guidance for South Deep remains unchanged.

Managed production in Ghana for Q1 2017 was 174.5koz, down 4% YoY (down 5% QoQ), with AIC of US$1,153/oz, up 12% YoY (up 17% QoQ), as
spending on the Damang reinvestment project commenced during the quarter. Gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona was 9% higher YoY
(16% lower QoQ) at 68.7koz, with AIC of US$626 per equivalent ounce, down 12% YoY (down 7% QoQ).

The Australian region produced 225.4koz for the quarter, flat YoY (down 6% QoQ), with AIC of A$1,335/oz (US$1,007/oz), up 6% YoY (up
10% QoQ). With Darlot in a sales process it is now considered a discontinuing operation. Consequently, production from continuing
operations for the quarter was 211.7koz at AIC of A$1,299 (US$979/oz).

Net cash flow and net debt
Due to the higher capital expenditure, driven by growth capital expenditure at Damang (US$20m), Gruyere (US$10m), Salares Norte
(US$12m) and South Deep (US$2m) the net cash flow from operating activities (net of tax) less net capital expenditure, environmental
payments and financing costs for the quarter was an outflow of US$35m, compared to an inflow of US$26m in Q1 2016. If we exclude the
growth capital expenditure of US$44m, then the net cash flow would have been an inflow of US$9m. As a result of the net outflow and the
final dividend payment, the net debt balance increased to US$1,241m during the quarter (31 December 2016: US$1,166m). Net debt to
EBITDA was 1.04x.
UPDATE ON PROJECTS

Damang
The Damang Re-Investment Project commenced on 23 December 2016 with two major mining contractors operating in the Damang complex and
satellite pit areas. The majority of mining equipment is on site, with the remainder expected by the end of April. Total tonnes mined
for Q1 was 9.61Mt (plan 7.34Mt). The project is expected to deliver approximately 36Mt (plan 33Mt) in 2017 due to increased
productivities with the key focus on capital waste stripping. Construction of the 2.5m lift on the existing East Tailings Storage
Facility (ETSF) has been completed and commissioned with capacity of 2.2Mt till Q4 2017. The Far East Tailings Storage Facility
(FETSF) construction (a new storage capacity required in Q4 that will provide life of mine tailings capacity requirements) has
commenced. Expenditure for the quarter amounted to US$20m with the forecast for the year on budget at US$120m.

Gruyere
As previously reported, the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum granted approval in February 2017 for the Project
Management Plan, Mining Proposal and Mine Closure Plan. Preferred tenderers for the major contracts including bulk earthworks, EPC
and power supply were confirmed during the quarter. The 288-room Gruyere Village Stage 1 was commissioned in March and earthworks for
the Gruyere Village Stage 2 site have also been completed. The complete 648-room Gruyere Village is expected to be ready for occupancy
by end of May 2017. Construction of the Anne Beadell borefield, which will support early construction activities and supply of potable
water to the camp, has commenced. Expenditure for the quarter amounted to A$14m (US$10m) with the forecast for the year on budget at
A$153m (US$112m).

FY17 GUIDANCE INTACT

Attributable equivalent gold production for 2017 is expected to be between 2.10 million ounces and 2.15 million ounces, with AISC of
between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce. As previously guided, due to the increased project capital spend, AIC is expected
to be between US$1,170 per ounce to US$1,190 per ounce.

DIRECTOR APPOINTMENT

On 3 March 2017, Gold Fields announced the appointment of Dr Carmen Letton as an independent non-executive director to its Board of
directors with effect from 1 May 2017. Dr Letton is head of open pit mining for Anglo American. She has over 30 years experience in
leadership and technical roles, both in the Australian and the international mining environment.

APPOINTMENT OF EVP: SOUTH AFRICA

We are pleased to announce the appointment of Martin Preece as EVP: South Africa, effective 2 May 2017. Martin was previously the
Chief Operating Officer at De Beers Consolidated Mines and has spent more than 30 years in diamond mining at De Beers, with extensive
experience in massive mechanised underground mining. We believe that his experience will help drive South Deep to become an efficient,
sustainable mechanised mine.

South Deep regrettably had two fatal accidents during the March quarter. Mr Bekwayo, a    dump truck operator and Mr Mehlwana, a
locomotive operator lost their lives in tramming related incidents. The fatal accident    on 1 January 2017 affected access to mining
areas and hauling ability. Loss of access to both tips in the high grade 3 West section   and the main workshop on 93 level, restricted
hauling activities until 11 March. The fatal accident on 16 February 2017 affected rail   bound tramming on 95 level for 6 days.

Gold production decreased by   43 per cent from 2,516 kilograms (80,900 ounces) in the December quarter to 1,424 kilograms (45,800
ounces) in the March quarter   mainly due to a decrease in tonnes mined and in head grade. Approximately 300 kilograms (9,600 ounces)
were lost as a result of the   fatal accidents. Another approximately 350 kilograms (11,300 ounces) were lost due to falls of ground.
Over and above these factors   the March quarter is characterised by the extended Christmas break, which is typical of South African
based mines.

Three incidents of falls of ground occurred in the thinner more proximal part of the ore body. The first one was due to risks posed by
the secondary extraction of drifts. The second one was due to proximity to the lavas in the hanging wall. The third one was due to set
collapses caused by an equipment collision. The net effect of these events was that certain high grade areas were rendered temporarily
unavailable. In addition, the planned rehabilitation of reef ore-passes due to scaling, reduced ore-pass availability during the
quarter.

The fatal accidents, falls of ground and the extended Christmas break impacted destress mining, longhole stoping and development.

Total underground tonnes mined decreased by 26 per cent from 495,400 tonnes in the December quarter to 365,200 tonnes in the March
quarter. The average grade mined decreased by 7 per cent from 5.23 grams per tonne to 4.89 grams per tonne due to the temporary loss of
high grade areas.

Gold broken during the quarter amounted to 1,784 kilograms (57,400 ounces), 360 kilograms (11,600 ounces) higher than gold recovered.
The build-up of excess broken stocks underground, is expected to be recovered in the next two quarters while access to the higher grade
areas to recover the gold deferred is expected in the June quarter.

Destress mining decreased by 28 per cent from 6,148 square metres in the December quarter to 4,402 square metres in the March quarter
due to the same reasons above as well as a temporary slowing down of destress mining as a precautionary measure as a result of
intersections of geological features.

Longhole stoping decreased by 32 per cent from 252,000 tonnes to 171,000 tonnes due to the same reasons as above. The current mine (95
level and above) contributed 64 per cent of the ore tonnes in the March quarter, compared with 63 per cent in the December quarter.
The longhole stoping method accounted for 47 per cent of total tonnes mined in the March quarter compared with 51 per cent in the
December quarter.

Development decreased by 25 per cent from 2,043 metres in the December quarter to 1,526 metres in the March quarter due to same reasons
as above. New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) decreased by 7 per cent from 210 metres in the December quarter to 195
metres in the March quarter. Development in the current mine areas decreased by 27 per cent from 1,833 metres to 1,331 metres.
Remedial action in the form of increased ore-body definition-drilling will be implemented to enhance information on geotechnical
structures, together with a revised support strategy and mining sequence to facilitate improved extraction and increase the ability to
prevent falls of ground.

Underground reef tonnes milled decreased by 40 per cent from 455,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 274,000 tonnes in the March
quarter. Total tonnes milled decreased by 22 per cent from 565,000 tonnes to 443,000 tonnes due to a decrease in underground material
milled. Total tonnes milled in the March quarter included 34,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 135,000 tonnes of
surface tailings material. This compared with 35,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 75,000 tonnes of surface
tailings material in the December quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by 6 per cent from 5.51 grams per tonne to 5.16 grams per
tonne.

Net operating costs decreased by 7 per cent from R1,012 million (US$73 million) to R939 million (US$71 million) mainly due to lower
production. A gold-in-process credit of R55 million (US$4 million) in the March quarter compared with R11 million (US$1 million) in
the December quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 24 per cent from R228 million (US$17 million) in the December quarter to R174 million (US$13 million)
in the March quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 25 per cent from R200 million (US$15 million) in the quarter to R151 million (US$11
million) in the March quarter. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 18 per cent from R28 million (US$2 million) to R23
million (US$2 million). The lower sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditure were mainly due to a slow start after the December
break.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 56 per cent from R488,534 per kilogram (US$1,097 per ounce) in the December quarter to R761,867
per kilogram (US$1,784 per ounce) in the March quarter mainly due to decreased gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs
and lower sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost increased by 56 per cent from R499,954 per kilogram (US$1,122 per ounce) in the December quarter to R777,497 per
kilogram (US$1,821 per ounce) in the March quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs, partially offset by lower
non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 145,900 ounces in the December quarter to 138,700 ounces in the March quarter due to lower yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 8 per cent from 24.5 million tonnes in the December quarter to 26.4 million tonnes in the March quarter.
Ore tonnes mined decreased by 10 per cent from 4.2 million tonnes to 3.8 million tonnes due to more focus on waste stripping to expose ore to be mined in future
quarters. Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 22 per cent from 7.9 million tonnes to 9.6 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined increased by 5 per cent
from 12.4 million tonnes to 13.0 million tonnes. Grade mined decreased marginally from 1.35 grams per tonne to 1.34 grams per tonne. The strip ratio increased from 5.3
to 6.0.

The CIL plant throughput increased by 6 per cent from 3.3 million tonnes in the December quarter to 3.5 million tonnes in the March quarter due to higher plant
utilisation and improved milling rate. Realised yield decreased by 9 per cent from 1.36 grams per tonne to 1.24 grams per tonne due to lower grades mined and an
increase in gold-in-process.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 5 per cent from US$82 million to US$78 million mainly due to a decrease in power costs and fuel
price. The lower power costs were as a result of partially moving off the transmission grid to Genser (an independent power producer).

Capital expenditure increased by 22 per cent from US$41 million to US$50 million due to mining fleet replacements and component replacements in the March quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 11 per cent from US$906 per ounce in the December quarter to US$1,010 per ounce in the March quarter due to
higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating cost.

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 36,900 ounces in the December quarter to 35,800 ounces in the March quarter mainly due to
lower head grade processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 129 per cent from 4.2 million tonnes in the December quarter to 9.6
million tonnes in the March quarter due to accelerated waste mining from Amoanda and Damang Pit Cutback (DPCB) with the commencement of
the Damang Re-investment Project. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 9 per cent from 0.82 million tonnes in the December quarter to 0.74
million tonnes in the March quarter. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 162 per cent from 3.4 million tonnes to 8.9 million tonnes.
Capital waste tonnes (included in total waste tonnes) increased by 689 per cent from 0.9 million tonnes to 7.1 million tonnes.
Operational waste tonnes decreased by 32 per cent from 2.5 million tonnes to 1.8 million tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 7 per
cent from 1.22 grams per tonne to 1.13 grams per tonne. The higher grade in the December quarter was due to around 0.17 million tonnes
at 1.41 grams per tonne mined from Juno 3 and 0.16 million tonnes at 1.20 grams per tonne from Abosso tails. This compared with no Juno
3 material and 0.37 million tonnes of Abosso tails material at 1.05 grams per tonne in the March quarter. The strip ratio increased
from 4.2 to 11.8.

Abosso tailings is a decommissioned tailings storage facility at Damang. The tailings dam has been drilled, assayed, modelled and
optimised. The economic portion of the tailings dam is being mined to supplement plant feed from the pits and other surface stockpiles.

At the end of the March quarter the remaining ore tonnes at Abosso tailings amounted to 0.34 million tonnes at 0.89 grams per tonne and
the balance on the main stockpile amounted to 0.69 million tonnes at 0.67 grams per tonne.

Tonnes processed increased by 4 per cent from 1.13 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.17 million tonnes in the March quarter.
Yield decreased by 7 per cent from 1.02 grams per tonne to 0.95 grams per tonne due to lower grade feed. The lower grade feed was
largely driven by treating lower grade material from the stockpiles. In addition, the ex-pit grade feed was lower than in the December
quarter. In the March quarter tonnes milled were sourced as follows: 0.32 million tonnes at 1.27 grams per tonne from the pits, 0.23
million tonnes at 1.08 grams per tonne from Abosso tailings and 0.62 million tonnes at 0.69 grams per tonne from stockpiles.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 17 per cent from US$35 million to US$29 million. This was mainly
due to a decrease in operating tonnes mined, a decrease in power costs as a result of totally moving off the transmission grid to
Genser and a US$2 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the March quarter compared with a US$1 million charge to cost in the
December quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 173 per cent from US$11 million to US$9 million. Non-sustaining capital expenditure
increased from US$nil to US$20 million mainly due to 7.1 million tonnes of capital waste stripped in the March quarter compared with
0.9 million tonnes stripped in the December quarter.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 13 per cent from US$1,317 per ounce in the December quarter to US$1,142 per ounce in the March
quarter mainly due to lower net operating cost and lower sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold. All-in
costs increased by 30 per cent from US$1,317 per ounce in the December quarter to US$1,709 per ounce in the March quarter due to the
same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs as well as non-sustaining (growth) capital expenditure of US$20 million. There was no
growth capital in the December quarter.

Gold production decreased by 24 per cent from 44,600 ounces in the December quarter to 33,800 ounces in the March quarter. Copper
production decreased by 16 per cent from 8,681 tonnes to 7,267 tonnes. Equivalent gold production decreased by 16 per cent from 81,500
ounces to 68,700 ounces. The decrease in gold and copper production was mainly due to lower gold and copper head grades mined in line
with the mining sequence. Gold head grade decreased by 26 per cent from 1.21 grams per tonne to 0.90 grams per tonne and copper head
grade decreased by 17 per cent from 0.60 per cent to 0.50 per cent. Gold and copper head grades for the year are expected to be around
1.04 grams per tonne to 1.06 grams per tonne and 0.47 per cent to 0.49 per cent, respectively. Gold recoveries increased from 68.7 per
cent to 71.0 per cent mainly due to lower presence of fine porous pyrite in ore treated during the March quarter. Copper recoveries
increased from 86.5 per cent to 87.9 per cent. Gold yield decreased by 23 per cent from 0.83 grams per tonne to 0.64 grams per tonne
and copper yield decreased by 15 per cent from 0.52 per cent to 0.44 per cent.

In the March quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 33,900 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,221 per ounce
and 6,691 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$5,254 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This compared
with 46,000 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,208 per ounce and 8,549 tonnes of copper that was sold at an
average price of US$4,626 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the December quarter.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 4 per cent from 3.29 million tonnes in the December quarter to 3.16 million tonnes in the March quarter
mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined increased by 1 per cent from 1.73 million tonnes to 1.74
million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 9 per cent from 1.56 million tonnes to 1.42 million tonnes also in line
with the mining sequence.

Ore processed   decreased by 2 per cent from 1.74 million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.71 million tonnes in the March quarter
mainly due to   lower throughput (815 tonnes per hour in the March quarter versus 833 tonnes per hour in the December quarter) as a
result of the   rainy season and lower plant availability due to maintenance activities (95 per cent availability in the March quarter
versus 97 per   cent availability in the December quarter).
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 20 per cent from US$40 million to US$32 million mainly due to
restructuring and a US$3 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the March quarter compared with US$1 million in the December
quarter.
Capital expenditure decreased by 69 per cent from US$16 million to US$5 million due to lower construction activities at the tailings
dam and waste storage facilities due to the rainy season.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 61 per cent from US$303 per ounce in the December quarter to
US$118 per ounce in the March quarter mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower
gold sold and lower copper by-product credits. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce decreased by 7 per
cent from US$676 per equivalent ounce to US$626 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

Gold production decreased by 15 per cent from 95,600 ounces in the December quarter to 81,600 ounces in the March quarter.

At the underground operations, ore tonnes mined were similar at 142,000 tonnes.   Head grade increased by 5 per cent from 4.65 grams per
tonne to 4.87 grams per tonne due to scheduling.

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 831,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 785,000 tonnes in
the March quarter with ore mined from Stage 3 and 5 of the Invincible pit and Stage 2 of Neptune pit. Eighteen days of production were
lost due to inclement weather and resultant wet conditions in the Neptune pit. This largely accounted for the reduction in ore tonnes
mined. Grade mined decreased by 4 per cent from 2.74 grams per tonne to 2.63 grams per tonne due to lower tonnages from the Invincible
pit and higher tonnages from the lower grade Neptune pit.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 60 per cent from 5.2 million tonnes in the December quarter to 2.1 million tonnes in the
March quarter and capital waste tonnes mined increased by 50 per cent from 4.2 million tonnes to 6.3 million tonnes reflecting a change
from the removal of primarily operating waste to the stripping of Stage 6 of the Invincible pit. Total material movements at the open
pits decreased by 10 per cent from 10.2 million tonnes to 9.2 million tonnes due to inclement weather. The strip ratio decreased from
11.3 to 10.7.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 9 per cent from 1,094,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 995,000 tonnes in the March
quarter due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown and the impact of increased volumes of softer Neptune ore which is processed at a
slower rate than the harder ore. Yield decreased by 6 per cent from 2.72 grams per tonne to 2.55 grams per tonne due to lower grade
ore mined in the open pits.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 13 per cent from A$75 million (US$56 million) to A$65 million
(US$49 million) due to decreased operational waste mining in the open pits.
Capital expenditure decreased by 5 per cent from A$37 million (US$28 million) to A$35 million (US$26 million) due to decreased
expenditure on mine infrastructure, partially offset by increased pre-stripping cost at Invincible and Neptune pits.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent from A$1,213 per ounce (US$914 per ounce) in the December quarter
to A$1,280 per ounce (US$966 per ounce) in the March quarter due to decreased gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs
and capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 62,200 ounces in the December quarter to 58,300 ounces in the March quarter due to lower
grade ore milled.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 14 per cent from 352,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 301,000 tonnes in the March quarter
mainly due to the completion of the Genesis 500 stoping area during the December quarter. Head grade mined increased by 2 per cent from
6.20 grams per tonne to 6.31 grams per tonnes.

Tonnes processed increased by 3 per cent from 298,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 308,000 tonnes in the March quarter with some
ore stockpiled in the December quarter processed during the March quarter. The combined yield decreased by 9 per cent from 6.49 grams
per tonne to 5.89 grams per tonne due to the preferential treatment of high grade ore in the December quarter and drawdown of low grade
ore stockpiles in the March quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 8 per cent from A$48 million (US$36 million) in the December
quarter to A$52 million (US$39 million) in the March quarter mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) gold-in-circuit charge to cost
in the March quarter compared with a A$6 million (US$4 million) credit to cost in the December quarter, partially offset by a reduction
in mining costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 6 per cent from A$18 million (US$13 million) to A$19 million (US$14 million) mainly due to costs
incurred on the establishment of an in-pit tailings facility at the Songvang pit.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 17 per cent from A$1,081 per ounce (US$815 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$1,268 per ounce (US$957 per ounce) in the March quarter due to decreased gold sold, higher capital expenditure and higher
net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 7 per cent from 67,400 ounces in the December quarter to 71,900 ounces in the March quarter mainly due to
increased tonnes processed.
Ore mined from underground increased by 11 per cent from 374,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 415,000 tonnes due to increased
stope availability in the March quarter. Head grade mined decreased by 28 per cent from 6.84 grams per tonne in the December quarter
to 4.94 grams per tonne in the March quarter with the majority of ore mined from low grade stopes in Zones 90 and 100, in line with the
mine schedule, as opposed to mining the higher grade areas in Zone 90 in the December quarter. Grade mined for the year is expected to
be between 5.50 grams per tonne and 5.65 grams per tonne.

Tonnes processed increased by 40 per cent from 329,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 461,000 tonnes in the March quarter due to
increased ore mined from underground, supplemented with stockpiled ore from the December quarter. The yield decreased by 24 per cent
from 6.37 grams per tonne to 4.85 grams per tonne reflecting the lower grades mined and lower grades from stockpiles.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 33 per cent from A$42 million (US$32 million) in the December
quarter to A$56 million (US$42 million) in the March quarter mainly due to increased ore tonnes mined and processed. In addition, a
A$5 million (US$4 million) gold-in-process charge to cost in the March quarter compared with a A$7 million (US$5 million) credit to
cost in the December quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 36 per cent from A$36 million (US$27 million) in the December quarter to A$23 million (US$18 million)
in the March quarter mainly due to higher expenditure related to the purchase of fleet and underground infrastructure in the December
quarter.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 2 per cent from A$1,175 per ounce (US$885 per ounce) in the December quarter

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 14,000 ounces in the December quarter to 13,700 ounces in the March quarter due to lower
grade of ore mined.

Ore mined from underground increased by 11 per cent from 106,500 tonnes in the December quarter to 118,400 tonnes in the March quarter
due to increased ore from the Metske stopes. The Metske stopes are historical bulk low grade ore sources in the upper part of the mine.
Head grade mined was similar at 3.95 grams per tonne.

Tonnes processed increased by 6 per cent from 113,000 tonnes in the December quarter 120,000 tonnes in the March quarter due to
increased ore mined. The yield decreased by 8 per cent from 3.87 grams per tonne to 3.55 grams per tonne due to the processing of
lower grade ore stockpiles in the March quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 5 per cent from A$19 million (US$15 million) to A$20 million
(US$15 million) mainly due to increased ore production in the March quarter.
Capital expenditure decreased by 25 per cent from A$8 million (US$6 million) to A$6 million (US$4 million) mainly due to a reduction in
exploration costs and lower development and infrastructure associated with the Oval ore body. Production delivery from the new Oval
ore body started late in 2016 and will provide the primary ore feed in 2017 from a number of recently established levels. Final
decline development is expected to be completed during the June quarter after which capital expenditure is anticipated to reduce even
further.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 1 per cent from A$1,921 per ounce (US$1,443 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$1,899 per ounce (US$1,434 per ounce) in the March quarter due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold

MEDIA RELEASE  S o u t h   D e e p   R e b a s e   P l a n

Johannesburg, 16 February 2017: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce the results of the South Deep Rebase Plan.
The mine entered a critical stage of its evolution at the beginning of 2015
when Gold Fields made the decision to take a step back and fix the base at
the mine before determining the new long-term steady state profile.

As part of this process, we removed the previous production and cost targets
to afford the new South Deep management team the time to get the basics
right and determine the way forward. However, in the absence of long-term
production targets, we stated that it was our goal to get the mine to cash
breakeven by the end of 2016, a goal that we are pleased to have achieved.
For FY 2016, South Deep generated net cash flow of US$12m. Even after
stripping out the benefit of the rand hedge, the mine achieved cash
breakeven for the year.

In addition, we undertook to provide a new ramp-up plan for the mine, which
we are pleased to announce today. The mine is expected to ramp-up to steady
state production of c.500koz over the next 5 years at AIC below US$900/oz
(in 2017 money terms).

The new management team undertook a thorough diagnostic during 2015, which
resulted in 68 business improvement projects being identified to create a
long-life, sustainable mechanised mine. To-date, 29 projects have been
completed, with 27 expected to be closed out in 2017 and the remaining 12
expected to be completed in 2018.

South Deep has faced a number of challenges over the years which can best be
summarised into four broad categories: People and skills; Fleet and
maintenance; Underground working conditions; and Mining method. Whilst we
have made good progress on all categories over the past two years, continued
improvement is required and anticipated during the ramp-up to steady state:

-   People and skills: The first priority was to establish an experienced
    management team with extensive exposure to mechanised and deep level
    mining. This objective was successfully achieved with most of the new
    management team now in place for 18 months or more and with a low
    turnover rate. A further 168 critical skill positions requiring
    experienced and skilled staff were identified at the start of 2015.
    Most of these positions were filled by the end of 2016 with only a
    limited number of specialist skill positions yet to be filled. In
    addition to acquiring the necessary skills at the senior and middle
    management level, the development of mechanised mining skills was
    highlighted as a specific and critical requirement for the future
    success of the mine. As such, a mechanised mining skills development
    programme focusing on supervisors, artisans and operators was
    implemented and sound progress recorded.
-   Fleet and maintenance: South Deep instituted a number of key
    strategies to upgrade the condition of mechanised equipment fleet and
    effectiveness of its maintenance practices. As part of the fleet
    renewal strategy, 58 category 1 units have been commissioned over the
    past 2 years. The total category 1 fleet currently stands at 111. An
    expansive and fully equipped underground workshop spanning a total
    footprint of 200 metres x 200 metres was commissioned on 93 level to
    provide the working conditions necessary for maintenance personnel to
    perform their tasks more effectively. Maintenance skills development
    programmes were introduced to upskill our engineering personnel. In
    addition, outsourced OEM maintenance contracts were concluded with key
    suppliers (Sandvik and AARD) to effect immediate improvements as our
    own skills improve over time.

-   Underground working conditions: The new management team identified
    poor underground working conditions as a key impediment to turning
    South Deep into a successful mechanised mine. A number of business
    improvement projects were initiated to remediate this deficiency and
    focused on various elements of the underground infrastructure,
    including roadways, water management, backfill and ventilation.

-   Mining method: As an ultra-deep bulk mine, geotechnical considerations
    and mine design are critical elements in the overall successful
    extraction of the orebody. To this end several improvements in the
    overall design and mining layouts have been implemented during the
    past two years.

    -   Regional Pillars: The overall stiffness of the regional support
        design was improved by reducing the corridor span between regional
        pillars from 240 metres to 180 metres and by increasing the
        dimensions of crush pillars in the destress cuts from 10 metres x 6
        metres to 8 metres x 20 metres. Regional pillar width has remained
        at 60 metres. The design improvements resulted in lower excavation
        convergence rates and an increase in overall rockmass stability.
    -   High Profile Destress: Over the past two years South Deep converted
        from a low profile (2.2 metre) destress mining method to a high
        profile (5.5 metre) layout. This has eliminated an inefficient and
        cumbersome multi-step mining process, which included footwall or
        hangwall   ripping  to   open   excavations  for  longhole   stoping
        equipment, and enabled mechanised roofbolt installation.       In a
        significant step for the mine, low profile was completely phased
        out in mid-2016. Going forward, all destress development will
        employ the high profile method.

Significant improvements in 2016

The initiatives that were implemented over the past two years started to
yield results during 2016, which was a milestone year for South Deep.
Apart from the 47% increase in gold production to 9.0t (290koz) there was
a continuous improvement in the lead indicators (which we have been
providing the market with for the past two years):
-     Development increased by 47% to 6,933 metres in 2016 from 4,701 metres
      in 2015. New mine development increased by 9% YoY to 811 metres.
-     Given the change to the high profile method in the middle of 2015,
      destress mining was little changed YoY at 32,333 square metres
      (FY2015: 31,499 square metres). The high profile method accounted for
      69% of total destress mining in 2016 compared to 5% in 2015. All
      destress mining on the mine now uses the high profile method.
-     Longhole stoping volumes increased by 74% to 745kt in FY2016 (FY2015:
      429kt). There was a notable improvement in longhole stoping rig
      productivity during FY2016, which increased by 28% YoY to 9,805t/rig.
-     Secondary support installation increased by 32% YoY in FY2016 to 8,694
      metres.
-     Backfill placed was 10% higher YoY at 373 cubic metres

Five-year outlook to steady state

It is anticipated that South Deep will reach steady state production in
2021/2022. During this six year period, tonnes mined will ramp up at a
fairly consistent rate from the current 160 ktpm run rate to 230 ktpm when
at steady state. A big driver of the volume growth to steady state is the
increased contribution from longhole stoping.

The table below illustrates the key production, cost and capital metrics
associated with the ramp-up plan. Importantly the ramp-up does not assume
significant productivity improvements over five years, but those which
have been achieved in 2016.

*In 2017 money terms

The production ramp-up over the next six years occurs in the North of
Wrench mining area, which is a lower extension to the current mining
operations and contains reserves of 10.7Moz. North of Wrench expands into
six corridors with independent operating and ventilation systems. As such,
ventilation and refrigeration are important factors to achieve the planned
production build-up. Consequently, a substantial increase in refrigeration
and upgrading of ventilation infrastructure and equipment is required in
order to meet the ramp-up profile.    Most the additional requirements occur
over the next three years.

Total growth capital of R2,280m will be spent over the next six years,
peaking at R582m in 2019. The bulk of this capital is required for
underground infrastructure (R1,044m) and follow-on development (R724m),
with the remainder budgeted for electricity (R104m), verticle development
(R88m), fleet (R66m) and drilling (R58m). Most of these items were part of
original project capital that was deferred in 2013 (R1.2bn in 2009 money
terms).

Importantly, most of the operating expenditure is now in the cost base,
with the majority of the key skills and fleet now in place. As the mine
ramps up to steady state, we expect to see operational gearing given the
fixed cost nature of the mine. As a result, we expect steady state AIC
below US$900/oz.

EXCEEDING TARGETS 

JOHANNESBURG. 16 February 2017
Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) today announced normalised earnings of US$191 million for the year ended December 2016 compared with normalised 
losses of US$45 million for the year ended December 2015.  

A final dividend number 85 of 60 SA cents per share (gross) is payable on 13 March 2017, giving a total dividend for the year ended December 2016 of 
110 SA cents per share (gross).

Statement by Nick Holland, 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

Exceeding targets in 2016
Gold Fields reports results for the year ended 31 December 2016, with both production and costs beating original guidance.  During 2016, we achieved a 
number of our strategic objectives including improving safety; achieving guidance; generating strong net cash flow; deleveraging the balance sheet and 
growing the dividend in line with higher normalised earnings.  In addition, we are investing in the future to allow us to continue to deliver and grow 
sustainable free cash flow for years to come.
 
Safety is our top priority and our efforts to achieve zero harm continued in 2016.  The Group's fatality injury frequency rate improved by 67% to 0.02 
in 2016 (FY2015: 0.06).  The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) improved by 33% to 2.27 in 2016 (FY2015: 3.40). 

For FY2016, attributable gold equivalent production was 2,146koz (FY2015: 2,159koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$980/oz (FY2015: 
US$1,007/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of US$1,006/oz (FY2015: US$1,026/oz).  This compares with revised guidance of 2,100koz to 2,150koz (original 
guidance of 2,050koz to 2,100koz) at AISC of US$1,000/oz to US$1,010/oz and AIC of US$1,035/oz to US$1,045/oz (same for original and revised guidance).


Our focus on generating free cash flow yielded positive results again in 2016 with the eight mines in the Group generating net cash flow of US$444m 
(FY2015: US$254m).  A significant driver of the increase in net cash flow was South Deep achieving a small net cash inflow for the full year of 
US$12m, compared to the c.US$80m outflow in the previous year.  After taking into account the interest paid on net debt, growth expenditure at Salares 
Norte and sundry other costs, Group net cash flow was US$294m (FY2015: US$123m). 

The strong cash generation has enabled us to further improve our balance sheet, by reducing our net debt by US$214m during the year to US$1,166m at 
the end of 2016 (31 December 2015: US$1,380m).  Net debt to EBITDA as at 31 December 2016 was 0.95x, surpassing our target of 1.0x by end 2016 which 
we set ourselves at the start of 2015.  It is worth highlighting that this improved balance sheet has been achieved even after the US$197m payment to 
Gold Road for the acquisition of 50% of the Gruyere Gold project announced at the end of 2016. 

In line with our trading statement released on 2 February 2017, there was a more than threefold increase in normalised earnings for 2016 to US$191m 
(FY2015: US$45m) or US$0.24 per share (FY2015: US$0.06).  The increase in normalised earnings has enabled us to declare a final dividend of 60 SA 
cents, which takes the total dividend for 2016 to 110 SA cents, which implies a pay-out at the upper end of our dividend policy. 

As detailed in a separate announcement, we have announced the new long-term build-up plan for South Deep.  The mine is expected to ramp-up to steady 
state production of c.500koz over the next 5 years at AIC below US$900/oz.  

Strong operational performance in Q4 2016
Attributable gold equivalent production for Q4 2016 was 566koz (Q3 2016: 537koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$911/oz (Q3 2016: 
US$1,026/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of US$941/oz (Q3 2016: US$1,038/oz). 

Reinvesting today for tomorrow
In 2017, we will continue to drive operational excellence but in addition increase our focus on setting up the business for the future.  With various 
new growth and development projects, we have entered the next cycle in our evolution.  This focuses on reinvesting in the business and our future to 
target both continuing and increasing free cash flow for the benefit of all stakeholders.

At the end of 2016 we announced our joint venture with Gold Road to develop and operate the Gruyere Gold project.  We have taken over its management 
in February 2017 and production should start early in 2019.  Last year also saw the decision on the reinvestment plan for Damang, extending the life-
of-mine from 2017 to 2024, with clear upside beyond that. 

In Chile, the Salares Norte project has achieved the key milestone of receiving Government approval for sufficient water rights. As at 31 December 
2016, Salares Norte had Mineral Resources of 4.4Moz gold equivalent ounces (25.6Mt at 4.6g/t Au; 53.1g/t Ag), of which 52% is in the Indicated 
category. In addition, land easement has been granted for a period of 30 years. The project is on track to complete a prefeasibility study in Q2 2017. 

In addition, we will continue to invest in brownfields exploration in Australia with positive results at St Ives and Granny Smith, and look for 
opportunities, for life extension at Cerro Corona and Tarkwa.

Investments such as these do not mean that our strategy has changed.  We remain focused on generating cash in order to reduce our debt, pay dividends 
to shareholders and share the value we create with employees and host communities. 

However, for us to grow and sustain cash flow, investing is necessary.  While we may spend more cash than we may generate in 2017, depending on, inter 
alia, gold price and exchange rate, we are taking a longer term view to growing our cash flow in the future.  Our business is a long-term game, which 
has to be sustainable though price cycles. Importantly, we are ensuring that we only embark on investments and capital expenditure with excellent 
potential for pay-backs and returns and which will continue to drive down our costs.  It is also important to remember that we need to keep managing 
our existing ore bodies with regard to grade management and ongoing sustainable capital expenditure, so as to provide a platform for repetitive strong
 cashflow.

In October, we announced the Damang reinvestment plan which requires an investment of US$340m and will extend the life of mine (LoM) by eight years 
from 2017 to 2024. Over the LoM, a total of 165Mt waste and ore will be mined, with 32Mt processed at a grade of 1.65g/t, resulting in total gold 
production of 1.56Moz (average annual production of 225koz) at average AIC of US$950/oz.  The project offers healthy returns, with an IRR of 28% at a 
gold price of US$1,200/oz and a payback period of 4.5 years. 

In November 2016, Gold Fields entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Gold Road Resources for the development and operation of the Gruyere Gold 
project in Western Australia. The total purchase consideration was A$350m payable in cash and a 1.5% royalty on Gold Fields' share of production after 
total mine production exceeds 2Moz with an approximate value of A$15 million.  The Gruyere project is expected to have average annualised production 
of 270koz for a 13-year life of mine at average AISC of c.A$945/oz (US$690/oz at A$1;00: US$0.73), with construction capital expenditure estimated at 
A$507m. First production from Gruyere is expected end-2018/early-2019.  The project offers a return of 6% on reserves only and excluding other known 
deposits on the joint venture tenements at a gold price of A$1,600/oz, after taking the acquisition cost into account. Importantly, this investment 
established a foothold in a new and very significant gold province, the Yamarna belt, east of the Yilgarn Craton system. 

Gruyere has received approval from the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) for the Project Management Plan, Mining Proposal and Mine Closure Plan. 
This is the final level of approval required to allow commencement of construction of the process plant and associated infrastructure, and development 
work on the Gruyere open pit mine. In addition, all environmental approvals have been received.

Before year-end we completed the sale of a portfolio of eleven existing producing and non-producing royalties to Maverix Metals Inc, in return for 
42.85 million common shares and 10 million common share purchase warrants of Maverix.  Gold Fields owns approximately 32% of the issued and 
outstanding common shares of Maverix, which is currently worth around US$42m. 

South Deep cash positive in 2016
South Deep is a key part of the Gold Fields portfolio and will be a key contributor to Group production and cash flow as the mine ramps up to full 
production. Production at South Deep increased by 47% to 9,032kg (290koz) in FY2016 from 6,160kg (198koz) in FY2015 driven primarily by increased 
mining volumes. AIC decreased 8% YoY to R583,059/kg (US$1,234/oz).  Good progress was made on a number of important activities:
-  An overall improvement in safety during 2016 with the TRIFR improving 17% YoY to 2.42 in FY2016 (FY2015: 2.91).  As previously reported, there was 
   one fatality at the mine during the year. 
-  Improved operating performance and the higher rand gold price received resulted in the mine generating net cash flow of R175m (US$12m), which is a 
   complete turnaround from the outflow of R1,009m (US$80m) in 2015. 
-  Development increased by 47% to 6,933 metres in 2016 from 4,701 metres in 2015. New mine development increased by 9% YoY to 811 metres.
-  Given the change to the high profile method in the middle of 2015, destress mining was little changed YoY at 32,333m2 (FY2015: 31,499m2).  
   The high profile method accounted for 69% of total destress mining in 2016 compared to 5% in 2015.  All destress mining on the mine now uses the
   high profile method.
-  Longhole stoping volumes increased by 74% to 745kt in FY2016 (FY2015: 429kt).  There was a notable improvement in longhole stoping rig productivity 
   during FY2016, which increased by 28% YoY to 9,805t/rig.
-  Secondary support installation increased by 32% YoY in FY2016 to 8,694 metres.
-  Backfill placed was 10% higher YoY at 373m3.

Australia 
Gold production in the Australia region for FY2016 was 5% lower YoY at 942koz, but exceeded original and revised guidance of 905koz and 925koz, 
respectively.  AIC for the region was 4% higher YoY in A$ terms at A$1,261/oz and 3% higher YoY in US$ terms at US$941/oz.  The region had another 
strong year of cash generation, with net cash flow of A$343m (US$256m) for 2016.

In line with our strategy to continually upgrade the Gold Fields portfolio, we have commenced a sales process for Darlot. Darlot was acquired in 2013 
as part of the acquisition of Barrick Gold's Yilgarn South assets. We have invested heavily to extend the life of the mine beyond the initial 
projected six months which has resulted in Darlot producing more than 241,000 ounces of gold in the past three years. However, we believe that Darlot 
needs a more intensive exploration focus, which Gold Fields is unable to provide given our significant exploration activities at our other Australian 
assets as well as the development of Gruyere project. 

The brownfields exploration programme in Australia continued to show positive results in 2016, with resources flat and reserves up +10% for the year 
(excluding Gruyere), with both Granny Smith and St Ives more than replacing depletion in 2016. The total exploration spend for the year was A$102m. 

West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region was 5% lower YoY at 644koz due to lower production at both Tarkwa and Damang.  However, AIC 
for the region decreased by 3% YoY to US$1,020/oz mainly as a result of lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by 
lower gold sold.  The region generated net cash flow of US$100m for FY2016.  The Damang project is progressing according to plan, with the mining 
contractors having been mobilised on site, along with most of their fleet. 

South America
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona decreased by 9% YoY to 269koz, mainly due to lower gold head grades, as a result of planned sequencing and the lower copper price. AIC decreased by 31% YoY to US$499 per gold ounce (2% YoY to US$762 per equivalent ounce).  AIC per equivalent 
ounce decreased by 2% YoY to US$762 per equivalent ounce (2015: US$777 per equivalent ounce).  Despite the lower production, the mine generated net 
cash flow of US$77m.

FY2017 outlook and guidance 
Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2017 is expected to be between 2.10 million ounces and 2.15 million ounces, unchanged from 
the updated guidance provided in 2016.  The Australian region is expected to produce around 910,000 ounces.  Cerro Corona's anticipated gold 
equivalent production of around 290,000 ounces is higher than 2016 with the increase mainly due to the positive impact of the higher copper/gold price 
ratio.  Lower production of 120,000 ounces is expected at Damang given the reinvestment currently underway and South Deep is expected to increase 
production to around 9,800 kilograms (315,000 ounces). AISC, for the Group, is expected to be between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce.

As mentioned earlier, Gold Fields plans to embark on a year of reinvestment in 2017 with the focus on new growth and development projects, and to 
target both sustaining and growing free cash flow.  Apart from the additional investment in South Deep, three other major projects namely the Damang 
reinvestment project, the Gruyere development project and the Salares Norte project require investment.  Growth expenditure at South Deep is planned 
to increase to R287 million (US$20 million) in 2017 (2016: R115 million/US$8 million).

In 2017, US$120 million will be invested in future growth at Damang largely on waste stripping to expose high grade ore sources in the future, while 
A$153 million (US$112 million) is planned to be spent on the development of Gruyere and A$106 million (US$78 million) on the balance of the purchase 
price.  In Chile, Salares Norte is on track to complete a prefeasibility study in H2 2017.  The plan is to increase expenditure to US$64 million at 
Salares Norte in 2017 (2016: US$39 million) as it anticipates commencing detailed feasibility.  

As a result of the above, AIC for the Group is planned to increase significantly to between US$1,170 per ounce to US$1,190 per ounce.  Sustaining 
capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$617 million and growth capital expenditure is planned at US$252 million. The US$252 million 
comprises US$120 million for Damang, A$153 million (US$112 million) for Gruyere, as well as R287 million (US$20 million) at South. These expectations 
assume exchange rates of R/US$: 14.14 and A$/US$: 0.73.

RESULTS FOR THE GROUP 

SAFETY
The Group's fatality injury frequency rate improved by 67 per cent from 0.06 in 2015 to 0.02 in 2016.  The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 improved by 33 per cent from 3.40 in 2015 to 2.27 in 2016. 

1  Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically Treated 
   Injuries4) x 1,000,000/number of man-hours worked.
2  A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend work for a period of one or more 
   days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform any functions.
3  A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the employee or contractor being 
   unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the day after the injury occurred. The employee or contractor 
   can still perform some of his duties.
4  A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which does not incapacitate that employee and who, 
   after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately resume his/her normal duties on the next calendar day, immediately following

For the year ended 31 December 2016 compared with the year ended 31 December 2015

REVENUE
Attributable equivalent gold production decreased marginally from 2.159 million ounces in 2015 to 2.146 million ounces in 2016.  

Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, increased by 47 per cent from 6,160 kilograms (198,000 ounces) to 9,032 kilograms (290,400 ounces). 

Attributable gold production at the West African operations decreased by 5 per cent from 678,500 ounces in 2015 to 644,200 ounces in 2016 due to lower 
production at both Tarkwa and Damang.  Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru decreased by 9 per cent from 294,200 ounces in 
2015 to 268,900 ounces in 2016.  Gold production at the Australian operations decreased by 5 per cent from 988,000 ounces in 2015 to 942,400 ounces in 
2016 due to lower production at all the operations.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep increased by 47 per cent from 6,160 kilograms (198,000 ounces) in 2015 to 9,032 kilograms 
(290,400 ounces) in 2016 due to increased volumes and grades.  

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa decreased by 3 per cent from 586,100 ounces in 2015 to 568,100 ounces in 2016 mainly due 
to lower yield.  At Damang, managed gold production decreased by 12 per cent from 167,800 ounces in 2015 to 147,700 ounces in 2016 mainly due to lower 
yield.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona decreased by 9 per cent from 295,600 ounces in 2015 to 270,200 
ounces in 2016 mainly due to the lower copper price relative to the gold price (price factor), lower gold head grades and lower gold recovery.  

At the Australia region, St Ives' gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 371,900 ounces in 2015 to 362,900 ounces in 2016 mainly due to lower 
grades.  At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 236,600 ounces in 2015 to 229,300 ounces in 2016 mainly due to decreased 
tonnes mined and processed.  At Darlot, gold production decreased by 15 per cent from 78,400 ounces in 2015 to 66,400 ounces in 2016 mainly due to 
lower grades mined.  At Granny Smith, gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 301,100 ounces in 2015 to 283,800 ounces in 2016 due to lower 
grades mined and processed. 

The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased by 9 per cent from US$1,140 per equivalent ounce in 2015 to US$1,241 per equivalent 
ounce in 2016.  The average rand gold price increased by 22 per cent from R478,263 per kilogram to R584,894 per kilogram.  The average Australian 
dollar gold price increased by 9 per cent from A$1,541 per ounce to A$1,675 per ounce.  The average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations 
increased by 7 per cent from US$1,161 per ounce in 2015 to US$1,247 per ounce in 2016.  The average equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment 
and refining charges, for Cerro Corona increased by 20 per cent from US$996 per equivalent ounce in 2015 to US$1,199 per equivalent ounce in 2016.  
The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate weakened by 16 per cent from R12.68 in 2015 to R14.70 in 2016.  The average Australian/US dollar exchange 
rate was similar at A$1.00 = US$0.75.

Revenue increased by 8 per cent from US$2,545 million in 2015 to US$2,750 million in 2016 mainly due to the higher gold price achieved.

OPERATING COSTS
Net operating costs decreased by 5 per cent from US$1,456 million in 2015 to US$1,388 million in 2016.  The US$68 million lower net operating cost was 
due to US$18 million lower cost in local currency and the exchange rate effect of US$50 million on translation into US$ dollar.  The gold-in-process 
credit to cost of US$46 million in 2016 compared with a charge of US$25 million in 2015.  This change in gold-in-process was mainly at St Ives due to 
the processing of low grade stockpiles in 2015 that were built-up in 2014 while the Invincible pit was being stripped in 2015.  Sufficient ore to fill 
the mill and to create stockpiles was mined in 2016.

At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep increased by 33 per cent from R3,000 million (US$237 million) in 2015 to R3,993 million 
(US$272 million) in 2016 mainly due to a 47 per cent increase in production, annual salary increases, the electricity increase and an increase in 
employees and contractors in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation and to position the mine to achieve the 
targets set out in the rebase plan.

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 10 per cent from US$513 million in 2015 to US$463 million in 2016.  This decrease in net 
operating costs was mainly due to lower production, benefits realised as a result of the incorporation of the development agreement which is now fully 
embedded at the operations following ratification in March 2016, continued business process re-engineering, as well as a build-up of inventory of 
US$18 million in 2016 compared with US$5 million in 2015.  At Tarkwa, net operating costs were similar at US$327 million due to higher operating 
costs, partially offset by a bigger build-up of gold-in-process.  A build-up of stockpiles of US$18 million in 2016 compared with US$7 million in 
2015.  At Damang, net operating costs decreased by 27 per cent from US$186 million to US$136 million due to lower mining and consumable costs in line 
with the lower production. 

At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona decreased by 3 per cent from US$145 million in 2015 to US$140 million in 2016 mainly 
due to a build-up of concentrate of US$4 million in 2016 compared with a drawdown of US$1 million in 2015. 

At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 8 per cent from A$747 million (US$562 million) in 2015 to A$689 million (US$514 million) in 
2016 mainly due to gold-in-process movements.  At St Ives, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$15 million (US$11 million) in 2016 compared with a 
charge of A$34 million (US$25 million) in 2015.  In 2015, St Ives processed low grade stockpiles built-up in 2014, whereas enough ore was mined to 
fill the mill and to create stockpiles in 2016.  At Granny Smith, the credit to cost of A$10 million (US$7 million) in 2016 compared with a charge of 
A$7 million (US$5 million) in 2015.  This A$17 million (US$12 million) change in gold-in-process was mainly due to timing of the campaign milling.  
At Agnew/Lawlers, a gold-in-process credit of A$7 million (US$5 million) in 2016 compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) in 2015.  At Darlot, a 
gold-in-process charge of A$1 million (US$nil million) in 2016 compared with a credit to cost of A$1 million (US$1 million) in 2015.

OPERATING PROFIT 
Operating profit for the Group increased by 25 per cent from US$1,089 million in 2015 to US$1,362 million in 2016 due to the increase in revenue and 
the decrease in net operating costs. 

AMORTISATION AND DEPRECIATION
Amortisation and depreciation for the Group increased by 11 per cent from US$610 million in 2015 to US$679 million in 2016.  This increase of 
US$69 million was due to amortisation and depreciation increases of US$83 million due to the increase in production at South Deep and a decrease in 
depreciable reserves at Cerro Corona and at St Ives in Australia, partially offset by an exchange rate effect of US$14 million. 

OTHER
Net interest expense for the Group decreased by 9 per cent from US$65 million in 2015 to US$59 million in 2016.  Interest expense of US$83 million, 
partially offset by interest income of US$9 million and interest capitalised of US$15 million in 2016 compared with interest expense of US$88 million, 
partially offset by interest income of US$6 million and interest capitalised of US$17 million in 2015.

The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 67 per cent from US$6 million in 2015 to US$2 million in 2016 due to downscaling of activities at 
Far Southeast project (FSE).  

The loss on foreign exchange of US$6 million in 2016 compared with a gain of US$10 million in 2015.  These gains and losses on foreign exchange 
related to the conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies.

The gain on financial instruments of US$14 million in 2016 was mainly due to the South Deep currency hedge of US$70 million at an average price of 
R16.8273 to the US$.  This compared with a loss of US$5 million in 2015 which related to the mark to market adjustment on the diesel hedges that the 
Australian operations entered into on 10 September 2014 and 26 November 2014.  The diesel hedges came to an end on 31 December 2015.

Share-based payments for the Group increased by 27 per cent from US$11 million in 2015 to US$14 million in 2016 due to the implementation of a new 
long-term employee incentive scheme.  Long-term employee benefits increased by 120 per cent from US$5 million to US$11 million due to mark to market 
adjustments relating to the share price portion of the incentive scheme. 

Other costs for the Group increased by 9 per cent from US$45 million to US$49 million, mainly due to the write-off of bank facility fees of 
US$5 million as a result of refinancing of the off-shore credit facility during 2016. 

EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS
Exploration and project costs increased by 70 per cent from US$54 million in 2015 to US$92 million in 2016 mainly due to an increase at Salares Norte 
from US$16 million in 2015 to US$39 million in 2016 and the write-off of brownfields exploration costs at the Australian operations from A$41 million 
(US$31 million) in 2015 to A$64 million (US$48 million) in 2016. This write-off is a book entry and non- cash.  

NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring expenses of US$17 million in 2016 compared with US$218 million in 2015.

The non-recurring expenses in 2016 included mainly:
-  Cash-generating unit impairment of US$66 million at Cerro Corona.  The impairment calculation is based on the 2016 life of mine plan using the 
   following assumptions:
   -  Gold price 2017: US$1,100 per ounce, 2018: US$1,200 per ounce, 2019 onwards: US$1,300 per ounce;
   -  Copper price 2017 and 2018: US$2.50 per pound, 2019 onwards: US$2.80 per pound;
   -  Resource price US$60 per ounce;
   -  Life of mine: 7 years; and
   -  Discount rate: 4.8 per cent.
      The impairment is due to a reduction in gold and copper reserves due to depletion, a decrease in the gold and copper price assumptions for 2017 
      and 2018, a lower resource price and an increase in the Peru tax rate. 
-  Impairment of fleet relating to the disposal of fleet to the contractor and inoperable assets at Damang (US$10 million);
-  Retrenchment costs (US$12 million), mainly at Damang (US$10 million) and Granny Smith (A$2 million/US$1 million);
-  Other: US$5 million.

This was partially offset by:
-  Profit on sale of royalties as part of the Maverix transaction (US$48 million);
-  Profit on buy-back of the bond (US$18 million); and
-  A decrease in rehabilitation provision (US$10 million) mainly due to decreases in base cases associated with a reduction in the diesel price at the 
   Australian operations (A$10 million/US$7 million).


Non-recurring items of US$218 million in 2015 included mainly: 
-  Impairment of the Group's investment in Far South East (FSE) in the Philippines (US$101 million) to its recoverable amount; 
-  Impairment of the Group's investment in Hummingbird (US$15 million) to its fair value; 
-  Loss on disposal of assets at Cerro Corona (US$5 million);
-  Scrapping of assets no longer in use at Cerro Corona (US$7 million);
-  Write-off of stockpiles at Damang (US$8 million) due to net realisable value adjustments; 
-  Retrenchment costs (US$9 million), mainly at Tarkwa (US$5 million) and St Ives (A$4 million/US$3 million); 
-  Impairment of Arctic Platinum project (US$39 million) to its fair value less cost of disposal;
-  Impairment at Darlot: gross A$19 million (US$14 million), tax A$6 million (US$4 million), net A$13 million (US$10 million); and
-  Impairment at Damang: gross US$36 million, tax US$13 million, net US$23 million.  This was based on current studies which may result in the pits 
   not being mined and thus necessitating them being written down to nil carrying value.

This was partially offset by:
-  A decrease in rehabilitation provision (US$15 million) due to increased discount rates at South Deep (R78 million/US$6 million) and at the 
   Australian operations (A$12 million/US$9 million).

ROYALTIES
Government royalties for the Group increased by 5 per cent from US$76 million in 2015 to US$80 million in 2016 in line with higher revenue.

TAXATION
The taxation charge for the Group of US$192 million in 2016 compared with US$247 million in 2015.  Normal taxation increased from US$143 million to 
US$205 million due to higher taxable income.  The deferred tax credit of US$13 million in 2016 compared with a charge of US$104 million in 2015.

The deferred tax credit of US$13 million in 2016, arose mainly due to lower impairments of the deferred tax assets of US$30 million (2015: 
US$68 million) at Cerro Corona and US$nil (2015:US$37 million) at Damang along with a lower charge of US$1 million (2015: US$32 million) related to 
the weakening of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol.  In addition, there were changes in the tax rates in both Ghana and Peru.  This resulted in a deferred tax 
credit of US$21 million (2015: US$nil) in Ghana and a deferred tax charge of US$12 million (2015: US$5 million credit) in Peru.

In Peru, tax depreciation is recognised using the straight line depreciation method for the majority of assets over periods longer than the life of 
mine.  As Cerro Corona has a current life of mine to 2023, a significant portion of assets will not be fully depreciated for tax purposes by the end 
of the life of the mine.  In prior years, the Group believed that the life could be extended through an expansion of the tailings storage facility.  
However, during 2015, the Group completed the expansion feasibility study and concluded that in the current gold and copper price environment it would 
not be viable.  Based on the Group's best estimate at 31 December 2016, it is unlikely that Cerro Corona will earn taxable profits post the current 
life of mine in order to utilise these deductible temporary differences as they reverse.  As a result of the above, the Group impaired an amount of 
US$15 million (2015: US$68 million) related to deferred tax assets not recoverable at Cerro Corona at 31 December 2016. 

The impairment of the deferred tax asset at Damang in 2015 of US$37 million arose due to uncertainty regarding the extent of future taxable profits 
against which it can be utilised.  

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol (Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the US dollar.  For 
accounting purposes, unutilised tax allowances must be converted from Soles to dollars at the closing rate at the period end.  Therefore, the US 
dollar equivalent of unutilised taxation allowances fluctuate due to movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar.
 This resulted in a change in the temporary taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation. A deferred tax charge of US$2 million (2015: 
US$32 million) arose due to the weakening of the exchange rate from 3.38 Nuevo Sol in 2015 to 3.40 Nuevo Sol in 2016 (2.84 Nuevo Sol in 2014 to 
3.38 Nuevo Sol in 2015). It has no cash effect.

EARNINGS 
Net profit attributable to owners of the parent of US$163 million or US$0.20 per share in 2016 compared with a net loss of US$242 million or 
US$0.31 per share in 2015.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$208 million or US$0.26 per share in 2016 compared with headline losses of US$28 million 
or US$0.04 per share in 2015. 

Normalised earnings of US$191 million or US$0.24 per share in 2016 compared with US$45 million or US$0.06 per share in 2015. 

CASH FLOW 
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$957 million in 2016 compared with US$771 million in 2015, a 24 per cent increase.  This increase was 
mainly due to an increase in operating profit of US$165 million, partially offset by an investment into working capital of US$3 million in 2016 
compared with a release of working capital of US$44 million in 2015 as well as higher tax paid of US$235 million in 2016 compared with US$195 million 
in 2015. 

Dividends paid of US$39 million in 2016 compared with US$27 million in 2015.  Dividends paid to owners of the parent increased from US$15 million in 
2015 to US$39 million in 2016.  Dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders of US$nil million in 2016 compared with US$12 million in 2015. 

Cash outflow from investing activities increased from US$652 million in 2015 to US$868 million in 2016 due to an increase in capital expenditure from 
US$634 million in 2015 to US$650 million in 2016.  Purchase of Gruyere Gold project amounted to US$197 million (A$266 million).  Environmental 
payments decreased from US$18 million in 2015 to US$15 million in 2016.  

Cash inflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments of US$294 million in 2016 compared with US$123 million 
in 2015, a 139 per cent increase.  This increase was mainly due to higher profit, partially offset by higher capital expenditure, higher royalties and 
taxation paid and negative working capital adjustments.  The US$294 million in 2016 comprised: US$444 million net cash generated by the eight mining 
operations (after royalties, taxes, capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$69 million of net interest paid, US$47 million for 
exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which is included in the US$444 million above) and 
US$34 million on non-mine based costs.  The US$123 million in 2015 comprised: US$254 million generated by the eight mining operations less 
US$78 million of interest paid, US$22 million for exploration and US$31 million on non-mine based costs.

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure increased from R848 million (US$67 million) in 2015 to R1,145 million (US$78 million) 
in 2016 due to higher expenditure on fleet, the refurbishment of the man winder at Twin shaft and higher expenditure on mining employee accommodation. 

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure decreased from US$221 million to US$206 million.  At Tarkwa, capital expenditure decreased from 
US$204 million to US$168 million due to higher fleet expenditure in 2015.  Capital expenditure in 2016 was mainly incurred on pre-stripping.  Capital 
expenditure at Damang increased from US$17 million to US$38 million mainly due to waste stripping at Amoanda pit. 

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased from US$65 million to US$43 million mainly due to higher expenditure on the 
construction of the tailings dam, waste storage facilities and once-off capital projects in 2015. 

At the Australia region, capital expenditure increased from A$373 million (US$281 million) in 2015 to A$431 million (US$322 million) in 2016.  At St 
Ives, capital expenditure increased from A$152 million (US$115 million) in 2015 to A$188 million (US$140 million) in 2016 due to increased pre-strip 
at Neptune, Invincible and A5.  At Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure decreased from A$97 million (US$73 million) to A$94 million (US$70 million) due 
to decreased development at Waroonga, partially offset by increased exploration expenditure.  At Darlot, capital expenditure increased marginally from 
A$27 million (US$20 million) to A$29 million (US$21 million) and at Granny Smith, capital expenditure increased from A$96 million (US$72 million) in 
2015 to A$121 million (US$90 million) in 2016 due to increased capital development, increased exploration expenditure and the new fresh air intake 
ventilation raise.

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$37 million in 2016 compared with an outflow of US$88 million in 2015.  The inflow in 2016 related to a 
drawdown of US$1.299 billion and proceeds on the issue of shares of US$0.151 billion, partially offset by the repayment of US$1.413 billion on 
offshore and local loans.  

The net cash inflow for the Group of US$87 million in 2016 compared with US$4 million in 2015.  The cash balance was US$527 million in 2016 compared 
with US$440 million in 2015. 

ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST
The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 3 per cent from US$1,007 per ounce in 2015 to US$980 per ounce in 2016 mainly due to lower net 
operating costs, lower losses on commodity cost hedges, higher by-product credits, partially offset by higher non-cash and cash remuneration and 
higher sustaining capital expenditure.  AISC in 2015 included US$8 million of inventory written off at Damang.  Total all-in cost decreased by 2 per 
cent from US$1,026 per ounce in 2015 to US$1,006 per ounce in 2016 for the same reasons as all-in sustaining costs, as well as lower non-sustaining 
capital expenditure, partially offset by higher exploration, feasibility and evaluation costs. 

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 6 per cent from R607,429 per kilogram (US$1,490 per ounce) to 
R570,303 per kilogram (US$1,207 per ounce) mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher sustaining capital 
expenditure.  The total all-in cost decreased by 8 per cent from R635,622 per kilogram (US$1,559 per ounce) to R583,059 per kilogram (US$1,234 per 
ounce) due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 3 per cent from US$1,049 per ounce in 2015 to US$1,020 per ounce 
in 2016 mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 31 per cent from US$718 per ounce to US$499 per ounce mainly 
due to lower net operating costs, lower sustaining capital expenditure and higher by-product credits, partially offset by lower gold sold.  All-in 
sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce decreased by 2 per cent from US$777 per equivalent ounce to US$762 per equivalent ounce 
mainly due to the same reasons as above.

At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 4 per cent from A$1,211 per ounce (US$912 per ounce) in 2015 to 
A$1,261 per ounce (US$941 per ounce) in 2016 mainly due to higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating 
costs.

FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN.
The free cash flow (FCF) margin is revenue less cash outflow divided by revenue expressed as a percentage. 

The FCF for the Group in 2016 is calculated as follows:

** Free cash flow does not agree with cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditure in the statement of cash flows 
   on page 23 mainly due to working capital adjustments and non-recurring items included in statement of cash flows. 

The FCF margin of 17 per cent in 2016 at a gold price of US$1,247 per ounce compared with 8 per cent in the in 2015 at a gold price of US$1,154 per 
ounce.  The FCF margin for 2016, exceeds the Group's target of a 15 per cent FCF margin at a gold price of US$1,300 per ounce.

The higher FCF margin in 2016 was mainly due to lower net operating costs and the higher gold price received, partially offset by higher capital 
expenditure.

Gold production increased by 47 per cent from 6,160 kilograms (198,000 ounces) in 2015 to 9,032 kilograms (290,400 ounces) in 2016 due to increased 
volumes and grades.

Underground tonnes milled increased by 33 per cent from 1.23 million tonnes in 2015 to 1.63 million tonnes in 2016.  Total tonnes milled increased by 
50 per cent from 1.50 million tonnes to 2.25 million tonnes.  Total tonnes milled in 2016 included 107,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 
507,000 tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 51,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 214,000 tonnes of surface tailings material in 
2015.  Underground reef yield increased by 10 per cent from 4.98 grams per tonne to 5.5 grams per tonne due to the mining of higher grade areas closer 
to the Corridor 4W shoreline and improved mining quality (dimensional and spatial compliance). 

Development increased by 47 per cent from 4,701 metres in 2015 to 6,933 metres in 2016.  New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) 
increased by 9 per cent from 744 metres in 2015 to 811 metres in 2016.  Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above increased by 
55 per cent from 3,957 metres to 6,122 metres.  Destress mining (low and high profile) increased by 6 per cent from 30,444 square metres in 2015 to 
32,333 square metres in 2016.  The low increase in destress square meters was mainly due to the strategic decision to stop destress cuts after the 
intersection of geological features as well as the earlier than planned conversion to high profile destress.  The destress conversion from low profile 
to high profile mining was completed in 2016.  High profile destress mining commenced in June 2015 and improved significantly from 3,604 square metres 
in 2015 to 22,466 square metres in 2016 with conversion of existing low profile destress cuts to high profile destress cuts.  Low profile destress 
decreased from 26,840 square meters in 2015 to 9,867 square meters in 2016.  The high profile and low profile methods contributed 69 per cent and 
31 per cent, respectively, to total destress in 2016.  Longhole stoping volume mined increased by 74 per cent from 429,475 tonnes in 2015 to 745,190 
tonnes in 2016.  

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 64 per cent of the ore tonnes in 2016, while the new mine (below 95 level) contributed 36 per cent.

Net operating costs increased by 33 per cent from R3,000 million (US$237 million) in 2015 to R3,993 million (US$272 million) in 2016, mainly due to 
the 47 per cent increase in production, annual salary increases, the electricity increase and an increase in employees and contractors in line with 
the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation.

Operating profit of R1,273 million (US$87 million) in 2016 compared with a loss of R54 million (US$4 million) in 2015.  This was mainly due to the 
46 per cent (2,841 kilograms) increase in gold sold together with a 22 per cent improvement in the rand gold price, partially offset by increased net 
operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 35 per cent from R848 million (US$67 million) in 2015 to R1,145 million (US$78 million) in 2016 as a result of higher 
spending on fleet, the refurbishment of the man winder at Twin shaft and higher spend on mining employee accommodation.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 6 per cent from R607,429 per kilogram (US$1,490 per ounce) in 2015 to R570,303 per kilogram (US$1,207 per ounce) 
in 2016 mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher net operating costs and higher sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost decreased by 8 per cent from R635,622 per kilogram (US$1,559 per ounce) in 2015 to R583,059 per kilogram (US$1,234 per ounce) in 
2016 due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustainable costs as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R675 million (US$53 million) in 2015 to R1,030 million (US$70 million) in 2016 due to additional fleet, 
the refurbishment of the twin shaft man winder and higher expenditure on mining employee accommodation.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased 
from R173 million (US$14 million) to R115 million (US$8 million). 

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 9,800 kilograms (315,000 ounces)
-  Destress square metres ~ 46,000 square meters
-  Development metres ~ 7,880 meters 
-  Sustaining capital expenditure ~ R1,020 million (US$72 million)
-  Growth capital expenditure~ R290 million (US$20 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ R555,000 per kilogram (US$1,220 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ R585,000 per kilogram (US$1,290 per ounce)

gold-in-process.  A build-up of stockpiles of US$18 million in 2016 compared with US$7 million in 2015. 

Operating profit increased from US$354 million in 2015 to US$382 million in 2016 due to higher revenue as a result of the higher gold price received.

Capital expenditure decreased by 18 per cent from US$204 million to US$168 million mainly due to the purchase of mining fleet for replacement in 2015.
Mining fleet expenditure including componentisation in 2015 was US$69 million compared with US$23 million in 2016.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 1 per cent from US$970 per ounce in 2015 to US$959 per ounce in 2016 due to lower capital 
expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 565,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ US$180 million
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ US$985 per ounce
-  Total all-in cost ~ US$985 per ounce

Gold production decreased by 12 per cent from 167,800 ounces in 2015 to 147,700 ounces in 2016 mainly due to lower head grade and lower yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 21.4 million tonnes in 2015 to 18.8 million tonnes in 2016 due to the late start of 
mining at the Amoanda pit.

Ore tonnes mined decreased from 4.7 million tonnes to 2.8 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased from 16.7 million tonnes to 
8.2 million tonnes as a result of only mining operational waste tonnes in 2015, while both operational waste tonnes and capital waste tonnes were 
mined in 2016.  Capital waste of 7.8 million tonnes was mined at Amoanda pit in 2016.  Head grade mined increased from 1.27 grams per tonne to 
1.32 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio increased from 3.6 to 5.7.

Yield decreased from 1.22 grams per tonne to 1.08 grams per tonne due to an increase in lower grade stockpiles treated.  In 2016, 2.2 million tonnes 
of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.37 grams per tonne and 2.1 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade 
of 1.04 grams per tonne.  This compared with 3.6 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.41 grams per tonne and 
0.7 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average grade of 1.27 grams per tonne in 2015. 

Tonnes processed decreased marginally from 4.29 million tonnes in 2015 to 4.27 million tonnes in 2016. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 27 per cent from US$186 million to US$136 million mainly due to lower mining 
and consumable costs in line with the lower production.   

Operating profit increased from US$8 million in 2015 to US$47 million in 2016 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold prices achieved, 
partially offset by lower gold sold. 

Capital expenditure increased by 124 per cent from US$17 million to US$38 million with the majority spent on waste stripping at Amoanda pit.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent from US$1,326 per ounce in 2015 to US$1,254 per ounce in 2016 due to lower net 
operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 158,900 ounces in 2015 to 150,200 ounces in 2016.  Copper production increased by 7 per cent from 
28,702 tonnes to 30,667 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production decreased by 9 per cent from 295,600 ounces to 270,200 ounces.  The decrease in equivalent 
gold production was due to the lower copper to gold price ratio as well as lower gold head grades treated and lower gold recovery.  The lower head 
grades were in line with the mine sequencing and the planned production schedule in 2016.  Gold head grade decreased from 1.07 grams per tonne to 
1.03 grams per tonne and copper head grade increased from 0.52 per cent to 0.53 per cent. 

Gold recoveries decreased from 71.9 per cent to 67.5 per cent mainly due to the presence of fine porous pyrite in the ore treated in 2016.  Action 
plans to mitigate the lower recoveries include blending to homogenise ore characteristics before feeding the plant and in-pit drilling to better 
predict the presence of porous pyrite. Copper recoveries increased from 86.1 per cent to 86.6 per cent.  Gold yield decreased from 0.77 grams per 
tonne to 0.70 grams per tonne and copper yield increased from 0.45 per cent to 0.46 per cent.  

In 2016, concentrate with a payable content of 149,105 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,244 per ounce and 29,905 tonnes of copper 
was sold at an average price of US$4,182 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared with 158,805 ounces of gold that was sold at 
an average price of US$1,109 per ounce and 28,221 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average price of US$4,229 per tonne, net of treatment and 
refining charges in 2015.  Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 8 per cent from 293,300 ounces in 2015 to 268,900 ounces in 2016 mainly due to 
lower gold produced and lower price factor.

Total tonnes mined increased by 11 per cent from 12.96 million tonnes in 2015 to 14.45 million tonnes in 2016 in line with the mine sequencing.  
The higher tonnes mined were mainly due to lower intensity of the rainy season.  Ore mined increased by 3 per cent from 6.84 million tonnes to 
7.06 million tonnes.  Waste tonnes mined increased by 21 per cent from 6.12 million tonnes to 7.39 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 
0.89 to 1.05 due to higher waste mined in 2016 in line with the mining sequence.  

Ore processed increased by 4 per cent from 6.71 million tonnes in 2015 to 6.98 million tonnes in 2016 mainly due to higher plant throughput 
(832 tonnes per hour versus 811 tonnes per hour) after the completion of the plant optimisation project.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 3 per cent from US$145 million in 2015 to US$140 million in 2016.  The lower 
cost was mainly due to a US$4 million build-up of concentrate inventory in 2016 compared with US$1 million drawdown in 2015. 

Operating profit increased by 24 per cent from US$147 million in 2015 to US$183 million in 2016 mainly due to the higher gold price and higher copper 
production, partially off-set by lower gold production and lower copper price.

Capital expenditure decreased by 34 per cent from US$65 million to US$43 million mainly due to higher expenditure on construction of the tailing dam, 
waste storage facilities and once-off capital projects in 2015.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 31 per cent from US$718 per ounce in 2015 to US$499 per ounce in 2016.  This was mainly due 
to higher by-product credits and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per 
equivalent ounce decreased by 2 per cent from US$777 per equivalent ounce to US$762 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above.

* Heap leach produced 600 ounces, rinsed from inventory (4,500 ounces was rinsed in 2015). 
++ Heap leach blended with mill feed to reflect the overall recovery of 2.79 grams per tonne (mill 2.84 grams per tonne). 

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 371,900 ounces in 2015 to 362,900 ounces in 2016 due to lower grade of ore milled following the closure 
of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines and transition to a predominantly open pit operation.  

Total tonnes mined increased by 82 per cent from 24.05 million tonnes in 2015 to 43.74 million tonnes in 2016.  The additional tonnes mined are a 
result of the transition to a predominantly open pit operation.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 48 per cent from 1.21 million tonnes in 2015 to 0.63 million tonnes in 2016 following the 
closure of the Cave Rocks mine in 2015 and Athena mine in 2016.  The grade mined increased by 7 per cent from 4.72 grams per tonne to 5.07 grams per 
tonne as a result of the closure of the lower grade Cave Rocks mine.  As a result, contained gold mined from underground decreased from 183,400 ounces 
in 2015 to 102,200 ounces in 2016.

Total tonnes mined were 43.11 million tonnes in 2016 compared with 22.84 million tonnes in 2015.  At the open pits total ore tonnes mined increased by 
101 per cent from 1.83 million tonnes in 2015 to 3.67 million tonnes in 2016 due to the ramp-up of the Invincible pit, combined with mining at the 
A5 and Neptune pits as part of a strategic shift to a primary open pit operation at St Ives.  Grade mined decreased by 5 per cent from 2.69 grams per 
tonne to 2.56 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined from the A5 pit while the Neptune pit was undergoing pre-strip. Contained gold mined from 
the open pits increased from 157,800 ounces in 2015 to 301,900 ounces in 2016. 

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 74 per cent from 6.90 million tonnes in 2015 to 12.03 million tonnes in 2016.

Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 14.11 million tonnes to 27.41 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased from 11.5 to 10.7.  
The increased tonnes reflect the increase in activity at the Invincible mine which is now in full production and the commencement of Stage 2 of the 
Neptune open pit, giving St Ives two significant areas of open pit activity beyond 2016.  There was no mining activity at Neptune during the first 
half of 2015. 

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 5 per cent from 3.87 million tonnes in 2015 to 4.05 million tonnes in 2016, mainly due to St Ives having 
mined sufficient tonnes to fill the mill in 2016, whereas a campaign milling strategy was adopted to supplement production in the first six months of 
2015.  The mill was closed for two weeks during the second half of 2016 for the installation of a new electrical control block for the Sag mill.  
Yield decreased from 2.95 grams per tonne to 2.84 grams per tonne due to increased mill feed from lower grade open pits during 2016.  Gold production 
from the Lefroy mill decreased from 367,400 ounces in 2015 to 360,400 ounces in 2016.  In addition, 93,277 tonnes of toll treatment produced 
1,945 ounces in 2016 that was credited to St Ives as part of the commercial arrangement.  

Residual leaching and irrigation of the existing heap leach pad produced a further 600 ounces in 2016.  This compared with 4,500 ounces produced in 
2015.  The residual leaching ceased in April 2016.  

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements decreased by 17 per cent from A$293 million (US$220 million) in 2015 to A$244 million 
(US$182 million) in 2016.  The significant cost reduction is the result of:
-  closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines;
-  efficiencies in the open pits with the cost per tonne of material movement decreasing year-on-year by 21 per cent on larger volumes and 
productivity improvements; and
-  benefits of enhanced open pit production resulting in a gold-in-process credit of A$15 million (US$11 million) in 2016 due to a build-up of 
stockpiles compared with a gold-in-process charge of A$34 million (US$25 million) due to a drawdown of stockpiles during 2015. 

The benefits of the above cost reductions were partially offset by increased mining volumes at the open pit operations.

Operating profit increased by 29 per cent from A$281 million (US$212 million) in 2015 to A$363 million (US$271 million) in 2016 due to a higher 
Australian dollar gold price (A$1,672 per ounce in 2016 versus A$1,543 per ounce in 2015) and a significant reduction in net operating costs, 
partially offset by slightly lower gold production.

Capital expenditure increased by 24 per cent from A$152 million (US$115 million) in 2015 to A$188 million (US$140 million) in 2016 with an additional 
A$23 million (US$17 million) incurred on pre-stripping at Neptune and Invincible open pits. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 1 per cent from A$1,287 per ounce (US$969 per ounce) in 2015 to A$1,273 per ounce 
(US$949 per ounce) in 2016 due to the significant reduction in net operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold and higher capital 
expenditure.

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 360,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$185 million (US$135 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,325 per ounce (US$970 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,325 per ounce (US$970 per ounce).

Tonnes processed decreased by 3 per cent from 1.22 million tonnes in 2015 to 1.18 million tonnes in 2016.  This reduction was due to a shortage of 
mill feed early in the year with the mill running just under capacity and an oversupply of ore in the second half of the year with not all ore mined 
being processed.  The combined yield increased from 6.02 grams per tonne to 6.07 grams per tonne mainly due to the preferential feed of higher grade 
ore in the latter part of the year.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, were similar at A$189 million (US$141 million). 

Operating profit increased by 10 per cent from A$176 million (US$133 million) in 2015 to A$194 million (US$145 million) in 2016 due to the higher 
Australian dollar gold price (A$1,670 per ounce in 2016 versus A$1,539 per ounce in 2015), partially offset by lower production.

Capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from A$97 million (US$73 million) in 2015 to A$94 million (US$70 million) in 2016.  The decrease in 
capital expenditure was due to increased development of Fitzroy Bengal Hastings (FBH) at Waroonga during 2015, partially offset by increased 
exploration expenditure in 2016.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 2 per cent from A$1,276 per ounce (US$959 per ounce) in 2015 to A$1,301 per ounce 
(US$971 per ounce) in 2016 due to lower gold sold, partially offset by lower capital expenditure.  

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 220,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$87 million (US$64 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,390 per ounce (US$1,020 per ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,390 per ounce (US$1,020 per ounce)

Gold production decreased by 15 per cent from 78,400 ounces in 2015 to 66,400 ounces in 2016 due to lower grades mined. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 2 per cent from 0.41 million tonnes to 0.42 million tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased by 18 per cent from 
6.08 grams per tonne in 2015 to 4.98 grams per tonne in 2016.  The reduced grade was due to mining of the lower grade bulk Felsic's area of Lords 
South Lower.  A further 28,200 tonnes at 1.29 grams per tonne were sourced from a surface oxide trial during 2016 contributing 1,200 ounces.  

Tonnes processed decreased by 2 per cent from 0.46 million tonnes in 2015 to 0.45 million tonnes in 2016.  The yield decreased from 5.34 grams per tonne to 4.55 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined and the addition of ore from the low grade oxide trial.   


Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 3 per cent from A$79 million (US$59 million) in 2015 to A$77 million 
(US$58 million) in 2016 due to cost reduction measures applied to mining activities.

Operating profit decreased by 21 per cent from A$43 million (US$32 million) to A$34 million (US$25 million) due to lower gold production, partially 
offset by a higher Australian dollar gold price received (A$1,679 per ounce in 2016 versus A$1,546 per ounce in 2015).

Capital expenditure increased by 7 per cent from A$27 million (US$20 million) to A$29 million (US$21 million).  Expenditure in 2016 was mainly 
incurred on exploration and the commencement of development of the Oval ore body.  The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to 
provide the primary ore feed in 2017.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 18 per cent from A$1,403 per ounce (US$1,057 per ounce) in 2015 to A$1,662 per ounce 
(US$1,238 per ounce) in 2016 due to lower gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating costs.  

Darlot was able to remain cash flow positive for the year (A$1 million) while spending A$16 million in capital development and A$11 million on 
exploration.  

Guidance 
The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 52,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$12 million (US$8 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,755 per ounce (US$1,285 per ounce)

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 301,100 ounces in 2015 to 283,800 ounces in 2016 due to lower grades mined and an increase in stockpiled 
ore as a consequence of the timing of the December milling campaign.

Ore mined from underground increased by 10 per cent from 1.38 million tonnes to 1.52 million tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased by 5 per cent from 
6.94 grams per tonne in 2015 to 6.61 grams per tonne in 2016 in line with the 2016 mining plan.

Tonnes processed were similar at 1.45 million tonnes.  The yield decreased from 6.45 grams per tonne to 6.11 grams per tonne due to lower head grades.  
The mill was not operating at capacity and the timing of the milling campaign results in variances between tonnes mined and milled.  This was 
significant to the year-on-year production analysis with a net 70,000 tonnes drawn down from stockpiles in 2015 and a net 70,000 tonnes build-up in 
2016.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements decreased by 5 per cent from A$188 million (US$141 million) to A$179 million 
(US$134 million).  Mining costs increased due to the additional volumes, but were more than offset by the net gold-in-process credit associated with 
the respective timing of the milling campaigns, referred to above.  The gold-in-process credit to cost of A$10 million (US$7 million) in 2016 compared 
with a charge of A$7 million (US$5 million) in 2015.

Operating profit increased by 8 per cent from A$275 million (US$207 million) in 2015 to A$298 million (US$222 million) in 2016 mainly due to the 
higher Australian gold price received (A$1,682 per ounce in 2016 versus A$1,538 per ounce in 2015).

Capital expenditure increased by 26 per cent from A$96 million (US$72 million) in 2015 to A$121 million (US$90 million) in 2016.  The majority of the 
expenditure related to capital development, exploration and the establishment of new fresh air intake ventilation raises.  The mines electricity 
generation moved from diesel to gas in May 2016 with the commissioning of the new power station.  This power station is providing savings in power 
and maintenance costs, lower carbon emissions and reduced risk of power interruptions. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 10 per cent from A$1,017 per ounce (US$764 per ounce) in 2015 to A$1,119 per ounce 
(US$834 per ounce) in 2016 mainly due to lower gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by the lower net operating costs.

The estimate for calendar 2017 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 278,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$115 million (US$84 million)

RESIGNATION OF NICO MULLER 
Gold Fields announced the resignation of Nico Muller, EVP: South Africa, effective 3 March 2017.  Nico will be leaving Gold Fields to take up the 
position of chief executive officer of Impala Platinum. 

The Board and management of Gold Fields thanked Nico for his significant contribution to South Deep and the company as well as his leadership and 
wished him every success in his new role.

Since joining Gold Fields in October 2014, Nico has played an important role in fixing the base at South Deep and repositioning the mine for a 
sustainable future.  In doing so, Nico has recruited a strong leadership team which will continue to take South Deep forward. 

DIRECTORATE CHANGES
Messrs Kofi Ansah and Alan Hill retired as non-executive directors of the Gold Fields Board of Directors on 31 December 2016. 

Gold Fields Chairperson Cheryl Carolus thanked Messrs Ansah and Hill for their valuable contribution and the enormous depth of experience they brought 
to the board over the many years in which they served as directors.  Mr Ansah has been a Gold Fields director since April 2004 and Mr Hill since 
August 2009.

THUSANANG CLINIC 
South Deep handed over the Thusanang 2 Clinic to the Gauteng Department of Health in August 2016.

Thusanang is an informal settlement on the border of South Deep mine's property in the Rand West municipality in Gauteng and is home to about 
8,000 residents.  The clinic brings much relief to a community that previously had to rely on a mobile clinic which only visited the area once a week. 

JOINT VENTURE WITH GOLD ROAD 
Gold Fields entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Gold Road Resources Limited (Gold Road) (ASX: GOR) for the development and operation of the 
Gruyere Gold Project in Western Australia, which comprises the Gruyere gold deposit as well as additional resources including Central Bore and 
Attila/Alaric (Gruyere). 

Gold Fields acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Gruyere Gold project for a total purchase consideration of A$350 million payable in cash and a 
1.5 per cent royalty on Gold Fields' share of production after total mine production exceeds 2Moz with an approximate value of A$15 million.  The cash 
consideration comprises A$250 million paid at completion in December 2016 and A$100 million payable according to an agreed construction cash call 
schedule. The consideration will be funded utilising existing cash resources and banking facilities in Australia. 
SALE OF ROYALTY PORTFOLIO TO MAVERIX 
Gold Fields Limited refers shareholders to the announcement made by TSX-listed, Maverix Metals Inc. (Maverix) (TSX-V: MMX) involving Gold Fields 
Netherlands Services B.V., and certain of its other wholly owned subsidiaries.  Maverix has agreed to acquire a portfolio of eleven existing producing 
and non-producing royalties from Gold Fields in return for 42.85 million common shares and 10 million common share purchase warrants of Maverix.  The 
transaction was completed in December 2016 and Gold Fields owns approximately 32 per cent of the issued and outstanding common shares of Maverix.  The 
fair value of the 42.85 million common shares was US$42 million and the shares are recognised as an equity accounted investee. The fair value of the 
10 million common share purchase warrants was US$6 million and are classified as derivative instruments.

CASH DIVIDEND
In line with the company's dividend policy to pay out a dividend of between 25 and 35 per cent of its earnings, the Board has approved and declared a 
final dividend number 85 of 60 SA cents per ordinary share (gross) in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016.  This translates to 32 per cent of 
normalised earnings.  The final will be subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax that was introduced with effect from 1 April 2012 of 15 per cent.  
In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a)(i) and 11.17(c) of the JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional information is disclosed:
-  The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
-  The local dividends withholding tax rate is 15 per cent (fifteen per centum);
-  The gross local dividend amount is 60 SA cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividends tax;
-  The Dividend Withholding Tax of 15 per cent (fifteen per centum) will be applicable to this dividend;
-  The net local dividend amount is 51.000 SA cents per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay the dividends tax;
-  Gold Fields currently has 821,532,707 ordinary shares in issue; and

Outlook for 2017 
Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2017 is expected to be between 2.10 million ounces and 2.15 million ounces, unchanged from 
the updated guidance provided for 2016.  The Australian region is expected to produce around 910,000 ounces with reduced ounces at the four mines 
largely due to a change in mining mix across these dynamic operations which inevitably affect grade and tonnage.  Cerro Corona's gold equivalent 
production of around 290,000 ounces is higher than 2016 with the increase mainly due to the positive impact of the higher copper/gold price ratio.  
Lower production is expected at Damang given the reinvestment currently underway and South Deep is expected to increase production to around 9,800 
kilograms (315,000 ounces). AISC is expected to be between US$1,010 per ounce and US$1,030 per ounce.

As mentioned earlier, Gold Fields plans to embark on a year of reinvestment in 2017 with the focus on new growth and development projects, and to 
target both sustaining and growing free cash flow.  Apart from the additional investment in South Deep, three other major projects namely the Damang 
reinvestment project, the Gruyere development project and the Salares Norte project require investment.  Growth expenditure at South Deep is planned 
to increase to R287 million (US$20 million) in 2017 (2016: R115 million/US$8 million).

In 2017, US$120 million will be invested in future growth at Damang largely on waste stripping to expose high grade ore sources in the future, while 
A$153 million (US$112 million) is planned to be spent on the development of Gruyere and A$106 million (US$78 million) on the balance of the purchase 
price.  In Chile, Salares Norte is on track to complete a prefeasibility study in H2 2017.  The plan is to increase expenditure to US$64 million at 
Salares Norte in 2017 (2016: US$39 million) as it anticipates commencing detailed feasibility.  

As a result of the above, AIC for the Group is planned to increase significantly to between US$1,170 per ounce to US$1,190 per ounce.  Sustaining 
capital expenditure for the Group is planned at US$617 million and growth capital expenditure is planned at US$252 million. The US$252 million 
comprises US$120 million for Damang, A$153 million (US$112 million) for Gruyere, as well as R287 million (US$20 million) at South. These expectations 
assume exchange rates of R/US$: 14.14 and A$/US$: 0.73.

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on pages 4 and 40.

REVIEWED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for 
preliminary reports and the requirements of the Companies Act 2008 of South Africa.

The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices 
Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required 
by IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with 
those applied in the previously issued consolidated financial statements. 

AUDITOR'S REVIEW
The condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been reviewed by the company's 
auditor, KPMG Inc.  The segmental operating results included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have not been reviewed by KPMG Inc. 
The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this media release.  Shareholders are therefore advised that 

in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should refer to the auditor's report on the last page of this 
release.

LITIGATION STATEMENT
In relation to the Litigation statement, there has been no further update since the release of the annual financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015 except for:

SILICOSIS
As previously reported, the respondents in the certification application, including Gold Fields, all opposed the certification application, which was 
heard by the Gauteng Local Division of the High Court from 12 to 23 October 2015.

On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, amongst other things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising current and 
former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and (b) a tuberculosis class 
comprising current and former mine workers who have worked on the mines for a period of not less than two years and who have contracted pulmonary 
tuberculosis and the dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary tuberculosis; and (2) that the common law be developed to provide that, 
where a claimant commences suing for general damages and subsequently dies whether arising from harm caused by a wrongful act or omission of a person 
or otherwise, before close of pleadings, and who would but for his or her death have been entitled to continue with such action, the claim for general 
damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant.

The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: (i) a determination of common issues, on an opt-out basis, and (ii) the hearing 
and determination of individualized issues, on an opt in basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the claimants.  The High Court ruling did 
not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought by the claimants.  The amount of damages has not yet been quantified for any of the 
claimants in the consolidated class application or for any other members of the classes.

Gold Fields and the other respondents believe that the judgment addressed a number of highly complex and important issues, including a far reaching 
amendment of the common law, that have not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa.  The High Court itself found that the scope and 
magnitude of the proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class action would address novel and complex issues of fact and law.  
The companies applied for leave to appeal against the judgement because they believed that the court's ruling on some of these issues is incorrect and 
that another court may come to a different decision.

On 24 June 2016, the High Court granted the mining companies leave to appeal against the finding amending the common law in respect of the 
transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused leave to appeal on the certification of silicosis and tuberculosis classes.

On 15 July 2016, the Gold Fields and the other respondents each filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against the 
certification of the two separate classes for silicosis and tuberculosis.

On 21 September 2016, the Supreme Court of Appeal granted the respondents leave to appeal against all aspects of the class certification judgment of 
the High Court delivered in May 2016.  The appeal record has been filed.  It is anticipated that an appeal hearing date may be allocated in the third 
quarter of 2017.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined and, accordingly, no adjustment for any effects on the Company that may result from
the proceedings, if any, has been made in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

SOUTH DEEP TAX DISPUTE
The South Deep mine (South Deep) is jointly owned and operated by GFIJVH (50 per cent) and GFO (50 per cent).  As at 31 December 2016, South Deep's 
gross deductible temporary differences amounted to US$1,585.3 million (R22,242.2 million), resulting in a deferred tax asset balance of 
US$475.6 million (R6,672.7 million).  This amount is included in the consolidated deferred tax asset of US$48.7 million on Gold Fields' statement of 
financial position.  South Deep's gross deductible temporary differences comprises unredeemed capital expenditure balances of US$633.2 million 
(R8,884.0 million) (tax effect: US$190.0 million (R2,665.2 million)) at GFIJVH and US$606.4 million (R8,508.0 million) (tax effect: US$181.9 million 
(R2,552.4 million)) at GFO, a capital allowance balance (Additional Capital Allowance) of US$163.4 million (R2,292.0 million) (tax effect: 
US$49.0 million (R687.6 million) at GFIJVH and an assessed loss balance of US$182.3 million (R2,558.2 million) (tax effect: US$54.7 million 
(R767.5 million) at GFO.

During the September 2014 quarter, the South African Revenue Services (SARS) issued a Finalisation of Audit Letter (the Audit Letter) stating that 
SAR has restated GFIJH's Additional Capital Allowance balance reflected on its 2011 tax return from US$163.4 million (R2,292.0 million) to nil.  The 
tax effect of this amount is US$49.0 million (R687.6 million) that being the amount referred to above as Additional Capital Allowance.

The Additional Capital Allowance was claimed by GFIJVH in terms of section 36(11)(c) of the South African Income Tax Act, 1962 (the Act). The 
Additional Capital Allowance provides an incentive for new mining development and only applies to unredeemed capital expenditure. The Additional 
Capital Allowance allows a 12 per cent capital allowance over and above actual capital expenditure incurred on developing a deep level gold mine, as 
well as a further annual 12 per cent allowance on the mine's unredeemed capital expenditure balance brought forward, until the year that the mine 
starts earning mining taxable income (i.e. when all tax losses and unredeemed capital expenditure have been fully utilised).

In order to qualify for the Additional Capital Allowance, South Deep must qualify as a 'post 1990 gold mine' as defined in the Act.  A 'post 1990 gold 
mine', according to the Act, is defined as 'a gold mine which, in the opinion of the Director General: Mineral and Energy Affairs, is an independent 
workable proposition and in respect of which a mining authorisation for gold mining was issued for the first time after 14 March 1990'.

During 1999, the Director-General: Minerals and Energy Affairs (DME) and SARS confirmed, in writing, that FIJVH is a 'post 1990 gold mine' as defined, 
and therefore qualified for the Additional Capital Allowance.  Relying on these representations, GFIJVH subsequently filed its tax returns on this 
basis, as was confirmed by the DME and SARS.

In the Audit Letter, SARS stated that both the DME and SARS erred in issuing the confirmations as mentioned above and that GFIJVH does not qualify as 
a 'post 1990 gold mine' and therefore does not qualify for the Additional Capital Allowance.

The Group has taken legal advice on the matter and was advised by external Senior Counsel that SARS should not be allowed to disallow the claiming of 
the Additional Capital Allowance. GFIJVH has in the meantime not only formally appealed against the position taken by SARS, but also filed an 
application in the High Court and will vigorously defend its position.  A trial date in the Tax Court has been set for October 2017.

Accordingly, no adjustment for any effects on the Company that may result from the proceedings, if any, has been made in the condensed consolidated 
financial statements.

GOLD WORKING GROUP
The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group (the ""Working Group""), made up of African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold 
Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold, remains of the view that achieving a mutually acceptable comprehensive settlement which is both fair to past, 
present and future employees, and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation.  Notwithstanding that the companies deny

MINING CHARTER OWNERSHIP ELEMENT DECLARATION APPLICATION
Gold Fields remains committed to, through the South African Chamber of Mines (""Chamber""), open and transparent negotiations with the Department of 
Mineral Resources, relating to the Draft Reviewed Mining Charter published without consultation with industry in early 2016.  The Chamber is concerned 
with a number of the proposals put forward in the Draft Reviewed Mining Charter which it believes are ill-conceived and/or unachievable targets which 
will in all likelihood have a negative effect on the continued sustainability of the mining industry in South Africa.  Negotiations in this regard are 
ongoing.
 
With regards to the Declaratory Order, as previously reported, the Chamber commenced a court application (with the agreement of the previous Minister 
of Mines, Minister Ramatlhodi) against the Minister and Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources regarding continuing consequences of 
previous BEE deals.  Until an agreed outcome has been reached with regards to the Draft Reviewed Mining Charter, the Chamber has decided not to 
withdraw the application but has not yet applied for a hearing date, which it can do at any time.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WRITE-OFFS
Asset impairments and write-offs recognised by the Group during 2016 include:
-  Cash-generating unit impairment of US$66 million at Cerro Corona.  The impairment calculation is based on the 2016 life of mine plan using the  
   following assumptions:
   -  Gold price 2017: US$1,100 per ounce, 2018: US$1,200 per ounce, 2019 onwards: US$1,300 per ounce;
   -  Copper price 2017 and 2018: US$2.50 per pound, 2019 onwards: US$2.80 per pound;
   -  Resource price US$60 per ounce;
   -  Life of mine: 7 years; and
   -  Discount rate: 4.8 per cent.
   The impairment is due to a reduction in gold and copper reserves due to depletion, a decrease in the gold and copper price assumptions for 2017 
   and 2018, a lower resource price and an increase in the Peru tax rate. 
-  Impairment of the fleet at Damang (US$10 million). 

PROFIT ON SALE OF ASSETS
Profit on sale of assets includes US$48 million relating to the sale of a royalty portfolio during December 2016.  The consideration received included 
42.85 million common shares and 10 million common share purchase warrants of Maverix Metals Inc.  The investment in common shares has been accounted 
for as an equity accounted investee amounting to US$42 million and the warrants as a derivative instrument with a fair value of US$6 million.

GRUYERE ACQUISITION
Gold Fields acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Gruyere Gold Project during December 2016 for a total purchase consideration of A$350 million 
(US$273 million) payable in cash and a 1.5 per cent royalty on Gold Field's share of production after the total mine production exceeds 2 million 
ounces.  The purchase consideration comprises A$250 million (US$185 million) payable on the effective date (13 December 2016), and A$100 million 
(US$74 million) payable according to an agreed construction cash call schedule.  In addition, transaction costs of A$19 million (US$14 million) were 
incurred and capitalised.  The 1.5 per cent royalty will be accounted for as the production milestones are met.  The 50 per cent interest in the 
project will be accounted for as a joint operation. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition.

BOND BUY-BACK
On 19 February 2016, Gold Fields announced an offer to purchase US$200 million of the US$1 billion notes outstanding.  Gold Fields accepted the 
purchase of an aggregate principal amount of notes equal to US$148 million at the purchase price of US$880 per US$1,000 in principal amount of notes.  
A profit of US$18 million was recognised on the buy-back of the notes.

EQUITY RAISING
On 17 March 2016, Gold Fields successfully completed a US$152 million (R2.3 billion) accelerated equity raising by way of a private placement, to 
institutional investors.  A total number of 38,857,913 new Gold Fields shares were placed at a price of R59.50 per share. 

CREDIT FACILITIES SUCCESSFULLY REFINANCED
Gold Fields successfully refinanced its US$1,440 million credit facilities due in November 2017.  The new facilities amount to US$1,290 million and 
comprise three tranches:
-  US$380 million: 3 year term loan maturing in June 2019 - margin 250 basis points (bps) over Libor;
-  US$360 million: 3 year revolving credit facility (RCF) also maturing in June 2019 (with an option to extend to up to 5 years) - margin 220bps 
   over Libor; and
-  US$550 million: 5 year RCF maturing in June 2021 - margin 245bps over Libor.

The new facilities were concluded with a syndicate of 15 banks.  On average, the interest rate on the new facilities is similar to the interest rate 
on the existing facilities.  A total of US$645 million was drawn down from the new facilities on 13 June 2016 to repay the group's existing 
US$ facilities, with US$645 million remaining unutilised. The refinancing is a key milestone in Gold Fields' balance sheet management and increases 
the maturity of its core debt, with the first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 2017).

HEDGING/DERIVATIVES (Reviewed) 

The Group's policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken as follows:
-  to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
-  for specific debt servicing requirements; and 
-  to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

Derivative instruments*
South Africa
On 25 February 2016, USD/ZAR forward exchange contracts were entered into for a total delivery of US$69.8 million starting July 2016 until December 2016.  The average forward rate achieved over the 6 month period was R16.8273.

The hedge was delivered into July and August and the balance closed out in September 2016.  The average rate achieved on delivery and close out was R13.8010, resulting in a positive cash flow and realised a gain on financial instruments of R211 million (US$14 million) recognised in profit or loss.

Gold production increased by 16 per cent from 2,160 kilograms (69,400 ounces) in the September quarter to 2,516 kilograms 
(80,900 ounces) in the December quarter mainly due to a 5 per cent increase in tonnes treated and a 10 per cent increase in recovered 
head grade. 

Underground reef tonnes milled increased by 7 per cent from 427,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 455,000 tonnes in the December 
quarter giving an average of 152,000 reef tonnes per month.  Total tonnes milled increased by 5 per cent from 539,000 tonnes to 
565,000 tonnes due to an increase in underground material milled.  Total tonnes milled in the December quarter included 35,000 tonnes 
of underground development waste mined and 75,000 tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 26,000 tonnes of underground 
development waste mined and 86,000 tonnes of surface tailings material in the September quarter.  Underground reef yield increased by 
9 per cent from 5.04 grams per tonne to 5.51 grams per tonne mainly due to fruition of the longhole stoping operating model implemented 
in June 2016. This model has expedited critical work (development, backfill and secondary support) required to make longhole stopes 
available.

Development increased by 13 per cent from 1,812 metres in the September quarter to 2,043 metres in the December quarter to promote 
longhole stope availability.  New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 3 per cent from 204 metres in the 
September quarter to 210 metres in the December quarter.  Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above increased by 
14 per cent from 1,608 metres to 1,833 metres.  Destress mining decreased by 3 per cent from 6,340 square metres in the September 
quarter to 6,148 square metres in the December quarter mainly due to the unfortunate fatal accident on 10 September 2016. In addition, 
two destress cuts were temporarily stopped as a result of the intersection of geological features. Together, these incidents resulted 
in the loss of 5 days of destress production.  Longhole stoping increased by 31 per cent from 192,000 tonnes to 252,000 tonnes, a 
record achievement for the mine.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 63 per cent of the ore tonnes in the December quarter, compared with 64 per cent in 
the September quarter.  The longhole stoping method accounted for 51 per cent of total ore tonnes mined in the December quarter 
compared with 48 per cent in the September quarter. 

Net operating costs decreased by 1 per cent from R1,022 million (US$72 million) to R1,012 million (US$73 million) mainly due to lower 
payroll charges.  Gold-in-process amounted to R11 million (US$1 million) and related to unsold gold at the end of the December quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from R234 million (US$17 million) in the September quarter to R228 million (US$17 million) 
in the December quarter.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 3 per cent from R207 million (US$15 million) in the September quarter to R200 million 
(US$15 million) in the December quarter.  Non-sustaining capital expenditure was similar at R28 million (US$2 million).

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 17 per cent from R586,712 per kilogram (US$1,289 per ounce) in the September quarter to 
R488,534 per kilogram (US$1,097 per ounce) in the December quarter mainly due to increased gold sold, lower sustaining capital 
expenditure and lower net operating costs.

Total all-in cost decreased by 17 per cent from R599,245 per kilogram (US$1,317 per ounce) in the September quarter to R499,954 per 
kilogram (US$1,122 per ounce) in the December quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 148,600 ounces in the September quarter to 145,900 ounces in the December quarter due to 
lower plant throughput. 

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 3 per cent from 25.3 million tonnes in the September quarter to 
24.5 million tonnes in the December quarter.  Ore tonnes mined increased by 17 per cent from 3.6 million tonnes to 4.2 million tonnes 
due to a higher number of available face positions in line with the mining sequence.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 
29 per cent from 11.2 million tonnes to 7.9 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined increased by 18 per cent from 10.5 million 
tonnes to 12.4 million tonnes, both as per the mining sequence.  Grade mined decreased from 1.41 grams per tonne to 1.35 grams per 
tonne.  The strip ratio decreased from 6.5 to 5.3. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased by 4 per cent from 3.48 million tonnes in the September quarter to 3.33 million tonnes in the 
December quarter due to earlier than planned Sag and Ball mill relining.  Realised yield increased by 2 per cent from 1.33 grams per 
tonne to 1.36 grams per tonne due to higher grades processed.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 8 per cent from US$89 million to US$82 million due to an 
US$8 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the December quarter compared with US$1 million in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 11 per cent from US$37 million to US$41 million due to higher expenditure on deferred stripping as a 
result of higher capital tonnes mined.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent from US$950 per ounce in the September quarter to US$906 per 
ounce in the December quarter due to lower net operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 38,900 ounces in the September quarter to 36,900 ounces in the December quarter mainly 
due to lower head grade processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 13 per cent from 4.8 million tonnes in the September quarter to 
4.2 million tonnes in the December quarter mainly due to lower equipment availability, given the age of the fleet and pending the full 
transition to contractor mining. 

Ore tonnes mined increased by 33 per cent from 0.6 million tonnes in the September quarter to 0.8 million tonnes in the December 
quarter.  Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 19 per cent from 4.2 million tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes.  Capital waste tonnes 
(included in total waste tonnes) decreased by 76 per cent from 3.6 million tonnes to 0.9 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes 
increased from 0.6 million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes. Head grade mined increased by 2 per cent from 1.20 grams per tonne to 
1.22 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio decreased from 7.1 to 4.2.

Yield decreased by 5 per cent from 1.07 grams per tonne to 1.02 grams per tonne due to lower grade realised from stockpile ore 
processed.  For the December quarter, 0.66 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.26 grams per 
tonne and 0.47 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 1.01 grams per tonne.  This compared with 0.41 million 
tonnes of fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.21 grams per tonne and 0.72 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an 
average grade of 1.18 grams per tonne for the September quarter.  As a consequence, tonnes processed were similar at 1.13 million 
tonnes.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 30 per cent from US$27 million to US$35 million mainly due to 
increased operating tonnes mined and a gold-in-process charge to cost of US$1 million in the December quarter compared with a credit to 
cost of US$2 million in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 31 per cent from US$16 million to US$11 million mainly due to lower capital waste stripping in the 
December quarter.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 11 per cent from US$1,182 per ounce in the September quarter to US$1,317 per 
ounce in the December quarter mainly due to lower gold sold and higher net operating cost, partially offset by lower capital

Gold production increased by 27 per cent from 35,100 ounces in the September quarter to 44,600 ounces in the December quarter.  Copper 
production increased by 19 per cent from 7,293 tonnes to 8,681 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production increased by 33 per cent from 
61,200 ounces to 81,500 ounces.  The increase in gold and copper production was mainly due to higher gold and copper head grades in 
line with the mining sequence.  Gold head grade increased by 21 per cent from 1.00 grams per tonne to 1.21 grams per tonne and copper 
head grade increased by 18 per cent from 0.51 per cent to 0.60 per cent.  Gold recoveries increased from 66.5 per cent to 68.7 per cent 
mainly due to lower presence of fine porous pyrite in ore treated during November and December.  Copper recoveries increased from 
86.4 per cent to 86.5 per cent.  As a result, gold yield increased by 24 per cent from 0.67 grams per tonne to 0.83 grams per tonne and 
copper yield increased by 18 per cent from 0.44 per cent to 0.52 per cent. 

In the December quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 46,000 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,208 per ounce 
and 8,549 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$4,626 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared 
with 36,200 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,334 per ounce and 7,479 tonnes of copper that was sold at an 
average price of US$3,974 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the September quarter. 

Total tonnes mined decreased by 9 per cent from 3.60 million tonnes in the September quarter to 3.29 million tonnes in the December 
quarter mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence.  Ore mined decreased by 3 per cent from 1.78 million tonnes 
to 1.73 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 1.82 million tonnes to 1.56 million tonnes.

Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.71 million tonnes in the September quarter to 1.74 million tonnes in the December quarter 
mainly due to higher throughput (833 tonnes per hour in the December quarter versus 829 tonnes per hour in the September quarter) and 
higher plant availability (97 per cent in the December quarter versus 93 per cent in the September quarter) due to maintenance 
activities.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 5 per cent from US$38 million to US$40 million mainly due to 
increases in the diesel price and grinding media as well as increased statutory workers participation.  

Capital expenditure increased by 7 per cent from US$15 million to US$16 million and related to the construction activities at the 
tailings dam and waste storage facilities. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce decreased by 60 per cent from US$765 per ounce in the September quarter 
to US$303 per ounce in the December quarter mainly due to higher gold sold and higher copper by-product credits, partially offset by 
higher net operating costs.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce decreased by 28 per cent from 
US$945 per equivalent ounce to US$676 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above, as well as higher equivalent ounces sold.

At the underground operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 10 per cent from 157,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 142,000 tonnes 
in the December quarter due to a deterioration of ground conditions at Hamlet.  Head grade decreased by 3 per cent from 4.78 grams per 
tonne to 4.65 grams per tonne due to scheduling.  

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 962,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 831,000 tonnes 
in the December quarter due to ore production being impacted by the removal of the temporary western ramp into the Invincible pit. The 
interim ramp was installed to connect Stage 3 and Stage 5 of the Invincible pit. It allowed for considerable savings in haulage costs, 
there was no room to leave it in place.  Grade mined increased by 8 per cent from 2.54 grams per tonne to 2.74 grams per tonne due to 
higher grade of ore mined from Stage 3 of the Invincible pit.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 136 per cent from 2.2 million tonnes in the September quarter to 5.2 million tonnes in the 
December quarter following the completion of pre-strip activities at Invincible Stage 5 pit during the December quarter.  The 
classification of the material changed from capital waste to operational waste and as a result, capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 
45 per cent from 7.7 million tonnes to 4.2 million tonnes.  Total material movements at the open pits decreased by 6 per cent from 
10.9 million tonnes to 10.2 million tonnes.  The strip ratio increased from 10.3 to 11.3 due to the reduced ore tonnes while the 
western ramp was being removed.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 9 per cent from 1,005,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 1,094,000 tonnes in the 
December quarter.  The mill was closed for the first week of the September quarter to complete the installation of a new electrical 
control block for the Sag mill.  Yield decreased by 4 per cent from 2.83 grams per tonne to 2.72 grams per tonne with the additional 
tonnes milled comprising lower grade feed. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 23 per cent from A$61 million (US$46 million) to A$75 million 
(US$56 million) due to the Invincible Stage 5 pit transitioning from pre-stripping to ore and waste mining.  This increase was fully 
offset by a reduction in pre-strip capital costs.   

Capital expenditure decreased by 35 per cent from A$57 million (US$43 million) to A$37 million (US$28 million) mainly due to decreased 
expenditure on pre-stripping at Invincible.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 12 per cent from A$1,383 per ounce (US$1,050 per ounce) in the September 
quarter to A$1,213 per ounce (US$914 per ounce) in the December quarter due to lower capital expenditure and increased gold sold, 
partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Ore mined from underground increased by 8 per cent from 325,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 352,000 tonnes in the December 
quarter due to the availability of additional ore development headings in the Cinderella orebody at New Holland and multiple stoping 
fronts on line in the FBH orebody at Waroonga.  Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 7 per cent from 51,500 tonnes in the 
September quarter to 55,100 tonnes in the December quarter. Head grade mined decreased marginally from 6.25 grams per tonne to 
6.20 grams per tonnes due to an increase in development ore. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 312,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 298,000 tonnes in the December quarter. 
The combined yield increased by 12 per cent from 5.78 grams per tonne to 6.49 grams per tonne due to the mill being preferentially fed 
higher grade ore.  
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 7 per cent from A$45 million (US$34 million) to A$48 million 
(US$36 million) mainly due to increased ore mined during the December quarter.  

Capital expenditure decreased by 18 per cent from A$22 million (US$17 million) to A$18 million (US$13 million) due to lower capital 
development at Waroonga following the completion of the Waroonga North exploration drive during the September quarter.

Gold production decreased by 8 per cent from 15,300 ounces in the September quarter to 14,000 ounces in the December quarter due to 
lower underground grades mined. 

Ore mined from underground decreased from 109,300 tonnes in the September quarter to 106,500 tonnes in the December quarter.  In 
addition, a further 2,500 tonnes were sourced from a surface oxide trial in the December quarter.  Head grade mined decreased from 
4.32 grams per tonne in the September quarter to 3.96 grams per tonne in the December quarter.  The reduced grade was due to mining of 
the lower grade bulk Felsic's area of Lords South Lower during the December quarter. 

Tonnes processed increased by 2 per cent from 111,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 113,000 tonnes in the December quarter.  
The yield decreased by 10 per cent from 4.27 grams per tonne to 3.87 grams per tonne mainly due to lower grade ore mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 12 per cent from A$17 million (US$13 million) to A$19 million 
(US$15 million) mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) gold-in-circuit charge to cost in the December quarter compared with A$nil 
million (US$nil million) in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 14 per cent from A$7 million (US$5 million) to A$8 million (US$6 million) mainly due to exploration 
and development of the Oval ore body.  The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to provide the primary ore feed in 
2017.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 14 per cent from A$1,688 per ounce (US$1,286 per ounce) in the September 
quarter to A$1,921 per ounce (US$1,443 per ounce) in the December quarter due to lower gold sold, higher net operating costs and higher 
capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 7 per cent from 72,800 ounces in the September quarter to 67,400 ounces in the December quarter mainly 
due to a reduction in tonnes processed.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 2 per cent from 381,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 374,000 tonnes mainly due to the 
excavation of two major ventilation raises (VR4 and VR7) in the December quarter.  Head grade mined increased by 4 per cent from 
6.56 grams per tonne in the September quarter to 6.84 grams per tonne in the December quarter as production returned to the higher 
grade areas in Zone 90.

Tonnes processed decreased by 13 per cent from 376,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 329,000 tonnes in the December quarter 
mainly due to timing of the mill campaign in December which allowed critical maintenance work and subsequently resulted in a stockpile 
being accumulated at year end. The yield increased by 6 per cent from 6.03 grams per tonne to 6.37 grams per tonne reflecting the 
higher grades mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 9 per cent from A$46 million (US$35 million) in the September 
quarter to A$42 million (US$32 million) in the December quarter.  The lower operating cost was due to a A$7 million (US$5 million) 
gold-in-process credit to cost compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 6 per cent from A$34 million (US$26 million) in the September quarter to A$36 million (US$27 million) 
in the December quarter mainly due to higher expenditure related to the purchase of fleet.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent from A$1,167 per ounce (US$885 per ounce) in the September 
quarter to A$1,175 per ounce (US$885 per ounce) in the December quarter due to the lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net 
operating costs.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

To the shareholders of Gold Fields Limited
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited, which comprise the condensed consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016, the condensed consolidated income statement and the condensed consolidated 
statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and selected explanatory notes, as set 
out on pages 16 to 23 and marked as reviewed, and the segmental financial results for the year ended 31 December 2016, as set out on 
pages 24 to 25 and marked as reviewed.

Directors' Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in the ""Basis of accounting"" note to 
the financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with International 
Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information performed by the independent auditor of 
the entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial 
statements are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard 
also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.
A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily 
consisting of making inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and applying analytical procedures, and 
evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements 
of Gold Fields Limited for the year ended 31 December 2016 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports, as set out in the ""Basis of accounting"" note to the 
financial statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Trading statement for twelve months to 31 December 2016

Johannesburg, Friday, 3 February 2017: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields)
(JSE, NYSE: GFI) advises that earnings per share (EPS) for the twelve months
ended 31 December 2016 (FY 2016) are expected to be between 160% and 170%
(US$0.49 to US$0.52) higher than the loss per share of US$0.31 reported for
the twelve months ended 31 December 2015 (FY 2015), at a range between
US$0.18 and US$0.21.

Headline earnings per share (HEPS) for FY 2016 are expected to be between
730% and 780% (US$0.29 to US$0.31) higher than the headline loss per share
of US$0.04 reported for FY 2015, at a range between US$0.25 and US$0.27.

In addition, normalised earnings per share for the period are expected to be
between 280% and 320% (US$0.17 to US$0.19) higher than the normalised
earnings per share of US$0.06 reported for FY 2015, at a range between
US$0.23 and US$0.25.

The increases in EPS, HEPS and normalised earnings are primarily driven by
an increase in the US$ gold price (8% YoY) and lower net operating costs in
local currencies as well as the impact of converting these costs at weaker
exchange rates. In addition, EPS is impacted by lower non-recurring items.
In FY 2016, the A$ was 1% weaker YoY and the rand was 13% weaker YoY,
against the US$.

For FY 2016, attributable gold equivalent production is expected to be
2,146koz (FY 2015: 2,159koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of
US$980/oz (FY 2015: US$1,007/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of US$1,006/oz (FY
2015: US$1,026/oz). This compares to revised guidance of 2,100koz  2,150koz
at AISC of US$1,000/oz  US$1,010/oz and AIC of US$1,035/oz  US$1,045/oz.

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q4 2016 is expected to be 566koz
(Q3 2016: 537koz), with AISC of US$911/oz (Q3 2016: US$1,026/oz) and AIC of
US$941/oz (Q3 2016: US$1,038/oz)

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed, and reported on, by the Companys external auditors.

Gold Fields will release FY 2016 financial results on Thursday, 16 February
2017.

GOLD FIELDS ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL OF JOINT ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FOR KIRKLAND
LAKE; REMAINS INTERESTED IN A NEGOTIATED TRANSACTION

Johannesburg, 18 November 2016:    Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) announces that it and Silver Standard Resources Inc. (Silver
Standard) (TSX:SRO, Nasdaq: SSRI) have today withdrawn their latest joint
proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Kirkland Lake Gold Inc.
(Kirkland Lake) (TSX: KLG) in a negotiated transaction.

As previously announced by Gold Fields, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold
Fields Netherlands Services B.V., has made three successive proposals
jointly with Silver Standard to acquire Kirkland Lake pursuant to a plan of
arrangement for consideration consisting of cash and shares of Silver
Standard or a combination thereof. In response to each proposal, the
Kirkland Lake board advised that it had determined that it was not
reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal relative to Kirkland
Lakes previously announced combination with Newmarket Gold Inc. (Newmarket)
(TSX: NMI), and that Kirkland Lake would not be engaging in any discussions
with Gold Fields or Silver Standard or providing them with due diligence
access.

In light of the lack of engagement by the board of Kirkland Lake in response
to these proposals, and there being no basis to expect any further
engagement from Kirkland Lake, Gold Fields and Silver Standard are left with
no choice but to withdraw their latest proposal.

Gold Fields remains interested in pursuing negotiations toward a board-
supported transaction with Kirkland Lake in the event that Kirkland Lakes
shareholders reject the Newmarket transaction.

This press release is not, and is not intended to be, a solicitation by Gold
Fields of proxies from any shareholder of Kirkland Lake or Newmarket. Gold
Fields does not seek the power to act, and will not act, as proxy for any
shareholder of either company.

CATEGORY 2 TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENT: ACQUISITION OF 50% OF GOLD ROADS
GRUYERE GOLD PROJECT

1. Introduction

Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE, DIFX: GFI) is pleased to
announce that it has, through its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary
Gruyere Mining Company Pty Ltd, agreed to acquire a 50% interest in ASX
listed Gold Road Resources Limiteds (ASX: GOR) (Gold Road) Gruyere Gold
Project (Gruyere) in Western Australia and to form a 50:50 unincorporated
joint venture over Gruyere (Gruyere Joint Venture) to develop, construct
and operate Gruyere. The acquired interest and Gruyere Joint Venture
includes the Gruyere, Central Bore, Attila/Alaric and other associated
deposits.

Gruyere is a large shear hosted porphyry gold deposit, with reserves of
3.5Moz and total resources of 6.2Moz. Gold Roads drilling demonstrates
that mineralisation likely continues at depth beneath the planned pit
shell. The deposits at Central Bore (0.7Mt, 9.1g/t, 187koz) and
Attila/Alaric (5.3Mt, 1.64g/t, 270koz), could further add additional value
to the Gruyere development. Including these other ore sources, the JV has
total resources of 6.6Moz.

2. Description of the business carried on by Gold Road

Gold Road is pioneering development of Australias newest goldfield, the
Yamarna Belt, 200 kilometres east of Laverton in Western Australia. Gold
Road holds tenements covering 5,000km2 in the region, which is
historically underexplored and highly prospective for gold mineralisation.
These tenements contain a gold resource of 6.6Moz, including 6.2Moz at the
Gruyere deposit, which Gold Road discovered in 2013.

In addition to its retained 50% interest in Gruyere, Gold Road will
continue to explore for similar-scale deposits on its 100% owned North
Yamarna tenements and in conjunction with its joint venture partner,
Sumitomo Metal Mining Oceania (a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.
Limited), on its South Yamarna tenements.

3. Particulars of the Proposed Transaction

Gold Fields will acquire a 50% interest in Gruyere for a total purchase
consideration of A$350 million payable in cash and a 1.5% royalty on Gold
Fields share of production after total mine production exceeds 2Moz with
an approximate value of A$15 million. The cash consideration will be
split, with A$250 million payable at completion and A$100 million payable
according to an agreed construction cash call schedule. The consideration
will be funded utilising existing cash resources in Australia.
The aggregate consideration comprises:

?   cash consideration of A$350 million, comprising A$250 million payable
    on completion of the transaction and A$100 million contributed by
    Gold Fields to fund Gold Roads cash calls during the construction
    phase;
?   a 1.5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on Gold Fields share of
    production from the Gruyere Joint Venture tenements, once total gold
    production exceeds 2Moz with an approximate value of A$15 million;

    Gold Fields will also contribute the following to the Gruyere Joint
    Venture in addition to contributions to construction cash calls):

    -   approximately A$50 million in the form of conditional assumed
        liability by Gold Fields for up to a 10% overrun (if any) on the
        Gruyere initial development program and budget as agreed between
        the parties;
    -   approximately A$75 million in funding support, in the form of a
        Gold Fields guarantee for any project-level bonding or guarantee
        requirements, to the extent required under the Gruyere Joint
        Venture;

4. Structure of the joint venture:

-   Gold Fields and Gold Road will establish a 50:50 unincorporated joint
    venture, the Gruyere Joint Venture, to develop and operate the
    Gruyere Gold Project, with both parties assuming responsibility for
    their respective share of post-feasibility study expenditure;
-   Gold Road will continue to manage the Gruyere Gold Project during a
    transition period of up to 6 months post completion, after which Gold
    Fields will become the manager on a no profit / no loss basis,
    where a management fee will be payable to Gold Fields to recover
    certain overhead costs that are not recovered directly through joint
    venture cash calls (such costs to be estimated and then subject to
    periodic adjustment and review);
-   a Management Committee, a Technical Committee and a Steering
    Committee will be formed during the development and commissioning
    stages of the Gruyere Joint Venture. The committees will be
    responsible for providing oversight of Gold Fields, as the Manager,
    and approving key decisions including business plans and budgets;
-   Gold Road and Gold Fields will initially have the right to appoint
    three representatives each to the respective committees;
-   the initial Chairperson of the Gruyere Joint Venture will be
    appointed by Gold Road during the transition period, after which the
    right to nominate the Chairperson will rotate every 12 months, unless
    changed by supermajority vote. The Chairperson will not hold a
    casting vote;
-   pre-emptive rights will exist in relation to the transfer of all or
    part of a joint venturers interest to a non-affiliated party, except
    in relation to a change of control at the listed parent company
    level;
-   Gold Road will maintain an ability to process ore from its 100%-owned
    North Yamarna and 50%-owned South Yamarna tenements through the
    Gruyere processing plant under a conditional commercial tolling
    framework;
-       Gold Road will maintain access rights to the extensive infrastructure
        developed by the Gruyere Joint Venture, including the bore fields,
        gas pipeline, tailings dam, airstrip, roads, transport equipment,
        emergency equipment, communications infrastructure; and
-       Gold Road and Gold Fields have provided warranties and indemnities to
        each other that are standard for a transaction of this nature.
5. Rationale for the Acquisition

Australia is a key part of our business and our largest cash generator and
this deal enhances our portfolio and expands our exposure to a new and
emerging goldfield in Western Australia. Gruyere will add life, margin and
cash flow into what is already a strong region for Gold Fields and which
has proven its ability to integrate new operations with ease. We are
excited about partnering with Gold Road and are hopeful this is the start
of a multi-decade, mutually beneficial relationship and see significant
potential synergies in resourcing, intellectual property, procurement and
technical skills.

We believe this acquisition is extremely competitive on a per ounce basis,
when compared to similar recent deals globally, at A$200 (US$153) per
reserve ounce and A$113 (US$86) per resource ounce.

The Feasibility Study for Gruyere, which was completed in October 2016,
indicated the Projects 3.5Moz reserve (6.2Moz resource) could support
average annualised production of 270koz for a 13-year life of mine (LOM).
All-in sustaining costs (AISC) over the LOM are expected to be A$945/oz
(US$690/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of A$1,103/oz (US$805/oz), with
construction capital expenditure estimated at A$507 million. First
production from Gruyere is expected at the end of 2018/early 2019.

DAMANG REINVESTMENT PLAN


Johannesburg, 24 October 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to
announce the Reinvestment Plan for the Damang Gold mine in Ghana which will extend the life of
mine (LOM) by eight years from 2017 to 2024. The Reinvestment Plan, entails Gold Fields investing
US$1.4bn (operating and capital expenditure) over the LOM. It will enhance the Groups presence in
one of its key operating regions and will result in significant social benefits for Ghana, including the
creation and preservation of 1,850 direct jobs.

Over the LOM, a total of 165Mt will be mined, with 32Mt processed at a grade of 1.65g/t, resulting in
total gold production of 1.56Moz. Mining and processing costs are estimated to average US$3.60/t and
US$16.25/t, respectively while all-in costs (AIC) are forecast to average US$950/oz. The benefits of
the Development Agreement (signed between Gold Fields and the Government of Ghana in March
2016), have been key inputs into the Plan and enhances the economics of the project.

The Reinvestment Plan is based on mineral resource models that have been updated in 2016 and
extensively reviewed both internally and by external consultants, namely SRK, Optiro and Rowley
Geological Services (RGS).

Since operations at Damang commenced in 1997, the mine has produced in excess of 4.0Moz,
sourced from multiple open pits. Production from the Damang Pit Cutback (DPCB) came to an end in
2013, and since then mining has focused on the margins of the Damang pit (the Huni, Juno and
Saddle areas) as well as lower grade satellite deposits. The decline in production since 2013 has been
exacerbated by variations in grade in the northern and southern extremities of the DPCB and the
satellite pits where grades have been lower than expected.

Consequently, a strategic review of Damang commenced in 2015 which identified that Gold Fields
should return to mining the higher grade core of the main Damang orebody. Evaluation work in 2015
and 2016 considered a number of options, including:
    - Care and maintenance (C&M)
    - Closure
    - Continuing operations
    - Expanding operations
Given the importance of the region to the Group and taking into account the benefits of the
Development Agreement, Gold Fields has taken the decision to continue operations at Damang
through the Reinvestment Plan. The Group will also retain the optionality to expand the operation
should the gold price strengthen sustainably to above US$1,400/oz.

The Reinvestment Plan entails a major cut back to both the eastern and western walls of the DPCB.
The cut back will have a total depth of 341m, comprising of a 265m pre-strip to access the base of the
existing pit. This will be followed by a deepening of the pit by a further 76m which will ultimately provide
access to the full Damang orebody including the high grade Tarkwa Phyllite lithology. To provide short
term ore supply, while the Damang pre-strip is in progress, mining will continue at the Amoanda, and
                                                      2


paleaoplacer satellite pits (Lima South, Kwesi Gap and Tomento East). In addition, the plant feed will
be supplemented by low grade surface stockpiles.

Inclusion of the Damang cutback will result in a 72% increase in Proven and Probable Reserves to
1.68Moz (31.5Mt @1.65g/t) compared with the December 2015 figure.

Mining will be undertaken by two mining contractors, with negotiations currently at an advanced stage.
At this stage, the contractors are expected to be mobilised early in 2017. A total of 165Mt will be mined
over a 7-year period, with the majority of material coming from the Damang Complex (DCPB/Saddle).
Of this 32Mt will be processed at a grade of 1.65g/t, resulting in 1.56Moz of gold production.
Operational metrics for the project are summarised in the table below:

Apart from the waste strip, the only other significant capital required is for the construction of the Far
East Tailings Storage Facility (FETSF) as the existing tailings storage facility (TSF) is approaching full
capacity. An interim 2.5m raise has commenced on the TSF, which will provide for an additional 3.6Mt
tailings capacity and is due for completion by the end of November 2016. Stage 1 of the new FETSF is
planned for completion by end-2017 and will provide 20Mt capacity. Further lifts of the FETSF will cater
for all tailings for the new LOM. Only minor capital work will be required on the Damang Processing
Plant, mostly due to replacement of the SAG Mill shell in 2018.
                                                                       3


In addition to the attractive returns associated with the project, the Reinvestment Plan will result in
significant social and fiscal benefits flowing into Ghana and, more importantly, the communities
surrounding Damang.

Gold Fields estimates direct employment associated with the Reinvestment Plan of 1,850 people. Of
this:
    - 368 will be Gold Fields employees, 55% of whom will come from the adjacent communities;
    - 90 will be on fixed term contracts, all from the catchment community; and
    - Approximately 1,400 will be contractor employees, 60% of whom will come from local
       communities.

Assuming a dependency ratio in Ghana around eight dependents per direct mining job, the spin-off
benefits of the new and retained jobs will be significant.

Investment in sustainable development projects is estimated to be US$5.0m over the eight-year period.
This will be split between education (US$1.5m), health (US$0.2m), water and sanitation (US$0.7m),
agriculture (US$1.6m) and infrastructure (US$1.0m).

Gold Fields has also commenced the tarring of the road between Damang and Tarkwa, estimated to
cost US$17m, which is expected to have benefits for the mines as well as local stakeholders.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

OVERVIEW AND UPDATE

The gold industry had a much more buoyant Q3 2016 driven by the higher US$ gold price, however, this has waned post quarter-end, with 
the gold price having pulled back in recent weeks. At Gold Fields, we remain focused on delivering on our strategic objectives, despite 
the moves in the gold price, including the positioning of the portfolio to withstand lower prices.
 
Regrettably, we had a fatality at South Deep during the quarter (as previously reported), following a seismic event. While we have made 
good progress on safety across the Group, the incident is a tragic reminder that we still have more work to do and our efforts to 
achieve zero harm will continue. 

Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 4% lower YoY (2% higher QoQ) at 537koz. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were 
8% higher YoY (flat QoQ) at US$1,026/oz and all-in costs (AIC) were 8% higher YoY (2% lower QoQ) at US$1,038/oz. Year to date, both 
AISC and AIC are tracking below the cost guidance for the full year provided in February 2016. The average US$ gold price achieved in 
the quarter was 20% or US$226/oz higher YoY (7% or US$87/oz higher QoQ). The average Australian dollar for the quarter was 0.76 
(4% stronger YoY and 1% stronger QoQ), while the average rand for the quarter was 14.15 (10% weaker YoY and 6% stronger QoQ). 

Production from South Deep was 26% higher YoY and 9% lower QoQ at 69koz, as a result of lower reef yield due to changes in mining mix. 
AIC was 2% higher YoY and 4% lower QoQ at R599,245/kg (US$1,317/oz). Destress mining decreased by 35% QoQ to 6,340 square metres due to 
the combined effect of the earlier than anticipated full adoption of the high profile destress method and the fatality which resulted 
in the cessation of destress mining across the operation for a two-week period. High profile destress accounted for 90% of total 
destress meters in Q3 2016.

Managed production in Ghana for Q3 2016 was 188koz, down 3% YoY (up 14% QoQ), with AIC of US$999/oz, up 4% YoY (down 7% QoQ). Gold 
equivalent production at Cerro Corona was 23% lower YoY and 5% lower QoQ at 61koz, with AIC of US$765 per equivalent ounce, up 2% YoY 
(up 28% QoQ). The Australian region produced 237koz for the quarter, down 5% YoY (down 1% QoQ), with AIC of A$1,303/oz (US$991/oz), 
up 11% YoY (up 2% QoQ).

Net cash flow and net debt
On the back of the increase in the US$ gold price during Q3 2016 and a favourable working capital movement, the net cash flow from 
operating activities (net of tax) less net capital expenditure, environmental payments and financing costs for the quarter was US$152m, 
2.5 times more than the net cash flow reported for H1 2016 (US$60m). Consequently, the net debt balance further reduced during the 
quarter to US$1,029m (30 June 2016: US$1,155m). We remain on track to beat our net debt to EBITDA target of 1x by year-end. 
FY16 outlook intact 

Guidance (upgraded in August 2016) for attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2016 remains unchanged at between 
2.10Moz and 2.15Moz. AISC is expected to be between US$1,000/oz and US$1,010/oz and AIC is expected to be between US$1,035/oz and 
US$1,045/oz, both unchanged from the guidance provided in February 2016.

Damang Reinvestment Project Approved 
As detailed in a separate release this morning, we are pleased to announce the Damang Reinvestment Project. The Project requires a cut 
back of the previously mined Damang pit and will result in an 8-year life of mine to 2024, with average annual production of about 
225koz and AIC of US$950/oz over the life. At a gold price of US$1,200/oz, the project has double-digit return metrics. The decision to 
reinvest in Damang would not have been possible without the Development Agreement (signed in March 2016) and we thank the Government of 
Ghana for creating an enabling environment for investment. 

Gold Fields rated top SA mining company on the DJSI
In September, Gold Fields was ranked the top South African mining company on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) 
benchmarking database.

The 2016 DJSI benchmarking database, indicates that Gold Fields sustainability practices rank with the best of resources companies 
worldwide. Gold Fields is ranked fifth in terms of all 44 mining companies on the DJSI and the third best global gold company.

Native claim at St Ives
Following the decision of the Full Federal Court in favour of St Ives, the Ngadju group applied for permission to appeal that decision 
to the High Court of Australia. On 14 October 2016, that request was declined by the High Court, leaving no other opportunity for 
review or appeal. St Ives continues to engage with the Ngadju group in relation to routine heritage surveys and other matters.

As previously mentioned, South Deep had a fatal accident during the September quarter. Mr Vakele Thafeni was fatally injured in a 
seismic related rock burst accident. Our sincere condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Thafeni. 

Gold production decreased by 9 per cent from 2,378 kilograms (76,500 ounces) in the June quarter to 2,160 kilograms (69,400 ounces) 
in the September quarter mainly due to a 11 per cent decrease in recovered head grade and the knock-on effect of the fatal accident. 
Mining operations halted for 10 production shifts with an estimated loss of 32,000 tonnes and 150 kilograms of gold (4,800 ounces).  

Underground reef tonnes milled increased by 2 per cent from 419,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 427,000 tonnes in the September 
quarter. Total tonnes milled decreased by 10 per cent from 601,000 tonnes to 539,000 tonnes due to a decrease in surface re-mining 
material milled. Re-mining of surface material was stopped in August to allow for processing of backlog underground tonnes. Total 
tonnes milled in the September quarter included 26,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 86,000 tonnes of surface 
tailings material compared with 24,000 tonnes of underground development waste mined and 158,000 tonnes of surface tailings material 
in the June quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by 11 per cent from 5.66 grams per tonne to 5.04 grams per tonne mainly due to 
increased volumes from typically lower grade development activities and due to a reduction in volumes from 3 West section, which at 
grades averaging between 7.0 grams per tonne and 8.0 grams per tonne, represents the highest grade section of the mine. Mining rates in 
3 West section were deliberately lowered to mitigate the risk of seismic activity associated with a prominent geological structure. 
In addition, the reef yield was negatively impacted by a 3 per cent increase in contribution in footwall waste development as a result 
of the acceleration in development to increase longhole stope availability.

Development increased by 1 per cent from 1,786 metres in the June quarter to 1,812 metres in the September quarter to promote longhole 
stope availability. New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) decreased by 9 per cent from 224 metres in the June quarter 
to 204 metres in the September quarter. This decrease was due to over achievement in the June quarter, but in line with the September 
quarter plan. Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above increased by 3 per cent from 1,562 metres to 1,608 metres. 
Destress mining decreased by 35 per cent from 9,687 square metres in the June quarter to 6,340 square metres in the September quarter. 
Low profile destress mining decreased by 83 per cent from 3,605 square metres to 621 square metres due to two low profile destress cuts 
reaching final limits and due to the strategic decision to convert, earlier than anticipated, the remaining low profile destress cut to 
the high profile method, in the September quarter, as previously communicated. Hanging wall ripping activities in the completed 
destress cuts to achieve required excavation heights, increased by 50 per cent from 10,500 tonnes in the June quarter to 15,700 tonnes 
in the September quarter, in order to provide early access to longhole stopes. One of the advantages of high profile destress mining 
is that ripping activities will no longer be required. High profile destress reduced by 6 per cent from 6,082 square metres to 
5,719 square metres mainly due to ground support rehabilitation. This being mitigated by the roll out of large localised pillars. The 
high profile and low profile methods contributed 90 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, to total destress mining in the quarter. 
Longhole stoping achieved for the quarter was 192,000 tonnes which is a record for the mine.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 64 per cent of the ore tonnes in the September quarter, while the new mine (below 
95 level) contributed 36 per cent. The long-hole stoping method accounted for 48 per cent of total ore tonnes mined in the September 
quarter compared with 39 per cent in the June quarter. 

Operating costs decreased by 1 per cent from R1,034 million (US$69 million) to R1,022 million (US$72 million) mainly due to lower 
bonuses paid in line with lower production, which was partially offset by higher electricity expenditure due to the inclusion of two 
months of winter tariff in the September quarter as opposed to one month only in the June quarter. 

Capital expenditure decreased by 44 per cent from R420 million (US$28 million) in the June quarter to R234 million (US$17 million) in 
the September quarter. The higher spending in the June quarter related to purchase of fleet and mining accommodation for employees.

Sustaining capital expenditure decreased by 47 per cent from R393 million (US$26 million) in the June quarter to R207 million 
(US$15 million) in the September quarter mainly due to additional fleet and the purchase of mining accommodation for employees in the 
June quarter. Non-sustaining capital expenditure was similar at R27 million (US$2 million).

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 5 per cent from R615,697 per kilogram (US$1,268 per ounce) in the June quarter to R586,712 per 
kilogram (US$1,289 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to decreased operating costs and lower sustaining capital 
expenditure, partially offset by decreased gold sold.

Total all-in cost decreased by 4 per cent from R627,233 per kilogram (US$1,293 per ounce) in the June quarter to R599,245 per kilogram 
(US$1,317 per ounce) in the September quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs.

Gold production increased by 29 per cent from 30,200 ounces in the June quarter to 38,900 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to 
higher tonnes processed and higher yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased by 9 per cent from 5.3 million tonnes in the June quarter to 4.8 million 
tonnes in the September quarter due to lower equipment availability, related to the age of the equipment. 

Ore tonnes mined were similar at 0.6 million. Total waste tonnes mined decreased by 11 per cent from 4.7 million tonnes in the June 
quarter to 4.2 million tonnes in the September quarter. Head grade mined decreased by 12 per cent from 1.37 grams per tonne to 
1.20 grams per tonne. The strip ratio decreased from 8.1 to 7.1.

Yield increased by 10 per cent from 0.97 grams per tonne to 1.07 grams per tonne due to a 2 per cent increase in plant recovery from 
90 per cent to 92 per cent and due to higher grade realised from stockpile ore processed as current mining volumes are not sufficient 
to fill the plant. For the September quarter, 0.41 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.21 grams 
per tonne and 0.72 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 1.18 grams per tonne. This compared with 
0.48 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.28 grams per tonne and 0.49 million tonnes of stockpiles 
milled at an average grade of 0.79 gram per tonne for the June quarter.

As a consequence, tonnes processed increased by 16 per cent from 0.97 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.13 million tonnes in the 
September quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 10 per cent from US$30 million to US$27 million mainly due to a 
gold-in-process credit to cost of US$2 million in the September quarter compared with a charge to cost of US$1 million in the June 
quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from US$10 million to US$16 million with the majority spent on capital waste stripping, 
engineering projects and Rex infill drilling.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 17 per cent from US$1,427 per ounce in the June quarter to US$1,182 per 
ounce in the September quarter mainly due to higher gold sold and lower net operating costs, partially offset by higher capital

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 35,700 ounces in the June quarter to 35,100 ounces in the September quarter. Copper 
production decreased by 5 per cent from 7,642 tonnes to 7,293 tonnes. Equivalent gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 
64,600 ounces to 61,200 ounces. The decrease in gold and copper production was mainly due to lower ore milled as a result of scheduled 
maintenance at the plant during the September quarter. Gold head grade increased from 0.98 grams per tonne to 1.00 grams per tonne and 
copper head grade was similar at 0.51 per cent. Gold recoveries increased from 66.3 per cent to 66.5 per cent and copper recoveries 
decreased from 88.0 per cent to 86.0 per cent. As a result, gold yield increased by 3 per cent from 0.65 grams per tonne to 0.67 grams 
per tonne and copper yield decreased 2 per cent from 0.45 per cent to 0.44 per cent. 

In the September quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 36,200 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,334 per 
ounce and 7,479 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$3,974 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This 
compared with 32,900 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,252 per ounce and 6,895 tonnes of copper that was sold at 
an average price of US$4,028 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the June quarter. 

Total tonnes mined decreased by 1 per cent from 3.65 million tonnes in the June quarter to 3.60 million tonnes in the September quarter 
mainly due to lower waste mined in line with the mining sequence. Ore mined decreased by 1 per cent from 1.80 million tonnes to 
1.78 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 2 per cent from 1.85 million tonnes to 1.82 million tonnes.

Ore processed decreased by 4 per cent from 1.78 million tonnes in the June quarter to 1.71 million tonnes in the September quarter 
mainly due to lower throughput (829 tonnes per hour in the September quarter vs 835 tonnes per hour in June quarter) due to increased 
ore hardness and lower plant availability (93 per cent in September quarter vs 96 per cent in June quarter) due to maintenance 
activities.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 27 per cent from US$30 million to US$38 million mainly due to a 
US$3 million gold-in-process charge to cost in the September quarter compared with a US$7 million credit to cost in the June quarter, 
both related to shipment schedules of concentrate stock.

Capital expenditure increased by 88 per cent from US$8 million to US$15 million due to more construction activities at the tailings dam 
and waste storage facilities as a result of the dry season. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per gold ounce increased by 28 per cent from US$599 per ounce in the June quarter to 
US$765 per ounce in the September quarter mainly due to higher net operating costs and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by 
higher gold sold and higher copper by-product credits. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 
26 per cent from US$750 per equivalent ounce to US$945 per equivalent ounce due to the same reasons as above.

At the underground operations, ore tonnes mined increased by 4 per cent from 151,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 157,000 tonnes in 
the September quarter. Head grade decreased by 13 per cent from 5.52 grams per tonne to 4.78 grams per tonne due to scheduling delays 
in high grade areas which related to rehabilitation required after seismic activity during the September quarter.  

At the open pit operations, ore tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 1,035,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 962,000 tonnes in the 
September quarter. Grade mined increased by 11 per cent from 2.29 grams per tonne to 2.54 grams per tonne. The decreased tonnes and 
higher grade were due to the completion of the low grade A5 open pit during the September quarter. Mining at A5 was undertaken to 
supplement production while the higher grade Neptune pit was being stripped.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 29 per cent from 3.1 million tonnes in the June quarter to 2.2 million tonnes in the 
September quarter. Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 10 per cent from 7.0 million tonnes to 7.7 million tonnes. Total material 
movements at the open pits decreased by 1 per cent from 11.1 million tonnes to 10.9 million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 
9.6 to 10.3 due to the closure of the A5 pit.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 6 per cent from 950,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 1,005,000 tonnes in the September 
quarter. The mill was closed for the last week of the June quarter and first week of the September quarter for the installation of a 
new electrical control block for the Sag mill. The installation of a new electrical control block was successfully completed in July, 
one week ahead of schedule. This contributed to the increased ore feed. Yield decreased by 3 per cent from 2.91 grams per tonne to 
2.83 grams per tonne due to reduced underground grade mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 3 per cent from A$59 million (US$44 million) to A$61 million 
(US$46 million) mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million) gold-in-process charge to cost in the September quarter compared with a 
A$6 million (US$5 million) credit to cost in the June quarter. This was partially offset by reduced mining costs in the open pits with 
activity moving towards pre-strip.

Capital expenditure increased by 16 per cent from A$49 million (US$37 million) to A$57 million (US$43 million) mainly due to increased 
expenditure on pre-stripping at the open pits, mainly at Neptune.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 5 per cent from A$1,311 per ounce (US$976 per ounce) in the June quarter to

per tonne in the June quarter to 4.32 grams per tonne in the September quarter. The reduced grade was due to the depletion of the high 
grade zone within Lords South Lower and commencement of mining the lower grade bulk Felsics area of Lords South Lower. No surface 
oxides were treated during the September quarter while the June quarter included 20,000 tonnes at 0.87 grams per tonne sourced from a 
surface oxide trial contributing approximately 500 ounces to production. 

Tonnes processed decreased by 15 per cent from 130,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 111,000 tonnes in the September quarter. This 
decrease was due to processing 20,000 tonnes from the surface oxide trial in the June quarter as mentioned above. The yield decreased 
by 3 per cent from 4.42 grams per tonne to 4.27 grams per tonne mainly due to lower grade ore mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 15 per cent from A$20 million (US$15 million) to A$17 million 
(US$13 million) mainly due to a decrease in mining costs with a greater portion of mining costs allocated to capital on increased 
development toward the Oval ore body.

Capital expenditure decreased by 13 per cent from A$8 million (US$6 million) to A$7 million (US$5 million). Capital was mainly incurred 
on exploration and development to the Oval ore body. The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to provide the primary 
ore feed in 2017.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 76,200 ounces in the June quarter to 72,800 ounces in the September quarter mainly due to 
a reduction in grade mined.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 1 per cent from 385,000 tonnes to 381,000 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased from 7.04 grams 
per tonne in the June quarter to 6.56 grams per tonne in the September quarter due to a reduction in mined grade from Zone 90.

Tonnes processed increased by 4 per cent from 363,000 tonnes in the June quarter to 376,000 tonnes in the September quarter. The yield 
decreased by 7 per cent from 6.51 grams per tonne to 6.03 grams per tonne reflecting the lower grades mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, were similar at A$46 million (US$35 million). The lower operating cost, due 
to lower mining and processing costs, including the effect of lower power costs as a result of the commissioning of the new gas power 
station, was partially offset by a lower gold-in-process credit to cost in the September quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 10 per cent from A$31 million (US$23 million) in the June quarter to A$34 million (US$26 million) in 
the September quarter. The higher expenditure related to the purchase of a new production drill and loader during the September 
quarter, as well as increased capital development and exploration activity.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 8 per cent from A$1,081 per ounce (US$805 per ounce) in the June quarter to 
A$1,167 per ounce (US$885 per ounce) in the September quarter mainly due to decreased gold sold and higher capital expenditure.

FATAL ACCIDENT AT SOUTH DEEP

Johannesburg, 12 September 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold
Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) regrets to announce that an employee at
the South Deep mine in South Africa lost his life in a fall-of-
ground accident on Saturday following a -1.5 magnitude seismic
event.

South Deep management immediately suspended all destress mining
activities and notified the Department of Mineral Resources. Due
to ongoing seismic activity in the area, the in-loco inspection
has been deferred until later today.

Nick Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields, said: Our
heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and
colleagues of the deceased. Management will do everything
possible to support them in this hour of need.

While this is the first fatality at South Deep since May 2015,
our review will reassess all safety protocols, procedures and
standards, Mr Holland added.

STATEMENT BY NICK HOLLAND, 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

It is pleasing to report our H1 2016 results into a much more buoyant gold market compared with the start of the year. Following Brexit 
at the end of June, the gold price has increased almost US$100/oz and is approximately US$250/oz higher than our planning price for 
2016. While we welcome the increase in the US$ gold price, we remain focused on delivering on our strategic objectives and have made 
good progress on a number of these during H1 2016. 

Materially higher earnings and cash flow in H1 2016
Gold Fields had an operationally strong H1 2016, with attributable gold equivalent production for the Group of 1,044koz (H1 2015: 
1,036koz), at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$992/oz (H1 2015: US$1,083/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of US$1,024/oz (H1 2015: 
US$1,108/oz). 

In-line with the trading statement, published on 19 July, headline earnings for H1 2016 was US$124m or US$0.16/share, compared with 
US$5m or US$0.01/share reported for H1 2015. Normalised earnings for the period was US$103m or US$0.13/share compared with US$8m or 
US$0.01/share reported for H1 2015. 

The increase in earnings was primarily driven by an increase in the US$ gold price (3% YoY) and good cost control which resulted in 
lower net operating costs in local currencies as well as the impact of converting these costs at weaker exchange rates. In H1 2016, 
the A$ was 5% weaker YoY and the rand was 29% weaker YoY, against the US$.

The Group generated net cash flow of US$60m for H1 2016, compared with US$1m in H1 2015, mainly due to the higher profit reported for 
the period and took into account US$22m spent on further drilling at Salares Norte.

We have declared an interim dividend of R0.50/share which is 12.5 times higher than the 2015 interim dividend of R0.04/share. 

South Deep outperforming guidance
Production at South Deep increased by 87% to 4,356kg (140koz) from 2,332kg (75koz) in H1 2015 driven by increased volumes and grade. 
AIC in H1 2016 decreased 19% YoY to R622,453/kg (US$1,257/oz). Good progress was made on a number of important activities:

-  Safety continues to be a priority at South Deep, with no fatalities reported in H1 2016 and the TRIFR improving 5% YoY to 2.89 in 
   H1 2016 from 3.03 in H1 2015. 
-  Helped by the higher rand gold price and favourable working capital movements, the net cash outflow for the period was R50m compared 
   with an outflow of R728m in H1 2015. Within this half year number, it is worth noting that the mine was cash positive in the June 
   2016 quarter. 
-  Development increased by 74% to 3,078 metres in H1 2016 from 1,773 metres in H1 2015.
-  Destress mining increased by 46% to 19,845 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016 from 13,619 square metres for the six 
   months ended 30 June 2015. 
-  Destress mining increased by 46% to 19,845 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016 from 13,619 square metres for the six 
   months ended 30 June 2015. 
-  The conversion from low profile to high profile destress mining yielded positive results. High profile destress mining contributed 
   53% to total destress mining for the period. Low profile destress mining was completed subsequent to quarter-end. 
-  Longhole stoping volumes increased by 120% to 301kt in H1 2016 from 137kt in H1 2015.
-  Secondary support increased by 34% YoY in H1 2016 to 3,891 metres.
-  Backfill placed was 47% higher YoY for the six months to June 2016 at 198m3.
-  As part of the fleet renewal strategy, 17 category 1 units were commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to be 
   commissioned during the remainder of 2016. In the past 18 months, we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a total of 
   114 category 1 units. 
-  Most of the critical skill position identified at the start of 2015 have now been filled, with a limited number of specialist skill 
   positions outstanding. 

Australia 
Gold production in the Australia region for H1 2016 was 2% lower YoY at 466koz due to lower production at all operations except Darlot, 
however all mines exceeded guidance. AIC for the region was only marginally higher in A$ terms at A$1,265/oz, but 6% lower YoY in 
US$ terms at US$928/oz due to the weakening of the A$ against the US$. AIC includes exploration expenditure (see below). Net cash flow 
from the region for H1 2016 was US$121m. 

During H1 2016, A$52m of the exploration budget was spent, with 347,456 metres drilled during the period. There have been encouraging 
results at all operations including: extensions at Wallaby laterally and at depth; prospective results from drilling at Northern Fleet 
on Lake Carey at Granny Smith and Waroonga North at Agnew as well as extensions at Invincible and Invincible South and Retribution on 
the Eastern Causeway at St Ives. Darlot continues to find resources to incrementally extend its life, while exploration to find the 
game changer continues. We anticipate replacing ounces mined into reserves at year-end. 

West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region was 7% lower YoY in H1 2016 at 311koz, due to lower production at both Tarkwa 
and Damang. However, AIC for the region decreased 9% YoY to US$1,052/oz mainly as a result of lower net operating costs and lower 
capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold. The region generated net cash flow of US$26m for the six months to June 2016. 

As previously reported, the conclusion of a development agreement with the Government of Ghana was a key milestone during H1 2016 and 
provides the platform for targeting many years of sustainable production by Gold Fields in Ghana. The lower royalties will become 
effective in 2017.

We continue to evaluate a range of options for Damang, with additional work required following the conclusion of the Development 
Agreement. We expect to make a decision and provide an update to the market before year-end.

South America
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona decreased by 15% YoY to 128koz, mainly due to lower gold head grades, as a 
result of planned sequencing at the mine, and the lower copper price. Consequently, AIC increased by 9% YoY to US$728 per equivalent 
ounce. Despite the lower production, the mine generated net cash flow of US$19m. 

Approaching 1x net debt to EBITDA target
Net debt decreased to US$1,155m during H1 2016, from US$1,380m at end December 2015 following the bond buyback and subsequent equity 
raising undertaken in the period. The net debt to EBITDA ratio reduced to 1.05x at 30 June 2016, from 1.38x at end-December 2015 and 
positions the company well to meet its net debt to EBITDA target of 1.0x by year-end. 

As previously reported in June, we have successfully refinanced our US$1,440m credit facilities due in November 2017. The new 
facilities amount to US$1,290m, with the interest rates being very similar to the previous facilities. The refinancing extends the 
maturity of our debt, with the first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 2017).

Improved FY16 production guidance
As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, we have increased the FY16 production guidance for the mine to 
9,000kg (289koz) from 8,000kg (257koz). However, we have also increased the AIC guidance for the year to R595,000/kg (US$1,310/oz) 
from R575,000/kg (US$1,265/oz). The higher AIC relates to increased capital expenditure of R211m (US$15m) to R1,210m (US$86m) due to a 
change in strategy on housing (decision to build instead of rent) and the acquisition of additional new fleet. The remainder of the 
increase is due to higher working costs, which comprise higher bonuses due to higher gold production achieved relative to plan as well 
as the investment in additional resources in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation. 

For Tarkwa, we have increased the FY16 AIC guidance to US$980/oz from US$940/oz, mainly due to a US$38m increase in capital expenditure 
to US$166m. The mine took advantage of the higher gold price and the benefits from the Development Agreement to increase capital 
stripping in order to increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond. 

Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative to plan in H1 2016, we have increased the FY16 production guidance 
for the region to 925koz from 905koz.

Consequently, FY16 production guidance for the Group has been increased to 2.10  2.15koz, from 2.05  2.10koz. AISC and AIC guidance 
for the year remains unchanged at US$1,000  1,010/oz and US$1,035  1,045/oz. Group capital expenditure has increased to US$655m, from 
U$602m. The cost guidance is based on unchanged exchange rate assumptions: US$0.73 = A$1.00 and R14.14 = US$1.00.

RESULTS FOR THE GROUP

SAFETY
The Groups fatality injury frequency rate improved from 0.08 for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 0.00 for the six months ended 
30 June 2016.  The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group improved by 35 per cent from 3.47 for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 2.20 for the six months ended 30 June 2016.

1  Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities + Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically 
   Treated Injuries4) x 1,000,000/number of man-hours worked.
2  A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee or contractor being unable to attend work for a period 
   of one or more days after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform any functions.
3  A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an employee or contractor which results in the employee or 
   contractor being unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working day, from the day after the injury

to 310,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower production at both Tarkwa and Damang.  Attributable equivalent 
gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru decreased by 15 per cent from 149,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
126,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Gold production at the Australian operations decreased by 2 per cent from 
476,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 466,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower production 
at all the operations except Darlot.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep increased by 87 per cent from 2,332 kilograms (75,000 ounces) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased volumes and grades.  

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa decreased by 6 per cent from 292,000 ounces for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to 273,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and lower plant throughput at a 
lower yield.  At Damang, managed gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
71,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and processed as well as lower yield.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona decreased by 15 per cent from 150,200 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 127,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the lower copper price relative 
to the gold price (price factor) and lower gold head grades, a function of planned changes in the mining sequence as the pit floor is 
lowered across the footprint.  

At the Australia region, St Ives gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 187,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
175,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to decreased tonnes processed and lower grades.  At Agnew/Lawlers, gold 
production decreased by 4 per cent from 113,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 ounces for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 mainly due to decreased tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by higher grades.  At Darlot, gold production 
increased by 31 per cent from 28,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 ounces for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 mainly due to increased tonnes mined and processed as well as higher grades.  At Granny Smith, gold production decreased 
by 2 per cent from 146,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
lower grades mined and processed. 

The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased by 3 per cent from US$1,186 per equivalent ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,218 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The average rand gold price increased by

Revenue increased by 3 per cent from US$1,270 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,305 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the higher gold price achieved.

OPERATING COSTS
Net operating costs decreased by 11 per cent from US$748 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$666 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The US$82 million lower net operating costs were due to lower mining costs of US$28 million in local 
currencies and the exchange rate effect of US$54 million on translation into US dollars.  The gold-in-process credit to cost of 
US$25 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a charge of US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 
This change in gold-in-process was mainly at St Ives due to the processing of low grade stockpiles while the Invincible pit was being 
stripped in the six months to June 2015. Sufficient ore to fill the mill and to create stockpiles was mined in the six months ended 
June 2016.

At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million (US$113 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to R1,959 million (US$127 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to higher production, 
annual salary increases and an increase in employees and contractors in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of 
the operation.

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 12 per cent from US$262 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$230 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  This decrease in net operating costs was mainly due to lower production, 
continued business process re-engineering, as well as a build-up of inventory of US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with a drawdown of US$2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  

At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona decreased by 11 per cent from US$71 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to a build-up of concentrate of US$6 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$nil million for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 13 per cent from A$387 million (US$303 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to A$337 million (US$247 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to gold-in-process movements. At 
St Ives, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$16 million (US$12 million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge 
of A$38 million (US$30 million) for the six months ended June 2015.  In the six months ended June 2015, St Ives processed low grade 
stockpiles, whereas enough ore was mined to fill the mill and to create stockpiles in the six months ended June 2016. At Granny Smith, 
the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million (US$1 million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge of 
A$6 million (US$5 million) for the six months ended June 2015. This A$8 million (US$6 million) change in gold-in-process was mainly 
due to timing of the campaign milling. At Agnew/Lawlers, a gold-in-process charge of A$4 million (US$3 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with a credit to cost of A$1 million (US$1 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  At Darlot, a 
gold-in-process charge of A$1 million (US$nil million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

OPERATING PROFIT 
Operating profit for the Group increased by 22 per cent from US$522 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$639 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the increase in revenue and the decrease in net operating costs. 

AMORTISATION 
Amortisation for the Group increased by 6 per cent from US$283 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$300 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016. This increase of US$17 million was due to actual amortisation increases of US$34 million due to the 
change in estimate in the depreciation at Cerro Corona and in Australia mainly due to lower reserves at St Ives, partially offset by an 
exchange rate effect of US$17 million. 

OTHER
Net interest expense for the Group decreased by 9 per cent from US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$31 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Interest expense of US$41 million, partially offset by interest income of US$3 million and 
interest capitalised of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with interest expense of US$46 million, partially 
offset by interest income of US$3 million and interest capitalised of US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 50 per cent from US$4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$2 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to downscaling of activities at Far Southeast project (FSE) and mainly related to ongoing 
study and evaluation costs.  

The gain on financial instruments of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was mainly due to the South Deep currency hedge 
of US$70 million at an average price of R16.8273 to the US$.  This compared with a loss of US$1 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 which related to the mark to market adjustment on the diesel hedges that the Australian operations entered into on 
10 September 2014 and 26 November 2014.  The diesel hedges came to an end on 30 June 2015.
Share-based payments for the Group was similar at US$6 million while long-term employee benefits increased from US$3 million to 
US$20 million.  The two schemes combined were at US$26 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$9 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 due to upward mark to market adjustments on the long-term employee incentive scheme.

Other costs for the Group increased from US$19 million to US$24 million, mainly due to the write-off of bank facility fees of 
US$5 million as a result of refinancing the off-shore credit facility. 

EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS
Exploration and project costs increased from US$33 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$41 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to increased expenditure of US$8 million at Salares Norte.

NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring income of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with non-recurring expenses of US$11 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. The non-recurring income for the six months ended 30 June 2016 included profit of US$18 million on 
the buy-back of the bond which was partially offset by retrenchment costs of US$10 million at Damang. 

The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2015 included impairment of the Groups investment in Hummingbird 
(US$7 million) to its fair value and retrenchment costs of A$3 million (US$3 million) at St Ives.

ROYALTIES
Government royalties for the Group decreased from US$40 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$39 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016.

TAXATION
The taxation charge for the Group of US$68 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$87 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015.  Normal taxation increased from US$64 million to US$83 million due to higher taxable income.  The deferred tax 
credit of US$15 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a charge of US$23 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015.  The deferred tax credit for the six months ended 30 June 2016 arose mainly due to the strengthening of the Peruvian 
Nuevo Sol, as well as the change in the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 32.5 per cent in Ghana as a result of the conclusion of 
the Development Agreement in the March 2016 quarter.

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol (Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the 
US dollar.  For accounting purposes the unredeemed capital allowance balance in respect of the operation must be converted from Soles 
to dollars at the closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, the US dollar equivalent of the unredeemed capital allowance balance 
fluctuates due to movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar. This resulted in a change in the 
temporary taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation.  A deferred tax credit of US$5 million arose due to the 
strengthening of the exchange rate from 3.38 Nuevo Sol to 3.28 Nuevo Sol in the six months to June 2016, compared with a deferred tax 
charge of US$26 million which arose due to the weakening of the exchange rate from 2.84 Nuevo Sol to 3.17 Nuevo Sol in the six months 
ended June 2015.  It has no cash effect.

EARNINGS 
Net earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$115 million or US$0.14 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
with net losses of US$2 million or US$0.00 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

Headline earnings attributable to owners of the parent of US$124 million or US$0.16 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with headline earnings of US$5 million or US$0.01 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

Normalised earnings of US$103 million or US$0.13 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$8 million or 
US$0.01 per share for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

CASH FLOW 
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$384 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$342 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015.  This increase was mainly due to an increase in operating profit of US$117 million and non-recurring income 
of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with non-recurring expense of US$11 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015, partially offset by an investment into working capital of US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
with a release of working capital of US$43 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 as well as higher tax paid (US$127 million 
versus US$119 million). 

Dividends paid of US$11 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.  Dividends paid to owners of the parent decreased from US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$11 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Dividends paid to non-controlling interest holders of US$nil million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 compared with US$5 million 30 June 2015. 

Cash outflow from investing activities decreased from US$340 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$321 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a decrease in capital expenditure from US$333 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$316 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This decrease of US$17 million related to a decrease of US$24 million due to 
currency changes, partially offset by actual increased capital expenditure of US$7 million in local currency. Environmental payments 
decreased from US$9 million for the six months ended June 2015 to US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  

Cash inflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and environmental payments of US$60 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 compared with US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 mainly due to higher profit and lower capital 
expenditure, partially offset by higher royalties and taxation paid and negative working capital adjustments.  The US$60 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprised: US$163 million net cash generated by the eight mining operations (after royalties, taxes, 
capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$37 million of net interest paid, US$28 million for exploration mainly at 
Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which is included in the US$163 million above) and US$38 million 
on non-mine based costs of which US$29 million was due to working capital movements.  The US$1 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 comprised: US$70 million generated by the eight mining operations less US$39 million of interest paid (this excludes any interest 
paid by the mines), US$18 million for exploration (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration which is included in the 
US$70 million above) and US$12 million on non-mine based costs.

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure increased from R419 million (US$35 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to R682 million (US$44 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to higher expenditure on fleet, the 
refurbishment of the man winder at Twin shaft and higher expenditure on new mine development. 

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure decreased from US$141 million to US$102 million.  At Tarkwa, capital expenditure 
decreased from US$133 million to US$91 million due to higher fleet expenditure for the six months to June 2015 related to timing of 
deliveries and orders.  Capital expenditure for the six months to June 2016 was mainly incurred on pre-stripping.  Capital expenditure 
at Damang increased from US$8 million to US$11 million mainly due to waste stripping at Amoanda pit. 

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure decreased from US$19 million to US$14 million.  The majority of the 
expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings dam. 

At the Australia region, capital expenditure increased from A$176 million (US$138 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
A$214 million (US$157 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  At St Ives, capital expenditure increased from A$77 million 
(US$60 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$94 million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
increased pre-strip at Neptune, Invincible and A5.  At Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure increased from A$44 million (US$34 million) 
to A$54 million (US$40 million) due to increased decline development.  At Darlot, capital expenditure increased marginally from 
A$13 million (US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 million) and at Granny Smith, capital expenditure increased from A$43 million 
(US$34 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$51 million (US$38 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
increased capital development, the new fresh air intake ventilation raise and the completion of the new gas fired power station.

Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with outflow from financing 
activities of US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 related to a 
drawdown of US$422 million and proceeds on the issue of shares of US$152 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$567 million 
on offshore and local loans. The outflow for the six months ended June 2015 related to a net repayment of loans.

The net cash inflow for the Group of US$59 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with an outflow of US$34 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015.  After accounting for a positive translation adjustment of US$4 million on non-US dollar cash 
balances, the cash inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was US$63 million.  The cash balance was US$415 million at 30 June 2015 
compared with US$503 million at 30 June 2016. 

ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST
The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 8 per cent from US$1,083 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$992 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower net operating costs and lower sustaining capital 
expenditure, partially offset by lower by-product credits and higher cash remuneration (long term employee benefits).  Total all-in 
cost decreased by 8 per cent from US$1,108 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,024 per ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 for the same reasons as all-in sustaining costs. 

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per kilogram 
(US$1,912 per ounce) to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher 
operating costs and higher sustaining capital expenditure.  The total all-in cost decreased by 19 per cent from R772,702 per kilogram 
(US$2,020 per ounce) to R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) due to the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as 
lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 9 per cent from US$1,156 per ounce for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,052 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower net operating costs and 
lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent from US$423 per ounce to 
US$489 per ounce mainly due to lower gold sold and lower by-product credits, partially offset by lower net operating costs.  
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 9 per cent from US$666 per equivalent ounce to 
US$728 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above, other than lower by-product credits as well as lower equivalent 
ounces sold.

At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased marginally from A$1,263 per ounce (US$990 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 31 December 2015 to A$1,265 per ounce (US$928 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to 
higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold.

FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN.
The free cash flow (FCF) margin is revenue less cash outflow divided by revenue expressed as a percentage. 

The FCF for the Group for the six months ended June 2016 is calculated as follows:

The FCF margin of 14 per cent for the six months ended 30 June 2016 at a gold price of US$1,218 per ounce compared with 4 per cent in 
the for the six months ended 30 June 2015 at a gold price of US$1,186 per ounce. 

The higher FCF margin for the six months ended 30 June 2016 was mainly due to lower net operating costs, lower capital expenditure and 
the higher gold price received.

Gold production increased by 87 per cent from 2,332 kilograms (75,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 4,356 kilograms 
(140,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased volumes and grades.

Underground tonnes milled increased by 52 per cent from 493,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 750,000 tonnes for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016. Total tonnes milled increased by 104 per cent from 0.56 million tonnes to 1.14 million tonnes. Total 
tonnes milled for the six months ended 30 June 2016 included 47,900 tonnes of underground waste mined and 346,300 tonnes of surface 
tailings material compared with 8,700 tonnes of underground waste mined and 58,300 tonnes of surface tailings material for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015.  Underground reef yield increased by 23 per cent from 4.70 grams per tonne to 5.77 grams per tonne due to 
greater adherence to spatial mining plans along with improved processes in the entire mining value chain.

Development increased by 74 per cent from 1,773 metres for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 3,078 metres for the six months ended 
30 June 2016.  New mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 524 per cent from 83 metres for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to 518 metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above 
increased by 51 per cent from 1,690 metres to 2,560 metres.  Destress mining increased by 46 per cent from 13,619 square metres for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to 19,845 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The destress conversion from low profile 
to high profile mining was completed subsequent to quarter-end.  Longhole stoping volume mined increased by 120 per cent from 
136,858 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 300,966 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  High profile destress 
mining started in June 2015 and improved significantly from 52 square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 10,599 square 
metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the introduction of 3 new drill rigs, improved productivity and the 
continued roll-out of the method across the entire mine.  The high profile and low profile methods contributed 53 per cent and 
47 per cent, respectively, to total destress for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 65 per cent of the ore tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016, while the new 
mine (below 95 level) contributed 35 per cent.  The long-hole stoping method accounted for 42 per cent of total ore tonnes mined 
compared with 37 per cent for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

Net operating costs increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million (US$113 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
R1,959 million (US$127 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The main contributing factor is the 52 per cent increase in 
tonnes mined, which resulted in higher bonuses paid, higher consumable spend and higher utility consumption.  The increased costs were 
also due to annual salary increases and additional resources (employees and contractors) in line with the strategy to sustainably 
improve all aspects of the operation.

Operating profit of R668 million (US$43 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a loss of R267 million 
(US$22 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  This was mainly due to the 87 per cent (2,024 kilograms) increase in gold 
production together with a 31 per cent improvement in the rand gold price, partially offset by increased net operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 63 per cent from R419 million (US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R682 million 
(US$44 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 as a result of higher spending on fleet and the refurbishment of the man winder 
at Twin shaft.

All-in sustaining costs decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per kilogram (US$1,912 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to increased gold sold, partially offset 
by higher operating costs and higher sustaining capital expenditure.

Total all-in cost decreased by 19 per cent from R772,702 per kilogram (US$2,020 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustainable 
costs as well as lower non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R322 million (US$27 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R623 million 
(US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to additional fleet and the refurbishment of the twin shaft man winder.  
Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased from R97 million (US$8 million) to R59 million (US$4 million). 

The independent Geotechnical Review Board (GRB), a committee of local and international experts, will continue to peer review progress 
at South Deep to ensure exposure to relevant industry leading practices and world class geotechnical support in massive underground

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 292,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 273,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to lower tonnes mined, lower plant throughput and lower grade.  

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 52.4 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
51.3 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Ore tonnes mined decreased from 7.3 million tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes.  
Operational waste tonnes mined increased from 16.0 million tonnes to 16.9 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined decreased 
from 29.1 million tonnes to 27.6 million tonnes.  Head grade mined increased from 1.43 grams per tonne to 1.44 grams per tonne.  The 
strip ratio increased from 6.1 to 6.8. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased from 6.81 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 6.80 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to unplanned downtime (both power and operational related).  Realised yield from the CIL plant decreased from 
1.33 grams per tonne to 1.25 grams per tonne due to lower head grades processed as a result of the blend between lower grade 
stockpiles, higher grade ore tonnes mined, related to timing differences between ore mined and ore feed to the plant. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 7 per cent from US$168 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to US$156 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a net increase in gold-in-process and lower operating 
costs.  The US$9 million build-up of stockpiles for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a drawdown of US$nil million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

Operating profit decreased from US$184 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$177 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 as a result of the lower gold sales, partially offset by lower net operating costs.

Capital expenditure decreased by 32 per cent from US$133 million to US$91 million mainly due to the purchase of mining fleet for 
replacement in the six months ended June 2015.  Mining fleet expenditure for the six months ended June 2015 was US$46 million compared 
to US$nil million for the six months ended June 2016.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent from US$1,106 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to US$993 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 71,900 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and processed and lower yield.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 10.5 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
9.8 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the late start of mining at the Amoanda pit as a result of delays in 
securing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit.

Ore tonnes mined decreased from 2.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased from 8.2 million 
tonnes to 5.0 million tonnes as a result of only mining operational waste tonnes for the six months ended June 2015, while both 
operational waste tonnes and capital waste tonnes were mined for the six months ended June 2016. Capital waste of 3.4 million tonnes 
was mined at Amoanda pit for the six months ended June 2016. The six months to June 2015 had no capital waste.  Head grade mined 
increased from 1.25 grams per tonne to 1.42 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio increased from 3.5 to 6.0 due to capital stripping at the 
Amoanda pit.

Yield decreased from 1.19 grams per tonne to 1.11 grams per tonne due to an increase in lower grade stockpiles treated. For the 
six months ended June 2015, 1.79 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.31 grams per tonne and 
0.33 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 1.34 grams per tonne. This compared with 1.15 million tonnes of 
fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.44 grams per tonne and 0.86 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average 
grade of 0.90 grams per tonne for the six months ended June 2016. 

Tonnes processed decreased from 2.11 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 2.01 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to a tailings line blockage for 10 days.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 21 per cent from US$94 million to US$74 million mainly due to 
lower mining and consumable costs in line with the lower production as well as lower payroll costs as a result of retrenchments for the 
six months ended June 2016.   

Operating profit increased from US$4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$13 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold prices achieved, partially offset by lower gold sold. 

Capital expenditure increased by 38 per cent from US$8 million to US$11 million with the majority spent on waste stripping at Amoanda 
pit.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent from US$1,336 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$1,260 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 10 per cent from 78,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 70,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016.  Copper production increased marginally from 14,566 tonnes to 14,693 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production decreased 
by 15 per cent from 150,200 ounces to 127,500 ounces.  The decrease in equivalent gold production was due to the lower copper price 
ratio as well as lower gold head grades treated.  The lower head grades were in line with the mine sequencing and the planned 
production schedule for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Gold head grade decreased from 1.08 grams per tonne to 0.96 grams per tonne 
and copper head grade decreased from 0.53 per cent to 0.50 per cent.  Gold recoveries decreased from 71.6 per cent to 67.4 per cent 
mainly due to mineralisation characteristics of the ore mined which is expected to dissipate by the end of the September quarter 2016 
once this section of the orebody is mined. Copper recoveries increased from 86.4 per cent to 86.7 per cent.  As a result, gold yield 
decreased from 0.87 grams per tonne to 0.65 grams per tonne and copper yield decreased from 0.55 per cent to 0.43 per cent.  The 
decreases in grade is in line with the plan.

For the six months ended 30 June 2016, concentrate with a payable content of 66,847 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of 
US$1,220 per ounce and 13,877 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$4,021 per tonne, net of treatment and refining 
charges.  This compared with 76,720 ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,192 per ounce and 14,174 tonnes of copper 
that was sold at an average price of US$5,190 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 18 per cent from 147,200 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 120,100 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower volumes produced.

Total tonnes mined increased by 24 per cent from 6.12 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 7.56 million tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 in line with the mine sequencing.  The higher tonnes mined was due to lower intensity of the rainy 
season.  Ore mined increased by 6 per cent from 3.36 million tonnes to 3.56 million tonnes.  Waste tonnes mined increased by 45 per 
cent from 2.76 million tonnes to 4.00 million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 0.82 to 1.13 due to higher waste mined for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. Waste mined was higher for the six months ended June 2016 mainly due to the prioritisation of ore mined for 
the six months ended June 2015 due to the rainy season and the mining sequence.

Ore processed increased by 9 per cent from 3.23 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 3.53 million tonnes for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to record plant throughput (835 tonnes per hour vs 791 tonnes per hour) after the completion 
of the plant optimisation project.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 11 per cent from US$71 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The lower cost was mainly due to a US$6 million build-up of 
concentrate inventory for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$nil million for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

Operating profit was similar at US$85 million.

Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from US$19 million to US$14 million.  The six months ended 30 June 2015 included 
construction of the new fuel station and the new camp.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent from US$423 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$489 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  This was mainly due to lower gold sold and lower by-product credits, partially 
offset by lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce 
increased by 9 per cent from US$666 per equivalent ounce to US$728 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above and 
lower equivalent ounces sold.

the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The additional tonnes mined are a result of the transition to a predominantly open pit operation.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 53 per cent from 0.70 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
0.33 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with the closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines.  The grade 
mined increased by 19 per from 4.52 grams per tonne to 5.40 grams per tonne as a result of the closure of the lower grade Cave Rocks 
mine.  

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 213 per cent from 0.60 million tonnes for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to 1.88 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the ramp-up of Invincible pit.  Grade mined increased 
by 11 per cent from 2.25 grams per tonne to 2.49 grams per tonne as the Invincible pit moved into a higher grade portion of the ore 
body.  

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 287 per cent from 1.20 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
4.64 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 8.0 million tonnes 
to 15.5 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased from 15.5 to 10.7 as the Invincible Pit has moved from a predominately stripping to 
a production phase, partially offset by the stripping of the Neptune pit in the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The increased tonnes 
reflect the increase in activity at the Invincible mine which is now in full production and the commencement of Stage 2 of the Neptune 
open pit giving St Ives two significant areas of open pit activity in 2016 and beyond.  The strip ratio for Invincible pit decreased 
from 20.5 to 8.7, while the strip ratio for Neptune pit was 58.2 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. There was no mining activity at 
Neptune during the first half of 2015.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 2.05 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 1.95 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to low grade stockpiles used to supplement production for the six months ended 
June 2015. St Ives adopted a campaign milling strategy towards the end of the six months ended 30 June 2015. Yield decreased from 
2.84 grams per tonne to 2.81 grams per tonne in line with less underground production, offset by no longer feeding low grade stockpiled 
material. Gold production from the Lefroy mill decreased from 185,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 173,500 ounces 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  In addition, 93,000 tonnes of toll treatment produced 2,000 ounces for the six months to June 
2016. 

Residual leaching and irrigation of the existing heap leach pad produced a further 400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  
This compared with 2,500 ounces produced for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  The residual leaching has now ceased being economic 
and the heap leach is being closed.  Since cessation of stacking activities, a total of 24,800 ounces was produced.  

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements decreased from A$164 million (US$129 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 to A$108 million (US$79 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The significant cost reduction is the result of:

-  the closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines;
-  efficiencies in the open pits with the cost per tonne of material movement decreasing by 29 per cent on larger volumes and 
   productivity improvements; and
-  the benefits of enhanced open pit production resulting in a credit of A$16 million (US$12 million) due to a build-up of stockpiles 
   compared with a cost of A$38 million (US$30 million) on drawdown of stockpiles in the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

The benefits of the above cost reductions were partially offset by increased mining volumes.

Operating profit increased from A$125 million (US$98 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$182 million (US$134 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a higher Australian dollar gold price (A$1,651 per ounce vs A$1,542 per ounce) and 
significant net operating cost reductions, partially offset by lower production.

Capital expenditure increased by 22 per cent from A$77 million (US$60 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$94 million 
(US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with an additional A$13 million (US$10 million) incurred on pre-stripping at 
Neptune and A5 pit. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 9 per cent from A$1,375 per ounce (US$1,079 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,247 per ounce (US$915 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the significant reduction in 
net operating costs, partially offset by lower production and higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 113,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 mainly due to a reduction in ore tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by higher grades. 

Ore mined from underground decreased by 14 per cent from 622,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 532,000 tonnes for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016. Ore mined from New Holland decreased by 19 per cent from 345,000 tonnes to 278,000 tonnes, mainly due to 
the Genesis 500 Series North nearing completion and the focus on developing the Cinderella ore body in the six months ended June 2016. 
Ore mined at Waroonga decreased by 8 per cent from 277,000 tonnes to 254,000 tonnes due to more difficult ground conditions encountered 
in the six months to June 2016.  Head grade mined increased by 7 per cent from 6.02 grams per tonne to 6.44 grams per tonne mainly due 
to a larger concentration of ore sourced from the higher grade Kim ore body.   

Tonnes processed decreased by 10 per cent from 625,700 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 566,200 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower tonnes available from the mines.  The combined yield increased from 5.64 grams per tonne to 
6.00 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grades mined.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 2 per cent from A$93 million (US$73 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$95 million (US$70 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a A$4 million (US$3 million) drawdown 
of inventory for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a A$1 million (US$1 million) build-up of inventory for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015. 

Operating profit increased from A$82 million (US$64 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$84 million (US$61 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the higher Australian dollar gold price (A$1,639 per ounce vs A$1,538 per ounce), partially 
offset by reduced production and higher net operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 23 per cent from A$44 million (US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$54 million 
(US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The increase in capital expenditure was due to the decline development to the 
Cinderella ore body at New Holland, an exploration development drive towards Waroonga North at Waroonga mine and increased exploration 
expenditure across the lease.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 14 per cent from A$1,277 per ounce (US$1,001 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,456 per ounce (US$1,068 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to decreased gold sold, higher 
net operating costs and higher capital expenditure.  All-in-sustaining costs are expected to decrease in the second half of 2016 as 
Cinderella moves into production and with the completion of the Waroonga North exploration development drive.

Gold production increased by 31 per cent from 28,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to increased tonnes and higher grade mined and processed from the Lords South Lower ore body. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 5 per cent from 194,200 tonnes to 204,800 tonnes.  Head grade mined increased by 18 per cent 
from 4.96 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 5.86 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The 
increase in tonnes and grades was due to mining of higher grade remnant areas and extensions to the Lords South Lower ore body.  
A further 25,300 tonnes at 1.35 grams per tonne were sourced from a surface oxide trial during the six months ended June 2016 
contributing approximately 1,000 ounces.  

Tonnes processed increased by 7 per cent from 214,300 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 230,100 tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016.  The yield increased from 4.14 grams per tonne to 5.02 grams per tonne due to higher grade ore mined, partially 
offset by the lower grade oxide trial.   

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 14 per cent from A$36 million (US$28 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$41 million (US$30 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The increase reflects increased volumes 
mined and processed as well as a A$1 million (US$nil million) build-up for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with A$2 million 
(US$2 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

Operating profit increased from A$8 million (US$6 million) to A$21 million (US$15 million) due to the higher Australian dollar gold 
price (A$1,669 per ounce vs A$1,538 per ounce), partially offset by the higher net operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent from A$13 million (US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 million). Capital expenditure in 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 was mainly incurred on exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval ore body.  The 
Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018.  The Oval ore body extends 
the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain its strategy of self-funding exploration expenditure while it continues an aggressive 
exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields franchise asset.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 13 per cent from A$1,786 per ounce (US$1,400 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,554 per ounce (US$1,139 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to higher gold sold, partially 
offset by higher net operating costs.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 146,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to lower grades mined in line with the mining sequence and as planned, as well as an increase in stockpiled ore 
as a consequence of the campaign milling.

Ore mined from underground increased by 13 per cent from 677,000 tonnes to 763,000 tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased by 4 per cent 
from 6.77 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 6.52 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 2016 in line 
with the mining plan.

Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 731,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 741,300 tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016.  The yield decreased from 6.23 grams per tonne to 6.03 grams per tonne due to lower head grades. The mill is not 
operating at capacity and the timing of the milling campaign results in variances between tonnes mined and milled in any given period 
which also impacts yield variances between head grade and yield.  

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements decreased by 2 per cent from A$94 million (US$73 million) to A$92 million 
(US$67 million).  Mining costs increased on the additional volumes, but was more than offset by the net gold in process credit 
associated with the respective timing of the milling campaigns, referred to above.  The gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million 
(US$1 million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge of A$6 million (US$5 million) for the six months ended 
June 2015. This A$8 million change in gold-in-process was mainly due to timing of the campaign milling.

Operating profit increased by 13 per cent from A$132 million (US$103 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$149 million 
(US$109 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the higher Australian gold price (A$1,674 per ounce vs A$1,539 per 
ounce).

Capital expenditure increased from A$43 million (US$34 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$51 million (US$38 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The majority of the expenditure related to capital development, exploration and the 
establishment of the fresh air intake ventilation raise.  The mine moved from diesel power to gas fired power in May 2016 with the 
completion of construction and the commissioning of the new power station.  The new power station is expected to provide savings in 
power costs, lower maintenance costs and the risk of power interruptions.  It is also expected to reduce carbon emissions.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent from A$1,008 per ounce (US$789 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,068 per ounce (US$783 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower gold sold, higher 
capital expenditure, partially offset by the lower net operating costs.

CORPORATE

GOLD FIELDS APPOINTS FOUR NEW NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD
Gold Fields has announcement the appointments of four new independent non-executive directors to its Board of Directors. Impala 
Platinum CEO Terence Goodlace joined the Board as a director on 1 July 2016, while Alhassan Andani, the Chief Executive and Executive 
Director of Stanbic Bank Ghana, joined on 1 August 2016. Former KPMG Africa Chair, Yunus Suleman and Peter Bacchus, the Global Head of 
Mining and Metals and Joint Head of European Investment Banking at Investment Bank Jefferies, based in London, will join the Board on 
1 September 2016.  
 
Gold Fields Chairperson Cheryl Carolus said the four new directors will ensure continuity of the skills set of the Board as a number of 
the current directors were approaching retirement age over the next two years. Former director David Murray stepped down from the Board 
on 1 June 2016.

The new directors provide the technical, financial, commercial and global mining experience necessary to help Gold Fields maintain and 
further strengthen its position as a global leader in sustainable gold mining, Ms Carolus said.

CREDIT FACILITIES SUCCESSFULLY REFINANCED
Gold Fields successfully refinanced its US$1,440 million credit facilities due in November 2017.  The new facilities amount to 
US$1,290 million and comprise three tranches:
-  US$380 million: 3 year term loan  margin 250 basis points (bps) over Libor;
-  US$360 million: 3 year revolving credit facility (RCF) (with an option to extend to up to 5 years)  margin 220bps over Libor; 
   and
-  US$550 million: 5 year RCF  margin 245bps over Libor.

The new facilities were concluded with a syndicate of 15 banks. On average, the interest rate on the new facilities is similar to the 
interest rate on the existing facilities.  A total of US$645 million was drawn down from the new facilities on 13 June 2016 to repay 
the groups existing US$ facilities, with US$645 million remaining unutilised. The refinancing is a key milestone in Gold Fields 
balance sheet management and increases the maturity of its debt, with the first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 
2017). 

CASH DIVIDEND
In line with the companys dividend policy to pay out a dividend of between 25 and 35 per cent of its earnings, the Board has approved 
and declared an interim dividend number 84 of 50 SA cents per ordinary share (gross) in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2016.  
This translates to 26 per cent of normalised earnings.  The interim dividend will be subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax of 15 per 
cent.  In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a)(i) and 11.17(c) of the JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional information is

OUTLOOK FOR 2016 

As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, we have increased the 2016 production guidance for the mine to 
9,000 kilograms (289,000 ounces) from 8,000 kilograms (257,000 ounces). However, we have also increased the AIC guidance for the year 
to R595,000 per kilogram (US$1,310 per ounce) from R575,000 per kilogram (US$1,265 per ounce). The higher AIC relates to increased 
capital expenditure of R211 million (US$15 million) to R1,210 million (US$86 million) due to a change in strategy on housing (decision 
to build instead of rent) and the acquisition of additional new fleet. The remainder of the increase is due to higher working costs, 
which comprise higher bonuses due to higher gold production achieved relative to plan as well as the investment in additional resources 
in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all aspects of the operation. 

For Tarkwa, we have increased the 2016 AIC guidance to US$980 per ounce from US$940 per ounce, mainly due to a US$38 million increase 
in capital expenditure to US$166 million. The mine took advantage of the higher gold price and the benefits from the Development 
Agreement to increase capital stripping in order to increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond. 

Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative to plan in the first half of 2016, we have increased the 2016 
production guidance for the region to 925,000 ounces from 905,000 ounces.

Consequently, 2016 production guidance for the Group has been increased to 2.10 million ounces to 2.15 million ounces, from 
2.05 million ounces to 2.10 million ounces. AISC and AIC guidance for the year remains unchanged at US$1,000 per ounce to US$1,010 per 
ounce and US$1,035 per ounce to US$1,045 per ounce. AIC includes US$50 million for Salares Norte. Group capital expenditure has 
increased to US$655 million, from U$602 million. The cost guidance is based on unchanged exchange rate assumptions: US$0.73 = A$1.00 
and R14.14 = US$1.00. 

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on 
page 3.

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited condensed consolidated six monthly financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee 
and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the Companies Act of South 
Africa. 

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these six monthly financial statements are in terms of International Financial 
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the previous annual financial statements.

CERTIFICATION JUDGEMENT 
As previously indicated, the Respondents in the Certification Application, including Gold Fields, all opposed the certification 
application, which was heard by the Gauteng Local Division of the High Court from 12 to 23 October 2015.

On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, amongst other things: (1) the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising 
current and former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and 
(b) a tuberculosis class comprising current and former mine workers who have worked on the mines for a period of not less than two 
years and 
who have contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and the dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary tuberculosis; and 
(2) that the common law be developed to provide that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and subsequently dies before 
close of pleadings, the claim for general damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant. 

The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: (i) a determination of common issues, on an opt out basis, and 
(ii) the hearing and determination of individualized issues, on an opt in basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the 
Claimants.

The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the cases brought by the Claimants. The amount of damages has not 
yet been quantified for any of the claimants in the Consolidated Class Application or for any other members of the classes.

Gold Fields and the other Respondents believe that the judgment addressed a number of highly complex and important issues, including a 
far reaching amendment of the common law, that have not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa. The High Court 
itself found that the scope and magnitude of the proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class action would 
address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The companies applied for leave to appeal against the judgement because they believed 
that the courts ruling on some of these issues is incorrect and that another court may come to a different decision.

On 24 June 2016, the High Court granted the mining companies leave to appeal against the finding amending the common law in respect of 
the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused leave to appeal on the certification of silicosis and tuberculosis classes.

On 15 July, the Gold Fields and the other Respondents each filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against 
the certification of the two separate classes for silicosis and tuberculosis. In an attempt to shorten any delay due to an appeal 
process, it is permissible to request that the appeals be dealt with on an expedited basis. The companies intend to do this, should 
leave to appeal be granted by the Supreme Court of Appeal.

GOLD WORKING GROUP
The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group, made up of African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, 
Harmony and Sibanye Gold, remains of the view that achieving a mutually acceptable comprehensive settlement which is both fair to past, 
present and future employees, and sustainable for the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation. Notwithstanding that the 
companies deny liability for the claims, the Working Group will continue with its efforts  which have been ongoing for more than a 
year  to find common ground with stakeholders, including the claimants legal representatives.

HEDGING/DERIVATIVES 
The Groups policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price.  However, hedges are sometimes undertaken on a project specific basis as 
follows:

-  to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
-  for specific debt servicing requirements; and 
-  to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

South Africa Derivative Instrument*
On 25 February 2016, USD/ZAR forward exchange contracts (FECs) were entered into for a total delivery of US$69.8 million starting 
July 2016 until December 2016.  The average forward rate achieved over the 6 month period is R16.8273, based off an average spot rate 
of R16.0748.

At the reporting date, the marked-to-market value on the outstanding FEC is positive US$5.6 million.

Gold production increased by 20 per cent from 1,978 kilograms (63,600 ounces) in the March quarter to 2,378 kilograms (76,500 ounces) 
in the June quarter due to higher volumes.

Underground tonnes milled increased by 26 per cent from 332,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 418,000 tonnes in the June quarter. 
Total tonnes milled increased by 11 per cent from 543,000 tonnes to 601,000 tonnes.  Total tonnes milled in the June quarter included 
24,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 158,800 tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 23,000 tonnes of underground 
waste mined and 187,500 tonnes of surface tailings material in the March quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by 4 per cent from 
5.91 grams per tonne to 5.66 grams per tonne due to higher development tonnes mined in lower grade areas.

Development increased by 38 per cent from 1,292 metres in the March quarter to 1,786 metres in the June quarter.  New mine capital 
development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 6 per cent from 252 metres in the March quarter to 266 metres in the June quarter.  
Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above increased by 46 per cent from 1,040 metres to 1,520 metres.  Destress 
mining decreased by 5 per cent from 10,158 square metres in the March quarter to 9,687 square metres in the June quarter.  High profile 
destress mining improved by 35 per cent from 4,517 square metres to 6,082 square metres.  Low profile destress mining decreased by 
36 per cent from 5,641 square metres to 3,605 square metres due to the strategic change in the mining method from low to high profile 
destress which commenced in the September 2015 quarter.   The high profile and low profile methods contributed 63 per cent and 37 per 
cent, respectively, to total destress. All low profile destress was completed subsequent to quarter-end.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 66 per cent of the ore tonnes in the June quarter, while the new mine (below 95 
level) contributed 34 per cent.  The long-hole stoping method accounted for 39 per cent of total ore tonnes mined in the June quarter 
compared with 46 per cent in the March quarter.  The decrease is due to the temporary loss of two drill rigs after a fall of ground 
incident.

Operating costs increased by 12 per cent from R924 million (US$59 million) to R1,034 million (US$69 million) mainly due to higher 
bonuses paid and consumable expenditure directly related to the higher production achieved.  The electricity expenditure was higher 
than the previous quarter as a result of the start of the winter month tariffs in June 2016 and higher consumption related to the 
higher production achieved.  

Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from R262 million (US$17 million) to R420 million (US$28 million) as a result of higher 
spending on fleet and the purchase of mining accommodation for employees. As part of the fleet renewal strategy, 17 category 1 units 
were commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to be commissioned during the remainder of 2016. In the past 18 months, 
we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a total of 114 units.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 71 per cent from R230 million (US$15 million) in the March quarter to R393 million 
(US$26 million) in the June quarter due to additional fleet and the purchase of mining accommodation for employees.  Non-sustaining 
capital expenditure decreased by 16 per cent from R32 million (US$2 million) in the March quarter to R27 million (US$2 million) in the 
June quarter.

All-in sustaining costs increased by 3 per cent from R600,563 per kilogram (US$1,183 per ounce) in the March quarter to 
R615,697 per kilogram (US$1,268 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due to increased operating costs and higher sustaining capital 
expenditure, partially offset by increased gold sold.

Total all-in cost increased by 2 per cent from R616,706 per kilogram (US$1,215 per ounce) in the March quarter to R627,233 per kilogram 
(US$1,293 per ounce) in the June quarter due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 139,500 ounces in the March quarter to 134,100 ounces in the June quarter due to lower 
throughput as a result of unplanned downtime.  

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 3 per cent from 25.3 million tonnes in the March quarter to 26.0 million 
tonnes in the June quarter mainly due to improved equipment utilisation.  Ore tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 3.4 million 
tonnes to 3.2 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined was similar at 8.6 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined 
increased by 7 per cent from 13.3 million tonnes to 14.2 million tonnes.  Grade mined decreased from 1.41 grams per tonne to 1.36 grams 
per tonne.  The strip ratio increased from 6.6 to 7.0. 

The CIL plant throughput decreased by 6 per cent from 3.50 million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.30 million tonnes in the June 
quarter due to unplanned downtime mainly due to power outages. Realised yield increased by 2 per cent from 1.24 grams per tonne to 
1.26 grams per tonne due to higher feed grades processed as a result of blending.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, was similar at US$78 million.

Capital expenditure decreased by 10 per cent from US$48 million to US$43 million mainly due to expenditure on mining fleet in the 
March quarter.   

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased marginally from US$994 per ounce in the March quarter to US$991 per ounce in 
the June quarter due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 28 per cent from 41,700 ounces in the March quarter to 30,200 ounces in the June quarter mainly due to 
lower tonnes processed and lower grades mined and processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 15 per cent from 4.6 million tonnes in the March quarter to 5.3 million 
tonnes in the June quarter due to capital waste strip at Amoanda pit. 

Ore tonnes mined decreased by 25 per cent from 0.8 million tonnes to 0.6 million tonnes.  Total waste tonnes mined increased by 
24 per cent from 3.8 million tonnes in the March quarter to 4.7 million tonnes in the June quarter.  Head grade mined decreased by 
6 per cent from 1.46 grams per tonne to 1.37 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio increased from 4.5 to 8.1 due to capital waste strip at 
Amoanda pit.

Yield decreased by 22 per cent from 1.25 grams per tonne to 0.97 grams per tonne due to more low grade stockpiles processed.  For the 
March quarter, 0.67 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.56 grams per tonne and 0.37 million 
tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 0.99 grams per tonne. This compared with 0.48 million tonnes of fresh ore and 
oxides milled at an average grade of 1.28 grams per tonne and 0.49 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average grade of 
0.79 grams per tonne for the June quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 7 per cent from 1.04 million tonnes in the March quarter to 0.97 million tonnes in the June quarter 
mainly due to a tails line blockage which impacted production for 10 days caused by coarse grind and the fast settling nature of the 
ore.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 32 per cent from US$44 million to US$30 million, in line with 
lower ore tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure increased by 900 per cent from US$1 million to US$10 million with the majority spent on capital stripping at 
Amoanda pit.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 25 per cent from US$1,139 per ounce in the March quarter to US$1,427 per

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 34,800 ounces in the March quarter to 35,700 ounces in the June quarter.  Copper 
production increased by 8 per cent from 7,051 tonnes to 7,642 tonnes.  Equivalent gold production increased by 3 per cent from 
62,900 ounces to 64,600 ounces.  The increase in gold and copper production was due to higher head grades treated, in line with the 
mining sequence and the planned production schedule for the June quarter.  Gold head grade increased from 0.94 grams per tonne to 
0.98 grams per tonne and copper head grade increased from 0.49 per cent to 0.51 per cent.  Gold recoveries decreased from 68.5 per cent 
to 66.3 per cent and copper recoveries increased from 85.4 per cent to 88.0 per cent.  As a result, gold yield increased from 
0.64 grams per tonne to 0.65 grams per tonne and copper yield increased from 0.42 per cent to 0.45 per cent. 

In the June quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 32,900 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,252 per ounce and 
6,895 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of US$4,028 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This compared with 
33,939 ounces of gold sold at an average price of US$1,133 per ounce and 6,982 tonnes of copper sold at an average price of 
US$3,847 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, in the March quarter.  

Total tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.91 million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.65 million tonnes in the June quarter.  
The lower tonnes mined in the June quarter were as a result of the lower waste mined in line with the mine sequence.  Ore mined 
increased by 2 per cent from 1.76 million tonnes to 1.80 million tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 
2.15 million tonnes to 1.85 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased from 1.23 to 1.03 due to lower waste mined in the June quarter.

Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.75 million tonnes in the March quarter to 1.78 million tonnes in the June quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 9 per cent from US$33 million to US$30 million mainly due to 
US$7 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the June quarter compared with a US$1 million charge to cost in the March quarter.

Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from US$5 million to US$8 million due to more construction activities at the tailings dam 
as a result of the dry season.  

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 55 per cent from US$386 per ounce in the March quarter to US$599 per ounce 
in the June quarter mainly due to lower copper by-product credits and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net 
operating costs.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce increased by 6 per cent from US$709 per 
equivalent ounce to US$750 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 15 per cent from 178,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 151,000 tonnes in the 
June quarter due to the Athena mine closure in February.  The reduced tonnes were partially offset by a 4 per cent increase in head 
grade from 5.29 grams per tonne to 5.52 grams per tonne.  

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 23 per cent from 844,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 
1,035,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  Grade mined decreased by 16 per cent from 2.72 grams per tonne to 2.29 grams per tonne.  
The increased tonnes and lower grade were primarily due to increased ore from A5 open pit which is now complete.  Mining at A5 was 
undertaken to supplement production while the higher grade Neptune pit was being stripped.

Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 1.6 million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.1 million tonnes in the 
June quarter.  Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 19 per cent from 8.6 million tonnes to 7.0 million tonnes.  The strip ratio 
decreased from 12.1 to 9.6.  Total material movements at the open pits remained consistent at 11.1 million tonnes with a move from 
capital stripping to ore and waste movement as the A5 pit moved to completion and the Neptune pit advanced into the early stages of ore 
production.  

Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 997,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 950,000 ounces in the June quarter 
with the mill closed for the last week of the June quarter for the installation of a new electrical control block for the Sag mill.  
Yield increased from 2.70 grams per tonne to 2.91 grams per tonne due to a drawdown of gold-in-circuit in the June quarter as opposed 
to a build-up of gold-in-circuit in the March quarter.  Gold production from the Lefroy mill increased from 86,600 ounces to 
88,800 ounces. 

Residual leaching and irrigation of the heap leach pad contributed 400 ounces to production in the March quarter. Residual leaching 
has now ceased being economic and the heap leach is being closed.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, increased by 20 per cent from A$49 million (US$35 million) to A$59 million 
(US$44 million) mainly due to the transition from primarily pre-strip mining to operating waste and ore mining in the open pits. 

Capital expenditure increased by 9 per cent from A$45 million (US$33 million) to A$49 million (US$37 million) mainly due to 
acceleration of the exploration programme with expenditure increasing from A$9 million (US$6 million) in the March quarter to 
A$13 million (US$10 million) in the June quarter. 

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 11 per cent from A$1,182 per ounce (US$852 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,311 per ounce (US$976 per ounce) in the June quarter due to higher net operating costs and capital expenditure, partially offset 
by increased gold sold.

Tonnes processed decreased by 1 per cent from 284,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 282,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  The March 
quarter processing included net 32,000 tonnes of ore carried over from the December quarter but processed in the March quarter.  The 
combined yield increased by 11 per cent from 5.70 grams per tonne to 6.30 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined in the December 
quarter, but processed in the March quarter (as described in the preceding sentence) and a drawdown of 2,600 ounces produced in the 
March quarter during the June quarter. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 2 per cent from A$48 million (US$35 million) to A$47 million 
(US$35 million) mainly due the cost improvement initiatives implemented across the site.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$27 million (US$20 million).  The capital expenditure was primarily on capital development

Gold production decreased marginally from 18,700 ounces in the March quarter to 18,500 ounces in the June quarter due to lower grade 
mined. 

Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 100,300 tonnes to 104,500 tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased from 5.94 grams 
per tonne in the March quarter to 5.78 grams per tonne in the June quarter.  A further 20,000 tonnes at 0.87 grams per tonne were 
sourced from a surface oxide trial during the June quarter contributing approximately 500 ounces to production.  In the March quarter 
5,600 tonnes of oxide material at 3.05 grams per tonne were processed adding approximately 500 ounces to production.

Tonnes processed increased by 30 per cent from 100,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 130,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  The yield 
decreased by 24 per cent from 5.84 grams per tonne to 4.42 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined and a significantly larger but 
lower grade trial treatment of surface oxide ore in the June quarter.  

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, decreased by 5 per cent from A$21 million (US$16 million) to A$20 million 
(US$15 million) mainly due to a decrease in mining costs.

Capital expenditure increased by 33 per cent from A$6 million (US$4 million) to A$8 million (US$6 million).  Capital was mainly 
incurred on exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval ore body.  The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is 
expected to provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018.  The Oval ore body extends the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain 
its strategy of at least breaking even while it continues an aggressive exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields 
franchise asset.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent from A$1,534 per ounce (US$1,105 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,574 per ounce (US$1,167 per ounce) in the June quarter due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net 
operating costs.

Gold production increased by 13 per cent from 67,500 ounces in the March quarter to 76,200 ounces in the June quarter.

Ore mined from underground increased by 2 per cent from 378,000 tonnes to 385,000 tonnes.  Head grade mined increased from 5.99 grams 
per tonne in the March quarter to 7.04 grams per tonne in the June quarter.  The increased grade was due to stoping activity returning 
to better grade areas of the mine with operating development also advancing through higher grade zones than in the March quarter.  

Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 378,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 363,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  A net 
21,000 tonnes of ore mined in the June quarter is planned to be processed in the September quarter due to the campaign milling 
schedule.  The yield increased by 17 per cent from 5.56 grams per tonne to 6.51 grams per tonne due to higher grades mined. 

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, were similar at A$46 million (US$34 million).

Capital expenditure increased by 55 per cent from A$20 million (US$15 million) in the March quarter to A$31 million (US$23 million) in 
the June quarter.  The higher expenditure related to mine capital development, exploration and the sinking of the VR7 fresh air intake 
raise which will provide ventilation down to 100 level, the newest mining front. These projects accelerated during the June quarter 
after a slow start to the year.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent from A$1,054 per ounce (US$759 per ounce) in the March quarter to 
A$1,081 per ounce (US$805 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by increased gold 
sold.

TWO NEW APPOINTMENTS TO THE GOLD FIELDS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) is pleased to announce the appointments
of Alhassan Andani and Peter Bacchus as independent non-executive
directors to the Board of Gold Fields. This brings to four the
announcements of new non-executive directors to the Gold Fields Board over
the past two months.

The appointment of Mr Andani takes effect on 1 August 2016 and that of Mr
Bacchus on 1 September 2016. Earlier this month Gold Fields announced that
former KPMG Africa Chair Yunus Suleman will join the Board on 1 Sept ember
2016, while Impala Platinum CEO Terence Goodlace joined as a director on 1
July 2016.

Gold Fields Chairperson Cheryl Carolus said the four new directors will
ensure continuity of the skills set of the Board as a number of the
current directors were approaching retirement age over the next two years.
The new directors provide the technical, financial, commercial and global
mining experience necessary to help Gold Fields maintain and further
strengthen its position as a global leader in sustainable gold mining, Ms
Carolus said.

Mr Andani (55) is currently Chief Executive and Executive Director of
Stanbic Bank Ghana. He has held various directorship positions and is
currently the Board Chairman of the Ghana CSIR (Council for Scientific &
Industrial Research) and a director of SOS Villages Ghana. He holds a BSc
in Agriculture from the University of Ghana and a Masters Degree in
Banking and Finance from the Finafrica Institute in Italy.

Mr Bacchus (47) is the Global Head of Mining & Metals and Joint Head of
European Investment Banking at investment bank Jefferies, based in London.
Prior to this position he was Global Head of Mining & Metals at Morgan
Stanley and before then Head of Investment Banking, Industrials and
Natural Resources at Citigroup. Mr Bacchus has over 20 years experience
in investment and corporate banking with a focus on the global natural
resources sector. He is also a non-executive director of UK-listed mining
group NordGold and a trustee of Space for Giants, an African-focused
conservation charity. He is a qualified Chartered Accountant and holds a
Masters in Economics from Cambridge University, United Kingdom.

The appointments have been made in terms of paragraph 3.59 (a) of the
Listing Requirements of the JSE Limited.

Trading statement for six months to 30 June 2016

Johannesburg, 19 July 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) advises that earnings per share (EPS) for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 (H1 2016) are expected to be 1,400% (US$0.14)
higher than the US$0.00 per share reported for the six months ended
30 June 2015 (H1 2015), at US$0.14 per share. Headline earnings per
share (HEPS) for H1 2016 are expected to be 1,500% (US$0.15) higher
than the US$0.01 per share reported for H1 2015, at US$0.16 per
share.

In addition, normalised earnings for the period are expected to be
1,200% (US$0.12) higher than the US$0.01 per share reported for H1
2015 at US$0.13 per share.

The increases in EPS, HEPS and normalised earnings are primarily
driven by an increase in the US$ gold price (3% YoY) and lower net
operating costs in local currencies as well as the impact of
converting these costs at weaker exchange rates. In H1 2016, the A$
was 5% weaker YoY and the rand was 29% weaker YoY, against the US$.

Attributable gold equivalent production for Q2 2016 is expected to be
529koz (Q1 2016: 515koz), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of
US$1,023/oz (Q1 2016: US$961/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of
US$1,061/oz (Q1 2016: US$986/oz).

For H1 2016, attributable gold equivalent production is expected to
be 1,044koz (H1 2015: 1,036koz), with AISC of US$992/oz (H1 2015:
US$1,083/oz) and AIC of US$1,024/oz (H1 2015: US$1,108/oz).

The forecast financial information on which this trading statement is
based has not been reviewed, and reported on, by the Companys
external auditors.

Gold Fields will release H1 2016 financial results on Thursday, 18
August 2016.

MEDIA RELEASE

Credit facilities successfully refinanced

Johannesburg, 7 June 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) has successfully
refinanced its US$1,440m credit facilities due in November 2017. The new facilities amount to
US$1,290m and comprise three tranches:

A. US$380m - 3-year term loan  margin 250 basis points (bps) over Libor
B. US$360m - 3-year revolving credit facility (RCF) (with an option to extend to up to 5 years)- margin
   220bps over Libor
C. US$550m - 5-year RCF- margin 245bps over Libor

The new facilities have been concluded with a syndicate of 15 banks. On average, the interest rate on
the new facilities is similar to the interest rate on the existing facilities. A total of US$645m will be
drawn from the new facilities to repay the groups existing US$ facilities, with US$645m remaining
unutilised.

The refinancing is a key milestone in Gold Fields balance sheet management and increases the
maturity of its debt, with the first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 2017).

In addition, since the start of the year, Gold Fields has successfully reduced its net debt by
approximately US$150m following the tender offer on the bonds and the accelerated equity raising.

Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's revised the outlook on the long-term credit rating of
Gold Fields (Moodys: Ba1; S&P: BB+) to stable from negative in March and April, respectively.

Statement by Nick Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

OVERVIEW AND UPDATE

Gold Fields has had a solid start to 2016. Attributable equivalent gold production for the quarter was 3% higher YoY (9%
lower QoQ) at 515koz, but importantly tracking FY16 guidance. Encouragingly, all eight operations exceeded their planned
production for the quarter. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) were 16% lower YoY (3% higher QoQ) at US$961/oz and all-in costs
(AIC) were 15% lower YoY (5% higher QoQ) at US$986/oz. Both AISC and AIC are tracking below the cost guidance for the
full year provided in February 2016. The average US$ gold price achieved was largely unchanged YoY at US$1,192/oz, but
was 9% or US$100/oz higher QoQ. The average Australian dollar for the quarter was 0.72 (9% weaker YoY and flat QoQ),
while the average rand for the quarter was 15.79 (35% weaker YoY and 12% weaker QoQ).

Q1 2016 operational performance

Despite being a seasonally weak quarter for South African mines, South Deep managed to absorb some of the impact of the
Christmas holidays due to production from voluntary shifts worked over the holiday period. Production from the mine was
75% higher YoY and only 7% lower QoQ at 64koz. Consequently, AIC was 20% lower YoY and 18% higher QoQ in rand
terms (largely due to lower production) at R616,706/kg (US$1,215/oz). The transition to high profile (HP) destress mining,
which commenced in H2 2015, progressed during Q1 2016, increasing 51% QoQ to 4,517 square meters. HP destress
accounted for 44% of total destress meters at the mine in Q1 2016.

Managed production in Ghana for Q1 2016 was 181koz, up 4% YoY (down 3% QoQ), with AIC of US$1,028/oz, down 21%
YoY (up 11% QoQ). Gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona was down 6% YoY (5% QoQ) at 63koz, with AIC of US$709
per equivalent ounce, down 34% QoQ (up 6% YoY). The Australian region produced 225koz for the quarter, down 7% YoY
(down 14% QoQ), with AIC of A$1,254/oz (US$904/oz), up 1% YoY (9% QoQ) in A$ terms.

The evaluation of various options for our Damang mine in Ghana are ongoing. We are on track to make a decision and provide
an update to the market by mid-year.

Strengthening the balance sheet

In February 2016, we bought back US$148m of our US$1bn 4.875% guaranteed notes due 7 October 2020 through a tender
offer, utilising our existing available revolving credit facilities, at 88% of nominal value.

Subsequently, in March, we successfully completed a R2.3bn (US$150m) accelerated equity raising by way of a private
placement to institutional investors. The net proceeds from the Placing was applied to the existing US$ revolving credit facility
that was utilised to purchase the Notes.

The net effect of these transactions, is a reduction in the net debt to EBITDA ratio, on a pro forma basis, from 1.38x to 1.21x,
as at 31 December 2015, which moves us closer to achieving one of our key strategic objectives of net debt to EBITDA of
1.0x.

Development agreement concluded in Ghana

One of the key highlights of the quarter, was the conclusion of a development agreement with the Government of Ghana for
both Tarkwa and Damang. We commend the Government of Ghana for creating a fair and competitive environment in the
country. This important step provides the platform for targeting many years of sustainable production by Gold Fields in Ghana.
The highlights of the agreement include:

     -    A reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 32.5%, effective 17 March 2016; and
     -    A change in the royalty rate from a flat 5% of revenue to a sliding scale royalty based on the gold price, with effect
          from 1 January 2017, which would be 3% of revenue up to a gold price of US$1,300/oz.

Success in native title appeal

At the end of the quarter, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia overturned a July 2014 Federal Court decision that
the re-grant of certain tenements to St Ives in 2004 by the State was not compliant with the correct processes in the Native
Title Act 1993 (Cth). The decision provides clarity on the status of our tenements and we will continue to openly engage with
the Ngadju People, and all other community stakeholders in relation to our operations in Australia.

FY16 outlook intact

Guidance for attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2016 remains unchanged at between 2.05Moz and
2.10Moz. AISC is expected to be between US$1,000/oz and US$1,010/oz and AIC is expected to be between US$1,035/oz
and US$1,045/oz.

2016 Reviewed Mining Charter

Gold Fields has noted the publication on Friday, 15 April 2016, by the Minister of Mineral Resources of a reviewed draft of
the Broad-based socio-economic empowerment charter for the South African mining industry that has been prepared by the
Department of Mineral Resources (DMR). Although the mining industry was not consulted prior to its publication, Gold Fields
will engage with the DMR, through the Chamber and appropriate structures, during the consultation period which ends on 31
May 2016.

Gold production decreased by 7 per cent from 2,119 kilograms
(68,100 ounces) in the December quarter to 1,978 kilograms
(63,600 ounces) in the March quarter due to lower volumes mined
as a result of the extended Christmas break, partially offset by
increased grades.

Total tonnes milled decreased by 1 per cent from 549,000 tonnes
in the December quarter to 543,000 tonnes in the March quarter.
Total tonnes milled in the March quarter included 23,000 tonnes of
underground waste mined and 187,500 tonnes of surface tailings
material compared with 23,000 tonnes of underground waste mined
and 122,300 tonnes of surface tailings material in the December
quarter. Underground reef yield increased by 13 per cent from 5.21
grams per tonne to 5.91 grams per tonne due to improved grades
towards the end of the quarter.

Development decreased by 10 per cent from 1,443 metres in the
December quarter to 1,292 metres in the March quarter. New mine
capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) decreased by 20 per
cent from 314 metres in the December quarter to 252 metres in the
March quarter. Development in the current mine areas in 95 level
and above decreased by 8 per cent from 1,129 metres to 1,040
metres. Destress mining increased by 38 per cent from 7,357
square metres in the December quarter to 10,158 square metres in
the March quarter. High profile destress mining improved by 51 per
cent from 2,990 square metres to 4,517 square metres. Low profile
destress mining improved by 29 per cent from 4,367 square metres
to 5,641 square metres. The high profile and low profile methods
contributed 44 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively, to total
destress.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 64 per cent of
the ore tonnes in the March quarter, while the new mine (below 95
level) contributed 36 per cent.   The long-hole stoping method
accounted for 46 per cent of total ore tonnes mined compared with
39 per cent in the December quarter.

Operating costs increased by 8 per cent from R857 million (US$61
million) to R924 million (US$59 million), mainly due to higher
bonuses paid and overtime worked during the Christmas break.

Capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent from R243 million
(US$17 million) to R262 million (US$17 million) as a result of higher
spending on fleet and the upgrade of the Twin shaft man winder.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R184 million (US$13
million) in the December quarter to R230 million (US$15 million) in
the March quarter due to additional fleet and the refurbishment of
the Twin shaft man winder. Non-sustaining capital expenditure
decreased from R59 million (US$4 million) in the December quarter

Gold production decreased by 5 per cent from 36,800 ounces in the
December quarter to 34,800 ounces in the March quarter. Copper
production increased by 6 per cent from 6,645 tonnes to 7,051
tonnes. Equivalent gold production decreased by 5 per cent from
66,200 ounces to 62,900 ounces. The decrease in gold production
was due to lower head grade treated, in line with the mine
sequencing and the planned production schedule for the March
quarter. Gold head grade decreased from 0.97 grams per tonne to
0.94 grams per tonne and copper head grade increased from 0.47
per cent to 0.49 per cent. Gold recoveries decreased from 71.4 per
cent to 68.5 per cent and copper recoveries were similar at 85.4 per
cent. As a result, gold yield decreased from 0.69 grams per tonne
to 0.64 grams per tonne and copper yield increased from 0.40 per
cent to 0.42 per cent.

In the March quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 33,939
ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,133 per ounce
and 6,982 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of
US$3,847 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This
compared with 37,622 ounces of gold that was sold at an average
price of US$1,109 per ounce and 6,770 tonnes of copper that was
sold at an average price of US$4,229 per tonne, net of treatment
and refining charges, in the December quarter. Total equivalent
gold sales decreased by 9 per cent from 67,500 ounces to 61,600
ounces mainly due to lower gold content and lower copper price
factor.

Total tonnes mined increased by 18 per cent from 3.31 million
tonnes in the December quarter to 3.91 million tonnes in the March
quarter. The higher tonnes mined in the March quarter were in line
with the mine sequence and the planned production schedule to
access new ore areas. Ore mined increased by 2 per cent from
1.72 million tonnes to 1.76 million tonnes.  Operational waste
tonnes mined increased by 35 per cent from 1.59 million tonnes to
2.15 million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 0.92 to 1.23 due
to higher waste mined in the March quarter.

Ore processed increased by 1 per cent from 1.73 million tonnes in
the December quarter to 1.75 million tonnes in the March quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 15 per cent from US$39 million to US$33 million
mainly due to higher planned maintenance at the processing plant
in the December quarter.

Capital expenditure decreased by 82 per cent from US$28 million
to US$5 million due to timing and less construction activities at the
tailings dam as a result of the rainy season. In addition, the
construction of the new camp was completed.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 70 per cent
from US$1,285 per ounce in the December quarter to US$386 per
ounce in the March quarter, mainly due to lower net operating costs
and capital expenditure and higher copper by-product credit. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent ounce
decreased by 34 per cent from US$1,073 per equivalent ounce to
US$709 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as
above.

  December quarter).

Gold production decreased by 13 per cent from 100,400 ounces in
the December quarter to 87,000 ounces in the March quarter
primarily due to the closure of the Athena underground mine in
February 2016 and a build-up of gold in circuit.

Total tonnes mined increased by 44 per cent from 7.8 million tonnes
in the December quarter to 11.2 million tonnes in the March quarter.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 25 per cent
from 237,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 178,000 tonnes in
the March quarter with the Athena mine closure in February. The
reduced tonnes were partially offset by a 3 per cent increase in
head grade from 5.16 grams per tonne to 5.29 grams per tonne.

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 28
per cent from 660,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 844,000
tonnes in the March quarter. Grade mined decreased by 11 per
cent from 3.07 grams per tonne to 2.72 grams per tonne. The
increased tonnes and lower grade were primarily due to the lower
grade A5 open pit coming into production during the March quarter.
A5 is a small pit which is expected to supplement production while
the higher grade Neptune pit is being stripped.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 24 per cent from 2.1
million tonnes in the December quarter to 1.6 million tonnes in the
March quarter. Capital waste tonnes mined increased by 79 per
cent from 4.8 million tonnes to 8.6 million tonnes. The strip ratio
increased from 10.4 to 12.1. The increased capital waste tonnes

mined were the result of the stripping campaigns at Neptune and
A5 which will complement the Invincible pit as St Ives moves to a
predominately open pit operation with the closure of the Athena
underground mine.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased by 2 per cent from 974,000
tonnes in the December quarter to 997,000 tonnes in the March
quarter with more open pit ore available for processing.       Yield
decreased from 3.21 grams per tonne to 2.71 grams per tonne in
line with decreased open pit grades mined and an increase in gold
in circuit of 9,200 ounces. Gold production from the Lefroy mill
decreased from 100,200 ounces to 86,600 ounces.

Residual leaching and irrigation of the existing heap leach pad
continued and a further 400 ounces were produced in the March
quarter. This compared with 200 ounces produced in the
December quarter. Since cessation of stacking activities, a total of
24,800 ounces have been produced. This process will continue
until pregnant solutions become uneconomic.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 25 per cent from A$65 million (US$46 million) to A$49
million (US$35 million), mainly due to a A$10 million (US$7 million)
build-up of inventory in the March quarter compared with A$1
million (US$1 million) in the December quarter as well as reduced
ore tonnes mined.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$45 million (US$33 million).

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 1 per cent
from A$1,171 per ounce (US$836 per ounce) in the December
quarter to A$1,182 per ounce (US$852 per ounce) in the March
quarter due to decreased gold sold, partially offset by lower net
operating costs.

due to lower tonnes and grades mined as planned.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 19 per cent from
313,000 tonnes in the December quarter to 252,000 tonnes in the
March quarter due to lower ounces mined in the New Holland mine
as the mine transitions into the new Cinderella orebody. Head
grade mined decreased by 11 per cent from 7.25 grams per tonne
to 6.45 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grade areas being
mined in the New Holland mine in the December quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 5 per cent from 298,000 tonnes in
the December quarter to 284,000 tonnes in the March quarter due
to a planned maintenance shutdown in February. The combined
yield decreased from 6.88 grams per tonne to 5.70 grams per tonne

due to lower grades mined and the processing of lower grade ore
mined in the December quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
increased by 9 per cent from A$44 million (US$31 million) to A$48
million (US$35 million) mainly due to a A$1 million (US$1 million)
drawdown of inventory in the March quarter compared with a A$4

the mining sequence.

Tonnes processed decreased by 15 per cent from 118,000 tonnes
in the December quarter to 100,000 tonnes in the March quarter.
The yield decreased from 6.52 grams per tonne to 5.84 grams per
tonne due to lower grade ore mined and trial treatment of surface
oxide ore. A surface oxide trial contributed 522 ounces to gold
production for the March quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,

proceeded through areas of lower grade than were accessed in the
December quarter, and in line with the plan.

Ore mined from underground increased by 7 per cent from 353,000
tonnes to 378,000 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased from 6.51
grams per tonne in the December quarter to 5.99 grams per tonne
in the March quarter. Increased operating development advance
(1,678m versus 1,423m) added lower grade ore to the total,
reducing the overall grade.

Tonnes processed increased by 5 per cent from 359,000 tonnes in
the December quarter to 378,000 tonnes in the March quarter in
line with the increase in mined tonnes. The yield decreased from
6.26 grams per tonne to 5.56 grams per tonne due to lower head
grades.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 2 per cent from A$47 million (US$34 million) to A$46

Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from A$27 million
(US$20 million) in the December quarter to A$20 million (US$15
million) in the March quarter. The lower expenditure related to
capital mine development, exploration and the completion of the
2015 capital works programme in the December quarter. Sinking
of the VR7 fresh air intake raise commenced during the March
quarter. This is expected to provide an essential additional source
of ventilation for the lower parts of the mine and will be
supplemented by a refrigeration plant. Installation of the gas-fired
power station was approaching completion at the end of the
quarter. During the June quarter the operation is planned to switch
over to this clean, reliable source of low cost power, with some of
the existing diesel generators being used for back-up and
supplementary power.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 4 per cent
from A$1,101 per ounce (US$787 per ounce) in the December to
A$1,054 per ounce (US$759 per ounce) in the March quarter
mainly due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower

Abridged consolidated financial statements

Gold Fields Limited  
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa

Issuer code: GOGOF

Abridged consolidated financial statements

Notes to the summary consolidated financial statements

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The summary consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for abridged reports and
the requirements of the Companies Act 2008 of South Africa applicable to summary financial statements. The Listings Requirements require abridged reports to be
prepared in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and
the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards
Council and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, from which the summary consolidated financial statements were derived,
are in terms of IFRS and are consistent with those applied in the previously issued consolidated financial statements except for the adoption of applicable amendments
to new standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

The Group adopted the annual improvements to IFRSs 2010 - 2012 cycle  various standards during 2015 which did not significantly impact the Group's financial
results.

This summarised report is extracted from audited information, but is not itself audited. The annual financial statements were audited by KPMG Inc., who expressed an
unmodified opinion thereon. The audited annual financial statements and the auditor's report thereon are available for inspection at the company's registered office.
The directors take full responsibility for the preparation of the abridged report and the financial information has been correctly extracted from the underlying annual
financial statements.

The information for the quarters ended September 2015, December 2015 and December 2014 as well as the segmental operating results included in these summary
consolidated financial statements have not been audited by KPMG Inc. The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the information contained in this
announcement. Shareholders are therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the nature of the auditor's engagement they should obtain a copy of
the auditor's report together with the accompanying financial information from the issuer's registered office.

LITIGATION STATEMENT

In relation to the Litigation statement, there has been no further update since the release of the Integrated Annual Report on 31 March 2015 except for:

South Deep tax dispute

The Group has taken legal advice on the matter and was advised by external Senior Counsel that South African Revenue Services (SARS) should not be allowed to
disallow the claiming of the Additional Capital Allowance. GFIJVH has in the meantime not only formally appealed against the position taken by SARS, but also filed
an application in the High Court and will vigorously defend its position.

Update of the Silicosis class action

The two class action applications were consolidated into one application on 17 October 2014. In terms of the consolidated class action application, the court is asked
to allow the class actions to be certified. The consolidated application was heard during the weeks of 12 and 19 October 2015. Judgment was reserved. If certification
is granted, it will be the first step in a process whereby the applicants will, on behalf of the class or classes, seek to hold Gold Fields and the other mining companies
liable for silicosis and/or tuberculosis and the resultant consequences. Any such claims will be defended.

Mining Charter ownership element declaration application

On 5 June 2015, the Chamber of Mines commenced a court application against the Minister and Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources regarding
the continuing consequences of previous BEE deals in measuring progress on the Mining Charter's ownership element. The parties' legal representatives met with
the Deputy Judge President of the North Gauteng High Court on 11 November 2015, where it was agreed that the application hearing will take place on 15 and 16
March 2016. The court heard the application to consolidate on 15 March 2016 and judgement was reserved to a future date to be confirmed. The Chamber Application
did not commence and was postponed to a future date yet to be determined.

SEC investigation

On 22 June 2015 Gold Fields Limited was informed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit of the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the Commission)
that it has concluded its investigation in connection with the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transaction related to South Deep and, based on the information
available to them, will not recommend to the Commission that enforcement action be taken against Gold Fields.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WRITE-OFFS

Asset impairments and write-offs recognised by the Group during 2015 include:

- Impairment of the Group's investment in Far South East (FSE) in the Philippines (US$101 million) to its recoverable amount;
- Impairment of the Group's investment in Hummingbird (US$15 million) to its fair value;
- Write-off of stockpiles at Damang (US$8 million) due to net realisable value adjustments;
- Impairment of Artic Platinum project (APP) (US$39 million) to its fair value less cost of disposal;
- Impairment at Darlot (US$14 million); and
- Impairment at Damang (US$36 million).

TAXATION

The major items causing the Group's income taxation to differ from the maximum South Africa statutory mining tax rate of 34 per cent include:

- Non-deductible share-based payments;
- Non-deductible interest expense;
- Deferred tax asset not recognised on impairments of FSE, APP and Hummingbird;
- Deferred taxation charge on Peruvian Nuevo Sol devaluation against the US Dollar (the functional currency of Cerro Corona is US Dollar, however, the Peruvian
  tax base is based on values in Peruvian Nuevo Sol); and
- Deferred tax assets derecognised at Damang and Cerro Corona.

AMENDMENT TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

At 31 December 2015, Cerro Corona did not meet certain covenants specified in the revolving senior secured credit facility agreement. The lenders have subsequently
waived their rights and entitlements arising from the failure of Cerro Corona to meet the specific covenants. Notwithstanding the waiver received from the lenders and
the fact that there is currently no legal or constructive obligation to settle the debt within the next 12 months, IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements, requires that
the balance outstanding of US$42 million under the revolving senior secured credit facility be disclosed as a current liability. The above balance was disclosed as long-
term in the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Restructuring of $1 billion Notes issue (Notes)

Subsequent to year-end, on 19 February 2016, Gold Fields Australasia (Proprietary) Limited (""GFA"") announced an offer to purchase $200.0 million of its Notes at
discounts of 17% to the original value. GFA would pay a minimum of $830 for every $1,000 of the securities. Gold Fields announces that it has accepted for purchase
an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to US$147.6 million at the purchase price of $880 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes. Gold Fields intends to hold
the notes acquired until their maturity on 7 October 2020. The purchase of the notes amounting to $147.6 million was financed by drawing down under the US$1,510
million term loan and revolving credit facilities.

Accelerated equity raising

Gold Fields successfully completed a US$150.0 million (R2.3 billion) accelerated equity raising by way of a private placement (""the Placing"") to institutional investors.

The offer was significantly oversubscribed and a total number of 38,857,913 new Gold Fields shares were placed at a price of R59.50 per share which represents a
discount of 6.0% to the 30-day volume weighted average traded price, for the period ended March 17, 2016 and a 0.7% discount to the 50-day moving average. The
net proceeds from the Placing will be applied to the existing $1,510 term loan and revolving credit facilities that was utilised to purchase the notes amounting to $147.6
million, as described above.
 
Final dividend

On 16 February 2016, Gold Fields declared a final dividend of R0.21 (US$0.01) per share.

ADDITIONAL NOTES INCLUDE

Hedging/Derivatives (Audited)

The Group's policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken on a project specific basis as follows:

- to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
- for specific debt servicing requirements; and
- to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

There were no outstanding contracts at December 2015.

Gold Fields Australia wins appeal in native title proceedings


Johannesburg, 29 March 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce that the Full Court of the Federal
Court of Australia today overturned a July 2014 Federal Court
decision that the re-grant of certain tenements to Gold Fields
Australias St Ives mine in 2004 by the State was not compliant with
the correct processes in the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).

As such, the Federal Court has confirmed that St Ives re-granted
tenements are valid for the purpose of the Native Title Act, and
that whilst St Ives rights as tenement holder and the Ngadju
Peoples native title rights shall coexist, St Ives rights shall
prevail should there be any inconsistencies.

Gold Fields welcomes this finding, which confirms that it has at all
times complied with its legal obligations in respect of its dealings
with these tenements. Gold Fields will continue to openly engage
with the Ngadju People, and all other community stakeholders in
relation to its operations in Australia.

It is not yet clear whether the Ngadju People will seek to appeal
this decision.

Johannesburg, 18 March 2016: Gold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE,
NYSE: GFI) has successfully completed a R2.3bn (US$150m) accelerated
equity raising by way of a private placement to institutional
investors.

The offer was significantly oversubscribed and a total number of
38,857,913 new Gold Fields shares were placed at a price of R59.50
per share which represents a discount of 6.0% to the 30-day volume
weighted average traded price (VWAP), for the period ended 17 March
2016 and a 0.7% discount to the 50-day moving average.

On 19 February 2016, Gold Fields launched a tender offer to buy back
up to US$200m of its US$1bn 4.875% guaranteed notes due 7 October
2020. Gold Fields accepted US$147.61m of the Notes tendered, at a
purchase price of US$880 per US$1,000 in principal amount of the
Notes (88% of the notional value), utilising its existing available
revolving credit facilities. This translates to a yield to maturity
of 8.1% per annum on the bonds accepted.

The net proceeds from the Placing will be applied to the Companys
existing US$ revolving credit facility that was utilised to purchase
the Notes.

The net effect of these transactions, will be a reduction in the net
debt to EBITDA ratio from 1.38x to 1.21x, as at 31 December 2015,
which gets Gold Fields closer to achieving one of its key strategic
objectives of net debt to EBITDA of 1.0x.

The Companys FY16 guidance of gold equivalent production of 2.05 to
2.10Moz at all-in costs of US$1,035-1,045/oz remains intact.
The Placing was executed by Merrill Lynch International acting as
global coordinator and bookrunner and Scotiabank as co-bookrunner.

The Bookbuild was significantly oversubscribed and a total number of 38,857,913
new Gold Fields ordinary shares (the Placing Shares) were placed with qualifying
institutional investors at a price of R59.50 per Placing Share (Placing Price), raising
gross proceeds of R2.5 billion. The Placing Shares being issued represent

LAUNCH OF ACCELERATED OFFERING TO RAISE UP TO ZAR2.5 BILLION


Gold Fields hereby announces the launch of an accelerated offering of up to 38,857,914
new ordinary shares (the Placing) of Gold Fields (Placing Shares) constituting
approximately 5% of its issued share capital, to raise approximately ZAR2.5 billion,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, through a bookbuilding process (the
Bookbuild) to be carried out by Merrill Lynch International (BofA Merrill Lynch), which
is acting as sole global coordinator and bookrunner in relation to the Placing, and Scotia
Capital Inc. (Scotiabank), which is acting as co-bookrunner in relation to the Placing
(each, a Manager and, together, the Managers).

Rationale for the Placing and use of proceeds

On 19 February 2016, Gold Fields launched a tender offer to buy back up to US$200
million of its US$1 billion 4.875% guaranteed notes due 7 October 2020 (the Notes).
Gold Fields accepted US$147.61 million of the Notes tendered, at a purchase price of
US$880 per US$1,000 in principal amount of the Notes (88% of the notional value),
utilising its existing available revolving credit facilities. The net proceeds from the Placing
will be applied to the Companys existing US$ revolving credit facility that was utilised to
purchase the Notes.

The Placing Shares will be issued by Gold Fields under its existing general authority to
issue shares for cash.

Launch of the Bookbuild

The Placing Shares will be offered to qualifying institutional investors only, and the
Placing does not and will not constitute, nor is it intended to constitute, an offer to the
public to purchase or subscribe for any Placing Shares.

The book for the Bookbuild will open with immediate effect and is expected to close by
17:00 (South African time) on Friday, 18 March 2016. Pricing and allocations will be
announced as soon as practicable following the closing of the book. The timing of the
closing of the book, the pricing of the Placing Shares and the making of allocations will
be agreed by Gold Fields and BofA Merrill Lynch and will be announced as soon as
possible after the close of the Bookbuild.
The Placing Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in
all respects with the existing ordinary shares of the Company, including the right to
receive all dividends and other distributions declared in respect of such ordinary shares
after the date of issue of the Placing Shares. Gold Fields will apply for admission of the
Placing Shares to trade on the Main Board of the JSE Limited (JSE). Listing and trading
of the Placing Shares on the JSE is expected to commence at 09:00 (South African time)
three business days after the close of the Bookbuild, subject to the JSEs approval.

Under the placing agreement entered into between Gold Fields and the Managers (the
Placing Agreement), Gold Fields and its subsidiaries will not, subject to customary
exceptions relating to employee share participation and similar arrangements, issue any
further ordinary shares for a period of 90 days from the closing date of the Placing,
without the prior consent of BofA Merrill Lynch.

The Placing is conditional, inter alia, upon admission of the Placing Shares to trading on
the Main Board of the JSE becoming effective and the Placing Agreement not being
terminated.

Statement by Nick Holland,
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields

2015 was another challenging year for the
gold industry, with the US$ gold price
peaking at around US$1,300/oz in January
and then falling approximately US$250/oz
through the course of the year, with much
volatility, to close 2015 at the US$1,050/oz
level. For Gold Fields, however, weakening
commodity currencies provided some offset
to the weaker US$ gold price. Combined
with ongoing cost saving initiatives and
efficiency improvements, the Group
generated net cash flow of US$123 million for
the year. This performance, driven by our
strong international portfolio, has enabled
Gold Fields to meet its commitments of
paying dividends and improving the balance
sheet. At South Deep, good progress has
been made on getting the basics right, with
early encouraging indicators emerging in H2
2015.

Q4 2015 highlights

Q4 2015 attributable equivalent gold
production was 566koz (up 2% quarter on
quarter), with all-in sustaining costs (AISC)
and all-in costs (AIC) down 2% quarter on
quarter to US$929/oz and US$942/oz,
respectively. Production from South Deep
was 24% higher quarter on quarter at
2,119kg (68koz), on the back of a 42%
quarter on quarter increase in Q3 2015.
Despite a further reduction in the average
gold price during the quarter to US$1,092/oz,

the operations generated net cash flow of
US$47 million.

The gold price steadily decreased through 2015, to average the year at US$1,140/oz

(FY14: US$1,249/oz). Notwithstanding the approximate US$100/oz
decrease in the average gold price, the Group managed to achieve a
reduction of US$73 million in the net debt balance.

Impairments of US$300 million were
recognised in Q4 2015, which includes US$50
million of mine impairments (mainly related to
the current outlook for Darlot and Damang);
US$145 million of investment impairments;
and US$105 million of deferred tax assets
derecognised.

Normalised earnings for the quarter were
US$15 million or 2 cents per share. In-line
with our dividend policy, we have declared a
final dividend of 21 per share, taking the full
year dividend to 25 cents per share. During
Q4 2015, there was a further reduction in the
net debt balance to US$1,380 million (30
September 2015: US$1,427 million), which
resulted in an improvement in the net debt to
EBITDA ratio to 1.38x, from 1.41x at the end
of Q3 2015.

For FY15, attributable equivalent gold
production for the group was 2.16Moz (FY14:
2.22Moz), within 1% of the original guidance
provided in February 2015. AISC and AIC
came in below 2014 and better than both the
original (February 2015) and revised
(November 2015) guidance at US$1,007/oz
(FY14: US$1,053/oz) and US$1,026/oz
(FY14: US$1,087/oz), respectively.


Strong end to the year at South Deep

South Deep had another improved quarter, with gold production up
24% quarter on quarter to 2,119kg (68koz) (almost double Q1 2015
production), driven by an increase in tonnes (+20% quarter on
quarter) and head grade from underground sources (+4% quarter on
quarter). Consequently, AIC fell 19% quarter on quarter to
US$1,156/oz. Q1 2016 is expected to be lower quarter on quarter
due to the Christmas holidays, however, it is expected to be better
than Q1 2015 as a result of the back to basics approach adopted
during the past year.

There was further progress made on a number of important activities
at the mine in Q4 2015:

-   Safety continues to be a priority, with no fatalities in the quarter or
    in H2 2015 and the TRIFR 40% lower quarter on quarter at 2.12.
-   Assisted by the higher rand gold price, there was a material
    reduction in the cash outflow to R57 million from R266 million in
    the previous quarter.
-   Development decreased marginally (-3% quarter on quarter) in
    the December 2015 quarter to 1,443 metres.
-   The roll out of the new high profile destress mining progressed
    well during the quarter. At the end of the year, all destress cuts at
    the mine had been converted to high profile with the exception of
    corridor 1 (approximately 70% of the mine is now employing high
    profile destress). Given the transition to high profile, there was an
    expected decrease in destress mining from 9,523 square metres
    in Q3 2015 to 7,357 square metres in Q4 2016.
-   Secondary support increased by 33% quarter on quarter, while
    backfill placed increased by 25% quarter on quarter.
-   During 2015 the fleet was optimised and a total of 24 category 1
    machines were delivered to the mine during the year, with all
    machines, except one, commissioned before year-end. An
    additional 17 machines will be acquired during 2016. The
    maintenance capacity at South Deep improved through the
    course of the year through the implementation of the OEM
    maintenance contracts in corridor 2 (approximately 35% of total
    mining), as well as the commissioning of the 93 level workshop.
-   The recruitment of the identified critical skills was 98% completed
    at the end of 2015. Importantly, most of the core mining and
    engineering positions have now been filled. With the requisite
    skills in place, we expect further improvements across the mining
    value chain at South Deep during 2016.
-   During 2015 a marked improvement in the physical conditions
    have been achieved across the mine. Further improvements are
    expected in 2016, particularly through the new underground
    roadway construction and maintenance project to be initiated in
    Q1 2016.

Good cost performance in Ghana, without any
currency tailwind

Attributable gold production in Ghana decreased by 3% quarter on
quarter to 174koz, driven by lower production at both Tarkwa and
Damang. However, AIC was 4% lower quarter on quarter at
US$925/oz. Unfortunately, Tarkwa had a difficult end to the year
following a fatality at the mine in early December. Tarkwa managed
to continue its good cost performance and reported an 8% quarter on
quarter decrease in AIC to US$799/oz and generated net cash flow of
US$14 million.

Damang had another challenging quarter with production and costs
deteriorating quarter on quarter. As reported with the Q3 2015
results, we continue to evaluate various options for Damang. We
expect to complete this work before the middle of the year.

Lower copper price impacts Peru

Production at Cerro Corona of both gold and copper decreased
quarter on quarter due to lower head grades. Combined with the
lower copper price, attributable equivalent gold production decreased
16% quarter on quarter to 66koz. On the back of the lower equivalent
production, AIC per equivalent ounce increased to US$1,073/oz.

Australia

Gold production in Australia increased 6% quarter on quarter to
263koz, due to higher production at St Ives and Agnew/Lawlers.
Consequently, AIC decreased 5% quarter on quarter to US$819/oz.
The region had another strong quarter, generating US$86 million of
net cash flow, compared to US$64 million in the September 2015
quarter. The Yilgarn South acquisition was fully repaid by the end of
October, which is an exceptional payback period of two years.

Production at St Ives increased 20% quarter on quarter mainly due to
increased tonnes processed and higher grades. Agnew/Lawlers
continued its recovery from the challenging ground conditions at
Waroonga earlier in 2015, reporting a 14% quarter on quarter
increase in production. Lower grades mined at Granny Smith
resulted in a 12% quarter on quarter decrease in gold production,
while production at Darlot was 3% lower quarter on quarter.

The Australian region materially increased its exploration spend
(A$91 million) and activity during 2015 as part of a three-year strategy
to increase reserves and resources at the various operations. In
additional to exploration drilling to increase current orebodies, activity
was also focused on developing new targets on the prospective
leases. At St Ives, there have been prospective anomalies on the
Speedway Trend and some positive early indications on the Eastern
Causeway. Work at Agnew/Lawlers has shown good potential at
Cinderella and the adjacent Waroonga North/Kath complex could be
an analogue to Kim. Exploration at Granny Smith has indicated
further mineralisation at depth. Multiple targets have been identified
across the lease at Darlot but more work needs to be done given the
paucity of drilling below 200m.

To build on the work undertaken in 2015 we have budgeted an
additional A$86 million for 2016. We are targeting to replace
depletion in 2016 and aim to add additional targets to the pipeline that
will give us improved flexibility and optionality over the long term.
Over the past decade, our exploration efforts have largely resulted in
us being able to replace what has been mined and we believe there
are reasonable prospects that this can be replicated in the future.

Balance sheet improves in 2015

During Q4 2015, there was a further reduction in the net debt balance
to US$1,380 million (31 December 2015: US$1,453 million) taking the
total reduction for 2015 to US$73 million. There was a regression in
the net debt to EBITDA ratio to 1.38x at year-end, from 1.30x at 31
December 2014.

2016 guidance and outlook

For 2016, we expect attributable equivalent gold production of
between 2.05 million ounces and 2.10 million ounces, with decreases
in the international operations partly offset by the growth in production
at South Deep. Notable changes in 2016 include a reduction in
production from the Australian region to around 905,000 ounces; the
negative impact of the lower copper price on Cerro Corona's
equivalent gold production (reduction to around 260,000 ounces);
lower production from Damang given the review currently underway;
and a 30% increase at South Deep to around 257,000 ounces.

The main contributors to lower production in Australia in 2016 are as
follows:

-   Mining of lower grade areas of the mine on Zones 90 and 100 at
    Granny Smith.
-   Closure of Athena underground mine and outperformance on
    grade from Neptune ore in early 2015 at St Ives.
-   Deeper mining at Agnew and timing to access the new high grade
    Cinderella ore body.
-   Limited mining planned at Darlot pending further exploration
    success during the current year.

The 30% increase in production from South Deep is expected to be
driven mainly by an increase in available working places; an increase
in productivity; fleet expansion; and grade improvements.

However, we expect unit costs to be largely unchanged from 2015,
with AISC expected to be between US$1,000/oz and US$1,010/oz
and AIC expected to be between US$1,035/oz and US$1,045/oz.
Group capital expenditure for the year is forecast at US$602 million.
These expectations assume the following exchange rates:
R/US$:14.14 and A$/US$:0.73.

Move to semi-annual financial reporting

Following a review of our reporting requirements, we have taken the
decision to change from quarterly to semi-annual financial reporting.
We will continue to provide production and cost updates to the market
on a quarterly basis.

Results for the Group

SAFETY

The Group's fatality injury frequency rate regressed from 0.00 in
the September quarter to 0.08 in the December quarter. We regret
to report that a fatality occurred at one of Tarkwa's waste rock
dumping areas. Our deepest sympathy and condolences were
extended to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased.
The total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)1 for the Group
regressed from 3.13 in the September quarter to 3.53 in the
December quarter.

The total recordable injury frequency rate for the year was 3.40
(2014: 4.04). This reflects a 16 per cent improvement in TRIFR for
2015.

1   Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIFR). (TRIFR) = (Fatalities +
    Lost Time Injuries2 + Restricted Work Injuries3 + Medically Treated
    Injuries4) x 1,000,000/number of man-hours worked.

2   A Lost Time Injury (LTI) is a work-related injury resulting in the employee
    or contractor being unable to attend work for a period of one or more days
    after the day of the injury. The employee or contractor is unable to perform
    any functions.

3   A Restricted Work Injury (RWI) is a work-related injury sustained by an
    employee or contractor which results in the employee or contractor being
    unable to perform one or more of their routine functions for a full working
    day, from the day after the injury occurred. The employee or contractor can
    still perform some of his duties.

4   A Medically Treated Injury (MTI) is a work-related injury sustained by an
    employee or contractor which does not incapacitate that employee and
    who, after having received medical treatment, is deemed fit to immediately
    resume his/her normal duties on the next calendar day, immediately
    following the treatment/re-treatment.

Quarter ended 31 December 2015 compared with
quarter ended 30 September 2015

REVENUE

Attributable equivalent gold production increased by 2 per cent
from 556,700 ounces in the September quarter to 566,000 ounces
in the December quarter. South Deep, St Ives and Agnew
produced more gold in the December quarter.

Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, increased by 24
per cent from 1,709 kilograms (54,900 ounces) to 2,119 kilograms
(68,100 ounces).

Attributable gold production at the West African operations
decreased by 3 per cent from 174,400 ounces in the September
quarter to 168,800 ounces in the December quarter due to lower
production at both Tarkwa and Damang. Attributable equivalent
gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru decreased by 16 per cent
from 78,800 ounces in the September quarter to 65,900 ounces in
the December quarter. Gold production at the Australian
operations increased by 6 per cent from 248,600 ounces in the
September quarter to 263,000 ounces in the December quarter
due to higher production at St Ives and Agnew, partially offset by
lower production at Granny Smith.

At the South Africa region, production at South Deep increased by
24 per cent from 1,709 kilograms (54,900 ounces) in the
September quarter to 2,119 kilograms (68,100 ounces) in the
December quarter due to increased volumes and grades.

At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa
decreased by 3 per cent from 149,400 ounces in the September
quarter to 144,800 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to
lower tonnes mined and lower plant throughput caused by the fatal
accident, seasonal weather and a pre-mature three day reline of
the SAG mill. At Damang, managed gold production decreased by
3 per cent from 44,400 ounces in the September quarter to 42,900
ounces in the December quarter mainly due to lower tonnes mined
and processed caused by operational constraints with a narrower
mining footprint in the pits.

At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent
production at Cerro Corona decreased by 16 per cent from 79,200
ounces in the September quarter to 66,200 ounces in the
December quarter mainly due to lower gold and copper head
grades, a function of planned changes in mining sequence as the
pit floor is lowered across the footprint.

At the Australia region, St Ives' gold production increased by 20
per cent from 83,600 ounces in the September quarter to 100,400
ounces in the December quarter mainly due to increased tonnes
processed and higher grades. At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production
increased by 14 per cent from 57,500 ounces in the September
quarter to 65,700 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to
higher grades mined and processed. At Darlot, gold production
decreased by 3 per cent from 25,400 ounces in the September
quarter to 24,600 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to a
drawdown of gold-in-circuit in the September quarter. At Granny
Smith, gold production decreased by 12 per cent from 82,100
ounces in the September quarter to 72,400 ounces in the
December quarter due to lower grades mined and processed.

The average quarterly US dollar gold price achieved by the Group
decreased by 1 per cent from US$1,103 per equivalent ounce in
the September quarter to US$1,092 per equivalent ounce in the
December quarter. The average rand gold price increased by 7
per cent from R471,094 per kilogram to R503,887 per kilogram.
The average Australian dollar gold price decreased by 1 per cent
from A$1,553 per ounce to A$1,531 per ounce. The average US
dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations decreased by 2 per
cent from US$1,126 per ounce in the September quarter to
US$1,108 per ounce in the December quarter. The average US
dollar gold price, net of treatment and refining charges, for Cerro
Corona increased by 6 per cent from US$908 per equivalent ounce
in the September quarter to US$960 per equivalent ounce in the
December quarter. The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate
weakened by 9 per cent from R12.86 in the September quarter to
R14.08 in the December quarter. The average Australian/US
dollar exchange rate weakened by 1 per cent from A$1.00 =
US$0.73 to A$1.00 = US$0.72.

Revenue increased by 1 per cent from US$635 million in the
September quarter to US$640 million in the December quarter due
to increased gold sold, partially offset by the lower gold price
achieved. Equivalent gold sold increased by 2 per cent from
576,000 ounces in the September quarter to 586,300 ounces in the
December quarter. This was mainly due to increased gold sold at
South Deep, St Ives and Agnew, partially offset by lower gold sold
at Cerro Corona, Tarkwa, Damang, Darlot and Granny Smith.

OPERATING COSTS

Net operating costs decreased by 7 per cent from US$366 million
in the September quarter to US$342 million in the December
quarter mainly due to lower expenditure at all the operations
except at South Deep and a US$6 million gold-in-process credit to
cost in the December quarter compared with US$3 million in the
September quarter.

At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep
increased by 7 per cent from R803 million (US$63 million) in the
September quarter to R857 million (US$61 million) in the
December quarter mainly due to higher production.

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 12 per
cent from US$134 million in the September quarter to US$118
million in the December quarter. This decrease in net operating
costs was mainly due to lower production as well as a build-up of
inventory of US$6 million in the December quarter compared with
US$1 million in the September quarter.

At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona
increased by 11 per cent from US$35 million in the September
quarter to US$39 million in the December quarter mainly due to a
drawdown of concentrate of US$2 million in the December quarter
compared with a US$1 million build-up at the end of the September
quarter.

At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 5 per
cent from A$186 million (US$135 million) in the September quarter
to A$176 million (US$125 million) in the December quarter mainly
due to lower direct mining costs at all the operations.

OPERATING PROFIT

Operating profit for the Group increased by 11 per cent from
US$269 million in the September quarter to US$298 million in the
December quarter due to the increase in revenue and the
decrease in net operating costs.

AMORTISATION

Amortisation for the Group increased by 11 per cent from US$155
million in the September quarter to US$172 million in the
December quarter mainly due to increased production.

OTHER

Net interest expense for the Group decreased by 13 per cent from
US$16 million in the September quarter to US$14 million in the
December quarter. Interest expense of US$20 million, partially
offset by interest income of US$2 million and interest capitalised of
US$4 million in the December quarter compared with interest
expense of US$22 million, partially offset by interest income of
US$2 million and interest capitalised of US$4 million in the
September quarter.

The share of equity accounted losses was similar at US$1 million
and mainly related to the ongoing study and evaluation costs at the
Far Southeast project (FSE).

The gain on foreign exchange of US$2 million in the December
quarter compared with US$7 million in the September quarter.
These gains and losses on foreign exchange related to the
conversion of offshore cash holdings into their functional
currencies.

The loss on financial instruments of US$nil million in the December
quarter compared with US$4 million in the September quarter and
related to the mark to market adjustment on the diesel hedges that
the Australian operations entered into on 10 September 2014 and
26 November 2014. The diesel hedges came to an end on 31
December 2015.

Share-based payments for the Group decreased from US$3 million
to US$2 million and long-term employee benefits increased from
US$nil million to US$2 million. The two schemes combined were
similar at US$4 million.

Other costs for the Group increased from US$7 million to US$20
million, mainly due to increased social development costs at Cerro
Corona and additional expenditure on global compliance.

EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS

Exploration and project costs decreased from US$11 million in the
September quarter to US$10 million in the December quarter
mainly due to lower expenditure at Salares Norte.

NON-RECURRING ITEMS

Non-recurring expenses increased from US$8 million in the
September quarter to US$199 million in the December quarter.

The non-recurring expenses in the December quarter included:
-   Impairment of the Group's investment in Far South East (FSE)
    in the Philippines (US$101 million) to its recoverable amount;
-   Impairment of the Group's investment in Hummingbird (US$4
    million) to its fair value;
-   Loss on disposal of assets at Cerro Corona (US$5 million);
-   Scrapping of assets no longer in use at Cerro Corona (US$7
    million);
-   Write-off of stockpiles at Damang (US$8 million) due to net
    realisable value adjustments; and
-   Impairment of Arctic Platinum project (APP) (US$39 million) to
    its fair value less cost of disposal;
-   Impairment at Darlot: gross A$19 million (US$14 million), tax
    A$6 million (US$4 million), net A$13 million (US$10 million);
    and
-   Impairment at Damang: (US$36 million) due to current studies
    which may result in certain pits not being mined and thus
    necessitating them written down to nil carrying value.

This was partially offset by:
-   A decrease in rehabilitation provision (US$15 million) due to
    increased discount rates at South Deep (R78 million/US$6
    million) and at the Australian operations (A$12 million/US$9
    million).

The non-recurring expenses in the September quarter included
US$3 million on the impairment of the Group's investment in
Hummingbird and US$4 million related to retrenchment costs at
Tarkwa.

ROYALTIES

Government royalties for the Group decreased from US$19 million
in the September quarter to US$18 million in the December
quarter.

TAXATION

The taxation charge for the Group of US$126 million in the
December quarter compared with US$34 million in the September
quarter. Normal taxation increased from US$36 million to US$43
million. The deferred tax charge of US$83 million in the December
quarter compared with a credit of US$2 million in the September
quarter. The deferred tax charge in the December quarter arose
mainly due to impairments of the deferred tax assets of US$68
million at Cerro Corona and US$37 million at Damang along with
an US$8 million charge related to the weakening of the Peruvian
Nuevo Sol.

In Peru, tax depreciation is recognised using the straight line
depreciation method for the majority of assets over periods longer
than the life of mine. As Cerro Corona has a current life of mine to
2023, a significant portion of assets will not be fully depreciated for
tax purposes at the end of the life of the mine. In prior years, the
Group believed that the life could be extended through an
expansion of the tailings storage facility. However, during 2015,
the Group completed the expansion feasibility study and concluded
that in the current gold and copper price environment it would not
be viable. Based on the Group's best estimate at 31 December
2015, it is unlikely that Cerro Corona will earn taxable profits post
the current life of mine in order to utilise these deductible
temporary differences as they reverse. Due to the above, the
Group impaired an amount of US$68 million related to deferred tax
assets not recoverable at Cerro Corona at 31 December 2015.

The impairment of the deferred tax asset at Damang of US$37
million arose due to uncertainty regarding the extent of future
taxable profits against which it can be utilised.

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol
(Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the
US dollar. For accounting purposes the unredeemed capital
allowance balance must be converted from Soles to dollars at the
closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, the US dollar equivalent of
unredeemed capital allowance balance fluctuates due to
movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol
and the US dollar. This resulted in a change in the temporary
taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation. A
deferred tax charge of US$8 million arose due to the weakening of
the exchange rate from 3.22 Nuevo Sol to 3.38 Nuevo Sol in the
December quarter, compared with a deferred tax charge of US$2
million which arose due to the weakening of the exchange rate
from 3.17 Nuevo Sol to 3.22 Nuevo Sol in the September quarter.
It has no cash effect.

EARNINGS

Net losses attributable to owners of the parent of US$258 million or
US$0.33 per share in the December quarter compared with net
earnings of US$18 million or US$0.02 per share in the September
quarter.

Headline loss of US$54 million or US$0.08 per share in the
December quarter compared with earnings of US$21 million or
US$0.03 per share in the September quarter.

Normalised earnings of US$15 million or US$0.02 per share in the
December quarter compared with US$22 million or US$0.03 per
share in the September quarter.

CASH FLOW

Cash inflow from operating activities of US$209 million in the
December quarter compared with US$221 million in the September
quarter. This decrease was mainly due to an investment into
working capital of US$34 million in the December quarter
compared with a release of working capital of US$34 million in the
September quarter, partially offset by lower royalties and taxation
paid in the December quarter.

Cash outflow from investing activities increased from US$146
million in the September quarter to US$165 million in the
December quarter due to an increase in capital expenditure from
US$143 million in the September quarter to US$158 million in the
December quarter.

Cash inflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure
and environmental payments of US$47 million in the December
quarter compared with US$75 million in the September quarter,
mainly due to higher capital expenditure and negative working
capital adjustments. The US$47 million inflow in the December
quarter comprised: US$82 million generated profit by the eight
mining operations, US$18 million of net interest paid, US$2 million
for exploration mainly at Salares Norte (this excludes any mine
based brownfields exploration which is included in the US$82
million above) and US$15 million on non-mine based costs. The
US$75 million inflow in the September quarter comprised: US$93
million generated profit by the eight mining operations, US$19
million of net interest paid, US$4 million for exploration mainly at
Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields
exploration which is included in the US$93 million above) and
US$5 million on non-mine based income.

In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure
increased from R187 million (US$14 million) in the September
quarter to R243 million (US$17 million) in the December quarter
due to higher expenditure on fleet.

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure decreased from
US$43 million to US$38 million. At Tarkwa, capital expenditure
decreased from US$37 million to US$35 million with expenditure
mainly incurred on pre-stripping. Capital expenditure at Damang
decreased from US$6 million to US$3 million.

In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure
increased from US$19 million to US$28 million. The majority of the
expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings
dam as well as construction of the new camp.

At the Australia region, capital expenditure increased from A$89
million (US$66 million) in the September quarter to A$107 million
(US$77 million) in the December quarter. At St Ives, capital
expenditure increased from A$31 million (US$22 million) in the
September quarter to A$45 million (US$32 million) in the
December quarter due to increased pre-strip at Neptune, Invincible
and A5. At Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure increased from
A$25 million (US$19 million) to A$28 million (US$20 million) mainly
due to increased development at FBH, a reasonably high grade
deposit that will ultimately replace Kim South at the Waroonga
underground mine. At Darlot, capital expenditure was similar at
A$7 million (US$5 million) and at Granny Smith, capital
expenditure increased from A$26 million (US$19 million) in the
September quarter to A$27 million (US$20 million) in the
December quarter due to equipment rebuilds.

Net cash outflow from financing activities of US$91 million in the
December quarter compared with an inflow of US$20 million in the
September quarter and related to net loans raised and paid. The
outflow in the December quarter related to the repayment of
US$212 million on offshore and local loans, partially offset by a net
drawdown of US$121 million on offshore and local loans.

The net cash outflow for the Group of US$54 million in the
December quarter compared with an inflow of US$93 million in the
September quarter. After accounting for a positive translation
adjustment of US$8 million on non-US dollar cash balances, the
cash outflow for the December quarter was US$46 million. As a
result, the cash balance decreased from US$486 million at the end
of September to US$440 million at the end of December.

ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST

The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 2 per cent from
US$948 per ounce in the September quarter to US$929 per ounce
in the December quarter mainly due to higher gold sold and lower
net operating costs, partially offset by higher sustaining capital
expenditure and the inventory write off of US$8 million. Total all-in
cost decreased by 2 per cent from US$961 per ounce in the
September quarter to US$942 per ounce in the December quarter
for the same reasons as all-in sustaining costs.

In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs
decreased by 14 per cent from R578,051 per kilogram (US$1,404
per ounce) to R495,833 per kilogram (US$1,095 per ounce) mainly
due to higher gold sold, partially offset by higher operating costs
and higher sustaining capital expenditure. The total all-in cost
decreased by 11 per cent from R589,823 per kilogram (US$1,431
per ounce) to R522,642 per kilogram (US$1,156 per ounce) due to
the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs, partially offset by
higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost
decreased by 4 per cent from US$962 per ounce in the September
quarter to US$925 per ounce in the December quarter mainly due
to lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure, partially
offset by the US$8 million inventory write-off at Damang.

At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in
cost increased by 72 per cent from US$747 per ounce to
US$1,285 per ounce. This was mainly due to lower gold sold, the
decrease in the copper price, the gold-in-process charge to cost
compared with a credit in the previous quarter as well as increased
capital expenditure. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost per
equivalent ounce increased by 47 per cent from US$731 per
equivalent ounce to US$1,073 per equivalent ounce mainly due to
the same reasons as above, as well as lower equivalent ounces
sold.

At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost
decreased by 3 per cent from A$1,177 per ounce (US$859 per
ounce) in the September quarter to A$1,146 per ounce (US$819
per ounce) in the December quarter mainly due to higher gold sold
and lower net operating costs, partially offset by higher capital
expenditure.

FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN

The free cash flow (FCF) margin is revenue less cash outflow
divided by revenue expressed as a percentage.

The FCF for the Group for the December quarter is calculated as
follows:

*  Revenue from income statement at US$640.1 million less revenue from
   by-products in AIC at US$26.0 million equals US$614.1 million.
** Free cash flow does not agree with cash flows from operating activities
   less capital expenditure in the statement of cash flows on page 23 mainly
   due to working capital adjustments and non-recurring items included in
   statement of cash flows.

The FCF margin of 14 per cent in the December quarter at a gold
price of US$1,092 per ounce compared with 11 per cent in the
September quarter at a gold price of US$1,103 per ounce.

The higher FCF margin in the December quarter was mainly due to
higher gold sold and lower net operating costs, partially offset by
higher capital expenditure.

BALANCE SHEET

Net debt (long-term loans plus the current portion of long-term
loans less cash and deposits) decreased from US$1,427 million at
the end of September to US$1,380 million at the end of December,
a US$47 million decrease.

NET DEBT/EBITDA

The net debt/EBITDA ratio at the end of the December quarter was
1.38x calculated on the actual results for the 2015 financial year.

Gold production increased by 24 per cent from 1,709 kilograms
(54,900 ounces) in the September quarter to 2,119 kilograms
(68,100 ounces) in the December quarter due to increased
volumes and grades.

Total tonnes milled increased by 42 per cent from 387,000 tonnes
in the September quarter to 549,000 tonnes in the December
quarter. Total tonnes milled in the December quarter included
23,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 122,300 tonnes of
surface tailings material compared with 19,400 tonnes of
underground waste mined and 33,700 tonnes of surface tailings
material in the September quarter. The re-mining project, treating
surface material, has started to gain momentum during the quarter
and has continued to sustain the backfill requirements in both
current workings and historical open stopes. Underground reef
yield increased by 3 per cent from 5.08 grams per tonne to 5.21
grams per tonne due to improved grades and a release of gold-in-
process during the quarter.

Development decreased by 3 per cent from 1,486 metres in the
September quarter to 1,443 metres in the December quarter. New
mine capital development (phase one, sub 95 level) decreased by
10 per cent from 347 metres in the September quarter to 314
metres in the December quarter. Development in the current mine
areas in 95 level and above decreased marginally from 1,139
metres to 1,129 metres. Destress mining decreased by 23 per
cent from 9,523 square metres in the September quarter to 7,357
square metres in the December quarter. The decrease in destress
mining is due to the strategic change in the mining method as
detailed in the September quarter. The mine started with the
process to convert low profile destress mining cuts to high profile
destress mining cuts towards the end of the September quarter.
High profile destress mining improved significantly from a low base
of 562 square metres in the September quarter to 2,990 square
metres in the December quarter, mainly due to the introduction of 3
new drill rigs and improved productivity. The high profile and low
profile methods contributed 43 per cent and 57 per cent,
respectively, to total destress.

The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 79 per cent of
the ore tonnes in the December quarter, while the new mine (below
95 level) contributed 21 per cent. The long-hole stoping method
accounted for 39 per cent of total ore tonnes mined compared with
40 per cent in the September quarter.

Operating costs increased by 7 per cent from R803 million (US$63
million) in the September quarter to R857 million (US$61 million) in
the December quarter. This increase was mainly due to the higher
production, as well as higher bonuses paid in line with the
increased production.

Operating profit of R211 million (US$17 million) in the December
quarter compared with R2 million (US$1 million) in the September
quarter mainly due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher
operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased from R187 million (US$14 million) in
the September quarter to R243 million (US$17 million) in the
December quarter as a result of higher spending on fleet.

All-in sustaining costs decreased from R578,051 per kilogram
(US$1,404 per ounce) in the September quarter to R495,833 per
kilogram (US$1,095 per ounce) in the December quarter, a
decrease of 14 per cent mainly due to increased gold sold, partially
offset by higher operating costs and higher sustaining capital
expenditure.

Total all-in cost decreased from R589,823 per kilogram (US$1,431
per ounce) in the September quarter to R522,642 per kilogram
(US$1,156 per ounce) in the December quarter, a decrease of 11
per cent due to the same reasons as for all-in-sustainable costs,
partially offset by higher non-sustaining capital expenditure.

Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R166 million (US$13
million) in the September quarter to R184 million (US$13 million) in
the December quarter due to additional fleet and the refurbishment
of the twin shaft man winder. Non-sustaining capital expenditure
increased from R20 million (US$2 million) in the September quarter
to R59 million (US$4 million) in the December quarter.

The focus during the March 2016 quarter will remain on advancing
the high profile destress mining cuts into virgin rock in order to
open up the orebody. Ripping to advance the converted destress
cuts was completed during the December quarter. The ratio of
high profile destress square metres to total destress square metres
is planned to increase from 43 per cent in the December quarter to
48 per cent in the March quarter and to 82 per cent by 2016 year
end.

The independent Geotechnical Review Board (GRB), a committee
of local and international experts, will continue to peer review
progress at South Deep to ensure exposure to relevant industry
leading practices, operational de-risking and world class
geotechnical support in massive underground mining at depth.

Guidance

The estimate for calendar 2016 is as follows:
-   Gold produced ~ 8,000 kilograms (257,000 ounces)
-   Destress square metres ~ 36,000 square meters
-   Capital expenditure ~ R999 million (US$71 million)
-   All-in sustaining costs ~ R550,000 per kilogram (US$1,200 per
    ounce)
-   Total all-in cost ~ R575,000 per kilogram (US$1,250 per
    ounce)

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 149,400 ounces in
the September quarter to 144,800 ounces in the December quarter
due to lower plant throughput.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from
26.1 million tonnes in the September quarter to 23.0 million tonnes
in the December quarter. Ore tonnes mined decreased from 3.8
million tonnes to 3.6 million tonnes. Operational waste tonnes
mined decreased from 9.7 million tonnes to 8.2 million tonnes while
capital waste tonnes mined decreased from 12.6 million tonnes to
11.2 million tonnes. The lower tonnes in all categories were due to
lower fleet utilisation in the December quarter compared with the
September quarter. The lower utilisation was partially due to some
of the equipment being parked during the investigation of the fatal
accident, but also a result of seasonal weather conditions. The
Harmattan (a very dusty wind) was particularly intense in
December as a result of the drought in West-Africa. This caused
very poor visibility which has a negative impact on effective
utilisation of mining equipment. Head grade mined increased from
1.37 grams per tonne to 1.45 grams per tonne. The strip ratio
decreased from 5.8 to 5.5.

The CIL plant throughput decreased from 3.40 million tonnes in the
September quarter to 3.30 million tonnes in the December quarter.
A three day reline on the SAG mill which was originally planned for
January 2016, had to be brought forward to December 2015 to
ensure continuous operation and structural integrity of the SAG
mill. Realised yield from the CIL plant was similar at 1.36 grams
per tonne.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased from US$86 million in the September quarter to US$73
million in the December quarter due to a net increase in gold-in-
process and lower operating costs. The US$7 million build-up of
stockpiles in the December quarter compared with US$1 million in
the September quarter.

Operating profit increased from US$82 million in the September
quarter to US$88 million in the December quarter as a result of the
lower net operating costs.

Capital expenditure decreased from US$37 million to US$35
million mainly due to lower capital waste mined.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 8 per cent
from US$872 per ounce in the September quarter to US$799 per
ounce in the December quarter due to lower net operating costs
and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Guidance

The estimate for calendar 2016 is as follows:
-   Gold produced ~ 560,000 ounces
-   Capital expenditure ~ US$128 million
-   All-in sustaining costs ~ US$940 per ounce
-   Total all-in cost ~ US$940 per ounce

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 44,400 ounces in
the September quarter to 42,900 ounces in the December quarter
mainly due to decreased volumes and lower tonnes processed.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 6.0
million tonnes in the September quarter to 4.9 million tonnes in the
December quarter due to lower equipment availability on the larger
excavators and operational constraints with a narrower mining
footprint in the Huni, Juno and Rex pits, typical of pits as they
progress deeper.

Ore tonnes mined decreased from 1.4 million tonnes to 1.0 million
tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased from 4.6
million tonnes in the September quarter to 3.9 million tonnes in the
December quarter. Head grade mined increased from 1.17 grams
per tonne to 1.43 grams per tonne. The strip ratio increased from
3.4 to 3.8.

Yield increased from 1.23 grams per tonne to 1.26 grams per
tonne due to improved plant recovery, partially offset by a lower
mine call factor.

Tonnes processed decreased from 1.12 million tonnes in the
September quarter to 1.06 million tonnes in the December quarter
due to a reduction in the percentage of oxides in the feed blend
and more frequent power outages during the December quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased from US$48 million to US$45 million mainly due to
lower production, partially offset by a US$1 million drawdown of
inventory in the December quarter compared with US$nil million in
the September quarter.

Operating profit increased from US$2 million in the September
quarter to US$3 million in the December quarter due to lower net
operating costs.

Capital expenditure decreased from US$6 million to US$3 million
with the majority spent on the processing plant upgrade.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 7 per cent
from US$1,272 per ounce in the September quarter to US$1,361
per ounce in the December quarter due to lower gold sold and the
US$8 million write-off of non-economical low grade stockpiles,
partially offset by lower net operating costs and capital
expenditure.

Guidance

The estimate for calendar 2016 is as follows:
-   Gold produced ~ 150,000 ounces
-   Capital expenditure ~ US$30 million
-   All-in sustaining costs ~ US$1,160 per ounce
-   Total all-in cost ~ US$1,160 per ounce

Gold production decreased by 16 per cent from 44,000 ounces in
the September quarter to 36,800 ounces in the December quarter.
Copper production decreased by 11 per cent from 7,492 tonnes to
6,645 tonnes. Equivalent gold production decreased by 16 per
cent from 79,200 ounces to 66,200 ounces. The decrease in gold
and copper production was due to lower gold and copper head
grades treated. This was in line with the mine sequencing and the
planned production schedule for the December quarter. Gold head
grade decreased from 1.11 grams per tonne to 0.97 grams per
tonne and copper head grade decreased from 0.51 per cent to
0.47 per cent. Gold recoveries decreased from 73.1 per cent to
71.4 per cent and copper recoveries decreased from 86.8 per cent
to 85.5 per cent. As a result, gold yield decreased from 0.81
grams per tonne to 0.69 grams per tonne and copper yield
decreased from 0.45 per cent to 0.40 per cent.

In the December quarter, concentrate with a payable content of
37,622 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,109
per ounce and 6,770 tonnes of copper was sold at an average
price of US$4,229 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.
This compared with concentrate with a payable content of 44,464
ounces of gold that was sold at an average price of US$1,123 per
ounce and 7,278 tonnes of copper that was sold at an average
price of US$4,521 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges
in the September quarter. Total equivalent gold sales decreased
by 14 per cent from 78,600 ounces in the September quarter to
67,500 ounces in the December quarter mainly due to lower
volumes.

Total tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 3.53 million
tonnes in the September quarter to 3.31 million tonnes in the
December quarter in line with the mine sequencing. The higher
tonnes mined in the September quarter was due to a push back on
the North-west wall, which necessitated the need to move waste to
open up ore areas. Ore mined decreased by 2 per cent from 1.76
million tonnes to 1.72 million tonnes. The strip ratio decreased
from 1.01 to 0.92 due to lower waste mined in the December
quarter.

Ore processed decreased by 1 per cent from 1.75 million tonnes in
the September quarter to 1.73 million tonnes in the December
quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
increased from US$35 million in the September quarter to US$39
million in the December quarter. The higher cost was mainly due
to a US$2 million drawdown of concentrate inventory at the end of
the December quarter compared with a US$1 million build-up at
the end of the September quarter.

Operating profit decreased from US$36 million in the September
quarter to US$26 million in the December quarter due to lower
equivalent gold sold and higher net operating costs.

Capital expenditure increased from US$19 million to US$28 million
mainly due to increased construction activities at the tailings dam
and the construction of the new camp.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 72 per cent
from US$747 per ounce in the September quarter to US$1,285 per
ounce in the December quarter. This was mainly due to lower gold
sold, the gold-in-process charge to costs and increased capital
expenditure. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per
equivalent ounce increased by 47 per cent from US$731 per
equivalent ounce to US$1,073 per equivalent ounce mainly due to
the same reasons as above and lower equivalent ounces sold.

Guidance

The estimate for calendar 2016 is as follows:
-   Gold equivalents produced ~ 260,000 ounces
-   Gold only produced ~ 150,000 ounces

* Heap leach produced 200 ounces, rinsed from inventory (1,800 ounces was rinsed in
  the September quarter).

Gold production increased by 20 per cent from 83,600 ounces in
the September quarter to 100,400 ounces in the December quarter
due to a significant increase in tonnes processed and higher
grades.

Total tonnes mined increased from 6.079 million tonnes in the
September quarter to 7.750 million tonnes in the December
quarter.

At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 14 per
cent from 275,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 237,000
tonnes in the December quarter as the Athena mine approaches
closure in the March 2016 quarter. The reduced tonnes were
partially offset by a 6 per cent increase in grade from 4.85 grams
per tonne to 5.16 grams per tonne.

At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 16
per cent from 569,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 660,000
tonnes in the December quarter. Grade mined increased by 13 per
cent from 2.71 grams per tonne to 3.07 grams per tonne as the pit
moved into a higher grade portion of the ore body.

Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 47 per cent from
3.913 million tonnes in the September quarter to 2.074 million
tonnes in the December quarter. Capital waste tonnes mined
increased by 262 per cent from 1.319 million tonnes to 4.779
million tonnes. The strip ratio increased from 9.2 to 10.4. Capital
waste mined included the commencement of stripping campaigns
at the Neptune and A5 pits which are expected to complement the
Invincible pit as St Ives moves to a predominately open pit
operation with the closure of the Athena underground mine.

Throughput at the Lefroy mill increased from 837,000 tonnes in the
September quarter to 974,000 tonnes in the December quarter with
more open pit ore available for processing. Yield increased from
3.11 grams per tonne to 3.21 grams per tonne in line with
increased open pit and underground grades mined. Gold
production from the Lefroy mill increased from 81,800 ounces in
the September quarter to 100,200 ounces in the December
quarter.

Residual leaching and irrigation of the existing heap leach pad
continued and a further 200 ounces were produced in the
December quarter. This compared with 1,800 ounces produced in
the September quarter. The decrease in production resulted from
a reduction in irrigation due to ponding issues (the top of the heap
leach pad becomes tight or solid and the solution cannot permeate
down through the pad) on the heap leach as well as a failure of the
elution circuit during the quarter. Since cessation of stacking
activities, a total of 24,400 ounces have been produced. This
process will continue until pregnant solutions become uneconomic.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, was
similar at A$65 million (US$46 million).

Operating profit increased from A$66 million (US$48 million) in the
September quarter to A$89 million (US$65 million) in the
December quarter due to increased production.

Capital expenditure increased from A$31 million (US$22 million) in
the September quarter to A$45 million (US$32 million) in the
December quarter with an additional A$13 million (US$9 million)
incurred on pre-stripping.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 5 per cent
from A$1,229 per ounce (US$879 per ounce) in the September
quarter to A$1,171 per ounce (US$836 per ounce) in the
December quarter due to increased gold sold, partially offset by
increased capital expenditure.

Gold production increased by 14 per cent from 57,500 ounces in
the September quarter to 65,700 ounces in the December quarter
mainly due to higher grades mined and processed.

Ore mined from underground increased by 19 per cent from
264,000 tonnes in the September quarter to 313,000 tonnes in the
December quarter as the Waroonga mine recovered from a
seismic event and adverse ground conditions encountered at the
beginning of the September quarter. Head grade mined increased
by 14 per cent from 6.36 grams per tonne to 7.25 grams per tonne
mainly due to higher grade areas being mined in the New Holland
mine.

Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 294,000 tonnes in
the September quarter to 298,000 tonnes in the December quarter
with the mill continuing to operate near capacity. The combined
yield increased from 6.07 grams per tonne to 6.88 grams per tonne
mainly due to higher grades.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased from A$51 million (US$38 million) in the September
quarter to A$44 million (US$31 million) in the December quarter
due to a A$3 million (US$3 million) build-up of inventory in the
December quarter compared with a A$3 million (US$2 million)
drawdown in the September quarter.

Operating profit increased from A$38 million (US$27 million) in the
September quarter to A$57 million (US$41 million) in the
December quarter due to higher gold sold and lower net operating
costs.

Capital expenditure increased from A$25 million (US$19 million) in
the September quarter to A$28 million (US$20 million) in the
December quarter. The increase in capital expenditure was due to
the ramp-up in development activities associated with Fitzroy
Bengal Hastings (FBH) at Waroonga and the commencement of
decline development to the Cinderella ore body. The Cinderella
deposit straddles the tenement boundary between New Holland
and Waroonga and will be accessed from the existing New Holland
mine. The discovery and mining of this deposit on the tenement
boundary became possible with the integration of the Lawlers and
Agnew mines.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 17 per
cent from A$1,401 per ounce (US$1,025 per ounce) in the
September quarter to A$1,160 per ounce (US$828 per ounce) in
the December quarter due to increased gold sold and lower net
operating costs, partially offset by higher capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent from 25,400 ounces in
the September quarter to 24,600 ounces in the December quarter
due to a drawdown of gold in circuit in the September quarter.

Ore mined from underground decreased by 1 per cent from
110,800 tonnes to 109,300 tonnes. Head grade mined increased
from 7.03 grams per tonne in the September quarter to 7.09 grams
per tonne in the December quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased by 6 per cent from 125,300 tonnes in
the September quarter to 118,000 tonnes in the December quarter
due to a parcel of toll treatment in the September quarter not
repeated in the December quarter. The yield increased from 6.30
grams per tonne to 6.52 grams per tonne. This was due to higher
grade ore mined and cessation of the lower grade material treated
as part of the toll treatment arrangements in the September
quarter. The tolling arrangements contributed 529 ounces to gold
production for the September quarter.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased from A$23 million (US$17 million) in the September
quarter to A$20 million (US$14 million) in the December quarter.
The decrease reflects a small build-up of gold-in-process in the
December quarter compared with a US$1 million drawdown in the
September quarter.

Operating profit increased from A$17 million (US$13 million) to
A$18 million (US$13 million) mainly due to lower net operating
costs, partially offset by the decrease in ounces produced.

Capital expenditure was similar at A$7 million (US$5 million) and
included A$3 million of capital development at Lords South Lower
and A$3 million of exploration.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 7 per cent
from A$1,232 per ounce (US$906 per ounce) in the September
quarter to A$1,142 per ounce (US$817 per ounce) in the

Gold production decreased by 12 per cent from 82,100 ounces in
the September quarter to 72,400 ounces in the December quarter
due to lower grades mined in line with the mining sequence and as
planned.

Ore mined from underground was similar at 353,000 tonnes. Head
grade mined decreased from 7.68 grams per tonne in the
September quarter to 6.51 grams per tonne in the December
quarter. In the September quarter mining activity took place, as
sequenced, in higher grade areas of the ore body. Due to mine
scheduling lower grade areas were mined in the December
quarter.

Tonnes processed decreased marginally from 361,000 tonnes in
the September quarter to 359,000 tonnes in the December quarter.
The yield decreased from 7.08 grams per tonne to 6.26 grams per
tonne due to lower head grades.

Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements were
similar at A$47 million (US$34 million).

Operating profit decreased from A$80 million (US$59 million) in the
September quarter to A$63 million (US$45 million) in the
December quarter due to lower gold sold.

Capital expenditure increased from A$26 million (US$19 million) in
the September quarter to A$27 million (US$20 million) in the
December quarter. The majority of the expenditure related to
capital development, exploration, the establishment of the new
fresh air rise and gas power station integration. The mine is
planned to move from diesel power to gas fired power in the June
2016 quarter with the completion of construction and the
commissioning of the new power station. The new power station is
expected to provide savings in power costs. It will also replace an
old diesel powered plant, substantially lowering the risk of power
interruption and reducing carbon emissions.

All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 15 per cent
from A$957 per ounce (US$699 per ounce) in the September
quarter to A$1,101 per ounce (US$787 per ounce) in the
December quarter mainly due to lower gold sold and higher capital
expenditure.

Guidance

The estimate for calendar 2016 is as follows:
-  Gold produced ~ 270,000 ounces
-  Capital expenditure ~ A$118 million (US$87 million)
-  All-in sustaining costs ~ A$1,170 per ounce (US$855 per
   ounce)
-  Total all-in cost ~ A$1,170 per ounce (US$855 per ounce)

Year ended 31 December 2015 compared with
year ended 31 December 2014

Group attributable equivalent gold production decreased by 3 per
cent from 2.22 million ounces in 2014 to 2.16 million ounces in
2015 mainly due to lower production at all the mines except for
Tarkwa and St Ives.

At the South Africa region, gold production at South Deep,
decreased by 1 per cent from 6,237 kilograms (200,500 ounces) in
2014 to 6,160 kilograms (198,000 ounces) in 2015 mainly due to
lower grades, partially offset by increased volumes.

At the West Africa region, total managed gold production increased
by 2 per cent from 736,000 ounces in 2014 to 753,900 ounces in
2015. At Tarkwa, gold production increased by 5 per cent from
558,300 ounces to 586,100 ounces mainly due to higher grade. At
Damang, gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 177,800
ounces to 167,800 ounces mainly due to lower grades, partially
offset by increased volumes.

At the South America region, gold equivalent production at Cerro
Corona decreased by 9 per cent from 326,600 ounces in 2014 to
295,600 ounces in 2015 mainly due to a decrease in gold and
copper grades as well as a lower gold equivalent price ratio.

At the Australia region, gold production decreased by 4 per cent
from 1,031,000 ounces in 2014 to 988,000 ounces in 2015. At St
Ives, gold production increased by 3 per cent from 361,700 ounces
to 371,900 ounces mainly due to higher grades mined and
processed. At Agnew/Lawlers, gold production decreased by 13
per cent from 270,700 ounces to 236,600 ounces mainly due to
lower tonnes mined and processed as well as lower grade. At
Darlot, gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 83,600
ounces to 78,400 ounces due to lower tonnes mined and
processed, partially offset by higher grade. At Granny Smith, gold
production decreased by 4 per cent from 315,200 ounces to
301,100 ounces mainly due to lower grades and volumes
processed.

INCOME STATEMENT

Revenue decreased by 11 per cent from US$2,869 million in 2014
to US$2,545 million in 2015 mainly due to lower production and the
lower gold price received. The average gold price decreased by 9
per cent from US$1,249 per ounce to US$1,140 per ounce. The
average Rand/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 17 per cent
from R10.82 in 2014 to R12.68 in 2015. The average
Australian/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 17 per cent from
A$1.00 = US$0.903 to A$1.00 = US$0.752.

Net operating costs decreased by 13 per cent from US$1,678
million to US$1,456 million due to the 17 per cent weaker Rand/US
dollar exchange rate, the 17 per cent weaker Australian/US dollar
exchange rate, the lower oil price and good cost control.

At South Deep in South Africa, net operating costs increased by 13
per cent from R2,657 million (US$246 million) in 2014 to R3,000
million (US$237 million) in 2015. This was mainly due to annual
wage increases and normal inflationary increases. All-in sustaining
costs of R607,429 per kilogram (US$1,490 per ounce) and total all-
in cost of R635,622 per kilogram (US$1,559 per ounce) in 2015
compared with all-in sustaining costs of R538,254 per kilogram
(US$1,548 per ounce) and total all-in cost of R602,363 per
kilogram (US$1,732 per ounce) in 2014 with the increase due to
lower gold sold and higher operating costs, partially offset by lower
capital expenditure.

At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 7 per
cent from US$551 million in 2014 to US$513 million in 2015. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in cost for the region of US$1,049 per
ounce in 2015 compared with US$1,094 per ounce in 2014.

At Tarkwa, net operating costs decreased by 12 per cent from
US$372 million in 2014 to US$327 million in 2015 due to on-going
business improvement initiatives and the lower oil price. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in costs of US$970 per ounce in 2015
compared with US$1,068 per ounce in 2014 due to increased gold
sold and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher capital
expenditure.

At Damang, net operating costs increased by 3 per cent from
US$180 million to US$186 million mainly due to increased tonnes
mined. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost of US$1,326 per
ounce in 2015 compared with US$1,175 per ounce in 2014 due to
higher net operating costs, lower gold sold and the US$8 million
inventory write-off.

At Cerro Corona in South America, net operating costs decreased
by 9 per cent from US$160 million in 2014 to US$145 million in
2015 mainly due to lower ore tonnes mined. All-in sustaining costs
and total all-in cost amounted to US$718 per ounce in 2015
compared with US$316 per ounce in 2014 due to lower gold sold,
lower by-product credits and higher capital expenditure, partially
offset by lower net operating costs. All-in sustaining costs and total
all-in cost, on a gold equivalent basis amounted to US$777 per
ounce in 2015 compared with US$702 per ounce in 2014 mainly
due to the same reasons as above as well as lower equivalent
ounces sold.

At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 7 per
cent from A$799 million (US$721 million) in 2014 to A$747 million
(US$562 million) in 2015 mainly due to the lower production. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in cost for the region of A$1,211 per
ounce (US$912 per ounce) in 2015 compared with A$1,124 per
ounce (US$1,015 per ounce) in 2014 due to lower gold sold and
higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating
costs.

At St Ives, net operating costs decreased by 6 per cent from A$313
million (US$282 million) in 2014 to A$293 million (US$220 million)
in 2015. This was mainly due to restructuring after the Cave Rocks
mine moved into care and maintenance at the beginning of May
2015, reduced tonnage from Athena underground, lower costs at
the Lefroy mill since the introduction of campaign milling in March
2015 as well as lower surface cartage costs resulting from shorter
tramming distances after the Cave Rocks closure. This was
partially offset by a drawdown of mainly Neptune stockpiles of
A$34 million (US$25 million) in 2015 compared with a build-up of
A$11 million (US$10 million) in 2014. All-in sustaining costs and
total all-in cost for St Ives of A$1,287 per ounce (US$969 per
ounce) in 2015 compared with A$1,289 per ounce (US$1,164 per
ounce) in 2014 due to higher gold sold and lower net operating
costs, partially offset by higher capital expenditure.

At Agnew/Lawlers, net operating costs decreased by 2 per cent
from A$191 million (US$173 million) in 2014 to A$188 million
(US$141 million) in 2015 mainly due to cost saving initiatives as
well as a A$2 million (US$1 million) build-up of inventory in 2015
compared with A$nil million (US$nil million) in 2014. All-in
sustaining costs and total all-in cost for Agnew/Lawlers of A$1,276
per ounce (US$959 per ounce) in 2015 compared with A$1,096
per ounce (US$990 per ounce) in 2014 due to lower gold sold and
higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating
costs.

At Darlot, net operating costs decreased by 15 per cent from A$93
million (US$84 million) in 2014 to A$79 million (US$59 million) in
2015. This decrease was mainly due to lower mining and
processing costs in line with the lower production, continued
rationalisation of costs as well as a A$1 million (US$1 million)
build-up of inventory in 2015 compared with a A$2 million (US$2
million) drawdown in 2014. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in
cost of A$1,403 per ounce (US$1,057 per ounce) in 2015
compared with A$1,353 per ounce (US$1,222 per ounce) in 2014
due to lower gold sold and higher capital expenditure, partially
offset by lower operating costs.

At Granny Smith, net operating costs decreased by 7 per cent from
A$202 million (US$183 million) in 2014 to A$188 million (US$141
million) in 2015 mainly due to a decrease in mining and processing
and its associated costs. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost
of A$1,017 per ounce (US$764 per ounce) in 2015 compared with
A$896 per ounce (US$809 per ounce) in 2014 due to lower gold
sold and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net
operating costs.

The Group all-in sustaining costs of US$1,007 per ounce and total
all-in cost of US$1,026 per ounce in 2015 compared with all-in
sustaining costs of US$1,053 per ounce and total all-in cost of
US$1,087 per ounce in 2014. The lower all-in-sustaining and all-in
costs in 2015 was due to lower net operating costs, the weaker
average Rand/US and Australian/US dollar exchange rates,
partially offset by lower by-product credits and higher capital
expenditure.

Operating profit decreased from US$1,191 million to US$1,089
million as a result of the above.

Amortisation for the Group decreased from US$657 million in 2014
to US$610 million in 2015 mainly due to lower production.

Net interest expense decreased from US$77 million to US$65
million due to the paying down of relatively more expensive South
African debt in the March 2015 quarter, as compared with offshore
debt.

The share of equity accounted losses after taxation increased from
US$2 million in 2014 to US$6 million in 2015 and related mainly to
the ongoing study and evaluation costs at the Far Southeast
project (FSE) and the Group's share of losses at Hummingbird of
US$2 million.

The gain on foreign exchange of US$10 million in 2015 compared
with US$8 million in 2014. These related to the conversion of
offshore cash holdings into their functional currencies.

The loss on financial instruments of US$5 million in 2015
compared with US$12 million in 2014 and related to the mark to
market adjustment on diesel hedges that the Australian operations
entered into on 10 December and 26 November 2014.

Share-based payments for the Group decreased from US$26
million in 2014 to US$11 million in 2015 due to the implementation
of a new long-term employee incentive scheme in 2014. Long-
term employee benefits of US$5 million in 2015 compared with
US$9 million in 2014 due to mark to market adjustments. The two
schemes combined decreased from US$35 million to US$16
million.

Exploration expenditure increased from US$47 million in 2014 to
US$54 million in 2015 due to increased expenditure at Salares
Norte. Expenditure at Salares Norte amounted to US$16 million in
2015.

Non-recurring items increased from US$97 million in 2014 to
US$218 million in 2015.

The non-recurring expenses in 2015 included mainly:
-   Impairment of the Group's investment in Far South East (FSE)
    in the Philippines (US$101 million) to its recoverable amount;
-   Impairment of the Group's investment in Hummingbird (US$15
    million) to its fair value;
-   Loss on disposal of assets at Cerro Corona (US$5 million);
-   Scrapping of assets no longer in use at Cerro Corona (US$7
    million);
-   Write-off of stockpiles at Damang (US$8 million) due to net
    realisable value adjustments;
-   Retrenchment costs (US$9 million), mainly at Tarkwa (US$5
    million) and St Ives (A$4 million/US$3 million);
-   Impairment of Arctic Platinum project (US$39 million) to its fair
    value less cost of disposal;
-   Impairment at Darlot: gross A$19 million (US$14 million), tax
    A$6 million (US$4 million), net A$13 million (US$10 million);
    and
-   Impairment at Damang: gross US$36 million, tax US$13
    million, net US$23 million. This was based on current studies
    which may result in the pits not being mined and thus
    necessitating them being written down to nil carrying value.

This was partially offset by:
-   A decrease in rehabilitation costs (US$15 million) due to
    increased discount rates at South Deep (R78 million/US$6
    million) and at the Australian operations (A$12 million/US$9
    million).

The non-recurring expenses in 2014 included mainly:
-   Retrenchment costs of US$42 million at all the operations with
    the majority at Tarkwa (US$17 million), South Deep (R161
    million/US$15 million), Damang (US$4 million) and St Ives
    (A$4 million/US$3 million);

-   An increase in rehabilitation costs in respect of previously
    retired assets due to an update of estimates of A$11 million
    (US$10 million) at Agnew and A$11 million (US$10 million) at
    St Ives;
-   Impairment of investments of US$16 million including: Bezant
    Resources PLC (US$7 million), Rand Refinery (US$4
    million/R45 million), APP (US$3 million) and Aurigin (US$2
    million);
-   Scrapping of redundant trackless equipment at South Deep
    (R91 million/US$8 million);
-   Scrapping of assets at Agnew (A$3 million/US$3 million) and
    St Ives (A$1 million/US$1 million); and
-   Information technology conversions at the Yilgarn South assets
    (A$5 million/US$5 million).

This was partially offset by the profit on the sale of Chucapaca
(US$5 million) and Robust Resources (US$2 million).

Royalties of US$76 million in 2015 compared with US$86 million in
2014.

The taxation charge of US$247 million in 2015 compared with
US$118 million in 2014. Normal taxation increased from US$134
million to US$143 million due to higher taxable income. The
deferred tax charge of US$104 million in 2015 compared with a
credit of US$16 million in 2014.

The deferred tax charge of US$104 million, arose mainly due to
impairments of the deferred tax assets of US$68 million at Cerro
Corona and US$37 million at Damang along with a US$32 million
charge related to the weakening of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol.

In Peru, tax depreciation is recognised using the straight line
depreciation method for the majority of assets over periods longer
than the life of mine. As Cerro Corona has a current life of mine to
2023, a significant portion of assets will not be fully depreciated for
tax purposes by the end of the life of the mine. In prior years, the
Group believed that the life could be extended through an
expansion of the tailings storage facility. However, during 2015,
the Group completed the expansion feasibility study and concluded
that in the current gold and copper price environment it would not
be viable. Based on the Group's best estimate at 31 December
2015, it is unlikely that Cerro Corona will earn taxable profits post
the current life of mine in order to utilise these deductible
temporary differences as they reverse. Due to the above, the
Group impaired an amount of US$68 million related to deferred tax
assets not recoverable at Cerro Corona at 31 December 2015.

The impairment of the deferred tax asset at Damang of US$37
million arose due to uncertainty regarding the extent of future
taxable profits against which it can be utilised.

The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol
(Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the
US dollar. For accounting purposes the unredeemed capital
allowance balance must be converted from Soles to dollars at the
closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, the US dollar equivalent of
unredeemed capital allowance balance fluctuates due to
movements in the exchange rate between the Peruvian Nuevo Sol
and the US dollar. This resulted in a change in the temporary
taxation differences for non-monetary assets on translation. A
deferred tax charge of US$32 million arose due to the weakening
of the exchange rate from 2.84 Nuevo Sol in 2014 to 3.38 Nuevo
Sol in 2015. It has no cash effect.

As a result of the above, net losses attributable to the Gold Fields
shareholders of US$242 million in 2015 compared with net
earnings of US$13 million in 2014.

Headline loss of US$28 million in 2015 compared with earnings of
US$27 million in 2014.

Normalised earnings of US$45 million in 2015 compared with
US$85 million in 2014.

CASH FLOW

Cash inflow from operating activities of US$771 million in 2015
compared with US$849 million in 2014 with the decrease mainly
due to a lower release of working capital and lower profit before
royalties, tax and non-recurring items.

Cash outflows from investing activities increased from US$531
million in 2014 to US$651 million in 2015. The cash outflow was
lower in 2014 mainly due to the proceeds on the disposal of
Chucapaca of US$81 million, as well as lower capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure increased from US$609 million in 2014 to
US$634 million in 2015.

At the South Africa region, capital expenditure at South Deep
decreased from R994 million (US$92 million) to R848 million
(US$67 million).

At the West Africa region, capital expenditure increased from
US$190 million in 2014 to US$221 million in 2015, due to
increased pre-stripping and additional expenditure on fleet
purchases at Tarkwa. In South America, at Cerro Corona, capital
expenditure increased from US$51 million in 2014 to US$65 million
in 2015 mainly due to increased expenditure on the construction of
a new raise at the tailings dam as well as the construction of a new
camp and fuel station. At the Australia region, capital expenditure
increased from A$304 million (US$274 million) to A$372 million
(US$281 million), mainly due to increased expenditure on
exploration.

Net cash outflow from financing activities of US$88 million in 2015
compared with US$126 million in 2014. Both related to long term
and short term loans received and repaid.

The net cash inflow of US$4 million in 2015 compared with
US$152 million in 2014. After accounting for a negative translation
adjustment of US$22 million, the cash outflow in 2015 was US$18
million. The cash balance at the end of December 2015 was
US$440 million compared with US$458 million at the end of
December 2014.

GOLD FIELDS TOP SA MINING COMPANY IN
SUSTAINABILITY YEARBOOK

Gold Fields was once again the top ranked South African mining
company in the 2016 Sustainability Yearbook, one of the most
recognised publications highlighting the sustainability performance
of listed companies worldwide. Gold Fields was also one of only a
few South African companies included in the Sustainability
Yearbook compiled by investment firm RobecoSAM. The
methodology used in compiling the Sustainability Yearbook is
identical to the one used by RobecoSAM in compiling the annual
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).

The Sustainability Yearbook ranks the annual sustainability
performance of the world's 2,100 largest companies, including 47
mining companies. Among other factors, it measures management
practices surrounding economic, environmental and social
engagement approaches. Gold Fields' 80 per cent rating (2014: 81
per cent) qualifies it for a Silver Class Award in the Sustainability
Yearbook as it is within five percentage points of the mining sector
leaders, Newmont Mining of the US and Barrick in Canada. This is
the fifth successive year that Gold Fields has received a Silver
Class award.

Outlook for 2016

Attributable equivalent gold production for the Group for 2016 is
expected to be between 2.05 million ounces and 2.10 million
ounces, with decreases in the international operations partly offset
by the growth in production at South Deep. The Australian region
is expected to produce around 905,000 ounces with reduced
ounces at the four mines largely due to a change in mining mix
across these dynamic operations which inevitably affect grade and
tonnage. Cerro Corona's gold equivalent production of around
260,000 ounces is lower than 2015 with the decrease mainly due
to the negative impact of the lower copper price. Lower production
is expected at Damang given the review currently underway and
South Deep is expected to increase production to around 8,000
kilograms (257,000 ounces).

The lower production in Australia is due to mining of lower grade
central areas of the main lode on Zone 90 and Zone 100 at Granny
Smith; the mining schedule for Invincible and Neptune at St Ives;
and limited mining planned at Darlot pending further exploration
success during 2016. The increase in production at South Deep is
expected to be driven mainly by an increase in available working
places; an increase in productivity; fleet expansion and grade
improvements.

Unit costs are expected to be largely unchanged from 2015, with
AISC expected to be between US$1,000 per ounce and US$1,010
per ounce and AIC is expected to be between US$1,035 per ounce
and US$1,045 per ounce. Group capex for the year is planned at
US$602 million. These expectations assume exchange rates of
R/US$: 14.14 and A$/US$: 0.73.

The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact
of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on
pages 4 and 32.

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings
Requirements for preliminary reports and the requirements of the
Companies Act 2008 of South Africa.

The Listings Requirements require preliminary reports to be prepared
in accordance with the framework concepts and the measurement
and recognition requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as
issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial
Pronouncements as issued by Financial Reporting Standards Council
and to also, as a minimum, contain the information required by IAS
34, Interim Financial Reporting.

The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed
consolidated financial statements are in terms of IFRS and are
consistent with those applied in the previously issued consolidated
financial statements except for the adoption of applicable
amendments to new standards and interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board.

The Group adopted the annual improvements to IFRSs 2010 - 2012
cycle  various standards during 2015 which did not significantly
impact the Group's financial results.

AUDITOR'S REVIEW

The condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields
Limited for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been reviewed by
the company's auditor, KPMG Inc. The information for the quarters
ended September 2015, December 2015 and December 2014 and
the segmental operating results included in the condensed
consolidated financial statements have not been reviewed by KPMG
Inc. The auditor's report does not necessarily report on all of the
information contained in this media release. Shareholders are
therefore advised that in order to obtain a full understanding of the
nature of the auditor's engagement they should refer to the auditor's
report on the last page of this release.

LITIGATION STATEMENT

In relation to the Litigation statement, there has been no further
update since the release of the Integrated Annual Report on 31 March
2015 except for:

South Deep tax dispute
The Group has taken legal advice on the matter and was advised by
external Senior Counsel that South African Revenue Services (SARS)
should not be allowed to disallow the claiming of the Additional
Capital Allowance. GFIJVH has in the meantime not only formally
appealed against the position taken by SARS, but also filed an
application in the High Court and will vigorously defend its position.
Currently it is awaiting the grounds of assessment to be issued by
SARS after the alternative dispute resolution process has failed.

Update of the Silicosis class action
The two class action applications were consolidated into one
application on 17 October 2013. In terms of the consolidated class
action application, the court is asked to allow the class actions to be
certified. The consolidated application was heard during the weeks of
12 and 19 October 2015. Judgment was reserved. If certification is
granted, it will be the first step in a process whereby the applicants
will, on behalf of the class or classes, seek to hold Gold Fields and
the other mining companies liable for silicosis and/or tuberculosis and
the resultant consequences. Any such claims will be defended.

Mining Charter ownership element declaration
application
On 5 June 2015, the Chamber of Mines commenced a court
application against the Minister and Director General of the
Department of Mineral Resources regarding the continuing
consequences of previous BEE deals in measuring progress on the
Mining Charter's ownership element. The parties' legal
representatives met with the Deputy Judge President of the North
Gauteng High Court on 11 November 2015, where it was agreed that
the application hearing will take place on 15 and 16 March 2016.

SEC investigation
On 22 June 2015 Gold Fields Limited was informed by the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act Unit of the United States Securities Exchange
Commission (the Commission) that it has concluded its investigation
in connection with the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)
transaction related to South Deep and, based on the information
available to them, will not recommend to the Commission that
enforcement action be taken against Gold Fields.

Hedging/Derivatives (Reviewed)
The Group's policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes undertaken on a project specific basis as follows:

  -   to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure;
  -   for specific debt servicing requirements; and
  -   to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.

Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.
There were no outstanding contracts at December 2015.

Independent auditors review report on condensed consolidated financial
statements

To the shareholders of Gold Fields Limited

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold
Fields Limited, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2015, and the condensed consolidated
income statement and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and selected
explanatory notes, as set out on pages 19 to 23 and marked as reviewed, and
the segmental financial results for the year ended 31 December 2015, as set out
on pages 24 to 25 and marked as reviewed.

Directors Responsibility for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these
condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for preliminary reports,
as set out in the Basis of accounting note to the financial statements, and the
requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

Auditors Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements. We
conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review
Engagements (ISRE) 2410, which applies to a review of historical information
performed by the independent auditor of the entity. ISRE 2410 requires us to
conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the financial statements are not prepared in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This standard also
requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements.

A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2410 is a limited
assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making
inquiries of management and others within the entity, as appropriate, and
applying analytical procedures, and evaluate the evidence obtained.

The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those
performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these financial
statements.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the condensed consolidated financial statements of Gold Fields Limited for
the year ended 31 December 2015 are not prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the requirements of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements for
preliminary reports, as set out in the Basis of accounting note to the financial
statements, and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.

Other Matter
We have not reviewed the information for the quarters ended September 2015,
December 2015 and December 2014 and the segmental operating results
included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, and
accordingly do not express a conclusion thereon.
