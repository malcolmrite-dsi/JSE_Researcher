REVIEWED ANNUAL GROUP RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2020 
AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION


- Group turnover up 9.6%
- Retail health and beauty sales up 8.4%
- UPD turnover up 11.2%
- Diluted headline earnings per share up 13.7% 
- Dividend of 450 cents per share
- Cash at year-end R2.2 billion 


OVERVIEW
Clicks Group delivered a strong and resilient performance against the background of a global 
humanitarian crisis and a deepening economic recession locally.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 8.4% supported by strong front shop health sales growth 
during the pandemic. UPD reported robust growth of 11.2% and continued to gain market share after 
securing new wholesale and bulk distribution contracts.

Tight cost management, continued working capital efficiency, pleasing health and beauty sales and 
the strong performance of UPD were the main contributors to the group's diluted headline earnings 
per share increasing by 13.7% to 754 cents. 

The board has declared a dividend of 450 cents per share for the full year, based on a dividend 
payout ratio of 60%.

IMPACT OF COVID-19
As essential healthcare service providers Clicks and UPD traded throughout the national lockdown 
which started on 27 March 2020. Management responded decisively to the lockdown, immediately 
implementing measures to reduce the group's cost base to off-set the impact of slower sales, 
with cash preservation being a priority to protect shareholder value.

Trading patterns shifted as customer shopping behaviour changed in response to the various lockdown 
restrictions. 

The accessibility of the Clicks store network proved beneficial, with 74% of stores located in 
convenience and neighbourhood shopping centres. This largely negated the significant slowdown in 
footfall at super regional and regional malls across the country.

Online sales in Clicks increased by 361% off a relatively low base for the second half of the 
financial year, reaping the benefit of the investment in its e-commerce and digital platform over 
the past four years.

The absence of a traditional winter cold and flu season adversely impacted pharmacy sales.  

Clicks stores were restricted to shorter trading hours and limited to selling only essential 
products under lockdown level 5 until 30 April 2020. The group's other retail brand stores all 
closed from the start of the lockdown. The Body Shop reopened from 1 May 2020 while Musica and 
ClaireÂ´s reopened from 1 June 2020 when the country moved to lockdown level 3. The group received 
some rental relief on stores which were closed due to the lockdown.

UPD's business to the private hospital and independent pharmacy channels grew strongly due to 
increased demand for medicines and healthcare products during the pandemic. 

The group incurred Covid-19-related costs of R44 million. This was off-set by focused cost 
management, lower overtime payments owing to restricted trading hours, rental reductions due to 
store closures and government funding for employees unable to work during the lockdown. 

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 9.6% to R34.4 billion. Retail sales grew by 7.3% and by 3.4% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of 2.2%. Distribution turnover increased by 11.2% 
with price inflation of 2.5% for the year. 

Total income grew by 8.4% to R9.4 billion. The retail margin was maintained at 33.3% while the 
distribution margin strengthened by 30 basis points to 8.5% owing to the benefit of new contracts 
and the higher annual increase in the single exit price (SEP) of medicines.

Retail expenses grew by 6.5% as the group continued to invest in new Clicks stores and pharmacies 
over the past year. UPD expenses, which include the costs related to the new wholesale and bulk 
distribution contracts, grew by 17.9%.

Group operating profit increased by 10.4% to R2.8 billion with the group's operating margin 
expanding by 10 basis points to 8.1%. The retail margin was well managed and increased by 20 basis 
points to 9.1% despite the impact of Covid-19 on the trading environment. The distribution margin 
was maintained at 3.3%. 

Headline earnings grew by 12.2% to R1.9 billion. Earnings per share increased by 11.4% to 
751 cents with headline earnings per share increasing by 11.7% to 754 cents. Diluted headline 
earnings per share grew by 13.7%.

Inventory days reduced from 70 to 66 days as stock levels were tightly managed in the second half 
of the year.  

Cash generated by operating activities before dividends paid totalled R2.3 billion. Capital 
expenditure of R591 million (2019: R647 million) was invested mainly in new stores and pharmacies, 
store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. 

The group returned R822 million to shareholders in dividend payments and R653 million in share 
buy-backs. At year-end the group held cash resources of R2.2 billion.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the international franchise brands GNC, 
The Body Shop and Claire's, increased by 8.4%, driven by competitive everyday pricing, 
differentiated product ranges, the Clicks ClubCard, new stores and online sales. Sales in 
comparable stores increased by 4.1%, with volume growth of 2.1% and inflation of 2.0%.

Clicks opened 39 stores to expand its retail footprint to 743 stores and increased its pharmacy 
network to 585 following the opening of 40 pharmacies. Clicks ClubCard active membership increased 
to 8.6 million and accounted for 78.2% of the brand's sales. 

UPD grew wholesale turnover by 17.0% as the business gained new private hospital and buying group 
contracts. This contributed to UPD increasing its market share from 27.0% to 29.4% at August 2020 
(source IQVIA). UPD's total managed turnover, combining wholesale turnover and turnover managed on 
behalf of bulk distribution clients, increased by 11.7% to R23.6 billion as the business gained 
two distribution contracts.

OUTLOOK
The performance of the past year has again demonstrated that the group's core health and beauty 
markets and business model are resilient. 

The consumer environment is expected to be extremely constrained in the year ahead owing to the 
continuing impact of Covid-19 and the socio-economic challenges arising from the lockdown. 
The first half of the new financial year was initially impacted by protest action at Clicks stores 
in early September and will be further affected by the widespread job losses expected in the 
aftermath of the pandemic.

The business has traded well in weak consumer markets over a sustained period and has adapted to 
the new market dynamics arising out of the Covid-19 crisis. 

The group has a robust balance sheet, generates strong cash flows and the directors remain confident 
in the group's ability to deliver on its medium-term targets.

Ernst & Young Inc., the group's independent auditor, has expressed an unmodified review conclusion 
on the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements. 

FINAL DIVIDEND
The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend for the period ended 
31 August 2020 of 450.0 cents per share (2019: 327.0 cents per share). The source of the dividend 
will be from distributable reserves and it will be paid in cash. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 90.0 cents per ordinary share will be withheld in terms of 
the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a 
dividend of 360.0 cents net of DT. 

The Company has 248 662 647 ordinary shares in issue. Its income tax reference number is 
9061/745/71/8.

Shareholders are advised of the following salient dates in respect of the final dividend:

TRADING UPDATE AND VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT

TRADING UPDATE FOR 23 WEEKS FROM 1 MARCH TO 9 AUGUST 2020

Clicks Group presents the following update to provide insight into the group’s
trading performance against the background of the Covid-19 pandemic and the
resultant national lockdown. This 23-week period covers trading from the start of
the second half of the group’s financial year, including the period immediately
before the country entered varying levels of lockdown from 27 March 2020, and
the subsequent four months of trading.

Retail health and beauty sales, including Clicks and the franchise brands of The
Body Shop, GNC and Claire’s, increased by 7.7% over the corresponding 23
weeks in the previous year. Total retail sales grew by 6.3%.

As an essential healthcare service provider Clicks has traded throughout the
lockdown period, although has been restricted to shorter trading hours and was
limited to selling only essential products under lockdown level 5 until 30 April
2020.

Trading patterns shifted as customer shopping behaviour changed in response to
the various lockdown level restrictions and consumers chose to stay home to
reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19.

Online sales in Clicks have shown significant growth since the start of lockdown.
The investment made in its online and digital capability over the past four years
enabled the brand to manage the increased demand and ensure an efficient and
convenient service to customers.

Clicks has experienced a decline in the frequency of customer visits during the
lockdown while the average basket value has increased over this time. The
decline in footfall at super regional and regional malls across the country has
impacted sales in destination stores. However, Clicks is well positioned in this
environment with over 70% of its stores located in convenience and
neighbourhood shopping centres.

Pharmacy sales have been negatively impacted as the country has not
experienced a traditional winter cold and flu season which is generally a strong
driver of sales growth. The incidence of colds and flu has been limited as South
Africans are wearing face masks during the pandemic, social interaction has
been limited, schooling restricted and large numbers of people are working from
home.

The group’s other retail brand stores all closed for the lockdown commencing on
27 March 2020. The Body Shop stores reopened from 1 May 2020 while Musica
and Claire’s stores reopened from 1 June 2020 when the country moved to
lockdown level 3. The group received rental relief on stores which were closed
due to lockdown.

UPD’s turnover for the period grew by 11.4% owing to strong growth from the
private hospital channel due to increased demand for medicines and healthcare
products. Sales growth was further supported by good growth from independent
pharmacies and the benefit of new contracts.

Group turnover for the 23 weeks increased by 10.2%.

TRADING UPDATE FOR 49 WEEKS TO 9 AUGUST 2020

Group turnover increased by 10.0% to R32.3 billion in the 49 weeks to 9 August
2020.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 8.7%. Health and beauty sales in
comparable stores increased by 4.6% with volume growth of 2.6% as selling
price inflation averaged 2.0% for the 49 weeks.

Total retail sales increased by 7.5% and by 3.9% in comparable stores, with
selling price inflation of 2.2%.

UPD increased turnover by 11.7%. Total managed turnover, combining
wholesale turnover and turnover managed on behalf of bulk distribution clients,
increased by 10.6% as the business traded well and benefited from gaining new
private hospital and buying group contracts.

 Segmental turnover
                         Sales growth (%)        Inflation (%)
 Retail                               7.5                  2.2
 Distribution                        11.7                  2.5
 Intragroup turnover                  3.9
 Total group                         10.0                 2.3

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 AUGUST 2020

The group expects diluted headline earnings per share for the year ending 31
August 2020 to increase by between 10% and 15% over the 663.6 cents for the
2019 financial year to between 730 and 763 cents. The figure for 2019 was
restated following the adoption of IFRS 16.

The growth in earnings is supported by the group’s tight cost management,
continued working capital efficiency and the performance of UPD which gained
new contracts and traded strongly throughout the year.

The group’s balance sheet remains robust and the business has continued to
generate strong cash flows throughout the year. The directors plan to declare a
full year dividend within the group’s targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% - 65%.

The financial information in this announcement is the responsibility of the
directors and has not been reviewed or reported on by the group’s independent
auditor.

- Retail health and beauty sales up 9.6%
- UPD turnover up 12.3%

- Earnings per share up 10.2%

OVERVIEW
Clicks Group continued its strong growth trend and delivered a highly competitive performance 
against a background of low economic growth, constrained consumer spending and extensive trading 
disruption due to electricity load shedding.

Retail health and beauty sales increased by 9.6% as Clicks gained market share across all its 
core product categories. UPD reported strong sales growth of 12.3% and continued to gain market 
share after securing new wholesale contracts.

The strong performances from both the retail and distribution businesses, together with efficient 
capital management, contributed to the group's diluted headline earnings per share increasing by 
14.4% to 338 cents. 

Owing to the economic upheaval arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the board has decided to 
preserve cash and consider an annual dividend at year-end once there is greater certainty.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group turnover increased by 9.9% to R16.9 billion. Retail sales grew by 8.6% and by 5.0% in 
comparable stores, with selling price inflation of 2.7%. Distribution turnover increased by 12.3% 
with price inflation of 2.4% for the half-year. 

Total income grew by 8.2% to R4.6 billion, with the group's total income margin declining by 
40 basis points to 27.3%. The retail margin was impacted by higher operating costs at the retail 
Centurion distribution centre due to the implementation of a centralised single picking project. 
The UPD margin strengthened by 20 basis points as the business gained new wholesale contracts.

Retail expenses grew by 7.3% as the group invested in a net 41 new Clicks stores and 44 new 
pharmacies over the past 12 months. Comparable retail costs were contained to an increase of 3.8%. 
UPD expenses, which include the costs related to the new wholesale contracts, grew by 14.5%.

Group operating profit increased by 9.4% to R1.2 billion with the group's operating margin constant 
at 7.4%. The retail and distribution businesses both did well to hold margins despite the low 
inflationary environment and challenging trading conditions.

Headline earnings grew by 13.1% to R851.2 million. Earnings per share and headline earnings per 
share increased by 10.2% and 10.4% respectively to 338 cents.

Working capital continues to be efficiently managed and the group's net working capital improved 
from 37 to 35 days. Retail inventory levels were 12.3% higher owing to increased front shop stock 
levels shipped earlier due to Covid-19 challenges being experienced in China. The new wholesale 
contracts in UPD, together with strategic stock buy-ins due to anticipated supply chain challenges 
in Asia and the annual increase in the single exit price of medicines, have resulted in group 
inventory increasing by 22.1%. These stock levels are expected to normalise in the second half of 
the year. 

Cash generated by operating activities before dividends paid increased by 2.9% to R1.2 billion for 
the six months. Capital expenditure of R309 million (2019: R264 million) was invested mainly in 
new stores and pharmacies, store refurbishments, supply chain and information technology. The group 
returned R822 million to shareholders in dividend payments, 20.5% higher than the prior period. 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by R857 million and the group had cash resources of 
R2.3 billion at the end of February 2020.

Subsequent to the reporting period the group repurchased 2 862 264 shares for a total consideration 
of R653.3 million as part of its ongoing capital management strategy aimed at enhancing returns to 
shareholders. The repurchases were made under a closed period mandate approved by the JSE. In order 
to preserve cash no further share repurchases have been made since South Africa entered the 
lockdown period.

TRADING PERFORMANCE
Retail health and beauty sales, which includes Clicks and the franchise brands GNC, The Body Shop 
and Claire's, increased by 9.6%, driven by competitive pricing, differentiated product ranges, 
the Clicks ClubCard and new stores. Sales in comparable stores increased by 5.8%, with volume 
growth of 3.5% and inflation of 2.3% for the six months.

Clicks opened 17 stores in the six months to expand its retail footprint to 721 stores and 
increased its pharmacy network to 572 following the opening of 27 pharmacies. Clicks increased its 
share of the retail pharmacy market from 24.1% to 24.6% at February 2020 (source IQVIA). 

UPD grew wholesale turnover by 17.6% as the business gained new private hospital and buying group 
contracts. This contributed to UPD increasing its market share from 26.0% to 27.2% at February 2020 
(source IQVIA). 

TRADING UPDATE FOR SEVEN WEEKS TO 19 APRIL 2020
Following the declaration of the state of disaster in South Africa in response to the Covid-19 
pandemic and the subsequent announcement of the national lockdown, Clicks experienced unprecedented 
levels of sales demand by customers across stores nationally, particularly in hygiene and healthcare 
products. However, this trend has reversed during the lockdown period.

Retail sales for the seven weeks to 19 April 2020 (the period), being the first seven weeks of 
the second half of the financial year, increased by 7.9% with health and beauty sales up 9.3%. 
The period includes the first 24 days of the lockdown during which time Clicks has been restricted 
to shorter trading hours and limited to only selling essential products. All Musica, The Body Shop 
and Claire's stores are closed during the lockdown.

UPD's turnover for the period grew by 31.2% due to customers preparing for the Covid-19 impact. 
UPD is well positioned in terms of its scale and logistics capabilities to support all healthcare 
facilities with medicine requirements as the country deals with the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Group turnover for the period increased by 15.9%.

OUTLOOK
Trading conditions are expected to be extremely tough for the remainder of the financial year as 
the extent and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are unknown. This could be compounded by 
electricity load shedding which remains a risk to retail sales, particularly in the higher-demand 
winter season. The recent sharp depreciation in the value of the Rand could impact on selling price 
inflation towards the end of the financial year and place further pressure on constrained consumers.

The group's sustained long-term performance is evidence that the strategy and business model remain 
relevant and resilient. This will be severely tested in the months ahead. The business has a robust 
balance sheet, generates strong cash flows and its plans to open 38 new Clicks stores and 
40 pharmacies in the financial year are unchanged.

Despite the headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic the group is well positioned in its core markets 
to respond to the needs of retail and distribution customers during this time of uncertainty and 
crisis. The directors remain confident in the group's ability to deliver on its medium-term targets. 

The financial information in this announcement has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's

Clicks Group chief executive Vikesh Ramsunder said the strong trading
performance in the weak consumer economy again demonstrated the resilience
of the Clicks brand and the defensive nature of the health and beauty markets in
which the group trades.
""Our wide range of gifting and value offering, supported by the convenience of
the Clicks chain's extensive retail and pharmacy footprint, ensured that we
maintained our robust sales momentum of recent years and sustained volume
growth.

""This was achieved despite the increasing pressures on consumer disposable
income, negative sentiment and the serious impact of electricity load shedding on
retail trading hours and shoppers in general over the past two months,"" he said.
