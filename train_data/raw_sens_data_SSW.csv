is pleased to advise that on 10 November 2020, a Brooklyn, New York, Federal Court
dismissed with prejudice, a putative securities class action suit seeking damages for
allegedly false and/or misleading statements by the Group and CEO Neal Froneman (the
“Defendants”), related to safety incidents in 2018.

The class action was brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased
Sibanye-Stillwater ADRs between 23 February 2017 and 31 October 2018, inclusive. The
class action was filed shortly after the occurrence of fatal incidents at Sibanye-
Stillwater’s SA gold operations in H1 2018. The Plaintiffs alleged that, in light of
the fatalities, statements that the Defendants made regarding safety were false and
misleading and violated the U.S. federal securities laws.

In dismissing the class action, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to allege any
violation of the U.S. securities laws, based on their failure to allege any materially
false or misleading statements.     The Court also found that Plaintiffs failed to
establish that the Defendants acted with fraudulent intent, or that their alleged
losses were caused by the statements in question. In doing so, the Court denied the
Plaintiffs’ request to file a further amended complaint, finding that it would be
futile, and directed the Clerk of the Court to enter judgment and close the case.

These Court proceedings are thus concluded, subject to any further proceedings
required in the trial court to finalize a judgment and any appeals that may be lodged.

Group CEO Neal Froneman commenting on the dismissal said: “We are extremely pleased
with the outcome of the class action. We take the safety of our employees very
seriously and ensuring a safe and enabling work environment is a primary focus
throughout the Group. The judgment validates our decision to oppose this class action
and to protect the interests of our stakeholders against spurious and opportunistic
legal actions.”

S&P Global Ratings upgrades Sibanye-Stillwater’s credit rating
Johannesburg, 4 November 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW)
is pleased to report that S&P Global Ratings has upgraded Sibanye-Stillwater’s issuer
credit rating to 'BB-’ from ‘B+’ with a Stable Outlook. In a recent report, S&P Global
Ratings stated: “materially higher cash flows owing to strong gold and PGM prices
have resulted in stronger-than-expected credit metrics and balance sheet”. Further
information is available from www.spglobal.com.

Charl Keyter, CFO of Sibanye-Stillwater commented: “the recent S&P rating upgrade is
pleasing, and reflects the significant improvement in the Group’s operating and
financial position. Despite considerable operational disruptions and other challenges
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, the Group delivered solid
results for Q3 2020, with the production build up ahead of forecast, underpinning
another record financial result. Production from the SA operations is expected to
normalise during Q4 2020, underpinning a more robust outlook for the Group, should
precious metals prices sustain at current levels”.

Fitch Ratings assigned a first-time issuer credit rating of ‘BB’ with a Stable Outlook
to Sibanye-Stillwater in August 2020. The Fitch Ratings report published on 2 November
2020 notes that “the IDR reflects a robust financial profile with forecast funds from
operations gross leverage comfortably below 1x in the medium term, and strong demand
fundamentals of palladium and rhodium in the next decade”. Further information is
available from www.fitchratings.com.

   repurchase in terms of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (“JSE”) and the Companies
   Act, 2008 (”Specific Offer”) to holders of 100 Sibanye-Stillwater Shares or more but equal
   to or fewer than 400 Sibanye-Stillwater Shares (“Specific Holders”), (collectively,
   “Offers”).

   As at 30 September 2020, Sibanye-Stillwater had approximately 30,000 ordinary shareholders,
   which reflects nearly a 60% increase in the total number of Sibanye-Stillwater shareholders
   (“Shareholders”) compared to the period prior to the acquisition by Sibanye Gold Limited of
   the entire issued share capital of Lonmin Plc on 10 June 2019. The aggregate shareholding
   in Sibanye-Stillwater of Shareholders who own fewer than 400 ordinary shares in Sibanye-
   Stillwater (“Sibanye-Stillwater Shares”) represents approximately 50% of the number of total
   Shareholders and 0.05% of all Sibanye-Stillwater Shares in issue.

   Shareholders are therefore advised of the Company’s intention to implement an Odd-lot Offer
   and a Specific Offer to Odd-lot Holders and Specific Holders, respectively (collectively,
   “Offer Holders”).

   Sibanye-Stillwater has thus decided to proceed with the implementation of the Offers which
   will result in the repurchase by the Company of the Sibanye-Stillwater Shares from the Offer
   Holders at an offer price determined as outlined in paragraph 4.3 below (“Offer Price”),
   subject to approval by Shareholders at a general meeting of Sibanye-Stillwater to be held
   on 1 December 2020 (“General Meeting”).

2. The Rationale

   The Offers will provide Offer Holders with the ability to dispose of their Sibanye-Stillwater
   Shares which are subject to the Offers (“Offer Holdings”) on an efficient basis and also
   provide liquidity for those Offer Holders who elect not to retain their Offer Holdings or,
   subject to amending the Memorandum of Incorporation of the Company (“MOI”), Odd-lot Holders
   who do not make an election in which case such Odd-lot Holders will be deemed to have agreed
   to dispose of their Sibanye-Stillwater Shares (“Odd-lot Holdings”). Odd-lot Holders can
   elect to retain their Odd-lot Holdings. The Specific Holders are required to elect to sell
   their Sibanye-Stillwater Shares (“Specific Holdings”), and where no such election is made,
   the Specific Holdings will remain unchanged.

   For Sibanye-Stillwater, the Offers will, inter alia, reduce the complexity and cost of
   managing a significantly larger Shareholder base.

3. Amendments to MOI

   The Board further proposes to make amendments to the Company’s MOI in order to (i) obtain
   authority to make and implement the Odd-lot Offer as outlined in detail in the circular to
   Shareholders (“Circular”), to expropriate Sibanye-Stillwater Shares from Shareholders in
   certain circumstances, including most notably the ability to make expropriation a default
   action for those Odd-lot Holders who have not made an election, and who will be deemed to
   have accepted the Odd-lot Offer; and (ii) to allow for the provision by the Company of
   electronic notices to the Shareholders.

4. Key terms of the Offers

   4.1 Odd-lot Offer

   Following the General Meeting and provided the Shareholders approve the resolutions required
   to amend the MOI and implement the Odd-lot Offer as contained in the notice of general
   meeting (“Notice of General Meeting”) incorporated in the Circular (“Resolutions”), Sibanye-
   Stillwater will proceed with implementing the Odd-lot Offer.

   In terms of the Odd-lot Offer, Odd-lot Holders will be able to:
   •   have their Odd-lot Holdings acquired by Sibanye-Stillwater at the Offer Price if they
       decide to sell their Odd-lot Holdings; or
   •   retain their Odd-lot Holdings if they decide to retain their Odd-lot Holdings.

   Odd-lot Holders who wish to retain their Sibanye-Stillwater Shares must specifically elect
   to do so. Odd-lot Holders who do not make an election will, subject to the amendment of the
   MOI, automatically be regarded as having accepted the Odd-lot Offer and to have chosen to
   dispose of their Sibanye-Stillwater Shares to the Company and will receive the Offer Price
   (“Cash Consideration”).

   4.2 Specific Offer

   In terms of the Specific Offer, Specific Holders will be able to:
   •   have their Specific Holdings acquired by Sibanye-Stillwater at the Offer Price if they
       decide to sell their Specific Holdings.

   The Specific Holders are required to elect to sell their Specific Holdings, and where no
   such election is made, their Specific Holdings will remain unchanged.

   4.3 Offer Price
  The Offer Price will be at a premium of 5% to the VWAP of a Sibanye-Stillwater share on the
  JSE over the 10 trading days up to the day immediately prior to the finalization date
  announcement, which is expected to be announced on or before Friday, 11 December 2020, less
  the dividend withholding tax levied in terms of the Income Tax Act to be withheld by the
  CSDP at the rate applicable to the relevant shareholder.

  4.4 Tax Implications

  Sibanye-Stillwater’s existing cash resources, being income, will be utilised to satisfy the
  Cash Consideration. The Cash Consideration paid by Sibanye-Stillwater pursuant to the Offer
  Shares should constitute a “dividend” as defined in section 1 of the Income Tax Act, in the
  hands of such Shareholder as no portion of the repurchase price will consist of contributed
  tax capital. For further details on the tax implications of the Offer, please refer to the
  Circular.

  The summary tax implications serve as a general guide and is not intended to constitute a
  comprehensive analysis of the tax consequence of the Offers under the South African tax law.
  It is also not intended to be, nor should it be considered to be, a legal or tax advice.
  Shareholders’ personal circumstances may lead to a different tax outcome, as such,
  Shareholders should seek appropriate advice in respect of their particular circumstances
  from their own tax and/or other professional advisers.

  4.5 Transaction costs for the Offers

  4.5.1 Shareholders eligible to participate in the Offers will not bear any transaction costs
        in respect of the Odd- lot Offer and Specific Offer.
  4.5.2 Securities transfer tax, if any, will be paid by Sibanye-Stillwater at a rate 0.25%.
  4.5.3 The Offers may be subject to tax in the relevant jurisdiction of the Offer Holder
        arising from the disposal of the Odd-lot Holdings or Specific Holdings by the Offer
        Holders who make an election to sell their respective Odd-lot Holdings or Specific
        Holdings to Sibanye-Stillwater, or who do not make an election in the case of Odd-lot
        Holders.

  The Offers do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any
  Sibanye-Stillwater securities in any in which the distribution, release or publication would
  be restricted or prohibited (“Restricted Jurisdiction”), including the United States (or to
  or for the benefit of any US Person (as such term is defined in Rule 902 under the US
  Securities Act of 1933)), or by use of the mails, or by any means or instrumentality
  (including, without limitation, facsimile transmission, telephone and the internet) of
  interstate or foreign commerce, or of any facility of a national securities exchange, of
  any Restricted Jurisdiction, including the United States, and the Offers cannot be accepted
  by any such use, means, instrumentality or facility or from within any Restricted
  Jurisdiction, including the United States (or by a US Person). The Offers are not available
  to holders of Sibanye-Stillwater American Depositary Shares.

  Full details on the terms of the Offers are contained in the Circular.

5. Circular and notice of General Meeting

  For Sibanye-Stillwater to implement the Odd-lot Offer, the Board is seeking approval from
  Shareholders to give effect to the proposed amendments to the MOI and to implement the
  Offers, and is therefore convening a General Meeting of Shareholders, to be held through
   electronic communication on Tuesday, 1 December 2020 at 09:00 (SA time), at which all
   Shareholders will be entitled to vote on the Resolutions required to give effect to proposed
   amendments to MOI and to implement the Offers.

   A Circular, containing details of the Offers and proposed amendments to MOI, together with
   a Notice of General Meeting, has been posted to Shareholders on Monday, 2 November 2020.
   The Circular is also available on the Company’s website: (www.sibanyestillwater.com/news-

OVERVIEW FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020 COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2019

The operational recovery from the severe lockdown in SA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed well. The
proactive and decisive response by the Group to address the COVID-19 challenges, while ensuring the integrity of the
operating environment and the safety of all our employees has been pleasing. Comprehensive health and safety protocols,
which were developed and implemented early on, have proven to be effective. In the interests of employee safety and
operational continuity a more measured and phased production build up was deemed appropriate, particularly as
employees from neighbouring countries and other provinces in South Africa were recalled.

The build-up to normalised production levels at the SA operations has progressed better than planned and the manner in
which employees have been reintegrated into the operations without a notable increase in infection rates or operational
disruptions, validates the more gradual recall and production build-up strategy.

By the end of Q3 2020, the SA gold operations had recalled approximately 92% of the workforce and achieved a production
run rate of approximately 99% of planned levels, with the SA PGM operation having recalled approximately 88% of the
workforce with a production run rate of 93% of planned levels achieved. By mid-October 2020, both the SA gold and PGM
operations were operating at close to planned production rates with the employee complement close to pre-COVID-19 levels.

While the US PGM operations have continued to operate throughout the year, COVID-19 protocols, particularly compliance
with social distancing requirements, has had an ongoing negative impact on productivity. The social distancing impact is
most prevalent on transport to and from work, with employees living throughout the state of Montana and travelling longer
distances to work than in SA. Restricted access to the operations has also affected shift arrangements and blasting schedules,
resulting in a negative 8% impact on productivity.

COVID-19 infection rates at the SA operations, have declined significantly after peaking in July 2020 and while there has been
a slight increase in infections in recent weeks, we do not anticipate a significant rise in cases or significant risk of the
operations being closed. There has been a sharp spike in infections in the US and the state of Montana, and there has been a
corresponding increase in positive cases at the US PGM operations. Again, we believe that our protocols are effective to
manage the situation and ensure the safety of employees as well as the integrity of the operations insofar as practicable.

Elevated precious metal prices for Q3 2020, together with the 15% depreciation of the rand against the dollar during 2020
year-to-date, has ensured record prices for the basket of metals produced in SA and close to record levels in the US. Despite
still being impacted by COVID-19 constraints during Q3 2020, the consistent operational performance coupled with high
commodity prices, underpinned an exceptional financial result for the Group for Q3 2020.

Group adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 increased by 182% (or R10,056 million/US$545 million) to R15,592 million (US$922 million),
compared with the same period in 2019. This represents another record quarterly financial result, surpassing the full-year Group
adjusted EBITDA of R14,956 million (US$1,034 million) for 2019. This outstanding result reflects the significant value accretive
PGM acquisition strategy embarked on from 2016.

Strong cash flow generation drove a further reduction in net debt during the period, despite the payment of the R1.4 billion
H1 2020 dividend. Net debt: adjusted EBITDA (ND: adjusted EBITDA) at the end of Q3 2020, decreased by 40% to 0.33x from
0.55x at the end of June 2020. Subsequent to quarter end, the soft call option on the Convertible Bond (CB) was exercised
and the CB was fully redeemed by 19 October 2020. On a proforma basis there is thus a further reduction in net debt of
R11,164 million (US$666 million), resulting in ND: adjusted EBITDA declining on a proforma basis to 0.05x* at 30 September 2020.

Available funding increased by 19% from R23,799 million (US$1,372 million) at 30 June 2020 to R28,202 million (US$1,683 million)
at 30 September 2020, comprising cash on hand of R15,151 million (US$904 million) (30 June 2020: R12,041 million (US$694
million)), committed undrawn facilities of R11,869 million (US$708 million) (30 June 2020: R9,000 million (US$519 million)), and
available uncommitted overnight facilities of R1,182 million (US$71 million) (30 June 2020: R2,758 million (US$159 million)).

The strategic deleveraging which has been a primary focus since 2017 is now complete. At current commodity prices and
the prevailing exchange rate, and with the SA operations having attained normalised production run rates, the Group is likely
to continue generating significant cash flow. Following the resumption of the dividend in August 2020, the Group is well
positioned to deliver superior total returns to shareholders. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital
allocation, with the primary focus on securing the future of the company and delivering on our vision of superior value creation
for all our stakeholders by prioritising dividends, share buy backs when appropriate, and smart, value accretive growth.

SAFE PRODUCTION

The safe production performance for Q3 2020 was mixed, with another good quarterly safety performance from the SA PGM
operations, offset by a decline in the safety performance of the SA gold operations.

The SA PGM operations delivered another fatality free quarter (mirroring the zero fatalities for Q2 2020), relative to two fatalities
experienced in Q3 2019. On 13 October 2020, the SA PGM operations achieved a milestone of four million fatality free shifts
with the last fatality recorded at Siphumelele shaft in March 2020.

Regrettably, after over 13 million shifts and almost two years without any fatal incidents, the SA gold operations suffered two
fatalities during Q3 2020. On 8 August 2020, Mr Mfuneka Manikela, a contractor employee at Kloof Thuthukani shaft, was
struck by ore flowing down the raise towards the tip while he was travelling in a centre gully to collect equipment. Mr Manikela
was 36 years old and is survived by his wife. On 13 August 2020 Mr Bonginkosi Hlophe, a learner miner at Driefontein Hlanganani
shaft, was struck by a gravity fall of ground while travelling above the strike gully. Mr Hlope was 38 years old and is survived
by his fiancee and three dependents. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Manikela
and Mr Hlophe. Both incidents are being investigated together with the relevant stakeholders and appropriate support has
been provided to both families.

Despite these fatalities we believe that our safety strategy remains appropriate and we will continue to work towards our goal
of zero harm. An improvement in serious injury frequency rate (SIFR), lost day injury frequency rate (LDIFR) and the total injury
frequency rates of 12%, 20% and 23% respectively was achieved for the quarter, compared to the same period in 2019 for
the SA gold operations. The focus on proactively managing leading indicators, in line with our Safe Production Strategy, will
remain key in achieving ongoing continual improvement.

The US PGM reported a total reportable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) of 13 per million hours for Q3 2020, compared to 8.5 per
million hours for Q3 2019. The majority of incidents were due to slips, trips and falls, which primarily resulted in minor lacerations.

OPERATING REVIEW

US PGM operations

Compliance with COVID-19 protocols continued to affect productivity at the US PGM operations. Logistical constraints
(transport of employees) and the need to stagger shift arrangements and blast cycles to accommodate social distancing
has resulted in productivity declines of approximately 8% versus pre-COVID-19 levels. For 2020 this is equivalent to a loss of
approximately 20,000 2Eoz of mined production. Mined 2E PGM production for Q3 2020 of 147,835 2Eoz was in line with the
comparable period in 2019. Production from the Stillwater mine (including Stillwater West and Stillwater East) of 91,940 2Eoz
for Q3 2020, was 1% lower than for the comparable period in 2019. The East Boulder mine (EB) produced 55,895 2Eoz, 3%
higher than for Q3 2019. Mined tonnes milled for Q3 2020 increased to 370,201 tonnes, 7% higher than for Q3 2019. Plant head
grade was 13.6 g/t in Q3 2020, 6% lower than for Q3 2019. Head-grade challenges were largely attributed to lower than
expected availability of higher grade stopes. Remedial action has been taken, and a recovery in grade is anticipated for
Q4 2020. PGM sales for Q3 2020 of 143,716 2Eoz were 3% higher than for Q3 2019, largely due to the timing of production
deliveries in Q3 2020.

All-in sustaining cost (AISC) of US$875/2Eoz for Q3 2020 was 11% higher than for Q3 2019, due to lower than planned 2E PGM
production from the Stillwater mine complex and higher royalties and insurance. The average 2E PGM basket price for Q3
2020, was approximately 96% higher than the average basket price used for planning, with a consequential increase in
royalties and insurance accounting for approximately US$51/2Eoz (6%) of the increase in AISC year-on-year.

The recycling operation fed an average of 25tpd of spent catalyst for Q3 2020. Recycling inventory normalised at
approximately 200 tonnes following the accelerated processing of inventory in Q2 2020, although has increased subsequent
to quarter end due to planned maintenance at the smelter early in Q4 2020. Ongoing COVID-19 related logistical and liquidity
constraints constraining the global recycling industry, continued to affect recycle receipts during Q3 2020 although recycle
receipts have begun normalising and are trending back to pre-COVID-19 levels. It should be noted that recycle receipts are
region specific, with COVID-19 continuing to constrain global supply from some regions.

The 2E PGM basket price for Q3 2020 averaged US$1,898/2Eoz, 37% higher than for Q3 2019, driving the mined adjusted EBITDA
margin to 62% from 57% in Q3 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the US PGM operations increased by 55% year-on-year to US$191
million (R3,227 million), with the recycling operation contributing US$10 million (R170 million). After accounting for recycling,
the blended adjusted EBITDA margin for the US PGM operations increased from 27% in Q3 2019 to 34% in Q3 2020.

Total capital expenditure for Q3 2020 amounted to US$69 million and was mainly spent on the Blitz and Fill the mill (FTM) growth
projects (54% or US$37 million).

The Blitz project has been reviewed following the suspension of growth capital activities due to COVID-19 during Q1 and Q2 2020,
which, as signalled in our H1 2020 results, further delayed the project schedule. The project review has indicated a delay of up
to two years, with production from Blitz now expected to reach a steady state run rate of approximately 300,000 2Eoz per annum by 2024.
Further detail on the project will be provided in Q1 2021, following the completion of the annual production planning cycle.
The FTM project is on schedule and on budget, building up to an annualised production run rate of approximately 40,000 2Eoz per annum
from December 2020. This project yields an estimated net present value of over US$460m at spot 2E PGM prices.

SA PGM operations

Despite ongoing COVID-19 related constraints at the SA PGM operations during Q3 2020, the ongoing production build-up
was well managed, with costs kept under control. Primarily due to the progressive production build up during the quarter,
4E PGM production of 427,715 4Eoz for Q3 2020 was 18% lower than for the comparable period in 2019.

Costs were well managed with AISC increasing by only 5% year-on-year to R16,985/4Eoz (US$1,004/4Eoz), despite lower
production and above inflation electricity tariffs and wage adjustments. Higher state royalty tax arising from the increase in
revenue and profitability were partly offset by financial benefits accruing to the Marikana smelting and refining operations
from the processing of Purchase of Concentrate (PoC) from Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum Mile following the declaration
of Force Majeure (FM) by Anglo American Platinum (Anglo Platinum) during March 2020 after breakdowns at its converter
plants (ACP).

The average 4E PGM basket price of R36,840/4Eoz (US$2,179/4Eoz) for Q3 2020 was 81% higher than for Q3 2019. This was
primarily driven by significant price gains in rhodium (166%) and palladium (41%) period-on-period and a 15% weaker rand
exchange rate. Rhodium and palladium respectively contributed approximately 42% and 30% of the spot 4E PGM basket
revenue for Q3 2020, despite comprising just 8% and 30% of the 4E prill split. The record average 4E basket price combined
with the steady increase in production post the COVID-19 lockdown, enabled a 217% increase in adjusted EBITDA for the SA
PGM operations to R9,287 million (US$549 million) for Q3 2020, with the adjusted EBITDA margin more than doubling from 25%
for Q3 2019 to 58% for Q3 2020.

Notably, the R9,287 million adjusted EBITDA generated during this quarter accounts for 72% of the R12.8 billion aggregated
initial acquisition cost of Kroondal, Rustenburg and Marikana. Considering the higher prevailing average PGM basket price
in Q4 2020 to date, combined with the return to normalised production rates during October, the outlook for Q4 2020 is
extremely positive.

PGM production of 154,904 4Eoz from the Rustenburg operation was 14% lower than for Q3 2019. Underground production
was 17% lower due to the ongoing build-up of production post the COVID-19 lockdown. This was partly offset by an 18%
increase in production from the surface operations, which were less affected by COVID-19 related restrictions. AISC for the
Rustenburg operation increased by 19% year-on-year to R18,864/4Eoz (US$1,116/4Eoz), primarily due to lower production,
compounded by above inflation increases in wages and electricity tariffs, with higher royalty tax adding approximately
R1,624/4Eoz (US$96/4Eoz). At normalised production levels and adjusting for the higher royalty tax, AISC would have been
R14,813/4Eoz (US$876/4Eoz), well within SA inflation. The combined AISC margin for the Rustenburg operation increased from
31% for Q3 2019 to 59% for Q3 2020.

The Kroondal operation delivered another solid operational performance despite COVID-19 constraints. Despite being a
primarily mechanised operation, a relatively higher proportion of Kroondal's labour complement comes from neighbouring
countries and other SA provinces which, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions on travel, resulted in a more delayed recall of
employees, compounded by the need to quarantine or isolate returning employees. As a result, 4E PGM production of
53,299oz was 21% lower for Q3 2020 than for Q3 2019. Absolute costs were well managed, with above inflationary electricity
tariff and wage increases being absorbed, but due to the lower production volumes, AISC increased by 18% to R12,805/4Eoz
(US$757/4Eoz) year-on-year, considerably less than the 93% year-on-year increase in the average PGM basket price.

PGM production from the Marikana operation for Q3 2020 of 177,717 4Eoz was 26% lower than for Q3 2019. The production
decline was again primarily due to the gradual production build, with the buildup at the conventional Marikana shafts slower
than at the more mechanised Rustenburg operation. The Marikana operation also employs a higher proportion of foreign
nationals and employees from other provinces than the Rustenburg operations, which further delayed the production build
up. Restructuring of the Marikana operations and closure of three Generation 1 shafts, which produced 10,537 4Eoz for
Q3 2019, also contributed to the decline in production year-on-year. AISC of R16,779/4Eoz (US$992/4Eoz) was 7% lower than
R17,955/4Eoz (US$1,224/4Eoz) for Q3 2019 despite significantly lower production. This partly reflects the ongoing realisation of
cost synergies from the integration of the Marikana operation into the SA PGM operations, as well as one-off benefits from
processing of PoC from Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum Mile (due to the Anglo Platinum ACP FM) at the Marikana smelting
and refining operations.

Revenue from chrome sales amounted to R309 million for Q3 2020, 6% lower than revenue of R330 million for Q3 2019 due to
lower volumes produced and lower prices year-on-year. Chrome sales of 429kt for Q3 2020, compared with 591kt for Q3 2019
with the average chrome price for Q3 2020 of US$138/t, 6% lower than the Q3 2019 average price of US$147/tonne.

Mimosa was largely unaffected by COVID-19 and continued to perform steadily. Attributable 4E PGM production of
31,572 4Eoz was 23% higher than for Q3 2019.

SA gold operations

The post lockdown production build up at the SA Gold operations progressed smoothly and ahead of plan. Gold production
of 8,987kg (288,938oz) for Q3 2020 was flat year-on-year, with production building up during both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019
following significant operational disruptions in prior periods. During H1 2020 operations were suspended due to COVID-19 and
during H1 2019, the production was significantly affected by the five-month AMCU strike. AISC of R715,345/kg (US$1,316/oz)
remained elevated due to lower production, above inflation electricity tariff and wage increases.

Gold production (excluding DRDGOLD) of 7,473kg (240,262oz) was similar to the comparable period in 2019, with AISC of
R746,127/kg (US$1,372/oz), 9% higher than for Q3 2019.

The average gold price for Q3 2020 of US$1,845/oz was 27% higher than for the comparable period in 2019, which together
with the 15% depreciation of the average rand: dollar exchange rate year-on-year boosted the average rand gold price
received for Q3 2020 by 47% to a record level of R1,002,945/kg. The inherent leverage of the SA gold operations to the rand
gold price was clearly evident with the adjusted EBITDA margin for the SA Gold operations expanding to 37% compared with
14% for Q3 2019 and adjusted EBITDA increasing 282% to R3,218 million (US$190 million) for Q3 2020.

Underground production from the Driefontein operation of 2,424kg (77,933oz) increased by 17% due to a 14% increase in the
average yield to 6.26g/t compared with 5.51g/t for the comparable period in 2019. The higher average yield during the
period was a planned consequence of the phased recall of employees since May 2020, with returning crews initially directed
to high grade areas, in order to build production and revenue as fast as possible. Underground yields have naturally
normalised as the employee complement has increased. AISC declined by 5% to R741,525/kg (US$1,364/oz).

Underground production from the Kloof operation increased by 11% to 2,881kg (92,626oz) compared to Q3 2019, due to a
14% increase in the underground yield for the same reason outlined above. The Kloof surface operation was less impacted
by COVID-19 constraints and spare capacity at the underground plants was utilised to accelerate surface throughput in
order to offset lower throughput from underground. Surface production for Q3 2020 increased by 23% compared with Q3
2019, to 457kg (14,693oz). Considering the additional cost associated with COVID-19, costs were well controlled, with AISC for
Q3 2020 of R718,630/kg (US$1,322/oz) being similar to Q3 2019. As mentioned above total AISC for Kloof is14% higher than the
total AISC for the comparative period as a result of higher sales in the current quarter compared to the same period in 2019
(higher GIP and gold on hand in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2020).

In contrast to the Driefontein and Kloof operations, underground gold production from the Beatrix operation of 1,319kg
(42,407oz) declined by 36% compared with Q3 2019. Beatrix employs a higher proportion of foreign nationals than Kloof and
Driefontein, with lower crew availability delaying the production build up. Gold production from surface sources increased
by 56% to 64kg (2,058oz) due to utilisation of spare plant capacity. AISC for Q3 2020 of R847,561/kg (US$1,559/oz) was 53%
higher than for the comparable period in 2019 due to the high fixed cost nature of the operations offset by the lower wage
costs of employees not recalled, with lower production in the period.

OUTLOOK

Mined 2E PGM production from the US PGM operations for 2020 is forecast at between 620,000 2Eoz and 650,000 2Eoz,
although due to ongoing COVID-19 constraints, is likely to be at the lower end of guidance. AISC is forecast to be between
US$830/2Eoz and US$860/2Eoz, after accounting for the price driven royalties and taxes detailed previously. Capital
expenditure is forecast to be between US$250 million to US$270 million, with the majority of this spend project in nature.

4E PGM production for 2020 from the SA PGM operations is forecast at between 1.35 million 4Eoz and 1.45 million 4Eoz with
AISC between R19,700/4Eoz and R21,000/4Eoz (US$1,159/4Eoz and US$1,235/4Eoz). Given the smooth recovery in production,
the upper end of production guidance and lower end of AISC guidance are very achievable. Capital expenditure is forecast
at approximately R2,000 million (US$117 million).

Gold production from the managed SA gold operations (excluding DRDGOLD) for 2020 is forecast to be at the upper end of
the production guidance of between 23,500kg and 24,500kg (756,000oz and 812,000oz) and as a result AISC is anticipated
to be at the lower end of the cost guidance of between R805,000/kg and R840,000/kg (US$1,473/oz and US$1491/oz). Capital
expenditure is expected to be marginally lower than the guidance of R2,850 million (US$168 million).

The 2020 dollar guidance is based on an average exchange rate of R17.00/US$.

Figures may not add as they are rounded independently

(1) The US PGM operations' underground production is converted to metric tonnes and performance is translated into rand. In addition to the US PGM
    operations' underground production, the operation treats various recycling material which is excluded from the statistics shown above
(2) During Q2 2020, sales were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, however Mimosa continued production of PGM concentrate that resulted in a build up
    of concentrate stockpile. A difference arose whereby the Mimosa 4Eoz sold during Q2 2020 were included as equal to the produced 4Eoz in the Q2 2020
    salient feature tables. The effect of this difference resulted in sold 4Eoz for Q2 2020 being reported as 31,576 4Eoz compared to an actual of 12,953 4Eoz.
    The AISC and AIC per 4Eoz for Mimosa were reported as R8,741/4Eoz compared to R15,420/4Eoz due to the inventory change not adjusted in these calculations
(3) Production per product - see prill split in the table below
(4) The Group and total SA PGM operations' unit cost benchmarks and capital exclude the financial results of Mimosa, which is equity accounted and excluded from
    revenue and cost of sales
(5) The average PGM basket price is the PGM revenue per 4E/2E ounce, prior to a purchase of concentrate adjustment
(6) Operating cost is the average cost of production and operating cost per tonne is calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation
    and change in inventory in a period by the tonnes milled/treated in the same period, and operating cost per ounce (and kilogram) is calculated by dividing the
    cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the PGM produced in the same period. The operating cost of Marikana
    operation includes the purchase of concentrate from Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum Mile
(7) All-in cost is calculated in accordance with the World Gold Council guidance. All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger and acquisition
    activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one-time severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings. All-in cost is made up of All-in
    sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation, together with corporate and major capital
    expenditure associated with growth. All-in sustaining cost per ounce (and kilogram) and All-in cost per ounce (and kilogram) are calculated by dividing the
    All-in sustaining cost and All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total 4E/2E PGM produced in the same period. For a reconciliation of cost of sales
    before amortisation and depreciation to All-in costs, see ""All-in costs - quarters""
(8) The Marikana PGM production includes the processing of 10,781 4Eoz, 18,949 4Eoz and 12,790 4Eoz third party concentrate purchases for the quarters ended
    30 September 2020, 30 June 2020 and 30 September 2019, respectively

(1) Operating cost is the average cost of production and operating cost per tonne is calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation
    and depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the tonnes milled/treated in the same period, and operating cost per kilogram (and ounce) is
    calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the gold produced in the same period
(2) All-in cost is calculated in accordance with the World Gold Council guidance. All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger and
    acquisition activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one time severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings. All-in cost
    is made up of All-in sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation, together with
    corporate and major capital expenditure associated with growth. All-in sustaining cost per kilogram (and ounce) and All-in cost per kilogram (and ounce)
    is calculated by dividing the All-in sustaining cost and All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total gold sold over the same period. For a
    reconciliation of cost of sales before amortisation and depreciation to All-in costs, see ""All-in costs - quarters""
(3) Corporate project expenditure for the quarters ended 30 September 2020, 30 June 2020 and 30 September 2019 was R8.5 million (US$0.5 million), R0.2 million
    (US$0 million) and R26.7 million (US$1.8 million), respectively

Figures may not add as they are rounded independently

(1) The US PGM operations' underground production is converted to metric tonnes and kilograms, and performance is translated into rand. In
    addition to the US PGM operations' underground production, the operation processes various recycling material which is excluded from the
    2E PGM production, All-in sustaining cost and All-in cost statistics shown
(2) During Q2 2020, sales were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, however Mimosa continued production of PGM concentrate that resulted in a
    build up of concentrate stockpile. A difference arose whereby the Mimosa 4Eoz sold during Q2 2020 were included as equal to the produced
    4Eoz in the Q2 2020 salient feature tables. The effect of this difference resulted in sold 4Eoz for Q 2 2020 being reported as 31,576 4Eoz
    compared to an actual of 12,953 4Eoz. The AISC and AIC per 4Eoz for Mimosa were reported as R8,741/4Eoz compared to R15,420/4Eoz due to the
    inventory change not adjusted in these calculations
(3) Cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation includes all mining and processing costs, third party refining costs, corporate general
    and administrative costs, and permitting costs. Corporate relates to the elimination of concentrate sales by Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum
    Mile to Marikana and the associated unrealised profit
(4) Inventory adjustment in Corporate includes the elimination of concentrate sales by Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum Mile to Marikana and the
    associated unrealised profit
(5) Share-based payments are calculated based on the fair value at initial recognition and do not include the adjustment of the cash-settled
    share-based payment obligation to the reporting date fair value
(6) Rehabilitation includes the interest charge related to the environmental rehabilitation obligation and the amortisation of the related capitalised
    rehabilitation costs. The interest charge related to the environmental rehabilitation obligation and the amortisation of the capitalised
    rehabilitation costs reflect the periodic costs of rehabilitation associated with current PGM production
(7) All-in cost is calculated in accordance with the World Gold Council guidance. All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger and
    acquisition activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one-time severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings. All-in
    cost is made up of All-in sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation, together
    with corporate and major capital expenditure associated with growth. All-in sustaining cost per ounce (and kilogram) and All-in cost per ounce
    (and kilogram) are calculated by dividing the All-in sustaining cost and All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total 4E/2E PGM produced in the
    same period
(8) The Q3 2020 and Q2 2020 by-product credit for Marikana includes the benefit from the sale of concentrate purchased from Rustenburg, Kroondal and
    Platinum Mile of R1,546 million and R128 million, respectively. The cost associated with the purchase and processing of the intercompany concentrate
    is included in the Marikana cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation

Figures may not add as they are rounded independently

(1) Cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation includes all mining and processing costs, third party refining costs, corporate general
    and administrative costs, and permitting costs
(2) Share-based payments are calculated based on the fair value at initial recognition and do not include the adjustment of the cash-settled
    share-based payment obligation to the reporting date fair value
(3) Rehabilitation include the interest charge related to the environmental rehabilitation obligation and the amortisation of the related
    capitalised rehabilitation costs. The interest charge related to the environmental rehabilitation obligation and the amortisation of the
    capitalised rehabilitation costs reflect the periodic costs of rehabilitation associated with current gold production
(4) All-in cost is calculated in accordance with the World Gold Council guidance. All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger
    and acquisition activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one time severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings.
    All-in cost is made up of All-in sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation,
    together with corporate and major capital expenditure associated with growth. All-in sustaining cost per kilogram (and ounce) and All-in cost per
    kilogram (and ounce) is calculated by dividing the All-in sustaining cost and All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total gold sold over
    the same period

Redemption of the US$450,000,000 1.875 per cent convertible bonds due 2023 completed

Johannesburg, 21 October 2020. Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW)
announced on 18 September 2020 that its wholly owned subsidiary, Sibanye Gold Limited
(the “Issuer”), had exercised its option in respect of its US$450,000,000 1.875 per
cent convertible bonds due 2023 (the “Bonds”) to redeem all outstanding Bonds on 19
October 2020 (the “Optional Redemption Date”) at their principal amount, together
with accrued but unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the Optional Redemption Date,
and an optional redemption notice was issued to all holders of the Bonds
(“Bondholders”) on 18 September 2020 (the “Optional Redemption Notice”).

Sibanye-Stillwater confirms that in response to the Optional Redemption Notice,
US$383,000,000 of the US$383,800,000 outstanding Bonds have been converted by
Bondholders. Pursuant to this conversion by Bondholders, 247,912,467 ordinary shares
of the Company (“Shares”) have been issued and listed on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange over the last two weeks, resulting in a total number of 2,925,001,704 Shares
currently in issue. The new Shares issued will rank pari passu with the existing
Shares of the Company in issue. The remaining Bonds, amounting to US$800,000, were
redeemed by the Issuer in cash at par value plus an accrued coupon, resulting in an
aggregate cash consideration of US$800,958.33 being paid to Bondholders.

“The successful early conversion of the Bonds concludes a key element of the funding
for the value accretive Stillwater acquisition concluded in May 2017. It materially
reduces debt levels and financing costs for the Group, improving our capital structure
and increasing our financial flexibility, allowing for a continuation of superior
returns to shareholders. We are delighted with the exceptional progress made by the
Group over the last three years and look forward to further improving our
sustainability whilst appropriately rewarding our investors”, Sibanye-Stillwater
Chief Financial Officer Charl Keyter commented.

Johannesburg, 16 October 2020. Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW)
is pleased to advise that the Delaware Supreme Court has issued its opinion on the
Stillwater Appraisal Action, affirming the favourable decision by the Delaware Court
of Chancery on 21 August 2019 to uphold the deal price of the acquisition of Stillwater
Mining Company (Stillwater) by the Group.

The action was brought by a group of minority shareholders (the Dissenting
Shareholders) of Stillwater, following the acquisition of Stillwater by the Group in
May 2017 for a cash consideration of US$18 per Stillwater share. The consideration
to the Dissenting Shareholders, which was equal to the original offer price plus
interest, was previously paid.

Group CEO Neal Froneman commented: ”We are extremely pleased with the affirmation by
the Supreme Court, which confirmed that we followed a process that was fair to all
stakeholders. This again validates our decision to oppose the action and protect the
interests of our stakeholders against spurious, opportunistic legal proceedings.”

Optional redemption notice issued to the holders of Sibanye Gold Limited’s
USD450,000,000 1.875 per cent convertible bonds due 2023

Johannesburg, 18 September 2020. Sibanye-Stillwater advises that its wholly owned
subsidiary, Sibanye Gold Limited (the “Issuer”) today, 18 September 2020, exercised
its option on its USD450,000,000 1.875 per cent convertible bonds due 2023 (the
“Bonds”) in line with    the terms and conditions (the “Conditions”) to redeem all
outstanding Bonds on 19 October 2020 (the “Optional Redemption Date”) at their
principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the
Optional Redemption Date. The current aggregate principal amount of Bonds outstanding
is USD383,800,000.00.

Holders of outstanding Bonds (the “Bondholders”) are entitled, in terms of the
Conditions, to each exercise a right on the redemption of the Bonds to convert the
Bonds into ordinary shares of the Company (the “Conversion Rights”). Bondholders are
expected to exercise their Conversion Rights and if all such Conversion Rights are
exercised, this will result in the issuance of up to 248,430,319 ordinary shares of
the Company, as previously approved by the shareholders. Should some Bondholders fail
to exercise their Conversion Rights, the Issuer will redeem the remaining Bonds from
its cash resources.

The redemption of the Bonds will further improve the leverage and capital structure
of the Group, and signifies the progress the Group has made since issuing the Bonds
in 2017 for the acquisition of Stillwater, as it concludes a key element of the
acquisition financing. Furthermore, the redemption of the Bonds eliminates interest
costs and related income statement revaluation costs and volatility, materially
reducing financing costs and outstanding debt.

Notification in terms of Section 45(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 – Approval of
intercompany funding to facilitate conversion of a USD200,000 convertible bond issued
by Sibanye Gold Limited

Sibanye Gold Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) (the “Issuer”) is the
issuer of the USD450,000,000 1.875 per cent convertible bonds due 2023 (current
principal value of USD384,000,000 outstanding) (the “Bonds”). Holders of outstanding
Bonds (the “Bondholders”) are entitled, under the terms and conditions of the Bonds
(the “Bond Terms”) to each exercise a right to convert the Bonds into ordinary shares
of the Company (the “Conversion Rights”) whether on the redemption of the Bonds by
the Issuer or otherwise on a voluntary basis from time to time by the issue of a
conversion notice to the Issuer.

Pursuant to the corporate reorganisation which was implemented in early 2020, the
Company became a guarantor in relation to the conversion and settlement of the Bonds
by the Issuer and furthermore undertook to deliver its shares to settle the Issuer’s
obligations under the Bond Terms. To facilitate this, the Company has entered into a
loan facility agreement with the Issuer, in terms of which it will fund any share
issues required to settle a conversion event under the Bonds (the “Loan Facility
Agreement”).

Following receipt of a valid conversion notice in respect of USD200,000 of the Bonds,
the Company will issue 127,967 ordinary shares to the Bondholder under the Bond Terms
to settle this conversion event and the relevant Bond will be cancelled.

Notice is hereby given that, in terms of the provisions of Section 45(5) of the
Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the “Companies Act”), and pursuant to the special resolution
passed at the general meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2020, the board of
directors of the Company (the “Board”) has adopted resolutions to provide financial
assistance to the Issuer by advancing loan funding to the Issuer in terms of the Loan
Facility Agreement, as required to settle conversion events under the Bonds from time
to time, including pursuant to the voluntary conversion notice received. This loan
funding constitutes direct and/or indirect financial assistance in terms of the
provisions of Section 45(2) of the Companies Act.

Having considered all reasonable financial circumstances of the Company in terms of
and pursuant to the provisions of Section 45 as read with Section 4 of the Companies
Act, the Board satisfied itself that:

 • immediately after providing the financial assistance referred to above, the Company
   would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test contemplated in Section 4 of the
   Companies Act
 • all relevant conditions and restrictions relating to the granting of such financial
   assistance by the Company contained in the Company's memorandum of incorporation
   are satisfied
 • the terms and conditions on which such financial assistance is to be given are
   fair and reasonable to the Company

    rhodium and gold, referred to as 4E (3PGM+Au), and in the US operations is principally platinum and
    palladium, referred to as 2E (2PGM)
3   The Group reports adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
    based on the formula included in the facility agreements for compliance with the debt covenant
    formula. For a reconciliation of profit/loss before royalties and tax to adjusted EBITDA, see note 8.1
    of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by
    dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue

The Group delivered solid operating results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (H1 2020),
with production from all the operating segments increasing year-on-year despite the challenges
and disruptions posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Along with significantly higher precious
metal prices received for the period, the operational results underpinned a robust financial
performance from the Group with record six-month adjusted EBITDA of R16,514 million (US$990
million) for H1 2020, 718% higher than for the comparable period in 2019, attributable profit
of R9,385 million (US$563 million) compared with a R255 million (US$18 million) loss for H1
2019. Normalised earnings of R8,845 million (US$531 million) and free cash flow of R10,921
million (US$655 million), facilitated continued delivery on our strategic imperatives,
specifically, ongoing reduction of debt and balance sheet leverage to 0.55x net debt: adjusted
EBITDA, well below our 1x internal target, and the resumption of cash dividends, with a R1,338
million interim dividend (US$79 million at US$/R16.97) declared based on the current shares
in issue.

The efforts to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic extended beyond our operations.
The economic and social devastation required an intensified focus on the social element of
our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategic pillar in order to provide critical
support to our employees and communities. The continued improvement in the Group safety
performance and the substantial financial and social assistance provided to employees and
their communities has complemented the operating and financial performance delivered during
the period. We committed over R1.5 billion in financial support to employees not at work
during the period and over R100 million committed to community and government support.

The continued improvement in Group safety performance for H1 2020 is noteworthy and achieved
in exceptional circumstances, with adjustment to protocols and distractions caused by COVID-
19 resulting in reduced levels of production in South Africa for a substantial portion of the
second quarter. Safe production milestones included the Group recording its first fatality
free quarter (Q2 2020) since Q4 2018, with the SA gold operations achieving a remarkable deep
level hard rock safe production milestone of 12.4 million fatality free shifts by the end of
H1 2020.

The US PGM operations reported 2E PGM production of 297,740 2Eoz which was 5% higher than
for H1 2019, with recycled production of 397,472 3Eoz 6% lower, primarily due to a global
slowdown of auto catalyst collections and deliveries and logistical constraints caused by
the global imposition of COVID-19 restrictions. Although the US Region was able to continue
operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic has resulted in further cost inflation.
Since March 2020, the Region has incurred approximately US$3 million in COVID-19 related
expenditure.

COVID-19 measures taken to reduce the number of people on site in response to COVID-19,
included suspending specific growth capital activities, largely associated with the Blitz
project. Given the delays caused by COVID-19 along with improved geological and geotechnical
knowledge gained as a result of new development and drilling, a review of the ramp up schedule
is being conducted. Early indications are that the Blitz project will be delayed by up to 18
months. Further detail will be provided once the study has been concluded. The Fill the Mill
project (FTM) is advancing according to schedule and within budget, with an annualised steady
state production run rate of 40,000 2Eoz expected from October 2020. This project is expected
to yield an NPV of over US$400m and an IRR of 124% at spot 2E PGM basket price.

4E PGM production from the SA PGM operations increased by 5% year-on-year to 657,828 4Eoz,
with the inclusion of the Marikana operations for the full six-month period offsetting lost
production due to COVID-19 disruptions. AISC of R19,277/4Eoz (US$1,156/4Eoz) were 46% higher
year-on-year, predominantly due to significantly lower production in Q2 2020 resulting from
COVID-19 related disruptions and the inclusion of relatively higher cost Marikana production
(due to entirely conventional production, which is higher cost relative to the significant
amount of lower cost mechanised production at Rustenburg and Kroondal and the cost of the
Marikana smelting and refining operations) which comprised 42% of production for the period
compared with 13% for H1 2019.

The integration of Marikana has continued to progress positively, with the Marikana operation
contributing R3,943 million (US$237 million) or 44% of total adjusted EBITDA from the SA PGM
operations for H1 2020. Identified annual synergies from Marikana have more than doubled from
initial estimates of approximately R730 million per annum, to an estimated annual run rate of
up to R1.85 billion in annual synergies by the end of 2020.

Production from the SA gold operations of 12,554kg (403,621oz) for H1 2020 was 17% higher
than for the comparable period in 2019, with AISC decreasing by 8% to R800,048/kg (US$1,493/oz)
compared to the same period in 2019, which was impacted by the AMCU strike across the managed
SA Gold operations (excluding DRDGOLD).

Gold production from the managed gold operations (excluding DRDGOLD), increased by 24% to
10,167kg (326,877oz) compared to the same period in 2019 despite the disruptions caused by
the national COVID-19 lockdown, largely reflecting the operational recovery post the AMCU
strike in H1 2019. The COVID-19 disruptions affected most of the April 2020 milling period
with a steady build-up from May into June. By the end of June almost 70% of the crews had
returned to work and were operating at slightly above planned efficiency levels. Despite
significantly lower production due to the COVID-19 disruptions in Q2 2020, AISC from the
managed SA gold operations decreased by 14% to R846,741/kg (US$1,580/oz) compared to the same
period in 2019. However, due to the COVID-19 disruptions, actual AISC remains well above our
AISC forecast that would be expected under normalised production conditions.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION
The Sibanye-Stillwater board of directors has declared and approved a cash dividend of 50 SA
cents per ordinary share (US 2.9466 cents* per share or US 11.7864 cents* per ADR) or R1,338
million (US$79 million*) in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2020 (“Interim dividend”)
(2019:nil). The Board applied the solvency and liquidity test and reasonably concluded that
the company will satisfy that test immediately after completing the proposed distribution.
Sibanye-Stillwater’s dividend policy is to return between 25% and 35% of normalised earnings
to shareholders. Normalised earnings6 is defined as earnings attributable to the owners of
Sibanye-Stillwater excluding gains and losses on financial instruments and foreign exchange
differences, impairments, gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, occupational
healthcare expense, restructuring costs, transactions costs, share-based payment on BEE
transaction (Rustenburg), gain on acquisition, other business development costs, share of
results of equity-accounted investees, all after tax and the impact of non-controlling
interest, and changes in estimated deferred tax rate. The Interim dividend declared equates
to 15% of normalised earnings for H1 2020, which is below the 25%- 35% pay-out range of our
policy but given enduring uncertainty around the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Board has
deemed this declaration as prudent under the current circumstances. The Board will review the
dividend at the end of the year.
The Interim dividend will be subject to the Dividends Withholding Tax. In accordance with
paragraphs 11.17 (a) (i) and 11.17 (c) of the JSE Listings Requirements the following
additional information is disclosed:
•    The dividend has been declared out of income reserves
•    The local Dividends Withholding Tax rate is 20% (twenty per centum)
•    The gross local dividend amount is 50 SA cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt
     from the Dividends Tax
•    The net local dividend amount is 40.00000 SA cents (80% of 50 SA cents) per ordinary share
     for shareholders liable to pay the Dividends Withholding Tax
•    Sibanye-Stillwater currently has 2,676,001,886 ordinary shares in issue
•    Sibanye-Stillwater’s income tax reference number is 9723 182 169


Shareholders are advised of the following dates in respect of the Interim Dividend:
Interim dividend:                                50 SA cents per share
Last date to trade cum dividend:           Tuesday, 15 September 2020
Shares commence trading ex-dividend:             Wednesday, 16 September 2020
Record date:                                     Friday, 18 September 2020
Payment of dividend:                             Monday, 21 September 2020


Please note that share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between
Wednesday, 16 September 2020 and Friday, 18 September 2020 both dates inclusive.

To   holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs):
•    Each ADR represents 4 ordinary shares;
•    ADRs trade ex-dividend on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): Thursday, 17 September 2020;

•    Approximate date of currency conversion: Monday, 21 September 2020; and
•    Approximate payment date of dividend: Tuesday, 29 September 2020

Assuming an exchange rate of R16.9689/US$1*, the dividend payable on an ADR is equivalent to
11.7864 United States cents for Shareholders liable to pay dividend withholding tax. However,
the actual rate of payment will depend on the exchange rate on the date for currency conversion.
* Based on an exchange rate of R16.9689/US$ at 24 August 2020 from IRESS. However, the actual rate of payment will

Sibanye-Stillwater Trading statement and Operating update for the six months ended
30 June 2020

Johannesburg, 14 August 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW) is
pleased to provide a trading statement and operating update for the six months ended
30 June 2020 (H1 2020 or the period).

The full financial and operating results for H1 2020 will be released on Thursday, 27
August 2020 at approximately 13:00 CAT (07:00 EST or 07h00 (MDT).), followed by a
conference call and webcast at 15:00 CAT (09:00 EST). Pre-registration is essential
for the conference call at https://www.diamondpass.net/5552512 while the webcast may
be accessed at https://78449.themediaframe.com/links/sibanye200827.html

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (JSE),
a company listed on the JSE is required to publish a trading statement as soon as it
is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial results
for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from the financial
results for the previous corresponding reporting period.

Trading statement for H1 2020

The Group advises that it expects an approximate 3,780% increase in basic earnings to
R9,385 million (US$563.1 million) or 351 cents (21 US cents) per share for H1 2020,
which compares with a basic loss of R255 million (US$18 million) or 11 cents (1 US
cents) per share reported for H1 2019. The Group expects headline earnings per share
(HEPS) of 350 cents (21 US cents) for the period, 404 cents (25 US cents) or 748%
higher than the headline loss per share of 54 cents (4 US cents) for H1 2019.

The expected increases in basic earnings and headline earnings for the period compared
to the comparative period in 2019 are mainly attributed to the following:
•   An improved operational performance from our managed SA gold operations, despite
    the adverse impact of the COVID-19 lockdown regulations on production volumes,
    with the AMCU strike significantly impacting earnings for H1 2019
•   The inclusion of the Marikana operations for the full six-month period, compared
    with one month for H1 2019
•   Significantly higher average precious metals prices for H1 2020
•   Depreciation of the rand relative to the US dollar, with the rand being on average
    17% weaker for the period at R16.67/US$

These increases were partially offset by foreign exchange losses, mainly on foreign
denominated debt resulting from the weaker exchange rate, the deferred tax credit,
which was recognised during H1 2019 at the US PGM operations due to a decrease in the
deferred tax rate, and the significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 lockdown
regulations on production volumes at our South African operations during the period.
This resulted in 54% of expected production volumes being delivered from the South
African gold operations over the quarter and 47% from the South African PGM operations,
partially compensated by pipeline depletion thereby reducing the shortfall in sold
ounces.
The translation of rand amounts into US dollar is based on average exchange rates of
R16.67/US$ for H1 2020 and R14.20/US$ for H1 2019. These exchange rates are provided
only as supplementary information.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed or reported on by Sibanye-Stillwater’s auditors.

All adjusted information disclosed above has been prepared for illustrative purposes
only and is treated as pro forma financial information by the JSE Limited. The
information is the responsibility of the Group's board of the directors and because
of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial position, changes in
equity, results of operations or cash flows. The Group will detail the relevant
adjustments used to arrive at the pro forma information when its half year results
are published.

Operating update for H1 2020 compared to H1 2019

The Group delivered strong financial results and a solid operating performance for H1
2020, with improved production across all the operating segments and higher received
precious metal prices for the period, considerably boosting Group profitability. This
was achieved despite the challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which, in
particular, severely disrupted the SA operations following the imposition of the
nationwide economic and social lockdown in South Africa in late March 2020.

Production from the SA gold operations for H1 2020 increased by 17% to 12,554kg
(403,621oz), largely reflecting the operational recovery post the AMCU strike in
H1 2019. 4E PGM production from the SA PGM operations of 657,828 4Eoz was 5% higher
year-on-year, with the inclusion of the Marikana operations for the full six-month
period offsetting lower production due to COVID-19 disruptions.

As announced on 23 March 2020, the US operations, after engaging local health
authorities in Montana, took proactive steps to reduce the number of people on site
and continued to operate largely uninterrupted throughout H1 2020. Mined 2E PGM
production of 297.740 2Eoz was 5% higher year-on-year with recycled production of
397,472 3Eoz 6% lower, due to the impact of COVID-19 on global auto catalyst
collections and deliveries.

Precious metals prices recovered strongly during Q2 2020 after an initial sharp
pullback in mid-March 2020, associated with the global imposition of COVID-19 related
economic and logistical restrictions. PGMs recovered most of their losses by the end
of H1 2020 and gold benefited from increased global uncertainty, rising steadily
throughout the period. As a result, average received metal prices for H1 2020, were
significantly higher than for the comparable period in 2019, with the average 2E PGM
basket price of US$1,837/2Eoz 43% higher year-on-year, the average 4E PGM basket price
received, 92% higher at R33,375/4Eoz (US$2,002/4Eoz) and the average gold price
received of R864,679/kg (US$1,613/oz), 45% higher than for H1 2019.

Due to the above factors the Group expects revenue of R55,019 million (US$3,301
million) for the period, which is an increase of R31,484 million (US$1,889 million),
or 134% higher than for the comparative period in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is expected
to be R16,514 million (US$990 million), 718% higher than for H1 2019 (R2,018 million
(US$142 million)).

As a result of this strong financial performance, pro forma net debt:adjusted EBITDA1
has declined meaningfully to 0.55x at 30 June 2020, from 1.25x at the end of H2 2019
and 0.75x at the end of Q1 2020.

This is well below our internal leverage targets, illustrating the Groups robust
    financial position and the clear benefits of Sibanye-Stillwater’s unique geographic
    and commodity diversification and timeous strategic growth. The Group is consequently
    well positioned for continued strategic delivery and the ongoing return of significant
    value to shareholders, in the form of meaningful total returns.

1   As per the covenant definition which includes 12 months rolling earnings


    COVID-19 update

    At the US PGM operations, the measures adopted by the Montana state and county
    authorities to manage the threat of the COVID pandemic have been practical and after
    following early actions taken to reduce the number of employees and contractors on
    site, the production impact of COVID-19 on the US PGM operations has been relatively
    limited from a production perspective. An increase in infections in Montana as the US
    reduces COVID related restrictions is possible, however the imposition of further
    operating restrictions is considered unlikely.

    As previously noted, severe production interruptions were experienced in South Africa
    during the first two months of the South African national lockdown, with a progressive
    ramp up in capacity permitted from May 2020 subject to COVID-19 workplace restrictions
    being applied.    Revised work arrangements allowing for greater social distancing
    continued to be necessary however, especially in the more congested labour-intensive
    environments, and a gradual, phased approach to the production build-up has been
    adopted, with between 70-80% of employees recalled by the end of H1 2020 and the SA
    operations likely to achieve optimal production levels in Q4 2020.

    Despite COVID-19 infections increasing substantially in the inland provinces during
    June and July and a high number of confirmed cases across the South African mining
    industry, we have not experienced undue pressure to suspend operations during this
    phase. This is ascribed to a number of factors including the early development and
    implementation of comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety protocols at our operations
    and other factors such as; recognition of wide-spread community transmission, our
    adoption of a phased approach to the production ramp-up, the readiness of public and
    private health services to cope with the pandemic and the imperative of sustaining
    economic activity to avert further social distress in the country.

    The initial risk-based framework that informed the application of the initial
    stringent three-week social and economic lock down and the subsequent two week
    extension appears to have been abandoned, with the Government subsequently adopting
    a more adaptive adjustment of the regulations and indefinitely extending the lock
    down, adding uncertainty to an already fraught environment.

    Considering the uncertain global economic outlook and unclear regulatory environment
    in South Africa at the beginning of Q2 2020, balancing the need for prudent management
    in order to ensure the sustainability of the Group, while at the same time
    acknowledging the difficulties facing our employees and communities in South Africa
    and attempting to provide appropriate financial, mental and emotional support, posed
    a significant challenge. Notwithstanding the uncertain outlook and heightened risks,
    significant efforts continue to be made by the Group to assist stakeholders and
    contribute to the national efforts to manage the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Contributions made by      Sibanye-Stillwater     during   Q2   2020   to   support   various
    stakeholders include:
    •   Financial contributions including approximately R1,500 million in wages,
        Unemployment Insurance Fund payments (UIF) and cash advances extended to non-
        working employees, pending payment of some claims made but not paid by the UIF
    •   Salary sacrifices by the Board and Executive management which were donated to the
    national solidarity fund of just over R2 million
•   Donations of approximately R21 million to COVID-19 national relief funds
•   Financial assistance of over R8 million provided to service providers and suppliers
    from local communities
•   Approximately 9,400 food parcels distributed to destitute communities, 20 water
    tanks donated to communities around Marikana without access to clean water and
    blankets and mattresses to local homeless shelters
•   Critical support to Government health care efforts including the donation of scarce
    personal protection equipment to the value of R2 million, approximately R3 million
    to sanitise local health facilities, old age homes, schools and taxi ranks and a
    contribution of approximately R1.8 million to assist with community tracing and
    screening
•   Approximately R41 million spent on the preparation and conversion of existing
    Company accommodation and hospitals to quarantine and isolation facilities, in
    order to assist local government by alleviating pressure on public health care
    facilities
•   Over R1 million budgeted          for   extensive    and   ongoing community       awareness    and
    education programmes

South Africa’s strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 now revolves around non-
pharmaceutical interventions, targeted social measures and restrictions on activities
that give rise to heightened levels of transmission in society while permitting
economic activity to the greatest extent that is prudent. The rate of new infections
has passed a peak in most provinces with a steadily declining trend now developing in
daily confirmed and active cases. This trend is mirrored at our operations, with
infection rates, particularly at our SA PGM operations declining substantially since
the peaks experienced in mid-July 2020. While it is envisaged that it will be necessary
to sustain current measures for a prolonged period to avoid a resurgence in COVID-19
cases, the likelihood of more stringent measures being re-imposed appears remote at
present.

At the end of July 2020, the SA PGM operations had achieved a production run rate of
between 70% and 75% of plan with the SA gold operations achieving a production run
rate of approximately 90% of plan. Supported by a better operational outlook than for
H1 2020 and with precious metals prices having recovered close to levels prior to the
global COVID-19 economic lockdown, the outlook for H2 2020 is positive.

OVERVIEW FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2020 COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2019
The Group had a strong start to the year, with the operating and financial performance for Q1 2020, materially better than for the
comparable period in 2019.

The US PGM operations reported an 8% increase in mined 2E PGM production relative to Q1 2019, reflecting the return to planned
production rates at the East Boulder and Stillwater mines, despite the difficult ground conditions which continued to impact the Blitz
project into Q1 2020.

The solid performance from the SA PGM operations continued, with 4E PGM production increasing by 59% year-on-year, driven by
the successful integration of the Marikana operation following the acquisition of Lonmin Plc in June 2019.

Gold production from the SA gold operations also increased by 66% as production normalised compared with Q1 2019, which was
impacted by the five-month AMCU strike.

Precious metals prices remained buoyant during Q1 2020, with palladium and rhodium prices reaching record levels, before falling
in late March 2020 as rising concerns about the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a general collapse in most
global markets, including precious metals. For the US PGM operations, the 2E PGM basket price averaged US$2,053/2Eoz for Q1 2020,
57% higher than for Q1 2019. Further depreciation of the rand provided an additional revenue boost for the SA operations, with the
average 4E PGM basket price of R33,192/4Eoz for Q1 2020, 94% higher year-on-year and the average rand gold price received 35%
higher at R795,323kg.

Group adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2020 was materially higher than Q1 2019, increasing by R10,324 million (US$666 million) to R11,132 million
(US$724 million), which alongside a reduction in net debt, resulted in net debt:adjusted EBITDA (ND:adjusted EBITDA) decreasing to
0.75x at quarter end, from 1.25x at the end of December 2019.

The Group is in a solid financial position, with leverage now comfortably below our 1x target and sufficient liquidity, despite the
temporary suspension of production at our SA operations in April 2020 in accordance with South African COVID-19 lockdown
regulations.

Given reduced dollar net debt, available liquidity including DRDGOLD increased to R18,315 million (US$1,026 million) at 31 March 2020, 
consisting of R16,357 million (US$916 million) cash on hand, R214 million (US$12 million) committed undrawn facilities and 
R1,744 million (US$98 million) of available uncommitted overnight facilities. Available rand RCF facilities were drawn down ahead of the
COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa as a precautionary measure. The US PGM operations continued to operate during Q2 2020
to date, and following amendments to the SA COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, the SA operations are rebuilding to an initial 50% capacity.
The Group has optimised working capital and increased liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to ensure an appropriately robust financial
position. The primary priority remains to lower the Group's net debt position further.

Following the market collapse in late March 2020, after an initial liquidity sell off precious metal prices recovered quickly.  
Basket prices remain elevated compared to the same time in 2019 with further depreciation of the rand continuing to
benefit revenues for the SA operations. The 2E PGM basket price has averaged approximately US$1,820/2Eoz for Q2 2020 to date,
with the rand 4E PGM basket price averaging approximately R33,950/4Eoz and the rand gold price averaging just over R1,000,000/kg
to date, which if sustained, will be positive for earnings and cash flow as the operational build up continues.

The future impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and as such guidance will be provided once we have greater certainty about the
operating outlook. For more information about our actions, announcements and response to COVID-19, please refer to

SAFE PRODUCTION
The intense focus on safe production at our operations and the implementation of medium- and long-term safety initiatives, which
are underpinned by the Zero Harm Strategic Framework, continues.

The SA gold operations achieved an unprecedented 11.5 million fatality free shifts on 6 May 2020, with over 620 days without any
fatalities. An overall improvement of 13% in terms of the Total Injury frequency rate (TIFR) compared with Q1 2019, is also encouraging.

The US PGM operations' safety performance also continued to improve with the Total Reportable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) for
Q1 2020, 25% lower than for the comparable period in 2019.

Regrettably, the SA PGM operations experienced four fatalities during the quarter, compared with two fatalities for the same period
in 2019. On 7 February 2020, Mr. Khulile Nashwa, a Winch Operator at the Rowland mine, Marikana operation, was travelling in the
haulage when a loco derailed and struck him. He was 49 years old and is survived by his wife and seven dependents. On 17 January 2020, 
Mr. Joao Abilio Silindane, a Rock Drill Operator at Bambanani mine, Kroondal operation, was fatally injured in a gravity-induced
fall of ground incident. He was 56 years of age and is survived by his wife and two dependents. On 20 March 2020, Mr. Emanoel
Kaphe, a Rock Drill Operator at Thembelani mine, Rustenburg operation, was fatally injured in a gravity-induced fall of ground
incident. He was 48 years of age and is survived by his wife and two dependents. The fourth incident occurred on 24 March 2020,
Mr. Rossofino Manhavele, a Conveyor belt operator at Siphumelele mine, Rustenburg operation, was found unresponsive lying in a
prone position at the bottom of the stairway next to the reef conveyor belt tail pulley on surface. Mr Manhavele succumbed to his
injuries on 30 March 2020 whilst still in Millpark hospital. He was 46 years of age and is survived by his wife and three dependents. The
Board and management of Sibanye-Stillwater extend their sincere condolences to the family and friends of these employees.

A principal focus at the operations continues to be on identifying and, rectifying safety hazards and verifying that adequate close
out has been achieved. In addition, ongoing monitoring of outlying working places in terms of risk score and/or compliance, remains
a key area of focus. The Critical Control Management journey stemming from detailed risk analysis process that we embarked on in
H2 2019 is also maintaining steady progress and is being addressed within the various discipline focus areas, as well as the overall
organisational health and safety strategy.

The safe start-up and subsequent production build-up, following the national lockdown in South Africa as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, will be a critical focus during the second quarter.

OPERATING REVIEW

US PGM operations
Mined 2E PGM production for Q1 2020 of 141,585 2Eoz was 8% higher than for Q1 2019. Production from the Stillwater Mine (including
Blitz) was 83,445 oz for Q1 2020, 3% higher than Q1 2019, while East Boulder (EB) delivered 58,140 oz, 17% higher than Q1 2019. Tonnes
milled for Q1 2020 totalled 347,528 tonnes, 8% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. PGM sales in March 2020 were affected
by a delay in refined metal released, resulting in sales for Q1 2020 of 91,975 2Eoz. This refined production was subsequently released
and sold during April 2020.

All-in sustaining cost (AISC) of US$894/ 2Eoz for Q1 2020, was 7% higher than for the comparable period in 2019, largely due to lower
production from Blitz and higher royalties and taxes as a result of an inflated realized PGM basket price (contributing US$37/ 2Eoz to
the variance).

The recycling operation fed an average of 28 tonnes of catalyst per day in Q1 2020, 9% higher than Q1 2019. High recycling feed
rates continued to increase with increased recycling receipts, as tonnes of catalyst received were 33 tonnes per day for Q1 2020,
60% higher than Q1 2019. Given significant receipts towards the end of the quarter and ahead of COVID-19 related restrictions,
recycle inventory approximated 815 tonnes. This has reduced to more normalised levels (200 - 300 tonnes).

Adjusted EBITDA of US$134 million (R2,059 million) at an improved adjusted EBITDA margin of 30% compares favourably to adjusted
EBITDA of US$104.6 million (R1,466 million) for Q1 2019, despite sales being lower than production for Q1 2020.

The threat of COVID-19 was managed in a proactive manner through the roll out of response plans and actions, as well as the
suspension of non-essential growth capital at Blitz. Despite these measures, a meaningful increase in mined 2E PGM production from
the US PGM operations is still forecast for 2020. Given the previously mentioned suspension of non-essential activities at Blitz, capital
expenditure is expected to reduce to between US$200 million and US$220 million for the year, approximately US$60 million less than
previously guided. Approximately 60% of this anticipated spend is growth capital in nature, including expenditure on the Fill the Mill
(FTM) project.

SA PGM operations
The SA PGM operations continued to perform strongly, with 4E PGM production of 418,072 4Eoz for Q1 2020, 59% higher than the
comparable period in 2019. Higher AISC of R16,745/4Eoz (US$1,089/4Eoz) year-on-year, reflect the change to toll processing at
Rustenburg, higher royalties and the inclusion of production from the Marikana operation with a higher average AISC, which was
absent in Q1 2019. 4E PGM sold of 522,843 4Eoz was 25% higher than 4E PGM production for Q1 2020, due to the sale of additional
ounces ahead of the COVID-19 lockdown.

4E PGM production from Rustenburg was 10% lower than Q1 2019 at 154,568 oz, due to a section 54 stoppage arising from the
Thembelani fatal accident and COVID-19 related production losses due to the operations being placed on care and
maintenance on 27 March 2020. Higher AISC of R18,255/4Eoz (US$1,187/4Eoz) was mainly as a result of lower production and higher
royalties. The significant increase (99%) in the average 4E PGM basket price from R16,582/4Eoz (US$1,184/4Eoz) to R32,958/4Eoz
(US$2,143/4Eoz), resulted in royalties increasing significantly, by R1,848/4Eoz (US$120/4Eoz) compared with Q1 2019.

4E PGM production from Kroondal of 53,458 4Eoz was 8% lower year-on-year, mainly due to the COVID-19 lockdown during the last
week of March 2020 impacting 4,649 4Eoz. AISC of R12,619/4Eoz (US$820/4Eoz), was 16% higher than the comparable period in 2019
primarily due to lower production and higher royalties.

The integration of the Marikana operation has proceeded smoothly. The Marikana operation produced 171,997 4Eoz and processed
8,068 4Eoz under existing purchase of concentrate arrangements in Q1 2020. The COVID-19 lockdown resulted in approximately
14,650 4Eoz lost production for the quarter. AISC of R17,128/4Eoz (US$1,114/4Eoz) was 2% lower than for Q4 2019, demonstrating the
cost benefits of synergies already realised.

Chrome revenue for Q1 2020 of R324 million was higher than the Q1 2019 chrome revenue of R304 million, despite the average
chrome price declining by 23% from US$167/tonne in Q1 2019 to US$128/tonne in Q1 2020, due to the inclusion of the Marikana
chrome tonnes.

Mimosa continued to perform steadily, reporting attributable 4E PGM production of 28,777 4Eoz with AISC of US$826/4Eoz.

The inclusion of revenue from the Rustenburg operation (deferred in Q1 2019 due to the change from purchase of concentrate to
toll treatment arrangement) and the Marikana operation (acquired in June 2019), together with the 94% higher average 4E PGM
basket price resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing significantly to R8,043 million (US$523 million) from R880 million (US$63 million) in
Q1 2019. This was also notably higher than the R3,823 million (US$260 million) adjusted EBITDA from Q4 2019, with the adjusted EBITDA
margin increasing from 39% for Q4 2019 to 51% for Q1 2020. Despite the pullback in PGM prices, as a result of ongoing depreciation
of the rand, the average basket price for Q2 2020 to date, has remained above R30,000/4Eoz.

The SA PGM operations have begun a phased build-up of production in line with the amended regulations in terms of the COVID-19
disaster management act. The initial phase involved the resumption of surface production and limited underground mining to
supplement surface material, with the subsequent build up to 50% likely to be achieved during May 2020. Following a review of 
non-essential capital expenditure, forecast capital expenditure for the year has been reduced by approximately R900 million to 
R2,200 million. Approximately 60% of the capital reduction is related to ore reserve development which was deferred while the 
operations were on care and maintenance and 40% on project and other capital.

Anglo Platinum Force Majeure 
On 6 March 2020, Anglo American Platinum (Anglo Platinum) announced the temporary shutdown of its converter plants and issued
shut down notices pursuant to a Force Majeure event.

On 5 May 2020, Anglo American Platinum announced that it had completed the repair of its converter plant Phase B unit and that
it expected to be fully operational from 12 May 2020, following which, force majeure to suppliers of concentrate will be lifted.

As a result of the completion of repairs to the Anglo Platinum converter plant, from 12 May 2020, Sibanye-Stillwater will resume delivery
of concentrate from the Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum Mile operations to Anglo Platinum for processing as per the original
agreements. The payment terms related to purchase of concentrate agreements and delivery terms of metals relating to tolling
agreements, shall resume as per normal for all concentrates delivered from 12 May 2020. In addition, Sibanye-Stillwater has agreed
a delivery schedule with Anglo Platinum relating to tolled metals that should have been processed and delivered during the
shutdown period. Delivery of these outstanding metal credits that were locked up as a result of the Anglo converter plant failure, are 
expected to commence during May 2020 with the majority of outstanding metal credits expected to be delivered by the end of July 2020.

SA gold operations
Gold production of 7,405kg (238,076oz) for Q1 2020 was 66% higher than for the comparative period in 2019, which was severely
impacted by the five-month AMCU strike that ended in April 2019. AISC of R741,858/kg (US$1,500/oz) was also significantly improved
compared with AISC of R914,590/kg (US$2,030/oz) for Q1 2019. Gold production (excluding DRDGOLD), increased by 82% year-on-year, 
from 3,326kg (106,948oz) to 6,059kg (194,801oz). Production was impacted by the seasonal factors (the return to work and
production build up after the December holidays) and operational disruptions caused by ESKOM power outages and the COVID
related lockdown which impacted production for the last week of March 2020. The Kloof operation was also affected by a fire at
Kloof 3 shaft, as well as seismicity that affected the Driefontein operation and limited access to higher grade production areas.

The return to more normalised production levels after the five months strike in H1 2019, coupled with the 35% increase in the average
gold price to R795,323/kg (US$1,608/oz) resulted in a R2,737 million (US$188 million) turnaround in adjusted EBITDA, from a loss of 
R1,611 million (US$115 million) for Q1 2019 to R1,126 million (US$73 million) for Q1 2020 at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%. The rand gold
price for Q2 2020 to date has averaged approximately R1,000,000/kg (US$1,680/oz), 26% higher than the average price for Q1 2020.
This has positive implications for earnings and cash flow from the SA gold operations as production continues to ramp up in
accordance with the amended COVID-19 regulations issued in terms of the Disaster Management Act.

As with the SA PGM operations, the build up to 50% is likely to be achieved during May. Capital expenditure for 2020 has been revised
downwards by R840 million to R2,500 million, with approximately 71% of the capital reduction related to ore reserve development
which was deferred while the operations were on care and maintenance, 10% on growth projects (Burnstone) and 19% on other
capital projects.

(1)  The US PGM operations' underground production is converted to metric tonnes and performance is translated into SA rand. In addition to the US PGM 
     operations' underground production, the operation treats various recycling material which is excluded from the statistics shown above and is 
     detailed in the PGM recycling table below
(2)  Production per product - see prill split in the table below
(3)  The Group and total SA PGM operations' unit cost benchmarks and capital exclude the financial results of Mimosa, which is equity accounted and 
     excluded from revenue and cost of sales
(4)  The average PGM basket price is the PGM revenue per 4E/2E ounce, prior to a purchase of concentrate adjustment
(5)  Operating cost is the average cost of production and calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation and change 
     in inventory in a period by the tonnes milled/treated in the same period, and operating cost per ounce (and kilogram) is calculated by dividing 
     the cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the PGM produced in the same period
(6)  All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger and acquisition activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one-time 
     severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings. All-in cost is made up of All-in sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current 
     operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation, together with corporate and major capital expenditure associated with growth. 
     All-in sustaining cost per ounce (and kilogram) and All-in cost per ounce (and kilogram) are calculated by dividing the All-in sustaining cost 
     and All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total 4E/2E PGM production in the same period

Figures may not add as they are rounded independently

(1)  Operating cost is the average cost of production and operating cost per tonne is calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation and 
     depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the tonnes milled/treated in the same period, and operating cost per kilogram (and ounce) is 
     calculated by dividing the cost of sales, before amortisation and depreciation and change in inventory in a period by the gold produced in the same 
     period
(2)  All-in cost excludes income tax, costs associated with merger and acquisition activities, working capital, impairments, financing costs, one time 
     severance charges and items needed to normalise earnings. All-in cost is made up of All-in sustaining cost, being the cost to sustain current 
     operations, given as a sub-total in the All-in cost calculation, together with corporate and major capital expenditure associated with growth. 
     All-in sustaining cost per kilogram (and ounce) and All-in cost per kilogram (and ounce) is calculated by dividing the All-in sustaining cost and 
     All-in cost, respectively, in a period by the total gold sold over the same period
(3)  Corporate project expenditure for the quarters ended 31 March 2020, 31 December 2019 and 31 March 2019 was R7.0 million (US$0.5 million), 
     R20.5 million (US$1.4 million) and R1.3 million (US$0.1 million), respectively. The majority of this expenditure was on the Burnstone project

Sibanye-Stillwater third update on impact of COVID-19 and Executive management
portfolio change

Johannesburg, 23 April 2020: Further to previous communiques regarding: 1) the
deferral of non-essential growth capital expenditure at the US PGM operations in
order to reduce employee numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) the suspension of
our South African (SA) operations in response to the initial nation-wide lockdown
announced by the President of the Republic of South Africa and 3) approval for limited
mining and processing at the SA operations, subject to the implementation of agreed
protocols to address COVID-19 related health and safety risks, Sibanye-Stillwater
(Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW) provides stakeholders with a further update.

As per the Amended Disaster Regulations announced by the SA Government on 16 April
2020, South African mines may now conduct operations at a reduced capacity of 50% of
normal production during the period of the lockdown, thereafter increasing productive
capacity as determined by the SA Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy.

Neal Froneman, Chief Executive of Sibanye-Stillwater commented: “We fully support the
measures taken thus far by the SA Government to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and
welcome the pragmatic approach taken to resume partial economic activity in the
industry whilst safeguarding the health of employees in line with the currently
available global and local health guidelines and protocols. This phased approach will
facilitate a managed and orderly return to safe production, which is necessary to
maintain the extensive contribution the mining industry makes to the national and
regional economies and to broader society, whilst minimising the prolonged health and
economic consequences of the pandemic for all our stakeholders”.

The safety, health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities is our
over-riding concern and, as announced on 20 March 2020, detailed protocols and
measures to manage the risks to employees and contractors of COVID-19 at our
operations had already been developed and were being implemented prior to the
nationwide lockdown.

The risk-based measures announced on 16 April 2020 to resume the prescribed levels
of mining activity include:

1. arranging transport for SA based employees from their homes in remote areas to
   their respective areas of work
2. rigorous screening and testing programs to be implemented as employees return to
   work
3. the provision of quarantine facilities for employees who may test positive for
   COVID-19
4. submission of data collected during screening and testing to the relevant authority

Sibanye-Stillwater fully supports these measures, which are aligned with our existing
COVID-19 mitigation protocols and plans and will be implemented accordingly as
underground production at the SA gold and PGM operations resumes over the course of
the next week or two.

As previously announced, the US PGM operations continue to operate with a reduced
workforce and Mimosa in Zimbabwe resumed operations under precautionary measures
agreed with the Government of Zimbabwe from 20 April 2020.



                                                                                      1
The future impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and forecasting the operating outlook
is complicated by uncertainty relating to the extent of the COVID-19 restrictions and
the rates at which production may resume at the SA operations beyond the current
lockdown period. As such we have decided to suspend previous operating guidance for
2020 until we have greater certainty. Guidance will be provided once we have more
stability and certainty.

Executive management portfolio changes
Following the completion of the Lonmin (now Marikana operations) integration into the
SA PGM portfolio Robert van Niekerk will move into a Group role heading up the
Technical Services function. Wayne Robinson has been appointed EVP: SA PGM operations
and will continue to build off the excellent base that was established by Robert and
his team.

“We have built a substantial and resilient business and the depth and quality of our
management bench provides flexibility and optionality. Wayne has significant
operational experience in SA hard rock mining, including gold and PGMs and will ensure
ongoing delivery and continuity as head of the SA PGM operations. Robert, with his
extensive experience will provide invaluable technical support across the Group and
drive best practice, technology and innovation and project functions, all of which
are core to our future success and relevance”, said Froneman.

Sibanye-Stillwater update on impact of COVID-19

Johannesburg, 25 March 2020: On Monday 23 March 2019, the President of the Republic
of South Africa (SA), Cyril Ramaphosa, announced a nation-wide lockdown for 21 days
effective from midnight on Thursday, 26 March 2020.

The nation-wide lockdown enacted in terms of the Disaster Management Act, is an
emergency protocol that requires South Africans to stay at home except those
individuals and businesses supplying essential services to the country. As a result,
Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW) has begun implementing measures
to place its SA gold and PGM operations under temporary care and maintenance and
subsequently facilitate the safe resumption of operations post the lockdown period.

This suspension of operations will adversely impact on production at the SA mines and
shareholders are therefore cautioned that production for 2020 may differ from previous
guidance. Further detail will be provided once there is greater clarity on the
possible production impact.

Sibanye-Stillwater preparations for Covid-19 and US PGM operations update

Johannesburg, 23 March 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW) is
a leading, global precious metals company. The Group employs over 80,000 people at
its geographically diversified operations in three countries and contributes
significantly to regional and local economies, and supports local communities and a
diverse supplier network in the regions it operates.

The spread of the Covid-9 corona virus outside of China was rapidly identified as a
significant risk and promptly prioritised by the Group in February 2020. The rapid
proliferation of the COVID-19 corona virus across the globe since then is
unprecedented, with many countries already enforcing previously unimaginable
restrictions to contain the spread and limit the impact of the virus.

The safety, health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities is
our overriding concern and every effort is being made to identify and minimise the
risks posed by the virus for employees and contractors, while ensuring the ongoing
continuity and sustainability of our operations at the same time.   A balanced
approach is necessary to minimise prolonged health and economic consequences of the
virus for all our stakeholders.

While we have currently had no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at our operations, we
are mindful of the heightened risk and role we have to play in arresting the spread
of this global pandemic. We have aligned our approach and efforts with guidelines
and best practices provided by the South African and United States Governments, the
World Health Organisation (WHO), and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. We
continue to engage with regulatory authorities, and industry bodies such as the
Minerals Council and the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), as well
as partnering with organisations such as The Employment Bureau of Africa (TEBA to
manage risks posed by migratory labour.

We are also engaging constantly with stakeholder representative bodies at
Government and community level, as well as labour representatives. It is at times
like these when leaders from all constituencies must stand together in the struggle
against the spread of this virus.

Our high level COVID-19 response

Our high level approach has been three pronged to manage the risks throughout the
organisation:

1. to develop and implement protocols, procedures and systems to measure and identify
   the risks
2. to develop and implement proactive measures to mitigate COVID-19 risks
3. in the event of an outbreak to ensure the health and safety of employees and to
   manage the consequences in a manner which least disrupts the operations


                                                                                    1
An executive Corona virus Steering Committee led by the Group Chief Executive Officer
has been established to provide regular oversight, guidance and counsel to a multi-
disciplinary Coronavirus co-ordination team.    The co-ordination team comprises of
representatives from our different operating regions, operating segments and business
units, and it meets daily to update plans in line with the dynamic information around
COVID 19. The team is responsible for the development and implementation of measures
to prevent the incidence and limit or spread of COVID-19 among the workforce, ensure
comprehensive and regular stakeholder engagement and develop business sustainability
and post COVID-19 recovery plans.

The Group has implemented high-level measures to contain and restrict the spread of
COVID-19 including:

•   Stakeholder communication and engagement
     - An extensive communication campaign to raise awareness about COVID-19 amongst
        employees and communities, and provide channels for consistent and relevant
        feedback
     - We have mapped a wide range of stakeholders linked to our business and begun
        engaging to ensure alignment with our protocols and identify possible ways in
        which we can collaborate to jointly minimise the risks. These include local
        health facilities; government departments (Health, DMRE and Home Affairs), SADC
        Embassies, Minerals Council and other mining companies; suppliers and local
        NGOs. We have also engaged private healthcare providers on collaboration
        possibilities such as private testing via Lancet as well as having key persons
        for case and disease management in medical schemes


•   Workplace hygiene
     - The nature of our business means that large groups of employees may gather in
        areas in the workplace. To that extent, we have put in place personal and
        workplace hygiene programmes to reduce this risk. This includes making soaps
        and other disinfectants available, screening of employees and contractors,
        adopting protocols around biometrics and enforcement of sick leave for
        employees who present with flu like symptoms
     - High-risk areas in the workplace and employee transport are cleaned and
        sterilised regularly
     - Appropriate PPE and sanitisers are being supplied and the use in all high-risk
        areas is mandatory


•   Travel restrictions
     - International and non-essential local travel have been banned and heightened
        approval processes for travel have been implemented
     - A mandatory 14-day quarantine period and screening has been implemented for
        employees returning from travel from high risk destinations


•   Remote work and limitation of direct engagement
     - Remote work and work from home protocols, where possible, are promoted and
        facilitated and direct meetings at corporate office and on site have been
        prohibited, with access strictly controlled and all visitors subject to the
        same screening and hygiene protocols as employees


•   Screening
                                                                                      2
    -   Employees returning from leave or business travel undergo mandatory screening
        to identify any possible risk of exposure and to determine travel patterns and
        contact points to enable an appropriate response in the case of an outbreak.
        Any employees displaying symptoms or who have travelled to high risk areas will
        undergo mandatory quarantine
    -   Agreement has been reached in South Africa with TEBA to screen all employees
        who migrate from neighbouring countries for testing at their borders of entry,
        thus reducing exposure risk
    -   Employee screening at Company managed facilities in South Africa is carried
        out regularly
    -   Pre-shift screening of employees and contractors in the US has been implemented


The COVID-19 situation is dynamic and continually evolving. Sibanye-Stillwater has
developed detailed plans to mitigate the impact of the virus and contain the spread
of any infections that may occur, as much as possible, should they occur. We are
monitoring the developing situation and continue to refine our plans on an ongoing
basis. Further information to address the COVID-19 threat will be announced as is
becomes applicable.



Possible impact on US PGM operations

In order to further proactively manage the COVID-19 threat at our US PGM operations
and comply with the added requirements of local health authorities, a decision has
been made to significantly reduce the number of people at our US sites, whilst
maintaining production from current operations.

Specific actions taken include:

•   demobilising contractors involved in growth capital activities
•   facilitating remote work for personnel that are not required on site
•   prohibiting face-to-face contact with external parties and restricting site access
    to employees


The Blitz project accounts for the majority of contract workers at the US PGM
operations and these decisions are likely to temporarily impact growth from Blitz in
2020 and delay the project’s development schedule. In addition, we have received a
force majeure notice from the manufacturer of the mills to be used in the expansion
of the concentrator. Further detail will be provided once we have concluded a full
impact assessment.

We are also making sure that these short-term disruptions do not impact longer-term
business plans while ensuring we are well-positioned to safely and efficiently ramp-
up operations in a timely manner once the worst of this global pandemic passes.

Our US PGM operations are a “critical infrastructure industry” as defined by the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, with PGMs essential components of many
chemical, medical and biochemical applications. This includes the use of PGMs in many
drugs used to treat a wide range of cancers, pacemaker electrodes, catheters, guides
for arthroscopic surgery and in self-rescuer masks used by first responders. Platinum
is also an essential catalyst in petrochemical plants necessary for energy production.
As the only primary PGM producer in the United States, we will endeavour to maintain
current production from our Stillwater and East Boulder mines, while maintaining
throughput through our Columbus Metallurgical Complex in order to provide PGM’s to

                                                                                      3
the critical sectors mentioned above. Aside from the Blitz project activities, our
other operations are largely unaffected by the aforementioned decisions.

Marikana operations to provide processing capacity to offset Anglo Platinum Force
Majeure

Johannesburg, 17 March 2020: Further to the announcement on 6 March 2020,
regarding the temporary closure of Anglo American Platinum Limited’s (Anglo
Platinum) converter plant at its Rustenburg Platinum Mines (RPM) processing
facilities, which led to Anglo Platinum declaring Force Majeure (FM) for a period
of approximately 80 days, Sibanye-Stillwater has subsequently assessed how best
to utilise spare PGM processing capacity at the Marikana operations and at the
Precious Metal Refinery in Brakpan (Marikana processing facilities).

Sibanye-Stillwater is accordingly pleased to announce that it has reached
agreements in principle, with Anglo Platinum regarding processing of all PGM
containing material produced from its Rustenburg and Platinum Mile operations
and approximately half of the PGM containing material produced from the Kroondal
operations, at its Marikana processing facilities for at least the duration of
the FM period. Prior to the FM declaration, PGM bearing concentrate from
Rustenburg was smelted and refined by Anglo Platinum under a toll processing
agreement while Kroondal and Platinum Mile PGM concentrate was subject to a
Purchase of Concentrate (PoC) agreement.

The terms of the revised processing agreements currently being finalised with
Anglo Platinum at the different operations include:

  1. The Rustenburg operations:
        a. PGM concentrate from the Rustenburg operations will continue to be
           smelted by Anglo Platinum on the same terms as the existing toll
           arrangement for the smelter portion, but thereafter, the resultant
           matte will be further processed and refined at the Marikana processing
           facilities.
  2. Platinum Mile
        a. Platinum Mile concentrate will be sold to and processed by the Marikana
           processing facilities for the duration of the FM period under the same
           terms as the pre-existing PoC agreement with Anglo Platinum. All
           benefits of the PoC agreement will accrue to Marikana.
  3.   The Kroondal operations
        a. The Kroondal operations currently operate under a Pool and Share
           Agreement (PSA) with Anglo Platinum with 50% of the profits
           attributable to Sibanye-Stillwater shareholders and 50% of the profits
           attributable to Anglo Platinum shareholders. For the duration of the
           FM period, 50% of the concentrate produced from the Kroondal PSA
           attributable to both parties will now be sold to and processed by the
           Marikana processing facilities under the same terms as the pre-
           existing PoC agreement with Anglo Platinum. All benefits of the PoC
           agreement for the 50% concentrate treated by the Marikana processing
           facilities will accrue to Marikana.
        b. The remaining 50% of the concentrate produced from the Kroondal PSA
           will continue to be sold to Anglo Platinum on materially the same
           terms and conditions as the pre-existing PoC agreement (delays in
           payment terms have been agreed).


                                                                                 1
Furthermore, it has been agreed that concentrate in respect of Platinum Mile and
the Kroondal PSA delivered up to 9 March 2020 will be sold to RPM in accordance
with the pre-existing PoC agreements.

The additional material planned to be treated at the Marikana processing
facilities will have no impact on forecast production from the Marikana operation
which is unaffected by the FM event.

Discussions are ongoing with Anglo Platinum regarding the timing of delivery of
refined metals from toll material from the Rustenburg operations which was in
process prior to the FM declaration, and due to be delivered in March, April and
May. Further detail in this regard will be provided in due course.

Neal Froneman CEO of Sibanye Stillwater commenting on the agreements said: “We
welcome the finalisation of these arrangements with Anglo Platinum, which will
largely offset the impact of the FM event on the Sibanye-Stillwater operations
and result in a minimal impact on the production outlook for the SA PGM
operations. It is also pleasing to note the way our management team has optimised
available capacity at the Marikana processing facilities, allowing us to minimise
the potential impact on our contractual obligations to our customers and reducing
the supply disruption caused by the unanticipated FM event.”

price increases due to the Anglo Platinum supply disruption.

Anglo Plats has indicated that its converter plant will be unavailable for at
least eight weeks, during which period the force majeure would remain in effect
and it would be unable to fully process the Rustenburg, Kroondal and Platinum
mile concentrate.

Sibanye-Stillwater has significant spare PGM processing capacity at the Marikana
operations and at the Precious Metal Refinery in Brakpan and will be assessing
how best to utilise this capacity.    We are engaging with Anglo Platinum with
respect to the various alternatives and will provide a further update once we
have clarity.

Early settlement of the Marikana Bulk tailings treatment projects metal purchase agreement,4 Mar 2020,"Early settlement of the Marikana Bulk tailings treatment project’s metal purchase agreement

Sibanye Stillwater Limited
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa
Registration number 2014/243852/06
Share codes: SSW (JSE) and SBSW (NYSE)
ISIN – ZAE000259701
Issuer code: SSW
(“Sibanye-Stillwater” or “the Group” or “the Company”)

Early settlement of the Marikana Bulk tailings treatment project’s metal purchase
agreement

Johannesburg, 4 March 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW)
advises that Western Platinum Proprietary Limited (“WPL”), Eastern Platinum Limited
(“EPL”) and Lonmin Limited (UK) (“Lonmin”) (collectively the “Purchasers”), now
subsidiaries of Sibanye-Stillwater and collectively known as the Marikana operations,
have entered into a Release and Cancellation Agreement (“the Release Agreement”) with
RFW Lonmin Investments Limited (“the Seller”) regarding the early settlement, of a
prior streaming agreement, on more favourable terms.

Salient Features:
•   Sibanye-Stillwater early settles, a long-term streaming facility at Marikana, with
    a current present value of US$81 million, for US$50 million in cash
•   The settlement will be funded through a new short-term platinum prepay facility,
    entered into with Merrill Lynch International (“Merrill Lynch”)
•   The transaction will extinguish a high cost, secured, long-term financing
    instrument, and replace it with a significantly lower cost, unsecured, short-term
    facility, providing operational flexibility for the Marikana operations and the
    ability to immediately market the now uncommitted Palladium and Rhodium metals to
    realize optimal pricing opportunities

Transaction
In May 2016 Lonmin entered into a streaming transaction (“Metals Purchase Agreement”)
with the Sellers whereby the Sellers made an upfront payment of US$50 million to WPL
to enable WPL to fully finance the Bulk Tailing Treatment (“BTT”) Project, which
involves the re-mining of certain tailings dams owned by WPL and EPL. In return the
Purchasers had to deliver to the Sellers a portion of the produced metal (Platinum,
Palladium, Rhodium, Gold, Ruthenium and Iridium) from the BTT Project. The volume
of metal delivered to the Sellers was calculated as a portion of the total metal
produced from the BTT Project with defined guaranteed minimum deliverable amounts on
a monthly basis at an agreed price that varied between 16% and 20% of spot prices.
Furthermore, the Sellers were granted certain security over the BTT Project assets
until such time as a minimum amount of metal had been delivered.

The Release Agreement sets out the terms and conditions upon which the Purchasers
have purchased the Seller’s entire interest in the Metals Purchase Agreement for an
amount of US$50 million to be settled in cash. The Release Agreement is subject to
certain conditions precedent, which conditions are anticipated to be fulfilled by 6
March 2020.

Rationale
The Early Settlement allows Sibanye-Stillwater to acquire the Seller’s entire interest
in the Metals Purchase Agreement for a purchase price of US$50 million which when
valued using spot PGM prices at 27 February 2020, would have an attributable value
of approximately US$81 million.
The Early Settlement has been financed using a forward PGM sale agreement (“Prepay”)
with Merrill Lynch whereby WPL will receive a prepayment amount of US$50 million
(approximately R 764 million) in exchange for delivering 72,886 ounces of Platinum over
the period June 2020 to December 2020. The deliveries are subject to a floor price of
US$700 per ounce and a cap price of US$1,050 per ounce. WPL will, on delivery, receive
from Merrill Lynch the difference between spot prices and the floor price, subject to
a maximum of the cap price. The funding is expected to be accounted for under IFRS as
deferred revenue. The delivery obligation under the Prepay amounts to approximately
10% of WPL’s, and 3% of the Group’s planned 2020 4E production.

Utilising the Prepay financing for the Early Settlement of the Metals Purchase
Agreement extinguishes WPL’s commitment to deliver approximately 62,000 6E ounces
over the next six years at an estimated price of approximately US$255 per ounce into
the Metal Purchase Agreement, effectively allowing Sibanye-Stillwater to replace the
high cost long term Metals Purchase Agreement, inherited with the Lonmin acquisition,
with a significantly more favorably priced short term Prepay facility. The Pre-pay
facility is linked to Platinum metal only, enhancing WPL’s flexibility to market and
sell Palladium and Rhodium metals, realising optimal pricing opportunities in the
current market. Furthermore, the Purchasers are released of all security obligations
to the Seller, with no additional security obligations associated with the Prepay.

Prepay financing
The Prepay financing is senior unsecured, with a guarantor group guaranteeing the
outstanding obligations. The guarantors are Sibanye Gold Limited, Stillwater Mining
Company Limited, Sibanye Rustenburg Platinum Mines Proprietary Limited and Kroondal
Operations Proprietary Limited.

Notice is hereby given that, in terms of the provisions of Section 45(5) of the
Companies Act 71 of 2008 (the “Companies Act”), and pursuant to the special resolution
passed at the general meeting of the Company held on 28 May 2019 (the “General
Meeting”), the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) has adopted a
resolution to guarantee the indebtedness of other members of the Group under the
Prepay, which guarantee constitutes the giving of direct and/or indirect financial
assistance to related- and inter-related companies and corporations of the Company
in terms of the provisions of Section 45(2) of the Companies Act.

Having considered all reasonable financial circumstances of the Company in terms of
and pursuant to the provisions of Section 45 as read with Section 4 of the Companies
Act, the Board satisfied itself that:
 • immediately after providing the financial assistance referred to above, the Company
   would satisfy the solvency and liquidity test contemplated in Section 4 of the
   Companies Act;
 • all relevant conditions and restrictions relating to the granting of such financial
   assistance by the Company contained in the Company's memorandum of incorporation
   are satisfied; and
 • the terms and conditions on which such financial assistance is to be given are
   fair and reasonable to the Company.

Small related party transaction
In terms of paragraph 10.7 of the JSE Listings Requirements (""Listings Requirements""),
the Early Settlement constitutes a small related party transaction as the Seller is an
associate (as defined in paragraph 10.1(b)(vii) of the Listings Requirements) of Sibanye-
Stillwater’s largest shareholder Gold One South Africa SPV (RF) Proprietary Limited (“Gold
One”) which held 16.25% of Sibanye-Stillwater, on the date the Release Agreement was
entered into on 24 January 2020 (and holds at 2 March 2020 12.26% of Sibanye-Stillwater).
The board of directors of Sibanye-Stillwater (""the Board"") is therefore required, pursuant
to section 10.7 (b) of the Listings Requirements to provide the JSE with written
confirmation, from an independent professional expert, that the terms of the Early
Settlement are fair insofar as Sibanye-Stillwater shareholders are concerned.

In this regard, BDO Corporate Finance Proprietary Limited was duly appointed as the
independent professional expert and has provided the Board with a fairness opinion
regarding the Early Settlement (""Fairness Opinion"") in which they have advised the Board
that they believe that the terms thereof are fair to shareholders.

The Fairness Opinion will lie open for inspection at the registered office of Sibanye-
Stillwater located at Constantia Office Park, corner 14th Avenue & Hendrik Potgieter
Road, Bridgeview House, Ground Floor (Lakeview Avenue), Weltevreden Park, 1709, South
Africa, for a period of 28 days from the date of this announcement.

Statement by Neal Froneman, Chief Executive Officer of Sibanye-Stillwater

The Group made significant progress delivering on all near-term strategic imperatives
during the course of 2019, significantly de-risking the business and in the process
establishing a solid base for the delivery of further value to stakeholders.
Most pleasing has been continued progress and improvement in safe production, with Group
safety for 2019 improving from the fatalities which significantly affected our SA gold
operations in H1 2018. On 27 January 2020, the SA gold operations achieved a significant
milestone of 10 million fatality free shifts over a 17-month period. This is an
unparalleled achievement in the history of our gold operations and in underground deep
level mining. Milestones like these illustrate what can be achieved when all stakeholders
work together and contribute constructively, and our appreciation goes to our employees,
their union representatives and the Department of Minerals Resources and Energy for their
invaluable assistance and input.
The consistent operational delivery from the SA PGM operations continued, despite the
integration and restructuring of the Marikana operation, the PGM wage negotiations, and
the impact of load shedding towards the end of the year. 4E PGM production of 1,608,332
4Eoz (including the Marikana operation for seven months since acquisition), was 37%
higher year-on-year, with 4E PGM production (excluding the Marikana operation) of
1,100,734 4Eoz above the upper end of annual guidance.
The US PGM operations reported 2E PGM production of 593,974 2Eoz which was in line with
the revised annual guidance. The operational issues which affected the East Boulder mine
and Stillwater West mine during 2019 were successfully addressed during the remaining
months in 2019, with both operations achieving normalised production run rates by year-
end.

The SA gold operations produced 29,009kg (932,659oz) (Including DRDGOLD) for 2019 and
23,427kg (753,194oz) (excluding DRDGOLD) for 2019. Normalised production run rates for
the reduced operating footprint at the SA gold operations were achieved during Q4 2019,
following the conclusion of the AMCU strike in April 2019 and a steady production build-
up.

The strike at the SA Gold operations which was initiated by the Association of Mineworkers
and Construction Union (AMCU) in November 2018, lasted approximately five months before
it was resolved in April 2019. The agreed settlement as in Sibanye-Stillwater’s favour,
with AMCU accepting the same three-year agreement, on the same terms that had been agreed
with the other unions six-months earlier. While the financial impact of the AMCU strike
was significant, we have consistently maintained that absorbing the strike impact was
necessary for us to re-establish respectful and more co-operative relations with AMCU.
The significant increase in the profitability of the SA PGM operations for H2 2019 is
further testament to the appropriateness of the decisions and position adopted during
the SA gold operations strike. The current three-year wage agreements have secured a
period of stability at both the SA gold and the SA PGM operations, which will facilitate


                                                                                                                                2
the optimisation of the operations and enable significant generation of value from these
operations for the benefit of all stakeholders.

The financial results for 2019 were significantly improved relative to 2018, despite
strike related losses incurred during H1 2019 at the SA gold operations. Group revenue
increased by 44% year-on-year to R72,925 million (US$5,043 million), driven by rising
precious metals prices and an improving or steady operating performance across the Group
during 2019, as well as the inclusion of the Marikana operations from June 2019 boosting
Group adjusted EBITDA for 2019 by 79% year-on-year to R14,956 million (US$1,034 million).
Group profit of R433 million (US$30 million) for 2019, improved significantly from a loss
of R2,521 million (US$191 million) for 2018, with H2 2019 profit of R604 million (US$42
million) offsetting the H1 2019 loss of R171 million (US$12 million). Group profit was
affected by various non-recurring and/or non-cash items, the most prominent for 2019
being a R1,103 million (US$77 million) gain on acquisition of Lonmin Plc (Marikana
operations), a R1,567 million (US$110 million) deferred tax credit recognised by the US
PGM operations and recognition of a R3,912 million (US$271 million) fair value loss on
the US$ convertible bonds, following the 258% increase in the Sibanye-Stillwater share
price during 2019, resulting in the bonds trading well above par value.
As a result of the strong operating and financial performance achieved in H2 2019,
progress on deleveraging the balance sheet has accelerated. Proforma net debt:adjusted
EBITDA (ND:adjusted EBITDA) reduced from 2.5x at 30 June 2019 to 1.25x at year end, well
below existing debt covenants and our 1.8x target for the 2019 year-end. Group leverage
should continue to decline naturally over the next two quarters as the adjusted EBITDA
from Q1 and Q2 2019, which were negatively impacted by the five-month strike at the SA
gold operations and the change from a Purchase of Concentrate (PoC) to toll processing
arrangement with Anglo American Platinum, fall out of the rolling total. If the run rate
that has been achieved over H2 2019 is sustained, our net debt to EBITDA ratio should
fall below 1.0x by mid-year. This is without considering the effects of reductions in
net debt that should be achieved through application of free cash generated to repaying
debt.
We are now highly confident about sustained deleveraging of the company’s balance sheet.
Moreover, with the balance sheet further de-risked, we are well positioned to resume cash
dividends during 2020 based on the current deleveraging trajectory and subject to current
commodity prices.

    primarily due to the inclusion of the Marikana (previously Lonmin) assets,
    acquired in June 2019
-   Ongoing successful definition drilling at the Blitz project, Stillwater Mine,
    at the United States (US) PGM operations yielded 2.0Moz of additional Mineral
    Reserves
-   Gold Mineral Resources at the South African (SA) gold operations increased by
    52% primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with the Kloof integration
    project, facilitating a decrease in cut-off grades
-   Exploration projects' advanced through the establishment of key partnerships
    including Aldebaran Resources Inc, Generation Mining Ltd and Wallbridge Ltd

Over the past six months, PGM prices, in particular palladium and rhodium have
increased significantly. Recent spot prices of palladium have exceeded US$2,500/oz
and rhodium US$11,000/oz, resulting in increases of more than 100% and 200% over
reported Mineral Reserve prices respectively. Both the Southern Africa (SA) and US
PGM operations are exposed to these movements, with the US PGM operations
predominantly palladium rich (78% of the 2E basket), and palladium and rhodium
constituting approximately 30% and 9% of the 4E basket at the SA PGM operations.
In addition, the Rand/US$ exchange rate, is currently trading at approximately
R14.90 further enhancing the profitability of the SA operations.

The substantial increase in the PGM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve base,
largely as a result of ongoing drilling at the Blitz project at the Stillwater
Mine in the US and the acquisition of Lonmin Plc, enhances the mine to market
strategy and positions the PGM operations to continue delivering value on a
sustainable basis. The inclusion of Lonmin's projects into the portfolio has
substantially improved both the greenfields and brownfields project pipeline,
providing the Company with significant development and growth optionality under
appropriate economic circumstances.

Subsequent to the substantial but necessary restructuring that took place in 2018
and 2019 the Mineral Reserve base at our SA gold operations has remained
relatively steady during 2019,. The significant growth in Mineral Resources, which
was largely driven by a forecast reduction in costs associated with the Kloof
integration project, is pleasing, and provides for optionality under an enhanced
metal price environment

Mineral Resources remain largely unchanged with mining depletions offset by
resource growth (+2,5Moz) at the Blitz section of the Stillwater mine. The growth
in Mineral Reserves was driven by further positive drilling results at the Blitz
section of the Stillwater Mine. Ongoing external audits by independent parties
have noted that Mineral Reserve tonnages may be marginally understated and grades
marginally overstated due to the addition of unplanned mineralised dilution during
stoping.   This is not deemed to have a material impact on estimated Mineral
Reserve ounces and further definition of unplanned dilution is currently being
investigated for inclusion in future Mineral Reserve estimates, including the
implementation of scanning technology in stoping operations.

The Altar and Rio Grande Mineral Resources remained unchanged, with no advance in
earn-in by our JV partner, Aldebaran Resources Inc. During 2019, Aldebaran
Resources Inc. drilled four holes at Altar totalling 5,416 m, discovering a new
Cu-Au-Mo porphyry directly under the QDM gold resource.

During 2019, Sibanye-Stillwater concluded an agreement with Generation Mining
Limited (Gen Mining) through which Gen Mining acquired a 51% interest in the
Marathon project and formed an unincorporated joint venture with Stillwater Canada
Inc., in exchange for a cash consideration of 3.0 million Canadian dollars (CAD)
and a 12.9% equity interest in Gen Mining. Gen Mining has an option to earn up to
an 80% interest through spending of $10 million and preparing a Preliminary
Economic Assessment within four years of the property acquisition date marked as
July 11, 2019.

Gen Mining published a revised Mineral Resource estimate for the Marathon deposit
dated 9 September 2019, and has also included additional Mineral Resources at the
Geordie and Sally deposits, which forms part of the greater Marathon Property. The
total PGM Mineral Resource of the Marathon project has increased from 4Moz to
5.5Moz. Due to the transaction with Gen Mining, the attributable reported Marathon
PGM and Cu mineral resources for Sibanye-Stillwater declined by 23% and 12%
respectively.

The Mineral Resources for the Denison PGM exploration project is included for the
first time. Denison project is a PGM exploration project on the Sudbury Igneous
Complex (SIC), approximately 30km to the west southwest of the town of Sudbury.
During 2019, Sibanye-Stillwater acquired the entire shareholding in Lonmin PLC,
including the Denison project, which was 100% held by Loncan, a subsidiary of
Lonmin. During 2019, Loncan entered into a binding agreement with Wallbridge
Mining whereby Loncan has appointed Wallbridge as the operator of the Revised
Denison Property to raise the necessary funding, implement the business plan and
manage the daily operations of Loncan.    Loncan has at the end of October 2019
issued Wallbridge with 20% of Loncan (Current Loncan shareholding is currently 80%
Lonmin and 20% Wallbridge).

The large increase in 4E PGM Mineral Resources was primarily due to the inclusion
of the Marikana assets (124.3Moz), which were acquired through the Lonmin
acquisition. 4E PGM Mineral Reserves at the Rustenburg, Kroondal and Mimosa
operations decreased by 1.4Moz, primarily as a result of depletion of 1.6Moz from
mining activities during 2019, partly off-set by 0.2Moz increase due to the latest
life of mine scheduling.

A thorough review of the historic (Sept 2018) 4E PGM Mineral Reserves at the
Marikana Operations, post the takeover of these assets by Sibanye-Stillwater in
June 2019, resulted in a decrease of 22.1Moz primarily due to:
   - Depletion of 1.2Moz from mining activities during 2019 (15 months Oct 2018 to
     Dec 2019)
   - Reduction of 1.1Moz due to an updated geological interpretation influencing
     design and scheduling.
   - Reduction of 1.5Moz due to the application of the economic evaluation
     process.
   - Removal of Mineral Reserves of 11.7Moz from operations on Care and
     Maintenance without the requisite feasibility studies in line with Sibanye-
     Stillwater's policy.
   - Removal of Mineral Reserves of 11.8Moz from projects below infrastructure
     which are not included in the life of mine.
   - Feasibility studies are currently being conducted on selected projects to
     confirm economic viability at current economic parameters which may
     positively impact future mineral reserve estimations.

-   The decrease was partially offset by:

    -   An addition of 0.3Moz included under the Marikana Mineral Reserves identified
        as a synergistic benefit.
    -   Sibanye-Stillwater has reported reserves on an attributable basis of 95.25%,
        increasing the total reported Mineral attributable Reserves by 4.9Moz in line
        with Group policy.

The increase in SA Gold Mineral Resources is primarily due to the use of lower
cut-off grades at the Kloof operation. The planned pay-limits at this operation
reduced due to cost savings realised from the Kloof integration project.    This
project is designed to close the unprofitable Kloof 3 and Kloof 7 shafts, and to
increase production at Kloof 8 and Kloof Main Shafts, which will result in
increased volumes and lower fixed costs.

The decrease in Gold Mineral Reserves can largely be attributed to:
   - Depletion of 0.8Moz from mining activities during 2019
   - Changes in the Mineral Resource model for the Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR)
     at Kloof 4 Shaft, which contributed to an overall decrease for Kloof of
     0.3Moz
   - Structural geology adjustments on the Carbon Leader Reef (CLR) at Driefontein
     5 Shaft, which resulted in geotechnical pillar adjustments and which
     contributed to an overall decrease at Driefontein of 0.5Moz
   - These decreases were offset by an extension of the Beatrix 4 Shaft Life of
     Mine (0.5Moz), where the operation has shown continued profitability
     following rationalisation in 2018.

The single largest impact on the Gold Projects Mineral Resources was the exclusion
of the attributable portion of the DRDGOLD underground resource at ERPM, following
the flooding of the underground workings, resulting in a decrease of 14.8Moz. In
January 2020, Sibanye-Stillwater exercised its option to increase its shareholding
in DRDGold to 50.1%.    This increase in shareholding will positively impact the
Company's attributable Gold Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in future
reporting periods. The other material impact was at the Kloof Below Infrastructure
(BI) Mineral Resources, which decreased by 4Moz due to an update in the estimation
model.   The estimation domains were adjusted in line with changes in the facies
for the EBA area, as well as constraining the estimate in the areas with a lack of
borehole information by using the Global Mean for simple kriging.

Mineral Reserves remained unchanged.

-   Corporate Governance

Sibanye-Stillwater reports its Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in
accordance with the SAMREC Code, the updated Section 12 of the JSE Listings
Requirements; and in consideration of the SEC Industry Guide 7, which is aligned
with the guiding principles of SOX. Recent amendments adopted by the SEC to
modernise the property disclosure requirements for mining registrations, which has
not come into effect fully yet, aligns closely with the requirements under the JSE
and SAMREC, and any non-compliance to SEC Industry Guide 7 is therefore considered
immaterial. The Altar, Marathon and Rio Grande Mineral Resources were originally
compiled under NI 43-101 guidelines but are deemed to be SAMREC compliant.

This Mineral Reserve and Mineral              Resource declaration represents a condensed and
consolidated summary of the full              Sibanye-Stillwater Mineral Resource and Mineral
Reserve declaration available in              the Group Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve
Report, which will be published                on 22 April    2020 and will be available at
www.sibanyestillwater.com


Guided by a commitment to best practice corporate governance, the statement has
been reviewed and confirmed by each segment's Technical Services.

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are estimates at a particular date, and
are affected by fluctuations in mineral prices, the ZAR/US$ exchange rate,
operating costs, mining permits, changes in legislation and operating factors.
Although all permits may not be finalised and in place at the time of reporting,
there is no reason to expect that these will not be granted.

All statement figures are managed by Sibanye-Stillwater with the exception of
those for Mimosa, the attributable portion for DRDGOLD and the US Projects.
Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves, and production
volumes are reported in metric tonnes (t).

Gold and Uranium estimates are reported separately from each other; therefore, no
Gold equivalents are stated to avoid potential anomalies as a result of year-on-
year metal price differentials.

The Southern African PGM Operations statement are reported as 3E PGM + Au, which
consists of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold. The US operations are reported
as 2E PGM, which consist of platinum and palladium.

The individual proportions of the reported PGM's are provided in the tables below.

Trading statement and operating update for the year ended 31 December 2019

Johannesburg, 14 February 2020:    Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SGL and NYSE:
SBGL) is pleased to provide a trading statement and operating update for the year
ended 31 December 2019. The comprehensive financial and operating results for the
six months and the year ended 31 December 2019 (H2 2019 and 2019 year respectively)
will be released on Wednesday, 19 February 2020.

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited (JSE),
a company listed on the JSE is required to publish a trading statement as soon as
it is satisfied that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that the financial
results for the period to be reported upon next will differ by at least 20% from the
financial results for the previous corresponding period.

Trading statement

A recovery in the Group operating performance in H2 2019 and increased contributions
from DRDGOLD and the Marikana operations, combined with a significant increase in
precious metals prices, boosted Group revenue by 44% year-on-year to R72,925 million
(US$5,043 million) for 2019, compared with R50,656 million (US$3,826million) for
2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 79% year-on-year to R14,956 million (US$1,034
million) for 2019.

The financial performance in H2 2019 was in stark contrast to the first half of the
year, which was significantly impacted by strike action at the SA Gold operations
and other operational disruptions. As a result of the improved operating performance
and sharp increase in precious metals prices in H2 2019, revenue for the period of
R49,390 million (US$3,386 million) increased by 110% from R23,535 million (US$1,657
million) for H1 2019 and 85% from R26,746 million (US$1,884 million) for H2 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for H2 2019 of R12,938 million (US$881 million) was 541% higher than
adjusted EBITDA for H1 2019 of R2,019 million (US$316 million) and 189% higher than
for the comparable period in 2018.

As a result of this strong financial performance, progress on deleveraging the Group
balance sheet has accelerated, de-risking the business and building a solid base for
future delivery of further. Proforma net debt:adjusted EBITDA has reduced
meaningfully to 1.2x* at 31 December 2019, from 2.5x the year before and well ahead
of our 1.8x target for the 2019-year end.

Shareholders are advised that the due to the factors listed below, the Group expects
to report a profit of R433 million (US$30 million) for 2019, which is a significant
improvement on the loss of R2,521 million (US$191 million) for 2018.

The improvement year-on-year primarily reflects, inter alia:
* significantly higher platinum group metals (PGM) and gold prices
* the inclusion of the Marikana operations for seven months, compared with zero
   months in the comparative period
* the inclusion of DRDGOLD for a full year, compared with five months in the
   comparative period
* a R1,103 million (US$77 million) gain on acquisition of Lonmin Plc (""Marikana
   operations"")
*   a R1,567 million (US$110 million) deferred tax credit recognised by the US PGM
    operations

These improvements were partly offset by:
* losses incurred by the SA gold operations due to the industrial action that ended
   in April 2019, followed by the subsequent ramp up to full production capacity
* recognition of a R3,912 million (US$271 million) fair value loss on the US$
   convertible bonds, following the 258% increase in the Sibanye-Stillwater share
   price during 2019, resulting in the bonds trading well above par value
* restructuring costs from the SA gold and Marikana operations

As a result, the Group expects to report basic earnings per share of 2.5 cents (0.2
US cents) for 2019, which is a 102% improvement on the basic loss per share of 110.4
cents (8.3 US cents) reported for the previous year. The Group expects to report a
headline loss per share (HEPS) of 40.2 cents (2.8 US cents), down 39.5 cents (2.7
US cents) or 5,643% compared with the HEPS of 0.7 cents (0.1 US cents) for 2018.
This is mainly attributable to the R1,103 million ($77 million) gain on acquisition
of Lonmin Plc being excluded from HEPS, but the fair value loss of R3,912 million
(US$271 million) on the US$ convertible bonds being included.

Normalised earnings1 which is more reflective of operating earnings, increased by
R3,797 million (US$263 million), to R2,360 million (US$163 million) from a R1,437
million (US$109million) loss in 2018.

The translation of the rand amounts into US dollar is based on average exchange
rates of R14.46/US$ for 2019, R13.24/US$ for 2018 and R14:69/US$ in H2 2019. This
information is provided as supplementary information only.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed or reported on by Sibanye-Stillwater's auditors.

All adjusted/normalised information disclosed below has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and is treated as pro forma financial information by the
JSE Limited.   The information is the responsibility of the Group's board of the
directors and because of its nature may not fairly present the Group's financial
position, changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will
detail the relevant adjustments used to arrive at the pro forma information when its
full-year results are published.

1 As per the covenant definition which includes 12 months of earnings from the Marikana operations

2 Normalised earnings excludes gains and losses on financial instruments and foreign exchange differences,
impairments, gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment, occupational healthcare expense, restructuring
costs, transactions costs, share-based payment on BEE transaction, gain on acquisition, other business development
costs, share of results of equity-accounted investees, after tax, and changes in estimated deferred tax rate

Operating update

The Group operational performance for the year ended 31 December 2019 was solid,
with the operational issues which affected H1 2019, largely having been addressed
by the end of the year. The consistent operational performance from the SA PGM
continued, despite the integration and restructuring of the Marikana operations and
the impact of load-shedding towards the end of the year. 4E PGM production of
1,100,734 4Eoz (excluding the Marikana operation) was above the upper end of annual
guidance. 4E PGM production of 1,608,332 4Eoz including the Marikana operations (for
seven months since acquisition), was 37% higher year-on-year.

The SA gold operations achieved normalised production run rates for the reduced
operating footprint during Q4 2019, delivering annual gold production of 753,194oz
(excluding DRDGOLD) and 932,659oz (Including DRDGOLD).
The US PGM operations reported 2E PGM production of 593,974 2Eoz which was in line
with revised annual guidance, following the operational issues which were experienced
at Blitz during H2 2019.


Results presentation

Sibanye-Stillwater will release its results for the six months and year ended 31
December 2019 on Wednesday, 19 February 2020 after 08:00 (CAT) and will host a live

Conclusion of S189 consultation process at the Marikana operations

Johannesburg, 16 January 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SGL and
NYSE: SBGL) advises that the consultation process with relevant
stakeholders in terms of Section 189A (S189) of the Labour Relations Act,
66 of 1995 (LRA), regarding the proposed restructuring of its Marikana
operation and associated services (previously Lonmin), as previously
announced on 25 September 2019, has been concluded.

The outcome of the S189 process, following consultations with stakeholders,
is as follows:
* Shaft 1B and a specific Sweeping and vamping project will continue with
  limited mining, sweeping and reclamation, until the end of December 2020
  - resulting in the preservation of 329 jobs, provided that the projects
  continue to be profitable on a three-month average period
* Job losses were reduced by identifying approximately 166 opportunities
  for affected employees to be transferred to other operations
* Approximately 1,612 employees were granted Voluntary Separation Packages
  (VSPs), 53 employees proceeded on normal retirement and natural attrition
  accounted for 259 employees
* Approximately 1,142 employees were ultimately retrenched and contractors
  were reduced by ~1,709

Sibanye-Stillwater CEO, Neal Froneman commented: ""We are pleased with the
outcome of the consultations with stakeholders, which despite the necessary
closure of some end of life shafts, resulted in the preservation of a
number of jobs. This will result in a more sustainable business which will
secure employment for the majority of the Marikana workforce for a much
longer period.""

Johannesburg, 10 January 2020: Sibanye-Stillwater is pleased to announce that it has
exercised its option to subscribe for additional ordinary shares of DRDGOLD Limited
(""DRDGOLD"") to attain a 50.1% shareholding in DRDGOLD (the ""Option Shares""). The option
was exercised on 8 January 2020 in terms of the DRDGOLD option agreement between Sibanye-
Stillwater and DRDGOLD, entered into on 22 November 2017 and approved by the DRDGOLD
shareholders on 28 March 2018.


The subscription price for each Option Share is R6.46 per share, payable in cash,
representing a 22.69% discount to the closing price of R8.35 per DRDGOLD share and a
10% discount to the 30-day volume weighted average traded price of DRDGOLD's shares, on
the JSE Limited (""JSE"") on the day prior to the date of exercise of the option, being
7 January 2020. The exercise of the option will increase Sibanye-Stillwater's holding
in DRDGOLD from 38.05% (265,000,000 shares) to 50.1% (433,158,944 shares).


It is anticipated that the Option Shares will be listed on the JSE on 22 January 2020.
DRDGOLD will continue to be listed on the JSE (Ticker code: DRD) with a secondary listing
on the NYSE in the form of American depository receipts (Ticker code: DRD).


Commenting on the exercise of the option, Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye-Stillwater,
said: ""By securing the majority holding in DRDGOLD, a leading surface mining and
processing company, we continue to create value for all stakeholders in line with our
vision. We are thrilled that the value of our initial shareholding has already increased
by 147% over 17 months.   The DRDGOLD team has a proven track record and has successfully
implemented the Far West Rand Recoveries project, having reached its 500 000 tonne per
month planned capacity for Phase 1. We look forward to further value creation as DRDGOLD
completes its detailed planning and possible implementation of Phase 2"".


This is a voluntary announcement by Sibanye-Stillwater as the exercise of the option
falls below the 5% threshold of the categorisation of transactions in terms of the JSE
Listings Requirements.
