DIVESTMENT BY SASOL CHEMICALS NORTH AMERICA LLC OF ITS 50% EQUITY INTEREST IN
GEMINI HDPE LLC

The board of directors of Sasol is pleased to announce that Sasol Chemicals North America LLC
(“SCNA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sasol, has agreed principle terms with INEOS Gemini HDPE
Holding Company LLC (“INEOS”) and a new entity to be formed by INEOS (“Newco”) to sell its 50%
membership interest in Gemini HDPE LLC (“Gemini”) to Newco (the “Sale”) for USD404 million
(subject to adjustment for cash, debt, working capital and other items ). Gemini produces and sells
bimodal high-density polyethylene based in La Porte, Texas, United States of America.

The Sale represents a further step in achieving Sasol’s strategic and financial objectives by accelerating
the focus on specialty chemicals and reducing net debt. Proceeds from the transaction will be used by
Sasol to repay near-term debt obligations.

Concurrent with the closing, the Company will have completed the restructuring of its existing debt
facilities and the security package in respect thereof, resulting in Sasol and its subsidiaries being
released from any existing security being provided in relation to Gemini (the “Refinancing”).

The representations and warranties being given by SCNA are general corporate representations and
warranties.

As disclosed in the Sasol financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by the
Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., the value of the net assets relevant to the sale is
USD 176 million (approximately R3 billion) as at 30 June 2020, which is net of the debt facilities
associated with the interest. The loss attributable to the net assets was USD 18 million (approximately
R290 million) for the year ended 30 June 2020.

The Sale between SCNA, INEOS and Newco will only be effective upon restructuring of the existing
debt facilities and the Company’s security package in respect thereof. Closing is anticipated to occur
by 31 December 2020.

The Sale is classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listing Requirements of the JSE.

SASOL BOARD COMMITS TO A 20% SACRIFICE ON NON-EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR BOARD FEES PROPOSED TO SHAREHOLDERS AT 2020 ANNUAL
GENERAL MEETING

In Sasol’s notice of the annual general meeting (AGM) scheduled for 20 November
2020, Sasol included, as special resolution number 1, a proposal to enable it to pay
the same fees to its non-executive directors (NEDs) from 20 November 2020 as
approved by shareholders at Sasol’s 2018 AGM. Without the approval of such
special resolution, the Company cannot pay any remuneration to the NEDs for their
services to the Company as its directors.

In view of the significant challenges still facing Sasol and in acknowledgement of the
erosion of shareholder value over the past two years, the Board has agreed to
commit to a sacrifice of 20% on the Board fees proposed for approval at the 2020
AGM. This fee sacrifice shall remain in place until a revised fee proposal is
considered by shareholders at Sasol’s 2021 AGM. The 20% fee sacrifice will apply to
the Chairman fee and the Board fee as set out more fully in special resolution 1 in
Sasol’s 2020 notice of AGM.

The Remuneration Committee will ensure that a review of the fees payable to NEDs
is carried out with the objective of ensuring that a new resolution on Board fees is
proposed to shareholders at the 2021 AGM.

previously communicated guidance of US$12,8 billion.

The LDPE unit, which uses ExxonMobil technology, has a nameplate capacity of 420 kilotons
per annum, making it one of the largest of its kind in the world. The LDPE unit is one of the
three LCCP plants that will form part of the Sasol/LyondellBasell Louisiana Integrated
Polyethylene joint venture. Production from the LDPE unit is an important milestone to ensure
the JV will be enabled to make a meaningful expansion into the U.S. polymers production
market.

All units which were operating prior to Hurricane Laura have returned to operation, with no
further operational impact from Hurricane Zeta.

LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX (LCCC) STATUS UPDATE, PRODUCTION
AND SALES METRICS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2020


LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX (LCCC) STATUS UPDATE

On 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall near Sasol´s Lake Charles
Chemicals Complex (including Lake Charles Chemicals Project) in Southwest
Louisiana. Sasol was making significant progress towards a restart of the LCCC
facilities, which had to be suspended as a precautionary measure due to Hurricane
Delta. Hurricane Delta made landfall on 9 October 2020.

Preliminary assessments indicated no further damage caused by Hurricane Delta, and
we are also pleased to report that our employees have safely resumed their duties . The
availability of sufficient industrial-level power from the local provider has resulted in the
commencement of a coordinated startup of the complex. The impact of Hurricane
Laura on the total net saleable tons of our North American Operations was
approximately 170 kilotons in quarter one of financial year 2021.

Seven chemical manufacturing units have returned to operation and all remaining units
which were operating prior to Hurricane Laura are expected to return to operation by
end October 2020. Commissioning activities of our Low Density Polyethylene unit have
resumed, and beneficial operation is still trending towards end October 2020.

Sasol will continue to support its employees and the local community impacted by the
hurricanes with relevant resources and assistance.

DIVESTMENT OF A 50% INTEREST IN SASOL’S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP)
BASE CHEMICALS BUSINESS AND THE CREATION OF A JOINT VENTURE WITH
LYONDELLBASELL

1.   Introduction and background

     The shareholders of Sasol (“Sasol Shareholders”) are referred to the announcement made at our
     November 2017 Capital Markets Day relating to our portfolio optimisation programme. Further Stock
     Exchange News Service (“SENS”) announcements released by the Company on 17 March and 18
     June 2020 confirmed our strategic ambition to focus on our Performance Chemicals business. In the
     March 2020 announcement Sasol set out its response plan, which included decisive action to reduce
     Sasol’s debt and an intention to reset Sasol’s strategy to improve long-term shareholder returns in a
     lower oil price environment. The June 2020 SENS announcement outlined the updated strategy
     (“Future Sasol Strategy”), a key part of which is to increase focus on specialty chemicals.

     As an integral part of the response plan and consistent with the Future Sasol Strategy, the Company
     has been assessing partnering options for its US base chemicals assets, situated at Sasol’s Lake
     Charles property in Louisiana. An extensive competitive process was followed to identify an
     appropriate partner that will enhance the benefits to be gained from the substantial investment in Lake
     Charles. Accordingly, Sasol Chemicals USA LLC (“Sasol Chemicals”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
     Sasol, has now entered into a suite of agreements and term sheets (“Transaction Agreements”) with
     a subsidiary and an affiliate of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (“LyondellBasell”) the effect of which is
     the disposal of a 50% interest in the LCCP Base Chemicals Business (as defined below) and the
     portion of the Lake Charles property from which it operates (“the Sale Land”), for a purchase
     consideration of US$2 billion (subject to closing adjustments) and the creation of a 50/50 joint venture
     in relation to those assets (together, with the other indivisible elements referred to in the Transaction
     Agreements, the “Transaction”).

     Further high level details of the Transaction are set out below. The Transaction constitutes a Category
     1 transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and, as such, requires the approval of more
     than 50% of the votes of the Sasol Shareholders present and voting at the general meeting. A circular
     will therefore be delivered to Sasol Shareholders in due course with full details of the Transaction.

     The Transaction will represent a significant step towards achieving Sasol’s strategic and financial
     objectives by materially reducing net debt, and catalysing a rapid shift towards the Future Sasol
     Strategy. The LCCP assets within Sasol’s US Performance Chemicals Business (as more fully
     described below) including the new Ziegler alcohol plant, ethylene oxide and derivatives plants, and
     the Guerbet alcohol plant, will be retained by Sasol. Sasol will also continue to have an integrated, low
     cost ethylene value chain at Lake Charles which will enable it to protect the profitability of the
     performance chemicals business. Following the Transaction, Sasol will continue to realise the core
     strategic and financial benefits of its capital investment in the LCCP.

2.   The Transaction

     Transaction structure

     The Transaction will result in the creation of a 50/50 joint venture with LyondellBasell in relation to the
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business and the associated land. Sasol will retain ownership and
     operatorship of the US Performance Chemicals Business, the other legacy base chemicals assets at
     Lake Charles, and the remainder of the Lake Charles property.

     This will be delivered pursuant to the Transaction agreements, through which Sasol Chemicals will
     dispose of a 50% stake in Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene JV, LLC (“LIP”), a newly incorporated
     subsidiary of Sasol Chemicals to LyondellBasell LC Offtake LLC, a subsidiary of LyondellBasell. The
     purchase consideration will be US$2 billion, subject to customary and ad hoc transaction-specific
     closing adjustments which are not, in aggregate, expected to be material. LIP will hold Sasol’s LCCP
     Base Chemicals Business, as well as the Sale Land. Equistar Chemicals LP, an affiliate of
     LyondellBasell, will be the operator of the business of LIP.

     The Transaction Agreements contain customary representations and warranties from Sasol
     Chemicals and LyondellBasell. If the Transaction is terminated due to, inter alia, breach by Sasol
     Chemicals, or failure to obtain Sasol Shareholder approval of the Transaction, and at any time during
     the six months following the date of such termination, Sasol Chemicals or any of its affiliates enters
     into an alternative transaction with a third party, there will be a break fee payable by Sasol Chemicals
     of US$40 million.

     Transaction scope

     Sasol’s LCCP Base Chemicals Business comprises the manufacture of ethylene and polyethylene
     products using the following assets at the Lake Charles property, and the marketing and sale of these
     products (together the “LCCP Base Chemicals Business”):

     -   The recently constructed ethane cracker, which produces ethylene from ethane feedstock and has
         a capacity of 1540 kilotons per annum (“LCCP Cracker”);
     -   The low density polyethylene (“LDPE”) plant, which has a production capacity of 420 kilotons per
         annum; and
     -   The linear low density polyethylene (“LLDPE”) plant, which has a capacity of 471 kilotons per
         annum).

     The LCCP Base Chemicals Business excludes the original ethane cracker, which has a production
     capacity of 460 kilotons of ethylene per annum (“Original Cracker”). This will be retained by Sasol
     together with the US Performance Chemicals Business, consisting of –

     -   the ethylene oxide value chain which consists of a new 300 kilotons per annum ethylene oxide
         unit and a new 100 kilotons per annum ethoxylation unit;
     -   the new Ziegler alcohol unit (140 kilotons per annum) which supplements the existing Ziegler unit
         (at the Lake Charles property;
     -   the new alumina unit (32 kilotons per annum) which supplements an existing alumina unit at the
         Lake Charles property;
     -   the new Guerbet alcohols (30 kilotons per annum) unit; and
     -   other Performance Chemicals units include a tetramerization unit producing 1-hexene and 1-
         octene, a linear alkyl benzene unit, paraffin extraction unit, and the hydrogenation unit producing
         LPA solvent.

     LIP will, pursuant to tolling arrangements set out in term sheets entered into as part of the Transaction
     Agreements, convert ethane feedstock into ethylene, and also convert ethylene into LDPE and
     LLDPE. Sasol will continue to use its 50% attributable share of ethylene production, together with
     ethylene produced by the Original Cracker, as feedstock for its US Performance Chemicals Business
     and its Gemini HDPE joint venture. Sasol will thereby preserve the benefit of ethylene producer
     economics for its retained business, and the ability to realise any further upside growth opportunities
     in future.

     Transaction timing

     It is expected that the Transaction will be implemented before the end of calendar year 2020
     (“Effective Date”), when the conditions precedent are expected to be fulfilled and the adjusted
     purchase consideration will be received by Sasol Chemicals in cash.

3.   The Partners

     The LyondellBasell group is one of the leading global producers of plastics, chemicals and refined
     products. The LyondellBasell group operates 22 olefins and polyolefins facilities globally with capacity
     to produce approximately 7.6 million tons per annum of ethylene, 5.3 million tons per annum of
     polyethylene and 5.5 million tons per annum of polypropylene as of December 2019. The majority of
     these production facilities are in North America. As of December 2019, and based on published
     capacity data, the LyondellBasell group ranked as the third largest producer of ethylene in North
     America, fourth largest producer of polyethylene in North America, and the largest producer of
     polyethylene in Europe.

     The partnership will provide substantial benefits to Sasol due to the partners’ recognised excellence
     in cost-effective operation of these type of facilities, their recognised track record in maximising upside
     potential and access to their extensive distribution network and customer base.

4.   Rationale

     The Transaction was agreed following a competitive process in which Sasol explored a number of
     potential constructs in order to determine which would realise the most value whilst protecting Sasol’s
     long-term strategic priorities. The intention was to generate significant proceeds to apply towards
     outstanding debt, while enhancing the benefits to be gained from the substantial investment in Lake
     Charles by partnering with a company with world class capabilities in commodity chemicals in the
     industry. Through this process it became clear that the proposal that offered the best combination of
     upfront and long-term value was that offered by the LyondellBasell group. Sasol believes that the
     Transaction has the following compelling benefits for its shareholders:

     -   Accelerated delivery on strategic objectives: Sasol will continue to have full ownership and
         operatorship of the US Performance Chemicals Business as well as the legacy base chemicals
         business, which helps provide an integrated value chain. This is consistent with the Future Sasol
         Strategy of increased focus on a global specialty chemicals portfolio. This portfolio has well-
         established capabilities and potential for long-term growth in a number of product categories
         including Ziegler and Guerbet alcohols, in which Sasol already has a strong market position. Such
         specialty chemicals products are expected to have a more resilient long-term demand outlook and
         higher return on investment than commodity chemicals;

     -   Reduced leverage: The Transaction is a critical part of Sasol’s response plan to reduce net debt,
         improve debt covenant compliance and enhance liquidity. As a result of this Transaction, net debt
         before lease liabilities, is expected to reduce materially from approximately US$10 billion to
         approximately US$8 billion, significantly improving Sasol’s financial position. Together with
         proceeds from other transactions, net debt will reduce by close to US$3 billion;
     -   Integrated value chain retained: The US Performance Chemicals Business will benefit from
         Sasol’s share of low cost onsite ethylene from the joint venture, and all ethylene from the Original
         Cracker. This access to low cost ethylene feedstock, as well as the original market and feedstock
         advantages of the investment in the LCCP, will help protect the profitability of the US Performance
         Chemicals Business;

     -   Well defined partnership with a proven operator: Sasol will continue to have substantial
         participation in the business as a joint venture partner. Clearly defined governance and onsite
         partnership arrangements with a world-class group that has significant global ethylene and
         polyethylene production expertise should create a strong platform for a highly productive
         relationship;

     -   Upside participation: The Transaction delivers immediate strategic and financial benefits, and
         Sasol will also continue to benefit from the ongoing value creation from the LCCP Base Chemicals
         Business, including the upside when the macroeconomic environment improves; and

     -   Growth optionality: Sasol will retain ownership of the remainder of the Lake Charles property and
         will be able to utilise vacant land to develop further facilities on the Lake Charles property. This
         provides Sasol with a solid base to grow its US Performance Chemicals Business. Sasol will also
         be able to secure further ethylene feedstock from future expansions (debottlenecking) of the LCCP
         Cracker to enable future growth of its US Performance Chemicals Business.

5.       Conditions precedent to the Transaction

         The Transaction is subject to the fulfilment of customary conditions precedent, by no later than 31
         March 2021, including:

     -       Approval by Sasol Shareholders of the ordinary resolutions necessary in order to implement the
             Transaction;
     -       Obtaining competition / anti-trust approvals in various jurisdictions; and
     -       Obtaining the consents or waivers of any person to enable the Transaction to be implemented, in
             particular consents required from key technology licence providers.

6.       Use of the Transaction proceeds and balance sheet outlook

         As outlined above, implementation of the Transaction will represent a significant step forward in
         delivering the Company’s response plan announced on 17 March 2020. Proceeds from this
         Transaction, in conjunction with proceeds from previously announced transactions and the progress
         in achieving short term cash savings measures, will make a meaningful and positive impact on Sasol’s
         financial prospects, principally as a result of the intended use of the Transaction proceeds to reduce
         Sasol’s debt. .

         Notwithstanding this progress, the Company continues to work towards a rights offer of up to
         US$2 billion in the second half of the 2021 financial year as the final step of the response plan. This,
         if implemented, would allow Sasol to operate sustainably within its covenant thresholds and so deliver
         on the Future Sasol Strategy. The amount to be raised in any rights offer and its timing remain subject
         to prevailing operating and market conditions as well as other initiatives, such as further disposals,
         that Sasol may implement. Any equity raising will also be aligned with the outlook for the Company
         under the Future Sasol Strategy. In light of the extended period before any rights offer takes place,
         the Company has terminated the standby underwriting arrangements that were put in place in March
         2020.

7.   Historical Financial information (unaudited)

     The value of the assets (fixed assets and working capital) comprising the LCCP Base Chemicals
     Business as at 30 June 2020, being the date of the last published financial information of Sasol, was
     R67,6 billion (US$3,9 billion). The loss attributable to the LCCP Base Chemicals Business for the year
     ended 30 June 2020 was R36,1 billion (US$2,3 billion).

     The historical financial information was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
     Standards and Interpretations of those standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards
     Board. The historical financial information and pro forma financial effects of the Disposal will be detailed
     in the Circular to Sasol Shareholders.

8.    Volume outlook

     Following the transaction the ownership and anticipated steady state production volumes of the
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business will be as follows:

       Production                       Future ownership        Steady state3 volumes

                                                                 [kilotons per annum]

     (1) Includes LDPE and LLDPE.
     (2) Sasol will have 50% of LIP volumes from the time at which the Disposal has been completed and the joint
         venture has been formed.
     (3) Steady-state volumes indicated are before any potential capacity upside from debottlenecking opportunities.

     As a result of the impact of Hurricane Laura there remains uncertainty about the near term outlook at
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business. A further update and additional outlook guidance for
     LCCP Base Chemicals Business will be provided upon release of the first quarter financial year 2021
     Business Performance Metrics results, scheduled for later in October 2020.

9.    Circular to Shareholders

      A circular containing full details of the Transaction and the proposed resolutions will be delivered to
      Sasol Shareholders with a notice of general meeting scheduled to be held on 20 November 2020.

10. Withdrawal of cautionary announcement

      Sasol Shareholders are referred to the Company’s cautionary announcement dated 17 March 2020,
      as well as the subsequent cautionary announcements, and are advised that full particulars regarding
      the disposals and the timing of the rights issue referred to in those announcements have been
     provided, caution is no longer required to be exercised by Sasol Shareholders when dealing in the
     Company’s securities.

Sasol Lake Charles Chemical Complex update

Hurricane Laura made landfall on 27 August 2020 near Sasol’s Lake Charles Chemical
Complex in Southwest Louisiana, and is one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit the
United States. Significant property and utility infrastructure damage has been experienced
across the region.

Sasol’s more than 800 Lake Charles employees are safe; however, hundreds of employees
have suffered significant damage to their homes and remain in temporary housing while utility
restoration and repair work is in progress. Sasol is assisting employees with home preservation,
essential supplies and financial aid. In addition Sasol is supporting the local authorities, utility
partners and citizen groups in community and infrastructure recovery efforts.

Sasol has completed damage assessments of the complex’s 14 manufacturing facilities and
associated utilities and infrastructure. While there was moderate wind damage to cooling towers
and some insulation and building damage, there is no apparent damage to major process
equipment, utilities or infrastructure. This will need to be confirmed once site electrical power is
completely restored and all systems are tested.

Removal of debris, repair work and startup planning continue on the site. Regular employee
work shifts have resumed, and several hundred contractors are working on site to expedite
readiness for startup.

The critical path for operational restart is the re-establishment of reliable external electrical
power service from Entergy, the regional power provider. The Sasol Lake Charles site is
currently partially energized. Entergy expects full load service, industrial-level reliability power,
to be available to Sasol and other industrial customers in the area by early-to-mid October.

Some site utility systems are currently online, with startup of the remaining utilities planned
before reliable power is enabled. Once Entergy declares reliable, full load power is restored,
Sasol will activate a coordinated startup of the site’s two ethane crackers, and derivative units.

The low-density polyethylene unit, the last of the Lake Charles Chemicals Project units to come
online, did not experience any significant storm impacts and commissioning activities have
resumed. The unit’s beneficial operation sequence will be initiated once the site is fully
energized.

Sasol has Atlantic Named Wind Storm (ANWS) insurance coverage for units under construction
as well as operating units.

Sasol’s progress toward securing a partner in its U.S. Base Chemicals business is far
advanced, and was not impacted by Hurricane Laura.

DISPOSAL OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BUSINESS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED

Introduction

Sasol refers its shareholders to the Stock Exchange News Service announcement of
29 July 2020, which informed the market that Sasol South Africa Limited (“SSA”), a
major subsidiary of Sasol, had signed an exclusive negotiation agreement with Air
Liquide Large Industries South Africa Proprietary Limited (“Air Liquide”) for the sale
of SSA’s sixteen air separations units and associated business located in Secunda.

Sasol is pleased to announce that negotiations with Air Liquide have been concluded
and a sale of business agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) has been entered into,
under which SSA shall dispose of its air separation business located in Secunda, (“the
Business”) to Air Liquide (“the Transaction”) subject to the suspensive conditions
outlined below.

Air Liquide is a world leader in gases, technologies and related services, and operates
in 80 countries with approximately 67 000 employees. Air Liquide has provided
technical and engineering support to Sasol in Secunda since 1979.

Description of the Business

The Business comprises the sixteen air separation units (“ASUs”), and related assets
with a combined capacity of up to 42 000 tons of oxygen per day, that provide oxygen
for Sasol’s fuels and chemical production processes in Secunda. The ASUs produce
various other gases utilised at Secunda, and rare gases sold externally. Employees
related to the Business will transfer to Air Liquide as part of the arrangement.

Subsequent to the Transaction, Air Liquide will supply various gases to SSA’s
operations under a long-term gas supply agreement (“Gas Supply Agreement”) with
an initial term of 15 years. It is anticipated that Air Liquide’s expertise would allow, in
coordination with Sasol, a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
associated with oxygen production over time.

In addition to the Sale Agreement and the Gas Supply Agreement, SSA and Air Liquide
(“the Parties”) have also concluded various ancillary service, lease and like
agreements (collectively “the Transaction Documents”). This includes an agreement
for Sasol to sell key utilities to Air Liquide, to enable continuous gas production.

Rationale for the Transaction
This Transaction forms part of Sasol’s expanded and accelerated divestment
programme announced on 17 March 2020. Sasol has identified the operation of the
ASUs and associated business by a third-party expert as an opportunity to deliver
upfront cash proceeds whilst also contributing to Sasol’s objectives of improved
efficiency and decarbonisation at the Secunda site.

Air Liquide has significant expertise in operating industrial-scale ASUs worldwide and
is expected to utilise this experience to deliver efficiency and reliability benefits for
Sasol. Air Liquide will work closely with Sasol to continue to leverage Sasol’s broad
expertise in site operations and optimally managing the integrated value chain. As Air
Liquide already owns the seventeenth ASU on the Secunda site, it is expected that
ownership and operations of the full air separation fleet will provide further gains in
operational efficiency. Improvements will be driven by a variety of factors including
advanced application of technology and technical ability, and potential future capital
investments by Air Liquide. It is expected that these improvements will position the
ASUs for more efficient operations under a rapidly evolving future environmental
landscape. Air Liquide will collaborate with Sasol in the development of our overall
sustainability roadmap at the Secunda site. We will provide more details on this
roadmap in the coming months.

Air Liquide will take full ownership and overall responsibility for managing the ASUs,
including all future capital and operating requirements, to maintain the agreed quantity
and quality of gases supplied to Sasol.

Total estimated capital expenditure of R8 to 12 billion would have been spent by Sasol
over the next 15 years. The ASUs require significant capital to sustain reliable
operations, as well as improved efficiencies to enable decarbonisation. This includes
an extensive restoration and sustenance program to ensure the ability to supply the
site in the longer term.

Terms of the Transaction

   a) Purchase Consideration

In terms of the Sale Agreement, the Parties have agreed that the purchase
consideration payable by Air Liquide to SSA for the Business shall be an amount of
approximately R8,5 billion (EUR148,75 million (to be settled in US Dollars at the
closing of the Transaction), plus ZAR 5,525 billion). The total amount shall be settled
in cash by Air Liquide following satisfaction of the suspensive conditions contained in
the Sale Agreement.

   b) Impact of Gas Supply Agreement (GSA)

The GSA will achieve common objectives of the parties through a long-term supply
agreement. The GSA enables the benefits of securing reliable oxygen supply for the
Secunda site into the longer term.

It is anticipated that the Transaction will result in additional cash outflow for Sasol of
approximately R650 million to R 1,2 billion per annum in real terms, over the term of
the agreement. This estimate is largely dependent on the energy efficiency benefits
which are achieved over time. Furthermore, potential further upside exists through the
joint execution of a GHG reduction roadmap.

   c) Other Significant Terms

The Sale Agreement contains warranties and indemnities which are standard for a
transaction of this nature as well as a typical material adverse change clause, which
allows Air Liquide to terminate the Sale Agreement before closing in the event that
certain defined material adverse changes occur before closing.

   d) Suspensive conditions to the Transaction

The Disposal is subject, inter alia, to the following key suspensive conditions:
    1.1. Approval by the Competition Authorities;
    1.2. Provision by Sasol Limited of a guarantee in favour of Air Liquide, as
         security for SSA’s obligations to Air Liquide under the Sale Agreement and
         selected obligations under the Gas Supply Agreement; and
    1.3. to the extent applicable, approval by the South African Reserve Bank of the
         implementation of the Sale Agreement and the Transaction Documents

     (collectively the “Suspensive Conditions”).

   e) Implementation and Effective Dates of the Transaction

The implementation and effective date of the Transaction shall fall ten business days
after the date on which the Suspensive Conditions are fulfilled or waived, as the case
may be, but will not be earlier than 1 December 2020.

Application of proceeds

The proceeds, net of associated tax obligations related to the Transaction, will be
utilised within the Sasol Group to facilitate repayment of near-term debt obligations.
Total tax obligations related to the Transaction are expected to be approximately R2,1
to R2,3 billion. The availability of the net proceeds for repayment of debt obligations
will depend on the final tax position of SSA.

Net asset value and profits attributable to the net assets of the Business

The value of the net assets of the Business was R5,6 billion at 30 June 2020. As Sasol
currently operates the ASUs internally, the only revenues which were made in relation
to the Business, related to external sales of rare gases (less than R100 million revenue
per year).

Categorisation of the Transaction

The Transaction is classified as a Category 2 transaction in terms of the Listing
Requirements issued by the JSE Limited (“JSE Listings Requirements”) and
accordingly does not require approval by the shareholders of Sasol.
Cautionary

This announcement does not serve to withdraw the cautionary announcement by the
Company on 17 August 2020 and shareholders of Sasol should accordingly continue
to exercise caution when dealing in the Company’s securities.

STATEMENT ON SASOL’S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS COMPLEX

On 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall near Sasol’s Lake Charles
Chemicals Complex in Southwest Louisiana.

Sasol activated its inclement weather protocols ahead of the storm at all affected Gulf
Coast locations in preparation for Hurricane Laura, with the primary concern being the
safety of our workforce, the protection of the environment and the integrity of our
facilities. Part of the response was to temporarily shut down facilities at Lake Charles,
Louisiana, as well as Greens Bayou and Winnie, Texas.

Sasol is supporting its employees in the impacted areas, assisting with temporary
housing, transportation and basic amenities for those affected by the storm.

The storm resulted in widespread electrical blackouts and other damage, preventing
Sasol from operating most utility systems. High voltage transmission line corridors
into the Lake Charles area are damaged, and the full assessment is still in progress
by a local power company. Sasol’s manufacturing facilities in Lake Charles remain
shut down.

Operations recovery crews at the Lake Charles site have started the damage
assessment process, and early reports indicate no apparent damage to process
equipment and no flooding damage experienced as a result of storm surge. The high
wind speeds caused damage to the cooling towers at the Lake Charles Chemicals
Complex.

Other Sasol manufacturing operations in the United States in Greens Bayou and
Winnie, Texas, were not impacted by the storm.

Start-up of the plants will depend on the availability of electricity, industrial gases, other
feedstocks and the restoration process. We are engaging with our customers and
suppliers regularly regarding the impacts on production.

Sasol has Atlantic Named Wind Storm (ANWS) insurance coverage for units under
construction as well as operating units.

Sasol will update the market as more certainty on the situation in Lake Charles is
obtained. We do not envisage that the hurricane will have an adverse impact on any
potential divestment transaction related to Sasol’s base chemical portfolio in the
United States.

AUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020 - Short-form announcement

Earnings performance

Sasol delivered a satisfactory set of business results for the first half of the year, driven by oil prices
averaging US$62,62/bbl and a solid production performance. During the second half of the year our
earnings was severely impacted by the sudden collapse in oil prices and the economic consequences
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The combined effects of unprecedented low oil prices, destruction of demand for products and
impairments of R111,6 billion resulted in a loss of R91,3 billion for the year compared to earnings of
R6,1 billion in the prior year. Within a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, our
foundation businesses still delivered resilient results with a strong volume, cash fixed cost and working
capital performance.

The 18% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil coupled with much softer global
chemical and refining margins negatively impacted our realised gross margins especially during the
second half of the year.

The LCCP delivered an improved earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) performance in the second half of the year of approximately R100 million (US$8 million),
despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. This compares to a loss before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation (LBITDA) of R1,1 billion (US$70 million) recorded in the first
half of the year.

Earnings were further impacted by R3,9 billion in additional depreciation charges and approximately
R6,0 billion in finance charges for the year as the LCCP units reached beneficial operation.

Our Energy business's gross margin percentage decreased from 43% in the prior year to 38% due to
the significant impacts of supply and demand shocks that led to lower crude oil prices and product
differentials. We expect that oil prices will remain low for the next 12 to 18 months as the impact of
COVID-19 becomes better understood. Oil markets also continued to remain exposed to shifts in
geopolitical risks as well as supply and demand movements.

Despite experiencing softer commodity chemical prices across most of our sales regions due to weaker
global demand and increased global capacity, our Base Chemicals and Performance Chemicals
businesses, including LCCP, reported increased sales volumes of 19% and 8% respectively, and
maintained robust results on certain products, ensuring a level of resilience in our cash flows.

Total cash fixed costs for the first half of the year were trending above 10% compared to the prior
period, however, in the second half, we significantly improved our total cash fixed cost performance
resulting in the full year cost remaining flat when compared to the prior year. This was largely
attributable to the implementation of our comprehensive response plan focusing on cash fixed cost
reduction and enhanced cash flow.
As a result our key metrics were impacted as follows:

-     Working capital managed to optimal levels achieving an additional benefit of R9,2 billion relative
      to our internal plans. This resulted in a historical low working capital ratio of 12,5% compared to
      14,8% for the prior year. Investment in working capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year;
-     Capital expenditure optimised by approximately R6,0 billion by deferring certain expenditure
      without compromising on safety and the reliability of our operations;
-     Loss before interest and tax (LBIT) of R111,0 billion compared to earnings before interest and tax
      (EBIT) of R9,7 billion in the prior year;
-     Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by 27% from R47,6 billion in the prior year to R35,0 billion;
-     Basic earnings per share (EPS) decreased to a R147,45 loss per share compared to earnings per
      share of R6,97 in the prior year;
-     Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by more than 100% to a R11,79 loss per share
      compared to the prior year; and
-     Core headline earnings per share(2) (CHEPS) decreased by 61% to R14,79 compared to the prior
      year.

1) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBIT for depreciation and amortisation, share-based
   payments, remeasurement items, movement in environmental provisions due to discount rate
   changes, unrealised net losses/(gains) on all derivatives and hedging activities and unrealised
   translation losses arising on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional
   currency. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Core HEPS as noted below, are useful measures of the
   Group's underlying cash flow performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and
   may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. (Adjusted
   EBITDA constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings
   Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma
   financial information as set out in the full set of audited summarised financial statements.)
2) Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings per share with certain once-off items
   (provision for tax litigation matters and LCCP cash fixed cost with limited corresponding gross
   margin), year-end close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects
   (exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up, and share-
   based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Year-end close adjustments include
   unrealised net losses/(gains) on all derivatives and hedging activities and unrealised translation
   losses arising on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currency in order
   to remove volatility from earnings from year to year. (Core HEPS constitutes pro forma financial
   information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in conjunction

Balance sheet management

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 18% to R42,4 billion compared to the prior year.
This was largely due to the softer macroeconomic environment during the first six months of the year
which was further impacted by the severe economic consequences from theCOVID-19 pandemic and
lower oil prices during the second half of the year, coupled with the LCCP still being in a ramp-up phase.
The decrease was partially negated by another strong working capital and cost performance from the
foundation business. Investment in working capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year due to
focused management actions, resulting in a working capital ratio of 12,5%. To create flexibility in
Sasol's balance sheet during our peak gearing period, we have successfully engaged with our lenders
to waive our covenants as at 30 June 2020 and to lift our covenants from 3,0 times to 4,0 times of Net
debt: EBITDA (bank definition) as at 31 December 2020. This provides additional flexibility, which is
subject to conditions, consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritising debt reduction
through commitments to suspend dividend payments and acquisitions while our leverage is above 3,0
times Net debt: EBITDA. We will also reduce the size of our facilities as debt levels reduce. Our Net
debt: EBITDA ratio at 30 June 2020, based on the revolving credit facility and US dollar term loan
covenant definition, was 4,3 times. The weaker Rand/US$ dollar exchange rate at 30 June 2020
impacted Net debt: EBITDA by 0,6 times.

During the year we secured incremental US dollar liquidity through a US$1 billion syndicated loan
facility for up to 18 months, and bilateral facilities (with a combined quantum of US$250 million) with
a tenure of two years. These facilities enhance our US dollar liquidity position during the peak gearing
phase as the LCCP ramps up. In the South African market, we have both bank loan facilities and an R8,0
billion Domestic Medium-Term Note Programme (DMTN) which was established in 2017. In August
2019, we issued our inaugural paper to the value of R2,2 billion in the local debt market under this
DMTN programme.

As at 30 June 2020, our total debt was R189,7 billion compared to R130,9 billion as at 30 June 2019,
with approximately R174,6 billion (US$10,1 billion) denominated in US dollar. Our balance sheet is
highly geared, requiring a reduction in US dollar denominated debt in order to achieve a targeted Net
deb t: EBITDA of less than 2,0 times and gearing of 30%, which we believe would be sustainable with
oil at approximately US$45 per barrel (in real terms). Through our comprehensive response plan we
have taken immediate steps to reset our capital structure by targeting to generate at least US$6 billion
by the end of 2021.

Our gearing increased from 56,3% at 30 June 2019 to 114,5% mainly due to remeasurement items
(39%) recognised, a weaker closing Rand/US dollar exchange rate (6%) and the adoption of the IFRS 16
'Leases' accounting standard (4%). Deleveraging the balance sheet is one of our highest priorities to
ensure business sustainability to position us for the future to deliver value to our stakeholders.

Consistent with our long-term commitment to return to an investment grade credit rating, we are
engaging with ratings agencies regarding the progress on our comprehensive response plan.

As at 30 June 2020, our liquidity headroom was in excess of US$2,5 billion well above our outlook to
maintain liquidity in excess of US$1 billion, with available Rand and US dollar based funds improving
as we advance our focused management actions. We continue to assess our mix of funding
instruments to ensure that we have funding from a range of sources and a balanced maturity profile.
We have no significant debt maturities before June 2021 when the US$1 billion syndicated loan
becomes due. In accordance with IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', the recent conditions
which underlie the covenant waiver requires an assessment of our debt maturity that resulted in a
further US$1 billion being classified to short-term debt at 30 June 2020.

Our net cash on hand position increased from R15,8 billion as at 30 June 2019 to R34,1 billion mainly
due to proceeds received from the US$1,0 billion syndicated loan as well as draw downs on the
revolving credit facility negated by LCCP capital expenditure for the year.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R35 billion. This includes R14 billion
(US$0,9 billion) relating to the LCCP and is in line with our internal targets.

In line with our financial risk management framework, we continue to make good progress with
hedging our currency and ethane exposure. For further details of our open hedge positions we refer
you to our Analyst Book (www.sasol.com).


Further cautionary announcement

Shareholders of Sasol (Shareholders) are referred to various cautionary announcements regarding the
expanded and accelerated asset disposal programme and the rights issue, the last announcement
released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 28 July 2020. Accordingly, Shareholders are advised
to continue exercising caution when dealing in the Company's securities until full terms
announcements on the disposal of the air separation units, the US Base Chemicals partnering process
and the rights issue are published.


Dividend

Dividend payments are an important part in our capital allocation framework. However, given our
current financial leverage and the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the Board
believes that it would be prudent to continue with the suspension of dividends. This will allow us to
continue to protect our liquidity in the short-term and focus on reducing leverage in order to create a
firm platform to execute our strategy and drive long-term shareholder returns. In addition, in
accordance with the covenant amendment agreement with lenders, we will not be in a position to
declare a dividend for as long as Net debt: EBITDA is above 3,0 times. We expect the balance sheet to
regain flexibility following the implementation of our comprehensive response plan.


Update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)
Ongoing focus as we ramp up all units to beneficial operation

At the LCCP, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity and bringing all the units to
beneficial operation. The LCCP continued with its exceptional safety record with a recordable case rate
(RCR) of 0,11.

After the ethoxylates (ETO) expansion achieved beneficial operation in January 2020, the alcohol
expansion and the alumina expansion, as well as the new Guerbet unit, achieved beneficial operation
in June 2020. As a result, 100% of the LCCP's Specialty Chemicals units are online, and 86% of total
nameplate capacity of the LCCP is operational.

The last remaining unit to come online will be the low density polyethylene (LDPE) unit, which was
damaged during a fire in January 2020. The unit is expected to achieve beneficial operation before the
end of October 2020. Some challenges in restoring the unit have resulted in a slight delay to the
previous market guidance of the end of September 2020. During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit
start-up, the ethylene produced by the cracker and destined for the unit is being sold to third parties.
As a result, projected earnings for the LCCP complex in this financial year will be impacted only by the
loss in the margin of ethylene to LDPE. In addition, the insurance claims process is underway, and the
first insurance proceeds have been received.

The overall LCCP cost estimate is tracking US$12,8 billion as per our previous guidance. The new ethane
cracker produced at an average rate of above 80% of nameplate capacity during the fourth quarter of
the year.

COVID-19 had a limited impact on the LCCP construction and commissioning activities during the
fourth quarter of the year, and mitigation plans are in place to minimise potential impacts going
forward. The close-out and demobilisation of the LCCP is progressing according to plan with the
remainder of the work limited to the removal of scaffolding. Site demobilisation of construction
equipment, infrastructure and services will be completed after the last unit achieves beneficial
operation. The people on site have reduced to less than 400 and follows the demobilisation plan. This
includes the LDPE restoration resources.


Board activities

The following change to the Board of the Company occurred after the publication of the Company's
Interim Financial Results on 21 February 2020:
- Ms KC Harper was appointed as Independent Director with effect from 1 April 2020.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Sasol will announce group financial results for the year ended 30 June 2020
(2020 financial year) that were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a
severe decline in crude oil and chemical product prices. The impact of the
weak macro-economic environment was partly mitigated by a strong cash cost,
working capital and capital expenditure performance.

Shareholders are advised that, for the 2020 financial year:
- The loss per share is expected to be between R146,75 and R148,15 compared
   to the prior year earnings per share of R6,97 (representing a decline of
   more than 100%);
- Headline loss per share is expected to be between R8,72 and R14,86 compared
   to the prior year headline earnings per share (HEPS) of R30,72
   (representing a decline of more than 100%); and
- Core HEPS (CHEPS**) is expected to be between R11,02 and R18,56 compared
   to the prior year CHEPS of R37,65.

Sasol’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(adjusted EBITDA*) is expected to decline by between 17% and 37% from R47,6
billion in the prior year, to between R30,0 billion and R39,5 billion. This
results from a 18% decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil
coupled with much softer global chemical and refining margins impacting our
gross margins adversely, especially during the second half of the 2020
financial year. The cash fixed cost performance for the second half of the
year improved markedly, partly offsetting the impact of lower gross margins.

The loss per share was as a result of the decrease in the adjusted EBITDA as
well as notable non-cash adjustments to earnings. The largest contributor
relates to impairments of a number of cash generating units following the
decline in the long-term macro-economic outlook, and the fair value impact
following the commencement of partnering discussions for our Base Chemicals
assets in the United States. Aggregate pre-tax impairment charges of
approximately R112 billion have been recognised in the 2020 financial year.

The impairments and fair value adjustments have impacted the reporting
segments as follows:
- Energy R12,5 billion across the portfolio;
- Base Chemicals R71,3 billion, primarily in the United States; and
- Performance Chemicals R27,7 billion, primarily relating to its share of
   ethylene producing assets in the United States.

Other non-cash adjustments include:
- Unrealised losses of R7,4 billion on the translation of monetary assets
   and liabilities due to the 23% weakening of the closing rand/US dollar
   exchange rate; and
- Unrealised losses of R4,8 billion on the valuation of financial
   instruments and derivative contracts.
- Depreciation of R3,9bn attributable to those Lake Charles Chemicals
   Project (LCCP) units that reached beneficial operation.
The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not
been reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors.

Sasol will release its Annual Financial Results on Monday, 17 August 2020,
for the year ended 30 June 2020. Given the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the associated restrictions placed on public gatherings, Sasol has
decided to pre-record its results presentation. Sasol’s President and Chief
Executive Officer, Fleetwood Grobler, and Chief Financial Officer, Paul
Victor, will present the results. The pre-recorded presentation will be
available     on    17     August    2020     on    the    following     link:
https://www.corpcam.com/Sasol17082020.

A conference call will also be hosted via webcast at 15h00 (SA) with Fleetwood
Grobler and Paul Victor to discuss the results and provide an update of the
business.    Please     confirm    your    participation     by    registering
online: https://www.corpcam.com/Sasol17August2020

* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting operating profit for
depreciation, amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement items,
change in discount rates of our rehabilitation provisions, all unrealised
translation gains and losses, and all unrealised gains and losses on our
derivatives and hedging activities.

** Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings with non-recurring
items, earnings losses of significant capital projects (exceeding R4 billion)
which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up, all
translation gains and losses (realised and unrealised), all gains and losses
on our derivatives and hedging activities (realised and unrealised), and
share-based payments on implementation of BBBEE transactions. Adjustments in
relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end are to remove
volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves
and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to
period. We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of the group´s
sustainable operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Core HEPS are not defined terms under IFRS and may not
be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of
Sasol. The adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
due to their nature, may not fairly present Sasol´s financial position,
changes in equity, results of operations or cash flows.

DISPOSAL OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED;
TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE AND FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


SALE OF AIR SEPARATION UNITS BY SASOL SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED

Sasol is pleased to announce that Sasol South Africa Limited (“SSA”), a Major
Subsidiary of Sasol, has signed an exclusive negotiation agreement with Air Liquide for
the sale of its sixteen air separation units located in Secunda to Air Liquide Large
Industries South Africa Proprietary Limited (“Air Liquide”). The proceeds will total
approximately R8,5 billion.

The air separation units, which have a capacity of up to 42 000 tons per day, provide
oxygen for Sasol’s fuels and chemical production processes in Secunda as well as
producing various other gases utilised at the site. Air Liquide will supply the gases to
SSA’s operations under a long-term gas supply agreement. It is anticipated that Air
Liquide’s expertise would allow, in coordination with Sasol, a targeted reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the oxygen production over the
coming years, which will contribute towards the GHG reduction for the overall Secunda
site.

Air Liquide has been present on the Secunda site since 1979, and already owns and
operates the seventeenth air separation unit, which was commissioned in January
2018. Air Liquide owning and operating the full air separation fleet is expected to
provide optimisation of management of the assets and energy efficiency benefits.

The transaction remains subject to further due diligence, finalisation of relevant
definitive agreements and associated internal and external approvals, including the
Competition Commission and the South African Reserve Bank. The parties aim to
negotiate final agreements by mid August, and a further announcement will be made at
that time. The transaction is currently expected to close within financial year 2021.

This transaction forms part of Sasol’s accelerated divestment programme as part of
Sasol’s comprehensive response plan announced on 17 March 2020.

RELEASE OF TRADING STATEMENT UPDATE

Our accelerated asset disposal programme is impacting the completion of our year-end
processes. We anticipate the release of a trading statement update early in August
2020.
FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Sasol refers to the SENS announcements released on the Stock Exchange News
Service (“SENS”) on 17 March 2020, outlining a comprehensive response strategy
designed to mitigate the impact of a lower oil price and COVID-19. The strategy
includes a cash conservation programme, an accelerated and expanded asset disposal
programme, as well as a potential rights issue of up to US$2 billion which remains
subject to the progress of other initiatives. A further SENS announcement was released
on 1 July 2020, updating investors on the progress regarding the asset disposal
programme.

Sasol shareholders are advised that implementation of the response strategy is
underway, the outcome of which may have a material effect on the price of the
Company’s securities. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to continue exercising
caution when dealing in the Company’s securities until full announcements on the
disposal of the air separation units, the asset disposal programme and the potential
rights issue are made.

The last remaining LCCP unit to come online is the Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)
plant, which was damaged during a fire in January 2020. Repair work to the unit is
ongoing and the unit is expected to achieve beneficial operation (BO) before the end of
October 2020. Some challenges were experienced in the completion of the restoration
process, resulting in a slight delay to the previous market guidance of a BO date before
September 2020.

Overall project completion was at 99% and capital expenditure amounted to
US$12,7bn.

SASOL’S GUERBET UNIT AT LAKE CHARLES ACHIEVES BENEFICIAL
OPERATION

Sasol is pleased to announce that the Guerbet alcohols unit at the Lake Charles
Chemicals Project (“LCCP”) achieved beneficial operation on 19 June 2020. The new
Guerbet unit is Sasol’s second Guerbet alcohol production site, with the other located in
Brunsbuettel, Germany. This means that 100 percent of LCCP’s specialty chemicals
units are now online, and that 86 percent of total nameplate capacity of LCCP is
operational. The Guerbet unit is the sixth LCCP production unit to be brought into
production, and has a nameplate capacity of 30 000 tons per year, using Sasol’s
proprietary technology.

The LCCP Ziegler unit, which achieved beneficial operation on 16 June 2020, is an
extension of the existing Ziegler plant in Lake Charles and adds to existing Ziegler
capacity from Brunsbuettel in Germany. It is the largest of its kind in the world, adding
nameplate capacity of 173 000 tons per year of alcohol and 32 000 tons per year of
alumina. The Ziegler unit is the most technically complex of the units in the LCCP and is
also based on Sasol’s proprietary technology.

The last remaining unit to come online at LCCP will be the low density polyethylene
(LDPE) plant, which was damaged during a fire in January 2020. This is on track for
beneficial operation by the end of September 2020, as per previous guidance. At the
end of May 2020, the LCCP capital expenditure was tracking the previously
communicated guidance of US$12,8 billion.

SASOL UPDATE ON RESPONSE TO OIL PRICE VOLATILITY AND COVID-19
PANDEMIC

Sasol continues to make significant progress on the response plan measures
announced on 17 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, to address the impacts of oil price
volatility and the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19).

The situation remains highly dynamic, but as lockdown regulations are eased in South
Africa and elsewhere, Sasol is now ramping up operations whilst taking action to ensure
the safety of employees and service providers.

This announcement includes the following:
         - Operational performance update
         - Covenant update
         - Status on financial position
         - Future positioning of Sasol
         - Change in Director’s executive responsibilities and new Group Executive
            Committee structure

OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE UPDATE

As previously communicated an unprecedented decrease in fuel demand in South
Africa as a result of COVID-19 resulted in us reducing our production rates at Secunda
Synfuels Operations (SSO) and suspending production at the Natref Refinery in
Sasolburg, in a joint decision with Sasol’s partner, Total South Africa.

Sasol used this period of lower production to bring forward its planned September 2020
maintenance shutdown at SSO. This shutdown was successfully completed in May
2020 and ensures production will be uninterrupted for the remainder of the calendar
year. Similarly, maintenance work planned for later during calendar year 2020 at Natref
was successfully completed during the lockdown period.

Since the lockdown restrictions in South Africa were eased on 1 June 2020, SSO has
ramped up production, and Natref is expected to start production by the end of June
2020 and will ramp up to full capacity as jet fuel demand resumes. The ammonia, nitric
acid and chlor-vinyl plants in Sasolburg also started up in May 2020.
Outside South Africa, Sasol’s operations are performing to plan. Oryx GTL’s train 1
came back into operation at the beginning of June 2020, and train 2 is expected to be
back in production in the second quarter of financial year 2021 following the extended
planned shutdown of the plant.

Sasol previously guided the beneficial operation of the Ziegler and Guerbet units at the
Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) by end June 2020 and is pleased to announce
that the Ziegler unit achieved beneficial operation on 16 June 2020 and the Guerbet
unit’s beneficial operation is imminent. Remediation work on the low density
polyethylene (LDPE) unit is progressing according to plan, and we expect to bring this
unit into production before the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2020.

COVENANT UPDATE

Sasol is pleased to announce the successful conclusion of discussions with lenders
regarding increased balance sheet flexibility in the context of COVID-19 impacts and
market volatility. Our lenders have agreed to waive the covenant at June 2020 and lift
the December 2020 covenant from 3 times to 4 times Net Debt : Earnings Before
Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA).

This additional flexibility is subject to conditions which are customary for such covenant
amendments and consistent with Sasol’s broader capital allocation framework. These
include provisions to prioritise debt reduction at this time, such as commitments that
there will be no dividend payments nor acquisitions while Sasol’s leverage is above 3
times Net Debt : EBITDA. Sasol will also reduce the size of its facilities as debt levels
are reduced, whilst continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position.

In conjunction with these amendments and in light of Sasol’s two notch credit rating
downgrade earlier this year, the interest costs across Sasol’s debt facilities will increase
by approximately US$40 million per annum, before any reduction in borrowings through
any self-help measures or disposals. The applicable interest rate will reduce in the event
that Sasol’s credit rating improves.

UPDATE ON FINANCIAL POSITION

Management continues to progress with the execution of its crude oil hedging
programme for financial year 2021. For quarter 1 financial year 2021, approximately
80% of Synfuels’ liquid fuels exposure was hedged, translating to 6 million barrels. This
consists of 2,5 million barrels of zero cost collars at a put strike price of US$31 per
barrel and a call strike price of US$39 per barrel, and 3,5 million barrels of put options at
an average net strike price of US$37 per barrel. Oil hedges for the remainder of
financial year 2021 are in progress with 2 million barrels using put options hedged at an
average net strike price of US$30 per barrel and 0,5 million barrels hedged using zero
cost collars at a put strike of US$36 per barrel and a call strike of US$45 per barrel.
These oil hedges will significantly protect liquidity during the forthcoming months

Sasol made significant progress with the implementation of its self-help measures as
communicated on 17 March and 23 April 2020. For financial year 2020 Sasol is well on
track to achieve the targets set, whilst for financial year 2021 plans to achieve the
targets set have been developed to a high level of probability.

Sasol reaffirms that liquidity headroom will remain well above US$1 billion, with
improved liquidity balances in Sasol’s US dollar and Rand liquidity facilities. Several
focussed management actions over the past couple of months have improved our
liquidity position.

Sasol remains committed to the delivery of its response plan to bring leverage back in
line with target levels and mitigate the impacts of recent market volatility and COVID-19.

The process to accelerate and expand our asset disposal programme has yielded good
progress for several of Sasol’s assets despite the macro environment volatility in recent
months. Any divestment or similar activity will be executed in line with balance sheet,
shareholder value and strategic objectives, including the potential for partnering options
at Sasol’s US Base Chemicals business.

Further updates on the progress of the disposal transactions will be made as and when
appropriate.

POSITIONING SASOL FOR THE FUTURE

As previously communicated, a key part of Sasol’s response plan is to look beyond the
near-term measures and position the business for sustained profitability in a low oil
price environment. The new strategy will focus on Sasol’s core portfolios of chemicals
and energy. A focused and robust review of the business, and the associated workforce
structures, is underway and a detailed update will be provided to stakeholders alongside
the full year results.

A key decision as a result of this includes the discontinuation of all oil growth activities in
West Africa. The reset of the strategy necessitates a revised operating model, which is
still under development and will be announced in the second quarter of financial year
2021.

The review has identified that the future Sasol business – “Sasol 2.0” – will be focused
on two core businesses, Chemicals and Energy (the Businesses). The revision of our
strategy aims to have a greater focus on enhanced cash generation, value realisation
for shareholders and business sustainability. The Chemicals Business will focus on its
activities in specialty chemicals where it has differentiated capabilities and strong
market positions which can be expanded over time. The Energy Business will comprise
the Southern African value chain and associated assets and will pursue greenhouse
gas emission reduction (GHG) through focus on gas as a key feedstock and renewables
as a secondary energy source. This will be a key enabler to achieve the 2030 and
longer term aspirations to shift to a lower carbon economy.

Our two market-facing Businesses will each be responsible for its own profit and loss,
management of resources and capabilities. A lean corporate centre will enable the
Businesses by fostering synergies and integrating activities, setting strategic boundaries
and allocating capital.

The redesign of the organisation to enable our sustainability at lower oil prices will have
an impact on our workforce structure. We have accordingly issued a notice to our
representative trade unions in South Africa in terms of section 189 of the Labour
Relations Act number 66 of 1995, inviting them to enter into consultation with Sas ol. A
similar process will be followed with the relevant recognised bodies in our other
jurisdictions.

CHANGE IN DIRECTOR’S EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEW GROUP
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE STRUCTURES

As a first step towards this long-term trajectory, the new senior leadership end-state
structure will consist of the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and six
Executive Vice President (EVP) portfolios. An additional EVP Sasol 2.0 Transformation
role will be in place for up to 24 months to help execute our restructuring initiative and
mitigate risks to ongoing operations. Changes in the roles of EVPs will be effective from
1 November 2020. This new structure will also increase our gender and diversity
representation at GEC level.

The EVP portfolios will be structured as follows:

-   The Energy Business Unit will comprise two EVP portfolios;

        o Priscillah Mabelane, whose appointment we announced on 2 June 2020, will
          lead Sasol’s liquid fuels marketing and sales activities, upstream gas,
          sourcing and marketing, and supporting functions associated with the Energy
          value chain.
        o Bernard Klingenberg will lead operations and technical functions within the
          Energy value chain, as well as mining, to ensure continuity in our ability to
          deliver across our integrated value chain.

-   The Chemicals Business Unit will be led by Brad Griffith. He will be fully accountable
    for the full end-to-end chemicals business, from feedstock sourcing through
    operations, marketing and sales and associated supporting activities and functions.

The Corporate Centre will be made up of three EVP portfolios:

    -   Chief Financial Officer, Paul Victor.
    -   Human Resources and Stakeholder Relations, led by Charlotte Mokoena.
    -   Strategy, Sustainability and Integrated Services, led by Executive Director Vuyo
        Kahla. Corporate portfolio strategy, sustainability, enterprise-wide risk
        management as well as enterprise-wide SHE policy and reporting will be added
        to his current responsibilities. Supply chain will move from his current portfolio of
        responsibilities and form part of the business units.

In addition to the permanent roles described above, Marius Brand will be appointed as
EVP Sasol 2.0 Transformation to lead the Group-wide Transformation Programme to
Sasol 2.0 and delivering the long-term sustainability targets by the third quarter of
financial year 2021.

Further details of our repositioning process will be provided at the August 2020 results
release.

BUSINESS UPDATE, PRODUCTION AND SALES METRICS FOR THE NINE
MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020


OPERATIONS SAFETY UPDATE

The safety and wellbeing of our employees and service providers remains our top
priority. Sasol management is disheartened by the tragic fatality suffered by a
service provider at our Secunda operations on 7 April 2020. An internal incident
investigation, in collaboration with the service provider, is well underway to
determine the root cause of this incident. The journey towards zero harm and
eliminating fatalities remains an imperative for Sasol.


FURTHER UPDATE OF COVID-19 ON GLOBAL OPERATIONS

In relation to the COVID-19 impacts on employees and service providers, Sasol
has implemented a range of measures and strict protocols to ensure that
employees can continue to perform essential work safely. Detailed COVID-19
response plans are in place for all sites globally, with dedicated task teams closely
monitoring and managing the situation in line with relevant local guidance.
Fourteen Sasol employees have tested positive for COVID-19 globally, of which
nine employees have recovered and the remaining five employees remain in self-
isolation and are receiving appropriate support. No employee has tested positive
for COVID-19 at our South African operations.

The lockdown in South Africa continues to have a significant impact on fuel
demand. Consistent with Sasol’s COVID-19 update on 8 April, this has resulted in
the phased suspension of production at the Natref refinery and a 25% reduction in
production rates at Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO). Chemicals used in the
mining and construction sectors have also seen a reduction in demand, which has
necessitated the suspension of production of Sasol’s ammonia, nitric acid and
chlor-vinyl plants in Sasolburg. Market demand for Sasol’s other industrial
chemicals has not been significantly impacted and therefore SSO’s residual
operating capacity is prioritising chemicals production for supply to domestic and
export markets. Fuel demand is being closely monitored in light of the two week
extension of the lockdown in South Africa.
The COVID-19 situation remains highly dynamic with infection rates varying
across Sasol’s operating jurisdictions. Sasol’s operations offer some flexibility to
balance fuels and chemicals output to respond to product demand.


RESPONSE STRATEGY PROGRESS

Sasol has made significant progress in implementing the self-help measures
communicated on 17 March 2020 as part of the response strategy to the COVID-
19 pandemic and oil price volatility. Most of the financial year 2020 initiatives have
already been agreed and are now being implemented. However, savings relating
to working capital carry some risk due to higher than expected inventory levels
following reduced demand and the weaker exchange rate impact on accounts
receivable. For financial year 2021, we have made significant progress and have
committed actions in place for more than 80% of the savings target.

The first set of self-help measures announced on 17 March 2020 is being realised
mainly by:
   - Optimising and reducing cash costs. A wide range of measures have been
       taken to cut operating costs. Some examples include non-payment of the
       financial year 2020 short-term incentive scheme to employees, freezing of
       vacancies and the drastic curtailment of external spend through
       engagements with suppliers to consider renegotiations on price and
       reduction in scope of services.
   - Significant results realised by re-prioritising capital expenditure following a
       risk based evaluation.
   - Several actions are planned to manage working capital to optimal levels for
       the Company to the end of financial year 2021 as the disruption associated
       with COVID-19 is expected to ease.

The ongoing negative demand impact from COVID-19 requires management to
consider further self-help measures. These measures are necessary to help
protect the Company’s balance sheet and liquidity until at least the end of financial
year 2021. The Company will implement the following key human capital
measures:
   - A 20% to 40% reduction in directors’ fees.
   - A two-part salary sacrifice for the President and Chief Executive Officer
       (CEO) which entails a donation of 33% of the CEO’s salary for three
       months from May 2020 to the Solidarity Fund set up by the South African
       government to support the fight against COVID-19, and for the remaining
       five months to December 2020, a salary sacrifice of 20% will apply.
   - Salary sacrifices for the Group Executive Committee and senior leadership
       members of 20%, and for middle to junior management levels ranging from
       15-10%. Salary sacrifices are planned for 8 months, however the duration
       of the temporary measures will be reassessed against the progress we
       make towards our savings targets. Furthermore, no salary increases will be
       effected in 2020.

In addition we are proactively investigating the opportunity to conduct critical and
statutory work during the current period of the lower product demand at SSO,
which could allow the maintenance intervention planned for September 2020 to be
optimised significantly or even postponed.

In parallel, Sasol has made progress on its expedited review of the business to
consider how it can be most effectively positioned to be sustainable in a low oil
price environment. Consistent with this approach, the expanded asset disposal
process has yielded good interest in relation to a number of assets, despite the
macro environment uncertainty. Updates on progress will be provided at the
appropriate time.


UPDATE ON FINANCIAL POSITION

Sasol aims to sustain liquidity headroom above US$1 billion for the foreseeable
future considering that it has no significant debt maturities before May 2021. The
contribution of the suite of self-help measures is key in maintaining this liquidity
position with asset disposals remaining essential to reduce Sasol’s debt levels.
The COVID-19 impact will have a significant negative effect on operating cash
flows. The response strategy measures detailed above are necessary to mitigate
the impact of reduced demand and much weaker macro-economic indicators on
the Company’s profitability. The necessity of any additional measures required will
be assessed on the basis of the further market developments.

Sasol appreciates the ongoing support from its lending group. The process to
secure appropriate adjustments to relevant covenants is underway and a further
update will be provided in due course.

We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of lower-for-longer macro-
economic assumptions on the value of our assets ahead of the 2020 financial year
end process. Details will be provided in our future trading updates.


BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Sasol Mining’s full year productivity is expected to range between 1 130-1 180
tons per continuous miner per shift, without taking into account any potential
effects of the COVID-19 spread amongst our workforce and the subsequent
impact on operations. We have reduced our additional external coal stock
purchases by approximately 400 – 600 kilotons for the SSO value chain for the
remainder of the financial year, following the recent reduction in both internal and
external customer demand. The resultant increase in coal stockpiles will help
mitigate potential business continuity risk including the potential impact of the
spread of COVID-19 amongst the workforce.

Given the decline in liquid fuels demand following the COVID-19 prevalence, sales
volumes are expected to be approximately 50-51 million barrels for financial year
2020. This is based on the current extended COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa,
and a phased demand ramp-up after the lifting of the lockdown restrictions.
Accordingly, SSO production for the full year is forecasted to decrease to
approximately 7,3-7,4 million tons. Chemicals production will be prioritised within
the revised SSO operating parameters.

Despite the Lake Charles Chemical Project (LCCP) ramp up continuing in line with
expectations for operational performance, further price weakness means that the
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)
contribution from LCCP for financial year 2020 has been revised to a loss of
between US$50-US$100 million. This compares to the previous guidance of a
positive EBITDA of US$50-US$100 million before the price weakness as a result
of the decline in oil prices and the COVID-19 global demand reduction.

Beneficial operations of the Guerbet and Ziegler units remain on track for the end
of June 2020 and the LDPE unit, which was planned for the second half of the
calendar year 2020, is now targeted to be on-line by the third quarter of calendar
year 2020. The acceleration of this timeline will ensure that Sasol captures the
additional contribution margin above ethylene, given the current low ethylene
prices achieved in the market.

The financial information on which this update is based has not been reviewed and
reported on by the Company's external auditors.

UPDATE ON SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

BACKGROUND

Shareholders are referred to Sasol’s SENS announcement issued on 31 March
2020. In that announcement, Sasol stated it would continue to run its operations,
in line with regulatory requirements applicable in the jurisdictions we operate in, to
ensure uninterrupted supply of essential products such as fuels and chemicals in
these jurisdictions. We reiterate that the COVID-19 pandemic is highly dynamic,
and we will continue to update the market of any further impact on Sasol’s
business.

A small number of Sasol employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and are
receiving our full support. These were isolated cases and have not negatively
impacted operations.

Sasol communicated a comprehensive response strategy on 17 March 2020 and
substantial progress has been made with regards to its US$2billion cash
conservation programme. While the Company has made substantial progress, it
will also implement additional self-help management actions to mitigate further
negative impacts of COVID-19 across its portfolio.

UPDATE ON OPERATIONS

In South Africa, the national COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in an
unprecedented decline in fuel demand since coming into effect on Friday, 27
March 2020. Sasol and its partner in Natref, Total South Africa, decided to
suspend the production at Natref with effect from Thursday, 9 April 2020 until
further notice.

Given the steep decline in fuels demand, a decision was also made by Sasol to
reduce daily production rates at our Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) by
approximately 25% to meet the current market demand, while maintaining optimal
inventory levels. We will maintain these production rates until further notice, while
carefully monitoring the supply and demand balance. A further reduction in
production rates may be required depending on further developments in the fuels
market. All Sasol’s mines are continuing to operate notwithstanding the lower
internal demand, resulting in the external coal purchases being significantly
minimised, compared to what was previously planned for the remainder of this
financial year.

Chemicals production will continue to be prioritised within the revised SSO
operating parameters including this cutback scenario. Despite the suspension of
production at the Natref refinery and lower production rates at SSO, the country’s
current demand for fuels and chemicals, including sanitisers, will be met. The
Company will continue to monitor the chemicals demand as well as supply chain
risks and will keep the market updated on developments.

Given these developments and the decline in demand, liquid fuels sales volumes
are expected to be approximately 50 – 51 million barrels against the previously
guided 57 – 58 million barrels for financial year 2020. Accordingly, Synfuels
production volumes will be approximately 7,3 – 7,4 million tons against the
previously guided range of 7,7 – 7,8 million tons. At this stage a similar reduction
in Synfuels chemicals demand is not being experienced, and Sasol is prioritising
supply of chemicals within South Africa as well as strong export demand.
More detail on production volumes and updated guidance will be provided in the
Company’s Q3 FY20 Business Performance Metrics report, to be released in April
2020.

RESPONSE STRATEGY PROGRESS

As referenced earlier, the Company has made significant progress on the US$2
billion business self-help measures for financial years 2020 and 2021, which form
the basis of the response strategy to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price
volatility.

Given the continued negative impact of COVID-19 on market demand and global
macro-economic indicators, Sasol’s management team is in the process of
proactively identifying further measures to provide an additional buffer against
short term volatility.

Sasol has put in place governance structures to manage the situation
appropriately and will take decisive action where necessary to respond to any
further changes in markets. These additional measures will be communicated to
the market once agreed with the various stakeholders.

Safeguarding the health and well-being of employees and providing essential
products to customers and stakeholders remains the Company’s priority.

SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 LOCK DOWN IN SOUTH AFRICA;
CREDIT RATING AND OIL HEDGING UPDATE, AND CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT

SASOL’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 MEASURES

Sasol welcomes and fully supports the directives announced by South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa on 23 March 2020, to combat the spread of COVID-19
in South Africa, including a three-week country-wide lockdown (“the COVID-19
directives”), which effectively commenced on Friday, 27 March 2020 and will
continue until Friday, 17 April 2020.

In South Africa, Sasol’s products and services, by and large, are classified as
essential goods and services as per Annexure B of the Lockdown Regulations
issued by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs on 25
March 2020. Sasol plans to run its South African-based operations for the duration
of the lockdown, and will work with the Government to ensure business continuity
and uninterrupted supply of fuels and chemicals in South Africa during this period.
However, some plants will be required to reduce throughput, or potentially
shutdown following lower product offtake by our customers due to the lockdown.
Furthermore, some intermediate chemicals will be re-directed to the production of
products where demand is not impacted, to the extent possible. To this end, Sasol
has formulated a special blend of alcohols to address the increasing demand for
sanitizer alcohols, and will expedite the production and availability of these critical
products locally to help safeguard the health and wellbeing of South Africans.

Sasol is collaborating with the South African Department of Trade, Industry and
Competition (DTIC) and is also prioritising supply to Government entities and other
essential services to jointly combat the spread of the virus in South Africa.

The health and wellbeing of employees remains Sasol’s foremost priority and
appropriate measures have already been taken to mitigate the risk of COVID-19
infection across all of Sasol’s sites. These measures are being strictly enforced
and closely monitored to ensure the ongoing safety of employees and the public.

Outside of South Africa, most of Sasol’s operations are continuing, with no
significant impacts to North American Operations (NAO) or its supply chain, or to
the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) construction to date. Chemical
manufacturing is defined as a critical infrastructure sector, and therefore NAO and
the LCCP is exempt from the stay-at-home order issued by the Louisiana
government.

All European and Asian assets are currently in operation. The Central Processing
Facility (CPF) in Temane, Mozambique, which supplies natural gas to
Mozambique and South Africa is not affected. Sasol continues to work closely with
suppliers and customers to ensure uninterrupted supply, where possible.

The COVID-19 situation is highly dynamic and with infection rates continuing to
increase in many countries, there is a risk of interruptions to production,
construction and associated supply chains, along with a potential impact on
demand and product pricing in some sectors. Shareholders are therefore advised
that this could impact Sasol’s earnings for 2020 financial year (FY20). The impact
on the business, suppliers and customers is being continuously evaluated and an
update will be provided in the Q3 FY20 Business Performance Metrics report.

UPDATE ON CREDIT RATING AND OIL HEDGING

Sasol notes that the credit rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and
Moody’s have updated their credit rating assessments of Sasol in light of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global growth and the volatility in the oil
price. S&P has announced that it has revised Sasol’s BBB- rating, which was
affirmed on 7 March to BB, with a negative outlook, while Moody’s also announced
that it has revised Sasol’s Ba1 rating to Ba2 and placed the company under review
for a downgrade. Moody’s stated that “South Africa’s 21-day lockdown to contain
the outbreak creates further uncertainty on near-term financial performance, while
an extended lockdown beyond the original timeline could further affect
performance”. The cost of some of Sasol’s floating rate debt is partly linked to our
credit rating and the revised rating profile will therefore result in an increase in
finance costs from existing facilities of approximately US$10 million per annum.

As stated in the market update on 17 March 2020, Sasol has developed a
comprehensive response strategy, which is being executed to mitigate the impact
of COVID-19 and a lower oil price as far as practically possible. This includes a
cash conservation programme, an accelerated and expanded asset disposal and
partnering programme, as well as a potential rights issue of up to US$2 billion,
which remains subject to the progress of other initiatives. Sasol maintains a long-
term commitment to achieving an investment grade credit rating.

Further to this, progress has been made on Sasol’s hedging programme reducing
Sasol’s exposure to any further short term pricing downside. Oil hedges are in
place for approximately 80% of Synfuels fuels Q4 FY20 production, at
approximately US$32 per barrel. Crude oil hedging execution will continue for the
next 12 months, while US$/ZAR and ethane hedging programmes have been
executed for the next twelve month period.

Sasol continues to have liquidity of approximately US$2,5 billion to provide an
additional buffer against short term volatility.

Fleetwood Grobler commented “This is an unprecedented time in the history of
Sasol and the world. We will continue to take decisive action to help safeguard the
health and well-being of our employees and provide essential products to the
many stakeholders that rely on us, while we reposition the business to enhance its
long term future.”

Shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities until a further announcement is made.

ADAPTING TO THE CURRENT COMMODITY PRICING LANDSCAPE AND TAKING
DECISIVE ACTION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE NET DEBT, THROUGH A CASH
GENERATION PLAN TARGETING US$6 BILLION OF CASH CONSERVATION,
FURTHER DISPOSALS AND A POTENTIAL RIGHTS ISSUE UP TO US$2 BILLION,
AND FURTHER CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

BACKGROUND

Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement issued on 12 March 2020, where
Sasol announced it was reviewing a variety of actions to address the challenges created
by the impact of COVID-19 and the recent decline in the oil and chemical prices.

In the short term, Sasol needs to enhance cash flow and reposition the balance sheet
on the assumption that there is a sustained low oil price until the end of financial year
2021. It is important to reiterate that Sasol currently has available liquidity of
approximately US$2.5 billion with no significant debt maturities before May 2021 and it
therefore believes it is positioned to withstand recent market volatility in the short term.
Sasol believes it can maintain liquidity headroom in excess of US$1 billion over the next
12 - 18 months with a US$25 per barrel oil price before the benefits of hedging.

Sasol can today announce a comprehensive response strategy designed to mitigate the
impact of these macroeconomic factors. This includes a commitment to re-set the
organisation to be globally competitive in a sustained low oil price environment. The
global portfolio of our foundation business remains cash positive under prevailing spot
market conditions and an oil hedging programme has been put in place to insulate the
balance sheet from further financial pressure.

A package of measures is being undertaken that is intended to fundamentally reposition
the Company over the following 24 months:
    - A cash conservation programme focused on enhancing cash flow and cost
      competitiveness in a low oil price environment, with US$2 billion cash delivery
      ahead of current plan targeted by 30 June 2021;
    - An accelerated and expanded asset disposal programme executed in line with
      balance sheet, shareholder value and strategic objectives with a view to deliver
      proceeds significantly ahead of the US$2 billion currently targeted;
    - Potential for partnering options at Sasol’s US Base Chemicals assets; and
    - A potential rights issue, which has been underwritten on a standby basis, as a
      supplemental initiative to reset the capital structure, subject to the progress
      made on cash conservation initiatives and asset disposals.

Collectively these actions target generating at least US$6 billion by the end of financial
year 2021. This is expected to reshape Sasol’s balance sheet and provide the platform
to deliver a globally competitive business with high cash yielding assets. Further to this,
Sasol is in discussions with its lenders about additional flexibility in respect of its
financial maintenance covenants to provide improved balance sheet flexibility in
financial year 2021.

OVERVIEW OF COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE STRATEGY

Self-help management actions: US$2 billion targeted by 30 June 2021

Financial year 2020
   - Immediate measures targeted to deliver a cash improvement of approximately
      US$1 billion by 30 June 2020 relative to current plan assumptions, including
      approximately
          o US$800 million to be realised from working capital optimisation and
             re-prioritising capital expenditure; and
          o US$200 million to be realised from cost-saving measures.
   - These improvements build on existing initiatives and take into account the
      anticipated working capital release as inventory and receivables are adjusted for
      lower oil and product prices.
   - Safe and reliable operating units remain a top priority for Sasol.

        Sasol believes achieving these targets would enable it to maintain a net debt to
        EBITDA ratio in compliance with financial maintenance covenants.

Financial year 2021
   - Further measures targeted to deliver approximately US$1 billion additional
      improvement in net debt position relative to previous plan assumptions, including
      approximately:
          o US$700 million to be saved from re-prioritising capital and working capital
            expenditure; and
          o US$300 million from continuing cost savings and business optimisation.

Asset disposals: Accelerated programme with scope increased significantly
above current US$2 billion target
   - Expanding the scope of, and accelerating, the asset disposal programme which
      is now intended to realise proceeds significantly above the previous target of
      US$2 billion.
   - This builds on the comprehensive asset review process and includes the
      potential for partnering Sasol’s US Base Chemicals assets on which there are
      active discussions.

Potential rights issue: Resetting the capital structure through an equity issue
after FY20 results, currently targeted at US$2 billion
    - Potential rights issue to raise up to US$2 billion (equivalent in ZAR terms), with
       execution expected after financial year 2020 results.
    - Sasol has entered into a standby underwriting agreement with BofA Securities,
       Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Securities in respect of a rights issue for an amount of
       up to US$2 billion-equivalent, which contains certain customary terms and
       conditions for transactions of this nature and conditions relating to Sasol making
       progress on certain of the measures described above, in anticipation of entering
       into an underwriting agreement in respect of a rights issue for an amount of up to
       US$2 billion-equivalent. BofA Securities and Citigroup will act as Joint Global
       Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc will act as
       Joint Bookrunner in connection with the potential rights issue.
    - In connection with implementation of the proposed rights issue, the shareholders
       of the Company will be required to approve certain resolutions. In this respect, in
       due course the Company intends to post a circular to shareholders in order to
       convene a general meeting of shareholders around July 2020, and to approve
       the necessary resolutions required to implement the proposed rights offer.
    - The size of the rights issue may be reduced subject to the progress made on the
       other elements of the response strategy.

Liquidity: Liquidity headroom of US$1-2 billion or greater to be put in place over
the following 12 to 18 months
   - Sasol expects to comply with the financial maintenance covenant thresholds in
       its debt agreements at 30 June 2020 assuming, amongst others, a prevailing
       Rand oil price of approximately R580 per barrel. Sasol can sustain a liquidity
       headroom in excess of US$1 billion over the next 12 - 18 months in a US$25 per
       barrel oil price before the benefits of hedging.
   - Sasol is actively engaging the lenders under its debt facilities to discuss
       adequate flexibility on its financial maintenance covenant thresholds in its debt
       agreements.
   - An active oil hedging strategy is in progress.
   - Sasol is targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 and gearing below 30% at
       end financial year 2022.

Business repositioning: Repositioning Sasol for sustainable profitability in a low
oil price environment
    - Sasol is undertaking a purposeful and systematic review of its global cost
       competitiveness and business structure.
    - Sasol is in the process of designing the scope of approximately R2.5 billion in
       expected sustainable net benefits by financial year 2022, expected to increase to
       R3.0 billion by financial year 2023 through efficiency and effectiveness measures
       across the business.
    - The objective is to deliver a focused and profitable business in a sustained low oil
       price environment, creating the scope for sustainable shareholder value creation
       through shareholder returns and strategic investment.
   -   Sasol maintains its commitment to meet the 10% reduction in greenhouse gas
       emissions as per the target set for 2030 for the South African operations, off a
       2017 baseline.


CONCLUSION

Sasol has a high quality, well diversified global portfolio with a range of strategically
advantaged assets and value chain integration. Sasol believes that the portfolio can be
positioned to be sustainably profitable in a future low oil price environment. A reshaped
and strategically focused portfolio based on cost, technology and market advantage is
planned. If assets do not increase the competitive advantage of this future Sasol, they
may be exited, or selective partnering may be pursued. Sasol aims for an asset portfolio
that is globally diverse across sectors and able to operate at the low end of the cost
curve in each sector and region.

The immediate focus is on the actions to stabilise the Company and protect the balance
sheet so that the underlying value of the portfolio is not compromised, and instead the
potential realised in the interests of all Sasol’s stakeholders.

In light of this, the agenda of the Capital Markets Day planned for November 2020 will
be focused on demonstrating progress against our short-term management actions,
including asset disposals, and our sustainability roadmap to meet our 2030 targets.

Sasol believes the immediate and decisive implementation of the measures announced
today can reset Sasol’s capital structure and align it with the cash generation of the
asset portfolio in a low oil price environment. We believe that the future Sasol will have
a strong value proposition, with the capacity to deliver returns to shareholders from the
portfolio and also generate sufficient cash for strategic growth and a sustainable future.

Fleetwood Grobler, Chief Executive Officer, made the following statement:

“In this dynamic and challenging environment, it’s critical that we tighten control on what
we can, acting both swiftly and decisively. My management team and I are fully
committed to delivering on the measures that we have announced today. Sasol has a
strong underlying business and all efforts are being made to enhance EBITDA in a
sustained low oil price environment. Delivering sustainable, long-term shareholder value
is our imperative and we have a clear plan to achieve that.”

Cautionary Statement

Shareholders are advised to exercise caution when trading in the Company’s securities
until such time as the full details of the disposals and the potential rights issue are
published.

UPDATE ON MARKET VOLATILITY AND CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

The unprecedented set of combined challenges driven by COVID-19 and the significant
decline in the oil price have come at a time when Sasol is in a peak gearing phase as
the Company completes LCCP.

Sasol is confident that its foundation business is capable of positive cash flow from
operations in a low oil price environment. At the prevailing Rand oil price of
approximately R580/bbl, Sasol will be within the current covenant levels at 30 June
2020. In anticipation of a lower-for-longer Rand per barrel oil price, a comprehensive
package of actions is being finalised to deliver this and sustainably strengthen the
balance sheet. It is important to note the current liquidity position:

   -   Sasol has current cash and available facilities of approximately US$2,5bn; and
   -   Sasol has no significant debt maturities before May 2021.

Sasol is prioritising the following actions, details of which will be announced to the
market on Tuesday:

   -   Business optimisation to reduce costs;
   -   Working capital optimisation;
   -   Re-scheduling some capital expenditure;
   -   Expanding the scope of, and accelerating, the asset disposal programme to
       realise proceeds in excess of the current US$2 billion target;
   -   Engaging our lending groups. Thus far, engagements have been constructive;
       and
   -   Assessing alternatives to manage Sasol's near-term debt covenant constraints,
       including a potential equity issue.

Sasol will update the market on the conference call at 15:00 SA on Tuesday, 17 March,
with detail on the comprehensive package of actions.

Shareholders are accordingly advised to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company's securities until a further announcement is made.

Fleetwood Grobler commented ""The disruption in the global oil market, coupled with the
ongoing impact of COVID-19 has significantly changed the outlook in just a few weeks.
It is critical that we keep matters within our control by acting quickly and decisively so
that stakeholders don't lose sight of the significant underlying value in this business. We
are therefore working towards a package of measures to ensure that the business is
profitable even at low oil prices and that we continue to have a strong balance sheet to
support it.""

Update On Sasol's Credit Rating

Sasol notes that the credit rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Moody's have completed
their periodic review of Sasol following the release of the company's interim financial results for 2020.

S&P has affirmed Sasol's BBB-/A-3 credit rating whilst Moody's has downgraded Sasol's credit rating
to Ba1/NP. The ratings action by Moody's reflects Sasol's elevated leverage in the context of volatile
market conditions.

As stated in Sasol's recent financial results, protecting the balance sheet remains an important priority
during the peak gearing phase. In this regard, several proactive actions have already been taken
which include a measured financial risk management programme to hedge oil and ethane commodity
price and exchange rate exposures, managing costs, increasing working capital efficiency and
agreeing additional flexibility on covenants with the lending group.

These initiatives continue to benefit the balance sheet with further actions underway. These include
re-phasing discretionary capital, ongoing delivery of the value-driven asset disposal programme and
active balance sheet management to maintain a healthy liquidity position and a balanced debt
maturity profile as Sasol works to restore an optimal capital structure. Sasol maintains a long-term
commitment to an investment grade credit rating.

Subject to the macroeconomic environment and the impact of COVID-19 on global product demand,
Sasol continues to expect the cash flow inflection point to be reached in the second half of FY20 and
de-leveraging to start thereafter. The overall Lake Charles Chemicals Project (""LCCP"") cost estimate
is tracking US$12,8 billion, within our previous guidance of US$12,6 - 12,9 billion. LCCP is expected
to be EBITDA positive in the second half of FY20 with a contribution of US$50 - US$100m for FY20.

Fleetwood Grobler commented ""We recognise the challenges presented by the current market
environment and acknowledge the outcomes of the rating agency reviews. We remain focused on
managing the factors within our control - delivering safe, strong and stable operational performance
and protecting the balance sheet as we bring the Lake Charles Chemicals Project to completion and
start deleveraging. The revised rating profile is not expected to have a material impact on our existing
funding costs. As ever, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework and priorities.""

In light of the above, Sasol management will be hosting a conference call to discuss our approach to
protecting the balance sheet on Tuesday, 10 March 2020, at 15h00 (SA).

GRANT OF CONDITIONAL SHARE AWARDS TO DIRECTORS AND PRESCRIBED
OFFICERS OF SASOL, AND DIRECTORS OF MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES OF SASOL

In order for Sasol to remain competitive in the market and to keep senior management and
eligible specialists retained, focused, engaged and motivated, Conditional Share Awards are
made annually and forms an important component of the reward mix offered in terms of the
remuneration policy. Shareholder approval of the Sasol Long-Term Incentive Plan (""the Plan""
and/or ""LTI"", as appropriate) was obtained at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.

The Conditional Share Awards have a split vesting period of 50% after three years with the
balance after five years and will only vest to the extent that the Corporate Performance Targets
(detailed below), as approved by the Remuneration Committee, have been achieved after the
performance period of three years. The full award is subject to the achievement of these
targets.

The standard timing for the annual Conditional Share Awards is to be made to eligible
participants at the beginning of the new financial year. However, due to the extended closed
period at the end of the 2019 financial year, the Board agreed to postpone these awards to
later in the 2020 financial year. No compensation is offered to members of the GEC in respect
of the delayed award date and the standard vesting periods of three and five years
respectively, will apply. To align with this timing, the on-appointment Conditional Share Awards
made to F R Grobler and B V Griffith on their appointment as President and Chief Executive
Officer and Executive Vice President: Chemicals Business respectively, as well as the recent
appointment of H C Brand, Executive Vice President: Sustainability and Technology, all subject
to the same performance and vesting conditions as the annual LTI awards, have now been
made.

In compliance with paragraphs 3.63 to 3.66 of the JSE Listings Requirements, Sasol hereby
announces that directors of Sasol, prescribed officers and directors of major subsidiaries of
Sasol, have been granted Conditional Share Awards in terms of the Plan.

The Board, or the Sasol Remuneration Committee, as appropriate, approved the Conditional
Share Awards made on 4 March 2020. In terms of the rules of the Plan, the participants have
to decline such an award within ten business days after the award date, failing which the
award will be deemed to have been accepted.

The rules of the LTI Plan are available on the Sasol website www.sasol.com.

FY20 Corporate Performance Targets

The Board annually considers the Corporate Performance Targets to ensure they reflect a
balanced outcome for both the participants and shareholders and serve as motivation for the
participants to focus on objectives that enable the achievement of the longer-term strategic
priorities. The participants listed above have 100% of their share awards subject to the
achievement of these Corporate Performance Targets (CPTs), which the Board believes is a
significant incentive to encourage performance. The following table sets out the targets:

Earnings performance

We delivered a satisfactory set of business results for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
with increased volumes while cost and working capital tracked our internal targets contributing to
the balance sheet covenant levels being maintained within market guidance. The financial results
were impacted mostly by a weak macroeconomic environment, which resulted in lower margins,
and the LCCP being in a ramp-up phase.

Earnings decreased by 72% to R4,5 billion compared to the prior period. This resulted from a 9%
decrease in the rand per barrel price of Brent crude oil, softer global chemical prices and refining
margins, lower productivity at our Mining operations and a negative contribution from the LCCP.
Our gross margin percentage decreased by 2% compared to the prior period driven by a softer
macroeconomic environment negatively impacting supply-demand dynamics especially in our
chemicals businesses. We anticipate softer chemical prices over the next 12 to 24 months and
expect structural recovery over the medium to long-term. Our Energy business was impacted by
lower crude oil prices as well as lower refining margins due to weaker demand.

As the LCCP units progress through the sequential beneficial operation schedule, our revenues
do not yet match the costs expensed. We do expect that for the second half of FY20 revenue
will match the costs expensed better and that the LCCP will generate positive earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). The LCCP negatively impacted earnings by
R2,8 billion (EBITDA of R1,1 billion and R1,7 billion in additional depreciation charges). Earnings
were further impacted by approximately R2,0 billion in finance charges for the period as the LCCP
units reach beneficial operation.

As a result of the aforementioned factors our key financial metrics were impacted as follows:

-   Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) decreased by 53% to R9,9 billion compared to the
    prior period;
-   Adjusted EBITDA(1) declined by 27% from R26,8 billion in the prior period to R19,6 billion;
-   Basic earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 73% to R6,56 per share compared to the prior
    period;
-   Headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 74% to R5,94 per share compared to the
    prior period; and
-   Core headline earnings per share(2) (CHEPS) decreased by 57% to R9,20 compared to the
    prior period.

(1)         Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBIT for depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement
            items, movement in environmental provisions due to discount rate changes, unrealised translation gains and losses, and
            unrealised gains and losses on Group hedging activities. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Group's
            underlying cash flow performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly
            titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the
            JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma financial
            information as set out in the full set of reviewed interim financial results.

(2)         Core HEPS is calculated by adjusting headline earnings per share with certain once-off items (provision for tax litigation
            matters and LCCP cash fixed cost with limited corresponding gross margin), period close adjustments and depreciation
            and amortisation of capital projects (exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping up,
            and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period close adjustments include translation gains
            and losses arising from translation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currency and realised and unrealised
            net gains on Group hedging activities at period end in order to remove volatility from earnings from period to period. Core
            HEPS constitutes pro forma financial information in terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements and should be read in
            conjunction with the basis of preparation and pro forma financial information notes as set out in the full set of reviewed
            interim financial results.

Balance sheet management

Our gearing increased from 56,3% at 30 June 2019 to 64,5% which is at the upper end of our
previous market guidance of 55% to 65%. The main reasons for the increase in gearing are the
adoption of the IFRS 16 'Leases' accounting standard (4% increase) and the net earnings impact
of the LCCP being in a ramp-up phase. Consistent with our long-term commitment to maintain
our investment grade credit rating, we continue to actively manage the balance sheet with the
objective of maintaining a healthy liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile.

Cash generated by operating activities decreased by 21% to R19,6 billion compared to
R24,8 billion in the prior period. This was largely due to the softer macroeconomic environment
and losses attributable to the LCCP. The decrease was partially negated by another strong
working capital and cost performance from the foundation business. Working capital decreased by
R433 million during the period mainly as a result of focused management actions.

Our net cash on hand position decreased from R15,8 billion as at 30 June 2019 to
R12,7 billion.

Actual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R21 billion. This includes
R10 billion (US$0,7 billion) relating to the LCCP and is in line with our internal targets.
In line with our financial risk management framework, we continue to make good progress with
hedging our currency and ethane exposure. For further details of our open hedge positions we
refer you to our Analyst Book (www.sasol.com).

Dividend

After careful consideration of our current leverage and the volatility in the macroeconomic
environment, the Board of directors (Board) decided to pass the interim dividend to protect
and strengthen our balance sheet. This is a decision that was not taken lightly as we remain
committed to delivering shareholder value, however, given the current position of our balance
sheet, the Board made this decision in the long-term interest of our shareholders. We continue to
ensure that we deliver the key elements of our strategy, particularly the completion of the LCCP.

Update on the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP)

Ongoing focus as we ramp up plants to beneficial operation

At the LCCP, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity in the field and bringing the
plants into beneficial operation. The project continued with its exceptional safety record with a
recordable case rate (RCR) of 0,10.

At the end of December 2019, engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete
and construction progress was at 98%, with overall project completion at 99%.

The investigation into the incident which occurred at the LDPE unit in January 2020 is complete.
The root cause analysis determined that a piping support structure, within the LDPE emergency
vent system, failed during commissioning causing a pipe to dislodge. No major equipment was
damaged, and the incident was isolated. Remediation has commenced, however, the replacement
of the high pressure piping material components have long lead times. We expect beneficial
operation of the LDPE unit to be delayed to the second half of calendar year 2020. Parallel
commissioning activities on the remainder of the LDPE unit continue during remediation and
every effort will be made to expedite the restoration project. The overall LCCP cost estimate is
tracking US$12,8 billion, within our previous guidance of US$12,6 billion to US$12,9 billion, and
our EBITDA estimate of US$50 million to US$100 million for FY20 remains.

During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit startup, the ethylene produced by the cracker and
destined for the unit is sold externally. All previously commissioned units were unaffected and are
operating to plan.

The ETO unit, the fourth of seven units, achieved beneficial operation on 30 January 2020. The
unit has a nameplate capacity of 100 kilo tons (kt) per year, forms part of our ethylene oxide
value chain and adds to the capacity of our Performance Chemicals product volumes already
produced and sold on both a regional and global scale. The ETO unit follows the linear low-
density polyethylene (LLDPE), world-scale ethane cracker and ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol
(EO/EG) facilities, which all reached beneficial operation last year and are operating to plan. This
provides additional flexibility to our ethylene oxide value chain and will enable us to divert some
volume away from the mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) product line and support increased margins.
As previously communicated, we still expect the Ziegler and Guerbet plants to achieve beneficial
operation in the last quarter of FY20.

The ethane cracker is ramping up following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor
catalyst in December 2019. The plant is expected to operate according to plan for the remainder
of the year. The LLDPE plant and the EO value chain are ramping up to plan with our learnings to
be carried over to the LDPE ramp-up.

The LCCP remains a world-scale, first quartile feedstock-advantaged plant, highly integrated
across a diverse product slate with high margin products and world class logistics and
infrastructure.
The short-term market outlook for ethane and product pricing remains volatile and estimates will
be updated periodically. We expect EBITDA in the range of US$600 million to US$750 million for
FY21.


Board activities

We have strengthened our LCCP control environment, which includes a detailed remediation plan
with specific focus on culture, processes and governance which is being monitored within the
project, operations and functional teams.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL HALF YEAR ENDED 31
DECEMBER 2019 AND LCCP UPDATE

Trading Statement for the financial half year ended 31 December 2019

Sasol is expected to deliver a satisfactory set of operational results for the six
months ended 31 December 2019, with a good volume, cost and working capital
performance. The financial results were however impacted by a weak
macroeconomic environment. This resulted in lower margins and operating profit.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Adjusted
EBITDA*) are expected to decline by between 22% and 32% from R26,8 billion in
the prior half year. This results from a 9% decrease in the rand per barrel price of
Brent crude oil, softer global chemical and refining margins and a negative EBITDA
contribution from the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP). As the LCCP units
progress through the sequential beneficial operation schedule, the costs associated
with the relevant units are expensed while the gross margin contribution follows the
planned volume ramp-up profile and inventory build. Earnings are further impacted
by approximately R1,7 billion in additional depreciation charges and approximately
R2 billion in finance charges for financial half year 2020 as the LCCP units reach
beneficial operation.

Shareholders are accordingly advised that:

-   Earnings per share (EPS) for the financial half year are expected to be between
    R5,37 and R7,76 per share. This is a decrease of between 68% and 78% from
    the prior half year EPS of R23,92;
-   Headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to be between R4,79 and
    R7,11 per share. This is a decrease of between 69% and 79% from the prior half
    year HEPS of R23,25. There were no significant impairments recorded for the
    half year 2020;
-   Core HEPS (CHEPS**) are expected to be between R7,90 and R10,04 per
    share. This is a decrease of between 53% and 63% from the prior half year
    CHEPS of R21,45.

We expect net debt to EBITDA to remain below 3,0 times and gearing to remain
within the previous market guidance of 55% and 65% for financial half year 2020.

Lake Charles Chemicals Project update

Sasol provided an update on the impact of the explosion and fire at the low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) unit on 24 January 2020. Mainly as a result of the
aforementioned incident, Sasol has revised its guidance on the EBITDA contribution
from the LCCP for the financial year 2020 to between US$50 million and US$100
million.

The financial information on which this trading statement is based has not been
reviewed and reported on by the Company's external auditors. Sasol's financial
results for the financial half year ended 31 December 2019 will be announced on
Monday, 24 February 2020.

* Adjusted EBITDA are calculated by adjusting operating profit for depreciation,
amortisation, share-based payments, remeasurement items, movement in
rehabilitation provisions due to discount rate changes, unrealised translation gains
and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on our hedging activities.

** Core HEPS are calculated by adjusting headline earnings with once-off items,
period close adjustments and depreciation and amortisation of capital projects
(exceeding R4 billion) which have reached beneficial operation and are still ramping
up, and share-based payments on implementation of B-BBEE transactions. Period
close adjustments in relation to the valuation of our derivatives at period end are to
remove volatility from earnings as these instruments are valued using forward curves
and other market factors at the reporting date and could vary from period to period.
We believe core headline earnings are a useful measure of the group s sustainable
operating performance. However, this is not a defined term under IFRS and may not
be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The
aforementioned adjustments are the responsibility of the directors of Sasol. The
adjustments have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and due to their
nature, may not fairly present Sasol s financial position, changes in equity, results of
operations or cash flows.

UPDATE ON THE LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP) LOW-
DENSITY POLYETHYLENE UNIT AND SASOL PUBLISHES PRODUCTION AND
SALES METRICS FOR THE FINANCIAL HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER
2019

LCCP Low-Density Polyethylene Unit update

At Lake Charles, we maintain our focus on safely improving productivity in the field
and bringing the plants into beneficial operation. The project continued with its
exceptional safety record with a recordable case rate of 0,10.

At the end of December 2019, engineering and procurement activities were
substantially complete and construction progress was at 98%. Overall project
completion was at 99% and capital expenditure amounted to US$12,5 billion.

An explosion and fire occurred at the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit on 13
January 2020. All employees and contractors are safe and accounted for. In line with
standard safety protocols as well as the necessary regional requirements, the unit
had to be made safe before re-entry of personnel into the affected area could be
allowed. The area which is the subject of the explosion, is a high pressure section of
the LDPE unit.

The investigation is underway to determine the cause, extent of the damage, and the
scope and timeline of repair. Initial findings indicate the damage is limited to a small
portion of the LDPE unit and, importantly, major equipment such as the compressors
were unaffected. Parallel commissioning activities on the remainder of the LDPE unit
will continue. The technology providers, licensors and other external experts are fully
engaged and in addition, we have mobilized and dispatched a team of Sasol
technical and operations experts to support the investigation team.

During the time of the delay in the LDPE unit start-up, the ethylene produced by the
cracker and destined for the unit will be sold externally. The projected earnings for
the LCCP complex in this financial year will only be impacted by the loss in the
margin of ethylene to low-density polyethylene. In addition, the insurance process
has been initiated and cover includes construction and commissioning activities. We
expect to determine the repair scope and outage duration by the second half of
February.

All previously commissioned units were unaffected and are operating to plan. The
Ethoxylates, Ziegler and Guerbet plants are also unaffected and remain within cost
and schedule as per our previous guidance.
Production and sales metrics for the financial half year ended 31 December
2019

Sasol has published its production and sales metrics for the financial half year ended
31 December 2019 on the Company´s website at www.sasol.com, under the Investor
Centre section or via this URL: http://www.sasol.com/investor-centre/financial-
reporting/business-performance-metrics.

Sasol expects a largely strong operational performance for the financial year ending
30 June 2020, with:

-   The Mining business updating their full year forecasted productivity to 1 170 – 1
    200 t/cm/s. This will however result in further external coal purchases of
    approximately 1,3 – 1,6 million tons during H2 FY20 to supplement the
    contracted Isibonelo volumes and enable recovery to desired stockpile levels;
-   Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement in
    Mozambique is expected to be 114 – 118 bscf, in line with previous market
    guidance;
-   Secunda Synfuels Operations full year production is forecasted to be
    approximately 7,7 – 7,8 million tons, in line with previous market guidance;
-   Natref is targeting production rates of above 600m³/h for the remainder of the
    year;
-   Energy’s sales volumes are on track to achieve previous market guidance of
    approximately 57 – 58 mm bbl for FY20;
-   As previously communicated, ORYX GTL expects to achieve a utilisation rate of
    55% – 60% for FY20 due to an extended planned shutdown during H2 FY20;
-   In line with previous market guidance, Base Chemicals sales volumes (excluding
    Polymers US products) are expected to be 1 – 2% higher than the prior year, and
    the total sales volumes are expected to be 15 – 20% higher than the prior year;
    and
-   Given the continuing macroeconomic headwinds and the softer outlook on global
    GDP growth in calendar year 2020, Performance Chemicals expects sales
    volumes for the full financial year to remain flat to slightly below the prior year’s
    level (excluding LCCP). Total sales volumes for the business are expected to be
    7 - 9% higher than the prior year.

SASOL CONFIRMS INCIDENT AT LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT
(LCCP) LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE UNIT

On Monday 13 January 2020 at 13:15 (US Central Standard Time), Sasol
experienced an explosion and fire at its LCCP low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit.

The fire was extinguished and all employees and contractors are safe and accounted
for.

The new LDPE unit had not yet achieved beneficial operation (BO) as planned for in
December 2019. The unit was in the final stages of commissioning and startup
when the incident occurred. The unit has been shut down and an investigation is
underway to determine the cause of the incident, the extent of the damage and
resulting impact on the LDPE unit's BO schedule.

All other Lake Charles units and previously commissioned LCCP units, namely the
ethane cracker, ethylene glycol/ethylene oxide and linear low-density polyethylene
units, are unaffected and operating to plan. The ethane cracker has achieved
nameplate capacity following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor
catalyst in the plant during December 2019.

The remaining three downstream units under construction to complete the integrated
LCCP site, Ziegler alcohols and alumina, alcohol ethoxylates and Guerbet alcohols,
are also unaffected and remain within cost and schedule as per our previous
guidance.

SASOL'S LAKE CHARLES CHEMICALS PROJECT (LCCP) ETHANE CRACKER
SUCCESSFULLY REPLACES ACETYLENE CATALYST AND INCREASES
ETHYLENE PRODUCTION RATES

Sasol is pleased to announce that the LCCP Ethane Cracker is increasing production
rates following the successful replacement of the acetylene reactor catalyst. The
Ethane Cracker achieved beneficial operation in August 2019 but has run approximately
50 - 60% of nameplate capacity due to underperformance of the plant's acetylene
removal system. This issue has now been resolved.

The outage to replace the catalyst was successfully completed on schedule and within
budget. Following the outage, the unit was started up smoothly and ethylene production
rates are approximately 85 - 90% of nameplate capacity and are increasing. Ethylene
quality meets US Gulf Coast ethylene pipeline specifications.

Sasol also looks forward to the completion of the LCCP Low Density Polyethylene
(LDPE) Unit which is being commissioned with beneficial operation expected later in
December 2019. The remaining three downstream units under construction to complete
the integrated LCCP site, Ziegler Alcohols and Alumina, Alcohol Ethoxylates, and
Guerbet Alcohols, remain on cost and schedule as per our previous guidance.
