ASPEN ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO MANUFACTURE INVESTIGATIONAL
COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE


Aspen is pleased to announce that one of its wholly-owned South African subsidiaries, Pharmacare Limited
(which trades as “Aspen Pharmacare”), has entered into a preliminary agreement with Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, two of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of
Johnson & Johnson, for the technical transfer and proposed commercial manufacture of their COVID-19
vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2-S.

The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing clinical trials. Aspen Pharmacare will perform formulation,
filling and secondary packaging of the vaccine for supply to Johnson & Johnson. This agreement is still
subject to the successful completion of the relevant technology transfer activities and finalisation of certain
commercial manufacturing terms.

Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to provide the necessary capacity required for the manufacture of Johnson
& Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at its existing sterile facility in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

Aspen has invested in excess of R3 billion in the facility containing the high technology equipment and
systems that will be used to manufacture state-of-the-art sterile drugs and vaccines, packaged into vials,
ampoules and pre-filled syringes. The production area where it is intended that the vaccine candidate will
be manufactured has capacity to produce more than 300 million doses per annum. The facility has
accreditation from a range of international regulatory authorities and provides lifesaving medicines to both
the domestic and international markets. It was part of the first flagship investments announced at the
President’s inaugural South African Investment conference.

DIVESTMENT OF ASPEN’S EUROPEAN THROMBOSIS BUSINESS TO MYLAN AND WITHDRAWAL OF
CAUTIONARY

Following the release of a cautionary announcement on 24 August 2020, Aspen is pleased to announce that,
Aspen Global Incorporated (“AGI”), its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Mauritius, has concluded an
agreement in terms of which Mylan Ireland Limited (“Mylan”) will acquire the commercialisation rights and
related intellectual property relating to Aspen’s Thrombosis Business in Europe 1 (the “Assets”) for a purchase
consideration of EUR 641.9 million, plus the cost of the related inventory (the “Transaction”). AGI’s
thrombosis products (the “Products”) are sold under the brand names, and variations of the brand names,
Arixtra, Fraxiparine, Mono-Embolex and Orgaran in Europe. Mylan has retained AGI (via its subsidiary, Aspen
France SAS, “Aspen France”) as its distributor of the Products in France.

The Transaction will be conditional upon the fulfilment of customary conditions precedent applicable to
transactions of this nature. It is anticipated that the Transaction will complete before 31 December 2020.

Mylan is a global pharmaceutical company, with principal offices in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, United States
of America. Mylan has a significant presence in Europe, generating sales of over USD 4 billion in 2019.

Transaction details

The disposal of the Assets comprises the following elements relating exclusively to the Products in Europe:

    -    intellectual property required for their commercialisation, and any related goodwill owned by AGI
         and its subsidiaries2;
    -    product registrations and marketing authorisations; and
    -    the related inventory3.


The purchase consideration payable by Mylan for the Assets, other than the inventory, of EUR 641.9 million
is structured as follows:

    -    Upfront cash consideration upon completion:                                     EUR 263.2 million
    -    Deferred cash consideration payable on 25 June 2021:                            EUR 378.7 million

The proceeds from the Transaction will be used to reduce the Group’s debt.

The transfer to Mylan of employees engaged in the Thrombosis Business will take place in accordance with
European labour law regulations.

Contemporaneously with the Transaction, Aspen and Mylan will enter into a Manufacturing and Supply
Agreement (the “MSA”) in terms of which Aspen will supply Products to Mylan for the Territory.

Financial information in respect of the Transaction

The Assets contributed approximately ZAR 1.91 billion4,5 in revenue, ZAR 0.53 billion5 in operating profit and
ZAR 0.45 billion5 in profit after tax6 to the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019. The Net Asset
Value of the Assets was approximately ZAR 9.25 billion7 as at 31 December 2019. It is expected that the net
proceeds from the Transaction will not vary materially from the Net Asset Value of the Assets at time of
completion of the Transaction.

Rationale

In March 2019, Aspen announced that it would undertake a strategic review in respect of its Europe CIS
Commercial business (“the Business”). The review has focused on assessing alternative models for the
conduct of the Business and in determining the range of available options with a view to optimising the
Group’s sustainable returns. In line with the objectives of the strategic review, Aspen is of the view that the
disposal of the commercialisation rights to the Products while continuing to manufacture and supply the
Products is an attractive option for the following reasons:

     •    the Transaction supports Aspen’s strategy of continuing to reshape the Group towards a greater
          concentration of revenue in Emerging Markets (“EMs”) – the Thrombosis business that Aspen will
          retain is almost exclusively in EMs and well supported by strong sales representation;
     •    the disposal will allow Aspen to achieve a more streamlined Business in Europe;
     •    in terms of the MSA, Aspen will continue to manufacture and supply the Products, contributing its
          significant expertise in the production of sterile injectables;
     •    the positive cash inflow from the proceeds of the disposal will allow Aspen to further strengthen its
          balance sheet and assist in establishing financial headroom for future investments; and
     •    Mylan represents the ideal partner to acquire these assets given the company’s strength in Europe,
          commitment to the injectables and biosimilars space and comparable employee-first culture and
          values.


Categorisation of the Transaction and Withdrawal of Cautionary

In terms of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements the Transaction is categorised as a Category 2 transaction.
This cautionary, as issued by Aspen on 24 August 2020, is hereby withdrawn.


1 Excludes Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States countries
2 Excluding certain goodwill relating to distribution of the Products in France
3 Excluding inventory in France where Aspen France will continue to distribute the Products
4 Includes revenue in France of ZAR 0.36 billion related to the Products that Aspen will continue to distribute and recognise the revenue
5 Aspen  average exchange rate for the six months ended 31 December 2019 was ZAR16.30 to 1 EUR
6 Profit after tax excludes any notional saving in interest paid arising from the repayment of borrowings with the net proceeds from
the Transaction
7 Aspen closing exchange rate as at the 31 December 2019 was ZAR15.69 to 1 EUR

TRADING STATEMENT


This trading statement is provided to Aspen Holdings shareholders as guidance on the key
performance metrics relating to the results of the Group for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020,
expected to be published on SENS on 9 September 2020, after market close.

The results of the Group for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020 are in line with the updated
guidance provided at the H1 2020 interim results presentation. The key performance metrics set out
below refer to continuing operations unless stated otherwise:

-   Revenue growth as reported, and in constant exchange rates (“CER”), is expected to be within the
    following range:

          Reported revenue growth:       8% to 10%
          CER revenue growth:            3% to 5%

    The difference between reported and CER revenue growth arises due to the material weakening of
    the ZAR against the majority of the other currencies in which Aspen trades in the fourth quarter.

-   Reported revenue growth from Commercial Pharmaceuticals is expected to be between 5% and
    7% and CER growth between 1% and 2%. Positive demand trends for Sterile Focus Brands used in
    the clinical management of COVID-19, the stockpiling of everyday healthcare products and
    advanced filling of prescriptions by consumers positively impacted performance during the early
    and peak periods of COVID-19 infections across several regions. These positive trends were more
    than offset by a decrease in demand as stock levels normalised, delays in the recovery of elective
    surgeries in most regions and reduced infection rates in non-COVID communicable diseases due to
    social distancing. Manufacturing revenue has delivered strong double-digit growth, both reported
    and CER, favourably impacted by the commercial sales of heparin to third parties. Non-heparin
    APIs sales have performed particularly well in H2 2020 assisted by Aspen’s ability to ensure
    consistent supply of product to the market despite the pandemic.

-   The Group delivered strong operating cash flows, benefitting from a positive cash inflow from
    working capital for the twelve months to 30 June 2020.

-   The operating cash flow to headline earnings conversion ratio is expected to be reported at more
    than 130% for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020, up from 107% for the twelve months to 30
    June 2019.

-   Net borrowings declined to approximately ZAR 35,2 billion at 30 June 2020 from ZAR 37,9 billion at
    31 December 2019. The reduction in net borrowings from net cash generated for the period and
    proceeds from disposals was diluted by unfavourable currency movements arising from the
    weakening of the ZAR relative to the EUR and the AUD which inflated the ZAR value of Aspen’s
    debt denominated in those currencies.

-   The leverage ratio, for banking covenant measurement purposes, is expected to be between 2.85x
    and 3.0x against a threshold of 3.5x, as at 30 June 2020. This is a positive outcome which brings
    the Group within range of its medium-term target of a leverage ratio of less than 3.0x.

-   Intangible and tangible asset impairments arising from rigorous and detailed annual impairment
    tests are expected to be approximately ZAR 1,5 billion in FY 2020 as compared to ZAR 3,8 billion in
    the prior comparable period.

-   The Japanese Business and public sector ARVs were classified to discontinued operations for the
    period ended 31 December 2019 and are excluded from the continuing operations for the twelve
    months ended 30 June 2020.

Normalised headline earnings per share (“NHEPS”) comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for
specific non-trading items in accordance with Aspen’s accounting policies. NHEPS is the primary measure
used by management to assess Aspen’s underlying financial performance. NHEPS for the year ended 30
June 2020 is expected to vary from that reported in the prior year ended 30 June 2019 within the
following ranges:

ASPEN’S PROPOSED COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PRELIMINARY
ASSESSMENT REGARDING PRICING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMIC AREA

In May 2017, the European Commission (“the Commission”) opened an investigation of Aspen
Holdings and certain of its European subsidiaries (“Aspen”) under Articles 102(a) of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area
Agreement (“EEAA”). The investigation was in respect of the molecules (i) Chlorambucil; (ii)
Melphalan; (iii) Mercaptopurine; (iv) Tioguanine; and (v) Busulfan (“the Products”) sold in the
European Economic Area(1) (excluding Italy) (“EEA”).

The Commission has now adopted a preliminary assessment, following its investigation, setting out
concerns that Aspen may have abused its dominant position by imposing unfair prices pursuant to
Article 102(a) TFEU and Article 54 of the EEAA.

The Products generated approximately EUR 28 million in revenue for the financial year ended 30
June 2020 in the EEA. Over 80% of the revenue is generated by solid dose form Products that are
currently sold at an average price of less than EUR 2 per tablet and approximately EUR 3 per patient
per day, this despite the Products’ low volumes (each Product treats, on average, around 200
patients per year per EEA Member State with one product having an average as low as 8 patients).
The average prices of all of the Products are well below those of certain other post-patent originator
oncology drugs that face generic competition in the EEA. In addition, in a number of Member States,
certain of the Products faced higher priced generic equivalents.

Consequently, Aspen disagrees with the Commission’s preliminary assessment. Notwithstanding
this, in order to meet the Commission’s competition concerns, Aspen has proposed commitments
pursuant to Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 (“the Proposed Commitments”).

The Commission has responded positively to the Proposed Commitments which it intends to accept,
subject to market testing. Market testing will allow interested third parties to submit their
observations on the Proposed Commitments to the Commission within the next two months. If the
result of the market testing is favourable the Proposed Commitments will become binding upon
Aspen and the Commission will close its investigation without any finding against Aspen.

The key elements of the Proposed Commitments are as follows:
   - Average price reductions per Product across the EEA of between 27% and 79% (overall
     average of 73%);
   - Aspen to maintain such reduced prices for ten years and guarantee supply for at least five
     years;
   - After five years, should Aspen wish to cease commercialising any of the Products it will make
     them available for sale to a third party, or absent an interested purchaser, maintain the
     marketing authorisations; and
   - Aspen will make a one-time payment to the relevant entities responsible for reimbursement
     of medicines and other beneficiaries as appropriate to bridge the implementation of the
     price reductions.

Aspen is focused on ensuring supply and access to affordable pharmaceuticals for our patients and
will continue to cooperate with the Commission to prioritise patient needs. This is consistent with
Aspen’s vision of providing quality affordable medicines, an object achieved over many years and
reflected in the role it has played in saving millions of lives across Africa through pioneering and
supplying generic anti-retroviral medicine for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The current COVID-19
crisis has further demonstrated the importance of governments and companies cooperating to
prioritise access to pharmaceuticals. Aspen, as a leading supplier of Anaesthetics, Thrombosis
treatments and most recently dexamethasone, has and will continue to work closely with
authorities to ensure the supply of medically critical products throughout the world, including in the
EEA.

Aspen is pleased that the Commission has responded positively to the Proposed Commitments and
is hopeful that the result of the market testing will also be supportive of the proposed resolution of
this matter.

Footnotes:
(1)The European Economic Area comprises the EU Member States (including the United Kingdom) together with
   Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

(2)Article 9 enables companies under investigation by the Commission to offer commitments in order to meet the
   Commission's concern. If the market test indicates that the commitments are a satisfactory way of addressing the
   Commission's competition concerns, the Commission intends to adopt a decision making the commitments legally
   binding on Aspen. Such a decision would legally bind Aspen to respect the commitments it has offered and would result
   in no finding that there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules.

VOLUNTARY UPDATE FOR THE 10 MONTHS ENDED 30 APRIL 2020


During these unprecedented times, Aspen management and Board have been monitoring the risks and
challenges associated with COVID-19, taking the necessary steps to maintain delivery of quality medicines
to patients across our regions while safeguarding the health and safety of our employees. Our immediate
focus under COVID-19 has been to establish processes aimed at ensuring optimum production and the
responsible allocation of essential drugs through heightened focus on our production and supply chain
activities.

Aspen is experiencing an elevated demand for certain of its Sterile Brands in Europe. These products are of
critical importance in the clinical management of patients infected with COVID-19 and we are making every
effort to support the healthcare authorities in Europe and the other regions where we operate. We wish to,
again, express our heartfelt gratitude to our employees throughout the world who have shown great
resilience, dedication and fortitude in allowing Aspen to continue to operate, ensuring delivery of
medicines to patients and caregivers reliant on our products during these exceptional times. In particular,
we highlight the commitment of Aspen’s production workers who leave the safety of their homes each day
to produce medicines for patients around the world.

Performance for the 10 months ended 30 April 2020

Commercial Pharmaceuticals

Our Commercial Pharmaceuticals business is divided into two segments, namely Sterile Brands and
Regional Brands. Certain products within both these segments have relevance in the management of
COVID-19, however the impact of the virus on the business has varied between regions.

Within the Sterile Brands business, elevated demand for Anaesthetics in Europe CIS towards the latter part
of the 10-month period has offset the expected decline in the Chinese business brought about by the
postponement of elective surgeries and less frequent haemodialysis treatment of patients during the first
four months of the calendar year 2020. The Chinese business has shown signs of recovery since the easing
of the restrictions in that country. In Europe CIS, Aspen’s largest Thrombosis region, the effect of COVID-19
on Thrombosis demand has been largely neutral, with declines in elective surgical procedures being
countered by increased hospitalisation rates of medically ill patients. The restructuring of the Thrombosis
business in Europe CIS has supported the continuing recovery of this business segment.

Stockpiling of everyday healthcare products and advanced filling of prescriptions by consumers in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the Regional Brands business. This has led to
overstocking in supply channels and in households which we anticipate will result in decreased demand
over the next few months as stock levels equalise.
Manufacturing

Aspen’s manufacturing facilities have maintained operations at normal capacity, with enhanced safety
measures introduced to protect employees. Aspen’s API manufacturing business has been positively
impacted by the sale of heparin API to third parties, while the underlying API and finished dose form
operations have also continued to perform well.

Europe CIS strategic review

The strategic review and internal restructuring undertaken in respect of the Europe CIS business has been
ongoing. Management continue to expect to finalise the outcomes of this strategic review and conclude on
an appropriate course of action by September 2020.

Capital Expenditure

Progress on strategic capital expenditure projects related to construction of manufacturing facilities for the
Anaesthetics products as well as smaller projects have been hampered by country specific COVID-19
restrictions and will resume as and when local regulations allow.

Working capital

Aspen’s maintenance of reasonable levels of safety stock through its value chain has, to date, stood us in
good stead during the COVID-19 crisis, allowing Aspen to continue to supply essential medicines to patients
in need around the world. In Europe, which has been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19, Aspen has been
well supported by its important manufacturing sites in France, Germany and the Netherlands and has
managed to redirect inventory successfully to the locations most in need. Aspen is also working hard with
its contract manufacturers and suppliers to overcome logistics hurdles as these arise in order to ensure
ongoing replenishment of finished products and raw materials. Careful attention is being paid to collections
of receivables and Aspen is ensuring that all of its creditors are paid to terms in this time of heightened
financial pressure on many businesses.



FY 2020 outlook

The Group outlook for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020, as published on 6 March 2020, did not take into
account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainty surrounding the severity, impact and
duration of COVID-19 prevents Aspen from reliably assessing and quantifying the future impact of the virus
on the business. The unusual demand patterns experienced during the first four months of the calendar
year 2020 do not necessarily represent trends which will persist over the rest of the period of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Aspen completed the disposal of its Japanese business at the end of January 2020 and applied the net
proceeds received from it to repaying short dated Euro denominated debt. Aspen’s leverage ratio will be
measured at 30 June 2020 against a covenant level of 3.5x. The Group expects to deliver a leverage ratio
below this covenant level, as guided at the interim results presentation in March 2020. Aspen has reviewed
and is comfortable with its liquidity position.

The Group maintains the outlook published with its interim results announcement in March 2020 for
Normalised HEPS from continuing operations in FY 2020 to be higher as compared to the prior year
Normalised HEPS from continuing operations of R13.50.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty presently being encountered as a consequence of the pandemic, as
more information becomes available, the outlook for FY 2020 will be updated if deemed necessary. Aspen
is scheduled to release its annual result for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020 on 09 September 2020.
The financial information in this update has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group’s auditors.

VOLUNTARY TRADING STATEMENT

This voluntary trading statement is provided to Aspen Holdings shareholders as guidance on the key
performance metrics relating to the results of the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019,
expected to be published on SENS on 5 March 2020, after market close. The Japanese Business and South
African public sector ARVs (commercial related activities only) have been reclassified to discontinued
operations for the period ended 31 December 2019 and the results have been restated for the comparative
period ended 31 December 2018.

The results of the Group for the six months ended 31 December 2019 are slightly ahead of the guidance
provided at the 2019 full year results presentation, supported by the performance of Commercial
Pharmaceuticals in certain regions and heparin sales to third parties. The key performance metrics set out
below refer to continuing operations unless stated otherwise:

*   Revenue growth as reported, and in constant exchange rates (""CER""), is expected to be within the
    following range:

          Reported and CER revenue growth:         2% to 4%

*   Revenue growth (CER) from Commercial Pharmaceuticals is expected to be between 1% and 3%.
    Manufacturing revenue has been favourably impacted by the reinitiating of commercial sales of heparin
    API to third parties, with underlying operations performing in line with expectations.

*   Included in Other operating income is an amount of ZAR 147 million relating to the receipt of the
    Hydroxyprogestrone caproate (HPC) milestone payment (USD 10 million) in August 2019.

*   The Group delivered improved operating cash flows over the comparable period in the prior year, for the
    six months to 31 December 2019.

*   The operating cash flow to headline earnings conversion ratio is expected to be reported at more than
    80% for the six months ended 31 December 2019, up from 43% for the six months to 31 December 2018.
    Aspen has a cyclically stronger operating cash flow in the second half of the financial year.

*   Net borrowings declined to approximately ZAR 38.0 billion at 31 December 2019. The implementation of
    IFRS 16 - leases on a modified retrospective basis was immaterial from an income statement perspective
    but did result in a once off increase in borrowings of ZAR 550 million.

*   The leverage ratio is expected to end between 3.50x and 3.60x against a covenant threshold of 4.0x, as
    at 31 December 2019. Assuming the net proceeds from the sale of the Japanese Business (EUR 270.3
    million) were received on 31 December 2019 and these proceeds were applied to the net borrowings in
    its entirety at this date, the pro-forma leverage ratio would have been between 3.20x and 3.30x. The net
    proceeds of EUR 270.3 million from the sale of the Japanese Business were received in February 2020.

*   Potential intangible asset impairment risk has been assessed based on the performance for the six
    months ended 31 December 2019 and expected performance for the 12 months ending 30 June 2020.
    Certain Regional Brands were identified due to lower performance vs prior expectations, and the
    resulting impairment is expected to be ZAR 500 million. A rigorous and detailed impairment test of
    tangible and intangible asset values is performed annually, at year-end based upon updated long-term
    future forecasts.
The Japan Business and public sector ARVs have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the period
ended 31 December 2019. The continuing operations for the prior period have been restated taking into the
following discontinued operations:
     * Japan Business (1)
     * Public sector ARVs (2)
     * Nutritionals Business
     * Asia Pacific non-core pharmaceutical portfolio

Note 1: In November 2019, the Group concluded an agreement (subject to conditions precedent) to divest
of its Japanese operations and any related intellectual property to Sandoz, a Novartis Division. The Japan
Business has been classified as a discontinued operation with all related assets and liabilities transferred to
assets-held-for-sale in terms of IFRS 5. The disposal transaction was concluded effective 31 January 2020.

Note 2: The Group concluded a transaction in September 2019 (subject to conditions precedent, which have
not yet been fulfilled) in terms of which the commercialisation and distribution rights for its major public
sector ARVs were licensed to Laurus, a leading Indian API manufacturer. In terms of the agreement, Aspen
would continue to manufacture the products for Laurus. The deal forms part of Aspen's strategy to exit the
commercialisation of public sector ARVs while ensuring that patients have access to competitively priced and
effective treatment.

Normalised headline earnings per share (""NHEPS"") for the year ended 31 December 2019 is expected to vary from those reported in the prior year ended 31 December 2018 within the following ranges:

*NHEPS continuing has been restated taking into account the impact of discontinued operations, namely the Nutritionals Business, the Asia Pacific
non-core pharmaceutical portfolio, Japan Business and the South African public sector ARVs. The net impact is a decrease of 83.2 cents to NHEPS
continuing for the six months ended 31 December 2018.


Note 3: NHEPS comprises headline earnings per share adjusted for specific non-trading items. NHEPS is the primary measure used by management to assess Aspen's underlying financial performance.
