INTERNAL TRANSFER OF NEDBANK GROUP LIMITED (“NEDBANK”) SHARES FROM OMLACSA TO OLD MUTUAL
EMERGING MARKETS PROPRIETARY LIMITED (“OMEM”)

OMLACSA hereby notifies its debt investors that it intends to transfer 62 131 692 Nedbank ordinary shares
(“Nedbank shares”) internally to OMEM (“the Transaction”). OMLACSA and OMEM are both wholly owned
subsidiaries of Old Mutual Limited (“OML”). The Transaction is subject to receiving the necessary regulatory
approval and will result in greater capital efficiency for the group.

The Transaction will have no impact on the financial results and net assets of OML as this transaction does not
change the total number of Nedbank shares held by the Old Mutual group. In the separate financial statements
of OMLACSA, the Transaction will result in a reduction in the net asset value equivalent to the market value of
the Nedbank shares transferred to OMEM (at 30 June 2020, the market value of the Nedbank shares, based on
a share price of R101.55 per share, was c.R6,3 billion). The net asset value of OMLACSA will change further by
the recognition of deferred tax on the Nedbank shares that remain within OMLACSA.

At the end of June 2020, the solvency ratio was 182% for the OML group and 208% for OMLACSA. Post the
Transaction, the solvency ratios of Old Mutual group and OMLACSA are expected to remain comfortably within
the solvency target ranges. This demonstrates the capital strength and resilience of our balance sheet.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our business, our lives and on how we work and interact. Although the resultant lockdown adversely
affected us, particularly the productivity of our physical distribution channels, we were agile and adapted to this new normal. We leveraged our digital
capability and through the use of digital sales platforms and the provision of data and network access, we enabled most of our employees and certain of our
advisers to work remotely. There is still a considerable amount of uncertainty around what we can expect within the next 12 months. However, we believe we
have taken sufficient actions to provide for the impact of the pandemic in the short term. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make further
provisions if necessary. We believe that the actions we have taken to maintain our capacity will allow us to take advantage of opportunities in this
environment and be in a position to accelerate activity as restrictions are lifted.

Although the pandemic adversely affected earnings in the first half of the year, our business remains robust, with sufficient levels of liquidity and strong
solvency positions in our regulated subsidiaries. We have performed stress tests to assess our liquidity and solvency positions under various recovery
scenarios. In all scenarios, our liquidity levels remain positive and our solvency ratio remains within our target range. Due to the significant level of
uncertainty in the current environment we have deferred our decision to declare an interim dividend. We believe this action is necessary in a period of
heightened uncertainty and we will revisit this decision for the full year dividend declaration when we have more clarity on the shape of possible economic
recovery scenarios.

New business sales volumes were negatively impacted, as most of our tied advisers in the Mass and Foundation Cluster were unable to sell during the lockdown
period due to the partial closure of the branch network and lack of access to customers' homes, worksites and branches. In Personal Finance, the impact was
less severe as we could enable remote working for a larger proportion of advisers. Although lockdown restrictions have been eased, and economic activity has
somewhat resumed, sales levels remain below prior year levels. The continued financial pressure on our customers led to a decline in sales activity and poor
persistency experience, which adversely affected distribution efficiencies. Customers also opted for lower margin risk and investment products resulting in a
significant decline in VNB compared to the prior year. The decline in closing and average equity markets led to pressure on our asset based fees and resulted
in unrealised mark to market losses in our equity portfolios. Initially lagging the equity markets, credit spreads widened in the second quarter as the
crisis contributed to a weakening economic outlook. Credit spreads increased by between 50bps and 100bps, higher than increases seen in the previous
financial crisis, resulting in significant mark to market losses in our unlisted credit portfolio. There was an increase in business interruption and rescue
claims in Old Mutual Insure during the second quarter.

We have presented certain of these COVID-19 impacts separately within our presentation of Results from Operations, in order to reflect the underlying results
of our segments on a more comparable basis to the prior year. Only items that are separately identifiable and reliably measurable have been presented in this
line item. Accordingly, Normalised Results from Operations, excluding COVID-19 impacts, was down 4% from the prior year largely driven by a significant
decrease in Mass and Foundation Cluster's profits due to lower sales volumes, poor persistency, and higher credit losses experienced in Old Mutual Finance due
to the strengthening of our provisioning. This was mostly offset by a decrease in catastrophe losses in Old Mutual Insure and growth in profits of Personal
Finance and Wealth Management due to improved mortality and a release of reserves following a change in the investment strategy for the closed annuity fund.
Rest of Africa profits were up 27% mostly due to lower losses in West Africa and foreign exchange gains as the rand depreciated most notably against the
Kenyan shilling and Malawian kwacha.

Despite the changes the pandemic has brought to the business, our focus remains unchanged. We continue to put customers first and simplify our business
through digital transformation. With the scaling of Old Mutual Protect, we have implemented digitalised customer and intermediary service models with a large
degree of straight-through processing. Continued use of robotics and artificial intelligence to service customers and process transactions have saved 8
million processing minutes to date. These initiatives do not only provide a better experience for customers and intermediaries, but also simplify various
business processes which lead to cost efficiencies. We continue to drive our cloud strategy via Amazon WebServices, with the first 85 workloads now live on
the cloud. This has resulted in no unplanned downtime experience for customers and has allowed us to rapidly deploy solutions across the business.

Changes in the macro environment including negative GDP growth forecasts and interest rate cuts, have resulted in increased uncertainty around future cash
flow projections for certain assets. This has resulted in the recognition of impairments in respect of the carrying value of our investment in Nedbank and the
goodwill related to our investment in Old Mutual Finance. In calculating the valuation for our investment in Nedbank we performed a range of valuations
assuming several different earnings and economic recovery scenarios and, although in certain scenarios a higher value could be supported, greater weight was
given to the downside scenarios given the increased uncertainty around forward looking information in the current environment. These impairments are
recognised in the IFRS income statement, however, are not recognised in Headline Earnings (HE) as this is an explicit adjusting item in accordance with the
JSE Circular. Accordingly they are also not recognised in AHE.

OUTLOOK

The increased levels of forecast risk and observed variability in possible recovery scenarios has made it increasingly difficult to provide guidance around
the achievement of previously disclosed medium term targets. In light of this, we are withdrawing our guidance in respect of these targets and replacing them
with targets more appropriate for measuring our progress as we transition the business through the crisis. These targets focus on the maintenance of
appropriate levels of solvency and liquidity and improving the efficiency of our business given the pressure on revenues COVID-19 introduces. To demonstrate
improved efficiency we will deliver R750 million of pre-tax run rate savings on a like for like basis by the end of 2022. During the second half of 2020 we
will focus on improving adviser productivity to normalised levels as rapidly as possible, improving customer access through increased digitalisation and
finding opportunities for further cost efficiencies. Further guidance on expected outcomes for the full year 2020 will follow once we have greater certainty
on the expected impacts of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.

TRADING STATEMENT

In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised that we expect HEPS and EPS for the year ended 31
December 2020 to be more than 20% lower than the reported HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (FY 2019 HEPS: 236.1 cents, FY 2019 EPS: 208.3 cents) due to
the significant impact COVID-19 has had on our results. We will publish a further update once there is more certainty on the probable ranges of the expected
decrease in HEPS and EPS.

TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited is currently in the process of
finalising its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 (""current
period""). This trading statement provides an indication of a range for Headline
Earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity holders
of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements compared to the six months ended 30 June 2019
(""comparative period""). The Group's interim results will be released on the
Stock Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Tuesday, 1 September 2020.

Further to our previous communication to shareholders on the 29 May 2020, the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on our business,
our lives and how we work and interact. Government enforced restrictions to
control the spread of COVID-19 in most geographies we operate in have
dramatically reduced the level of economic activity during the first half of
2020 and negatively impacted growth forecasts for the remainder of the year. In
this challenging environment we adapted to this new normal by leveraging our
digital capability to enable most of our employees and certain of our advisers
to work remotely.

New business sales volumes were negatively impacted, as most of our tied
advisers were unable to sell during the lockdown period due to the partial
closure of the branch network and lack of access to customers’ homes, worksites
and branches. Although lockdown restrictions have been eased, and economic
activity has somewhat resumed, sales levels remain below prior year levels.
This impact was most severe in the Mass and Foundation Cluster, where sales
volumes were too low to cover the largely fixed initial expenses and this
resulted in negative Value of New Business for H1 2020 for this segment.

Although local and global equity markets have recovered in the second quarter,
the JSE SWIX was down 8% at the end of June 2020 and average equity market
levels were 10% lower than the prior year. During the second quarter we saw
credit spreads widening by between 50bps and 100bps, more than increases in
previous market crises.

Throughout the period, in this tough economic environment, our solvency capital
has remained strong. At the end of June 2020, the solvency ratio was 182% for
the Group and 208% for OMLACSA. This demonstrates the capital strength and
resilience of our Group to withstand periods of prolonged market stresses and
positions us well to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.

The significant deterioration in the operating environment compared to the
comparative period has however negatively impacted our earnings. While there is
still much uncertainty around the pandemic and the impact that it will have on
experience, we have raised short term provisions in anticipation of worsening
mortality, morbidity and persistency experience in the second half of 2020.
These reserves are intended to allow for expected short term variances to our
long term assumptions.

Weaker growth forecasts and higher observed credit spreads have led to notable
unrealised mark to market losses in the first half of the year in our unlisted
equity and credit portfolios in Specialised Finance, although we believe the
quality of our credit book remains high. As these are unrealised they could
reverse in future periods as market conditions recover. We have also increased
our provisions for expected credit losses in Old Mutual Finance in recognition
of declining GDP forecasts, and the anticipated impact of this on future credit
losses.

There was an increase in business interruption (BI) claims in Old Mutual Insure
during the second quarter. We also made a decision to offer commercial
settlements to certain qualifying Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME)
customers to enable them to continue operating.

Taking into account the operating environment and factors outlined above
shareholders are advised that the Group’s key profit measures are expected to
fall within the ranges outlined below:

 Key Performance Indicators
 (R million unless stated                  Estimated          Estimated
 otherwise)                                 % change       30 June 2020   30 June 2019
 Results from Operations              (61%) to (71%)      1,760 - 1,308          4,512
 Adjusted Headline Earnings           (62%) to (72%)      1,980 - 1,459          5,211
 AHEPS (cents)¹                       (60%) to (70%)        43.7 - 32.7          109.1

1. AHEPS defined as Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by WANS adjusted to reflect the
Group's BBE shares and shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds.

The notable decrease in the GDP growth for South Africa and increased
uncertainty around future cashflow projections is expected to result in the
recognition of material impairments in respect of the carrying value of our
investment in Nedbank and the goodwill related to our investment in Old Mutual
Finance. These impairments are recognised in the IFRS income statement,
however, are not recognised in Headline Earnings as this is an explicit
adjusting item in accordance with the JSE Circular. Accordingly they are also
not recognised in Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE).

Headline earnings is higher than AHE, as AHE excludes the results related to
the operations of Residual plc and Zimbabwe and the adjustment in respect of
investment return for group equity and debt instruments held in life funds, all
of which were positive in H1 2020.

Taking into account the decrease in operating earnings and the significant
impairments outlined above shareholders are advised that HEPS and Basic EPS are
expected to fall within the ranges outlined below:

 Key Performance Indicators
 (R million unless stated                  Estimated   Estimated 30 June
 otherwise)                                 % change                2020   30 June 2019
 Headline Earnings                    (23%) to (33%)       4,507 - 3,922          5,854
 HEPS (cents)                         (20%) to (30%)        102.5 - 89.7          128.1
 IFRS profit after tax                  Greater than    (5,621) - (6,745)         5,817
 attributable to equity holders               (100%)
 of the parent
 Basic EPS (cents)                      Greater than    (128.5) - (154.2)         127.3

OLD MUTUAL VOLUNTARY OPERATING UPDATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 MARCH 2020
AND TRADING STATEMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2020.


The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has had far reaching impacts on the global
economy, with many countries around the world enforcing lockdowns in varying
severity. The significant declines seen in global capital markets and commodity
prices, the decrease in economic activity due to lockdown restrictions and low
investor and consumer confidence have created a challenging operating
environment for businesses and individuals. In South Africa, the pandemic has
resulted in the rand weakening against major currencies and substantial
outflows from the local bond and equity markets following a further credit
rating downgrade.

To manage the spread of COVID-19, governments in most countries where we operate
have introduced full or partial lockdowns, restricting the movement of goods and
people. Despite the start of gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, we expect
a slow recovery due to the severity of global and local economic contraction
suffered during the crisis. During this pandemic the safety and wellbeing of our
employees, intermediaries and customers remains a top priority. The Group has
experienced minimal disruption to our business operations, with the exception of
our distribution processes where the disruption levels have been higher. We were
able to successfully mobilise and enable the majority of our employees to work
from home and this has allowed us to continue to serve our customers. Although
lockdown restrictions are being eased we envisage that all those business
functions able to operate effectively from home will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future to minimise the number of employees physically onsite in our
primary office locations of Pinelands and Sandton. The small group of employees
who are working from our premises have been engaged and briefed on the strict
protocols they need to follow to ensure their safety, and the safety of other
employees and our customers remains a priority.


Many of our tied advisers have been unable to sell during the lockdown period
due to the partial closure of the branch network and lack of access to customer’s
homes, worksites and branches. The majority of our branch consultants are unable
to work from home and therefore the necessary closure of the majority of our
branch network has slowed loan disbursements and negatively impacted funeral,
savings and credit life sales. These factors have significantly impacted
productivity and new business acquisition during April and May. We have
implemented various intermediary initiatives during lockdown including the
provision of airtime and network access to enable communication with customers,
promotion of digital platforms for sales and the introduction of lower hurdles
for academy advisors to earn base allowances for the duration of the lockdown.
We are actively monitoring the lifting of restrictions to ensure we can return
to full operating capacity as soon as restrictions are lifted.

We have continued to make progress against our strategic priorities during the
first quarter, with focus on improving our customer enablement and servicing
journey and digitally enabling our employees. We have implemented a number of
enhancements and introduced new digital channels and functionality such as the
use of USSD and WhatsApp platforms to service funeral claims and
disinvestments. We added Old Mutual Insure to our Rewards programme, and new
rewards partners such as Uber and Checkers are expected to assist our rewards
members during this difficult period. We have been able to continue with the
roll out of Old Mutual Protect to customers and onboarding of advisers, with
over 1,000 advisers now using the product.


Capital position and Liquidity


The Group’s liquidity management remains robust and we have cash reserves more
than sufficient to cover our business requirements. We have performed a series
of stress tests to assess our liquidity position under various recovery scenarios
and liquidity levels remain positive under all of these.


The solvency ratio for OMLACSA for the three months ended 31 March 2020 was 211%,
at the top end of our target range of 175%-210%. The decrease in our solvency
ratio from the reported 216% in our FY2019 results, was largely due to a reduction
in own funds driven by the significant decrease in Nedbank’s share price year to
date and a decrease in the related solvency capital requirement. The impact on
our capital ratio of market driven decreases on the rest of the portfolio was
largely mitigated by our hedging programme, which proved effective during this
period of volatility. We also continue to monitor our Group solvency ratio and
we remain well within our target range of 155%-175%.


Following the severe market downturn in March 2020, the monthly investment
returns earned on our Absolute Growth Portfolios, our flagship smoothed bonus
portfolios, fell to negative levels in excess of -15%. We exercised our right
of discretion to declare a less severe negative bonus of -5% to protect benefit
payments to customers. This is the first time in the history of this product
that a negative bonus has been declared and we remain confident that the Bonus
Smoothing Reserve will be restored over the medium term. Investment risk for our
customers is being managed through the diversification of underlying portfolios
within mandate, the smoothing of investment returns and the offering of explicit
capital guarantees. The guarantee risk for shareholders is managed on an ongoing
basis through various management actions including applying Market Value
Adjustments to voluntary withdrawals, reducing bonuses, declaring negative
bonuses or removing non-guaranteed account values. In addition, the Group holds
an explicit Investment Guarantee Reserve and employs a hedging strategy on the
assets supporting this reserve. Our smoothed bonus funds have been managed well
during this period of volatility.

 (RFO)
1Comparative   amounts represent FY2019 balances.


Life APE sales have decreased largely due to lower recurring premiums flows
experienced across the business partially offset by strong single premium sales.
The decline in recurring premium life sales is driven by lower umbrella sales in
Old Mutual Corporate and lower sales volumes in Mass and Foundation Cluster and
Personal Finance, reflecting lower levels of customer disposable income.


Net Client Cash Flow remains positive due to strong single premium life sales
and higher institutional and retail inflows in Wealth and Investments, despite
increased outflows as customers seek liquidity and withdraw funds to supplement
income. FUM levels have decreased largely due to a decrease in equity market
levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the positive
impact of foreign denominated FUM due to the weakening rand.


We experienced stable growth in Loans and Advances compared to the prior year,
with deliberate slowed disbursements to manage credit risk. Gross Written
Premiums showed good growth driven by the ongoing benefits from strategic
partnerships in Old Mutual Insure and strong renewal rates and new business
acquisition in East Africa.


The decrease in RFO is due to lower asset based fees and negative fair value
movements on unlisted equity and credit portfolios in Wealth and Investments.
Lower life sales volumes not sufficient to cover fixed distribution related
costs, deterioration in underwriting experience in Old Mutual Corporate and the
impact of poor persistency and higher credit losses, specifically in Mass and
Foundation Cluster have further contributed to the decline in profits. This was
partially offset by improved underwriting experience in Old Mutual Insure
compared to significant catastrophe losses in the prior year.


Trading update


Despite a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in South Africa and in many
countries where we operate, we expect the pandemic to impact our performance for
the remainder of the 2020 financial year as levels of uncertainty continue to
impact economic conditions and consumer confidence. The value of issued life
sales in the month of April was significantly lower than in the prior year,
reflecting the impact on our sales force. Issued sales in Mass and Foundation
Cluster were down around 90% and almost 50% in Personal Finance, respectively.
We expect sales levels to recover subsequent to lockdown and specific management
actions have been put in place to accelerate sales and greater access to
customers. The significant drop in issued sales will negatively impact reported
Life APE sales in H1 2020, and therefore we expected this metric to be lower
than prior year as the impact of lower issued sales volumes comes through.


Low levels of issued sales in April and May, whilst the distribution cost base
remains largely fixed, will have a negative impact on our reported profits and
Value of New Business (VNB) for H1 2020. Initiatives in the form of premium
holidays, discounts and deferrals of rate increases will pose further downside
pressure on revenue levels. In response, expenses are being tightly managed.


The risk of rising infection rates may adversely impact mortality experience,
whilst other COVID-19 related claims such as business interruption claims could
also negatively impact underwriting experience. We have seen an increase in
business interruption incidents in April and May, however we expect to be able
to rely on our existing reinsurance programme. The consumer will remain under
significant pressure, with increased levels of unemployment expected. This is
likely to reduce levels of disposable income resulting in lower sales volumes,
worse persistency and higher credit losses on our loan book. Shareholder
investment returns are expected to be below prior year due to year to date
decline in the equity markets and negative fair value movements on certain
classes of invested shareholder assets.


Taking into account these indicators of H1 2020 performance, In terms of paragraph
3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, shareholders are advised
that Headline Earnings per share (HEPS) and Earnings per share (EPS) for the six
months ended 30 June 2020 are expected to be more than 20% lower than the reported
HEPS and EPS for the comparable period (H1 2019 HEPS: 128.1 cents, H1 2019 EPS:
127.3 cents). We will publish a further update once there is more certainty on
the probable ranges of the decrease in HEPS and EPS.


Our contribution to society

We have remained conscious of our commitment to support our customers and
communities in this time of severe stress and continue to make positive
contributions through various initiatives.

Key initiatives include the following:

?   R4 billion worth of free life cover made available to approximately 430 000
    registered healthcare workers across South Africa.
?   We pledged R50 million towards relief efforts that address immediate
    educational needs, hygiene awareness and nutritional support and R5 million
    towards national initiatives that provide access to personal protective
    equipment for essential service workers. As part of these efforts, we have
    refurbished a former training centre close to our office in Pinelands which
    will in part be used by Lancet Laboratories for COVID-19 testing. The remainder
    of the facility was refurbished as an isolation and quarantine facility and
    handed over to the Western Cape government on 27 May 2020.
?     Our business in Namibia committed N$5 million towards the provision of food
      supplies, the expansion of testing capacity, and the National Disaster Fund.
      In Kenya, we contributed KES6 million in support of government initiatives to
      contain the virus. In Zimbabwe, we offered ZWL$2 billion life insurance cover
      to health professionals on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19.
?     We are providing ongoing customer relief such as premium payment holidays,
      premium discounts, delays in annual rate and fee reviews and grace periods
      for loan repayments.
?     We included the Solidarity Fund as a beneficiary on our staff Payroll Giving
      Programme in which employees are encouraged to give generously. Our Executive
      Committee members agreed to forego salary increases and the company is
      directing these funds to the Solidarity Fund.
?     Old Mutual Insure pledged R50 million in total to support SME customers and
      partners during this period.


Outlook


Over the past few weeks, we have performed a detailed scenario planning exercise
which has focused on modelling the financial impact on key earnings, liquidity
and capital measures under a range of possible economic scenarios. The outcome
of these scenarios shows that, whilst we do expect to experience earnings pressure
in the short term, our capital and liquidity remain at appropriate levels in
all scenarios, with the Group solvency capital ratio falling marginally below
our target range pre-management actions only in the most extreme scenario tested.
In order to mitigate the expected pressure on earnings we have implemented a
series of management actions focusing on reducing expenses in 2020. We are also
working on a number of medium term initiatives to capitalise on the growth
opportunities the pandemic presents, these will be communicated in due course.
Whilst we expect market circumstances to place pressure on earnings in the short
term we remain confident in the strength of our cash reserves and balance sheet
to withstand this volatility, ensuring we will continue to be able to deliver on
our promises to customers and providing a platform to accelerate growth as
economic conditions improve.

SUSPENSION OF FUNGIBILITY OF OLD MUTUAL LIMITED SHARES ON THE ZIMBABWE STOCK
EXCHANGE

Shareholders holding Old Mutual shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (“ZSE”)
are advised that on 15 March 2020, the Zimbabwe Minister of Finance issued
the Exchange Control (Suspension of Fungibility of Certain Shares) Order,
2020 (Government Notice 583 of 2020) (“the Fungibility Suspension Order”).

The Fungibility Suspension Order suspends every exchange control authority,
directive or order granted by any exchange control authority allowing the
fungibility of the Company’s shares listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
until 12 March 2021. It does not affect transactions conducted on the ZSE on
or before 13 March 2020 and in respect of which settlement was due by 18
March 2020.

The Company’s understanding is that the shares listed on the ZSE remain
tradable subject to the limitations introduced by the Fungibility Suspension
Order and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe’s related audit
of transactions. This may have a material effect on the price of the
Company’s securities traded on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.

Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the
Company’s securities on the ZSE until a further announcement is made as may
be necessary.

FINALISATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND DIVIDEND CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS

Shareholders   are  referred   to   Old  Mutual’s   Preliminary   Results
announcement dated 16 March 2020, wherein the company declared a final
dividend of 75 cents per share, which will be paid on Monday, 4 May 2020.
The dividend of 75 cents per ordinary share will be subject to a local
dividend tax rate of 20% which will result in a net final dividend, to
those shareholders who are not exempt from paying dividend tax, of 60
cents per ordinary share. International shareholders who are not exempt
or are not subject to a reduced rate in terms of a double taxation
agreement, will be subject to a dividend withholding tax at a rate of
20%.


Shareholders on the London, Zimbabwean, Malawian and Namibian registers
will be paid in the local currency equivalents of the final dividend.
Distributions made through the dividend access trust or similar
arrangements established in a country will not be subject to South African
withholding tax but may be subject to withholding tax in the relevant
country. We recommend that you consult with your tax advisor regarding
the in-country withholding tax consequences.


The local currency equivalents of the final dividend have now been
established as follows:
Malawi                            32.34   Malawian kwacha per share
Namibia                           75.00   Namibian cents per share
United Kingdom                     3.71   GBP pence per share
Zimbabwe                          91.37   RTGS cents per share

These local currency equivalents have been calculated using the following
exchange rates:
Malawi                          43.1139   Malawian   kwacha per Rand
Namibia                          1.0000   Namibian   cents per Rand
United Kingdom                  20.2070   Rand per   Pound sterling
Zimbabwe                         0.8208   Rand per   RTGS dollar
The timetable released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 16 March
2020 remains unchanged.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR INTERIM CEO

Our business was resilient against significant headwinds in 2019. We faced challenging macroeconomic conditions in South Africa, our largest market, and many
of our operating countries in the Rest of Africa. This put pressure on the disposable income levels of our customers and on the ability of our businesses to
grow value for our customers and investors. We remain confident that our diversified business allows us to protect value for stakeholders in tough economic
times. After careful consideration of the relevant facts and actions, our Board took the difficult decision to dismiss our former chief executive, Peter Moyo.
We remained focused on reassuring our customers, investors and employees during the heightened media attention and scrutiny that followed, through transparent
and regular communication. The Board remains confident that the decision made was in the best interests of our stakeholders and that their duties were
discharged in line with the high standard of governance and ethics expected of an established and respected organisation like ours.

Our financial results were resilient after taking into account the impact of external factors in our operating environment. Results from Operations (RFO)
decreased by 2% reflecting positive assumption changes offset by a decrease in Old Mutual Insure's underwriting result. Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) was
up 5% mainly due to stronger shareholder investment returns in South Africa, partially offset by reductions in the fair value of properties in East Africa. We
delivered positive Net Client Cash Flow (NCCF) which is commendable in the tough macroeconomic environment and Funds under Management (FUM) increased by 2% in
line with the increase in average market levels.

Our business in China showed good growth in 2019 and is well positioned to penetrate the life insurance market which is relatively new and underpenetrated.
Previously, we offered primarily investment products, but have since expanded our offering to include protection solutions such as life, disability and
critical illness. Despite tough external factors, we have made great strides to be more operationally efficient so we remain relevant to our customers of the
future. Since listing in 2018, we have been deliberate and focused on making what we believe to be essential culture shifts to champion positive futures for
our customers every day and to attract top talent. We have been working relentlessly to become a digitally enabled business. We have made good progress on
simplifying our legacy systems and processes, transforming the business to be more agile and able to meet our customers' needs and expectations. 2019 was a
year in which our customers and communities were vulnerable and we remained dedicated to make an impact to their everyday lives through our responsible
business efforts. Embedding a culture of being a responsible business has been a key focus since listing. We continue to create awareness amongst our
employees to act responsibly, as we believe this will positively impact our ways of working and interactions with customers and the communities we serve. We
have organised ourselves to make an impact through specific focus areas which align with the needs of our stakeholders and we are in the process of refining
targets to track desired outcomes in each focus area.

We returned significant levels of capital to our shareholders, including share buybacks totalling R4.9 billion and total ordinary dividends of 120 cents per
share, an increase of 3% from last year.

On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 (Coronavirus) was declared as a pandemic due to the rising rate and scale of infection observed. The rapid spread of virus since
the start of 2020, and particularly in recent weeks, has caused significant disruption in global equity markets. The volatility of movements on global
exchanges such as NYSE and FTSE is comparable to previous crises. In South Africa, the JSE SWIX has decreased by 23% since the start of the year to date. In
China and Italy, significant proportions of the populations have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus, with other countries responding to the
risk with increased screenings and travel restrictions.

We are monitoring this situation on a daily basis. We have established a special committee to ensure that our employees in all of our locations can continue
to work safely, whether that is from our premises or from their homes. We have placed restrictions on all cross border business and personal travel to ensure
we limit the risk of infection to our employees and customers. We also regularly model the impact of 'perfect storm' scenarios on our solvency capital and
liquidity levels. These stress tests have shown we remain sufficiently capitalised with appropriate liquidity levels through these scenarios. We remain
confident that the benefits of our well diversified business, strong balance sheet and stable cash generating ability will stand us in good stead, in what is
anticipated to be a difficult year.

The achievement of our RFO target of nominal GDP+2% CAGR is dependent on an improvement in the macroeconomic environment in South Africa, which remains our
largest operating country, and higher equity market levels. Given the anticipated disruption in global equity markets and significant downward pressure on
GDP growth rates we do not anticipate being able to achieve this target for the 2020 financial year.

IFRS profit after tax for the comparative period includes the accounting impacts of the transactions executed to complete the Managed Separation. These
included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of Nedbank. IFRS profit after tax for the comparative period therefore included the consolidated
profits in respect of Quilter plc and Nedbank, both of these were classified as profit from discontinued operations. IFRS profits for the comparative period
also included the profit recognised on the distribution of Quilter plc and Nedbank of R23,175 million. IFRS profit after tax for the current period no longer
includes the impact of these items, which is the main driver of the decrease. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent on a
comparable basis increased by 34% from the prior year. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders on a comparable basis is derived by adjusting the
comparative to remove the impact of Managed Separation transactions and to reflect Nedbank as if it had been accounted for as an associate for the full year
in 2018. The increase of 34% is driven by material Residual plc losses in 2018 which did not recur, partially offset by a decrease in Zimbabwe earnings.

TRADING STATEMENT AND PERFORMANCE UPDATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019


Financial performance

Shareholders are advised that Old Mutual Limited is currently in the process of
finalising its annual results for the year ended 31 December 2019 (""current
period""). This trading statement provides an indication of a range for Headline
Earnings per ordinary share (HEPS) and earnings attributable to equity holders
of the Group per ordinary share (EPS) in terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the JSE
Limited Listings Requirements compared to the year ended 31 December 2018
(""comparative period""). The Group's annual results will be released on the Stock
Exchange News Service of the JSE Limited on Monday, 16 March 2020.

Results from Operations (RFO) is expected to decrease by approximately 0% to 5%
compared to the comparative period, a resilient outcome in the context of low
economic growth in South Africa. Adjusted Headline Earnings (AHE) is expected to
increase by approximately 2% to 7% mainly driven by higher shareholder investment
return in South Africa. Accordingly, AHE per share is expected to increase by
approximately 4% to 9% to 202.9 - 212.6 cents in the current period compared to
195.1 cents for the comparative period.

1Restated   to exclude the results of Zimbabwe.
2AHEPS defined as Adjusted Headline Earnings divided by WANS adjusted to remove the Group's BBBEE
shares and shares held in policyholder and consolidated investment funds.

IFRS profits in the 2018 financial year include the accounting impacts of the
transactions executed to complete the Managed Separation. These transactions
included the distribution of Quilter plc and the unbundling of Nedbank Group
Limited (Nedbank). Profit after tax for the comparative period therefore included
the consolidated profits in respect of the Quilter plc and Nedbank businesses,
these were classified as profit from discontinued operations. Profits for the
comparative period also included the profit recognised on the distribution of
Quilter plc on 24 June 2018 and the unbundling of Nedbank on 15 October 2018.
Profit after tax for the current period no longer includes the impact of these
items related to the execution of Managed Separation, which is the main driver
of the expected decrease. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders
of the parent on comparable basis is expected to increase by approximately 30%
to 37%. IFRS profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent on a
comparable basis is adjusted to remove the impact of Managed Separation
transactions and to reflect Nedbank as if it had been accounted for as an
associate for the full 2018 year.

The table below sets out the impact of the Managed Separation transactions
included in profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent for
the comparative period:
R million                                  31 December 2018
Profit from discontinued operations -      1,275
Quilter
Profit from discontinued operations -      7,241
Nedbank
Profit on Quilter distribution and         23,175
unbundling of Nedbank

Accordingly, we expect Basic earnings per share to decrease by approximately 73%
to 75% to 204.9 - 197.0 cents compared to 788.1 cents in the comparative period.
Headline Earnings (HE) is expected to decrease by approximately 24% to 28%. We
expect Headline Earnings per share (HEPS) to decrease by approximately 22% to
25% to 230.2 - 239.4 cents compared to 306.9 cents in the comparative period.
