General notes:
1. Trading in the entitlements to the A Warrant Receipts will only be permitted to commence 3 Business Days prior to the settlement of the A Warrant Receipts.

2. The issuance of the A Warrant Receipts on the JSE on 2 December 2020 will not give rise to any fractions of the A Warrant Receipts.
3. Certificated DR Holders are advised to dematerialise their DRs as soon as possible in order to facilitate the issue of dematerialised A Warrant Receipts. DR Holders are advised that there may be no dematerialisation or rematerialisation of their DRs between Wednesday, 25 November 2020 and Friday, 27 November 2020, both days inclusive. The register is closed for all cross-register movements between Wednesday, 25 November 2020 and Friday, 27 November 2020, both days inclusive.
4. The A Warrant Receipt register is expected to be closed for all cross-register movements as from 8 November 2023 until the Expiry Date. During that period, A Warrants traded on SIX Swiss Exchange will not be capable of exchange against A Warrant Receipts traded on the JSE and vice versa.
5. The JSE code for the A Warrant Receipts is CFRO and the ISIN is CH0562931086.
6. The above dates and times are subject to change. Any material change will be released on SENS. Detailed dates and times relating inter alia, to the settlement of New DRs upon the exercise of A Warrant Receipts will be announced in due course.

Farfetch, Alibaba Group and Richemont Form Global Partnership to Accelerate the Digitisation of the Luxury Industry


- Alibaba to launch Farfetch luxury shopping channels on Tmall Luxury Pavilion and Luxury Soho; will also invest in newly formed Farfetch China Joint Venture and in Farfetch Limited
- Richemont to invest in newly formed Farfetch China Joint Venture and in Farfetch Limited; will also explore additional opportunities to work closely with Farfetch
- Farfetch and Alibaba to leverage their platforms and augmented retail technologies to accelerate the digitisation of the luxury industry; also forming a Steering Group, joined by influential luxury leaders, Johann Rupert and François-Henri Pinault
- Artemis to increase existing ownership in Farfetch with additional investment

November 5, 2020 - Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA and HKSE: 9988) and Richemont (SWX:CFR) today announced a global strategic partnership to provide luxury brands with enhanced access to the China market as well as accelerate the digitisation of the global luxury industry. Leveraging each company's respective expertise and extensive reach, the partnership will bring luxury retail to the next generation by seamlessly integrating the digital and physical realms.

Farfetch to Launch on Alibaba's Luxury Platforms in China

Farfetch will launch luxury shopping channels on Alibaba's platforms, Tmall Luxury Pavilion and Luxury Soho, China's premier luxury and luxury outlet destination within the Tmall marketplace, as well as Alibaba's cross-border marketplace Tmall Global. The new channels expand the reach of Farfetch's global luxury platform to Alibaba's 757 million consumers, offering luxury brands a multi-brand solution through a single integration with Farfetch. This will provide luxury labels with a unique opportunity to elevate their brand awareness, while also significantly expanding their addressable market of luxury consumers through their participation on Farfetch's global marketplace. For luxury consumers, this provides multiple ways to shop for their favorite brands either through the Farfetch integration, or through the already highly successful NET-A-PORTER integration on Tmall Luxury Pavilion.

Strategic Investments in Farfetch and Farfetch China

As part of the global partnership, Alibaba and Richemont will invest USD600 million (USD300 million each) in private convertible notes issued by Farfetch Limited. Alibaba and Richemont will also invest USD500 million (USD250 million each) in Farfetch China, taking a combined 25% stake in a new joint venture that will include Farfetch's marketplace operations in the China region. In addition, Alibaba and Richemont have an option to purchase a further combined 24% of Farfetch China after the third year of the joint venture's formation. Alibaba and Richemont will also explore additional opportunities to work closely with Farfetch to provide services to luxury brands. The investments by Alibaba and Richemont in Farfetch China and the establishment of the joint venture are expected to be completed during the first half of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.

Separately, Artemis has also agreed to increase its existing investment in Farfetch with a USD50 million purchase of Farfetch's Class A ordinary shares.

Accelerating the Digitisation of the Global Luxury Industry

Luxury New Retail (""LNR"") is a visionary initiative which will leverage Farfetch's and Alibaba's state-of-the-art omnichannel retail technologies to serve the needs of luxury businesses, including a full suite of enterprise solutions powered by Farfetch. These solutions will serve both mono-brand and multi-brand distribution strategies for luxury brands, including fully-connected e-commerce websites and apps, omnichannel retail technology, and access to the Farfetch and Tmall Luxury Pavilion marketplaces via a single integration.

Farfetch and Alibaba have also formed a steering group to further enhance the LNR initiative, which is aimed at leading the digitisation of the global luxury retail industry. Richemont Chairman, Johann Rupert, and Artemis Chairman, François-Henri Pinault, will join Farfetch and Alibaba on the LNR steering group as founding members, bringing their combined decades of industry leadership and expertise.

José Neves, Farfetch Founder, Chairman and CEO said: ""This announcement is a major step in our mission to connect the curators, creators and consumers of the luxury fashion industry. The USD1.15 billion investment in Farfetch from Alibaba Group, Richemont, and Artemis is a strong validation of our position as the global platform for luxury.

The new initiatives with Alibaba Group and Richemont extend Farfetch's strategy to power the digital transformation occurring across the luxury industry, which has been accelerated by the unprecedented challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Luxury New Retail initiative will explore ways we can help the wider industry move forward and thrive in the post-COVID world.""

Daniel Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group, said: ""This highly complementary partnership brings together some of the world's leading luxury retail and technology platforms, representing another milestone in Alibaba's strategy to meet the rapidly growing demand for luxury products in China. The Chinese luxury market – which is expected to account for half of global luxury sales by 2025 – consists of hundreds of millions of young, digitally-native consumers. By partnering with Farfetch and expanding our existing relationship with Richemont, we will accelerate the digitisation of the global luxury retail industry and transform the luxury shopping experience for consumers.""

Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said: ""Building on our successful joint venture with Alibaba, these developments represent a further meaningful acceleration of our journey towards Luxury New Retail. This initiative brings together a powerful combination of highly complementary strengths - notably with our Maisons' luxury retail expertise and YOOX NET-A-PORTER's deep brand partnerships, expert curation and exceptional customer care - that will help us deliver a seamless omnichannel experience to our discerning clientele.
Partnerships make you stronger. I am delighted to partner with Daniel, José, and François-Henri to bring our shared vision to fruition, setting new standards for the future of luxury.""

François-Henri Pinault, Chairman, Artemis, said: ""The growth potential of luxury e-commerce has never been so promising, and the importance of China for the luxury industry is only becoming more obvious every day. Thanks to the vision of José Neves, Farfetch played an important role in improving the omnichannel experience for luxury customers in recent years. The investment by Artemis demonstrates our belief in the future of Farfetch and I am personally looking forward to exploring the future of luxury retail with this group of visionaries and experts.""  

Goldman Sachs International acted as Lead Financial Adviser and Allen & Company LLC acted as Financial Adviser to Farfetch.

FARFETCH ISSUANCE OF USD600 MILLION 0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2030

In conjunction with the above strategic developments, Alibaba Group and Richemont have each agreed to purchase USD300 million of the 0% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the ""Notes"") issued by Farfetch Limited (the ""Company"") for total gross proceeds of USD600 million. The additional capital will support Farfetch's long-term strategy of delivering a global technology platform for the luxury fashion industry and facilitate the Company's continued focus on executing its growth plans and driving towards operational profitability.  The sale of the Notes to Alibaba Group and Richemont is expected to settle on or about November 17, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.
 
In conjunction with its investment, Alibaba Group will nominate one director to the Farfetch Board.

The Notes will mature on November 15, 2030 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. At any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert the Notes at its option at an initial conversion price of approximately USD32.29, which reflects a 22% premium to the volume-weighted average price over the trailing thirty (30) trading day period ending on October 30, 2020. Upon conversion, the Notes will be settled in Class A ordinary shares of the Company (with the Company's right, in certain circumstances, to settle the Notes in its Class A ordinary shares, cash or a combination thereof, at the Company's election). If certain events occur that constitute a ""fundamental change"" (as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the Notes), holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or some of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus all accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, and including, the maturity date.  The Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who convert Notes in connection with a fundamental change.

Alibaba Group and Richemont may require the Company to repurchase all or part of their respective Notes on June 30, 2026 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, such repurchase date.

The Company will not be able to redeem the Notes prior to November 15, 2023, except in the event of certain tax law changes. On or after November 15, 2023, the Company may redeem, for cash, all or part of the relevant Notes if the last reported sale price of its Class A ordinary shares has been at least 130% (or 200%, if a substantial portion of the relevant Notes are held at the time by Alibaba Group or Richemont) of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of the redemption, at a redemption price equal to 100%  of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

When issued, the Notes will be the Company's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; contractually subordinated to the Company's 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025; and structurally junior to any indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's subsidiaries.

ARTEMIS INVESTMENT DISCLOSURE:

In conjunction with the above strategic developments, Artemis has agreed to purchase 1,889,338 Class A ordinary shares issued by Farfetch for total gross proceeds of approximately USD50 million.  The issuance of shares to Artemis is expected to settle on or about November 17, 2020 subject to customary closing conditions.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT

16 OCTOBER 2020


RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES EGM AND UPDATE TO EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME AND CONDITIONAL SHARE CAPITAL INCREASE


Shareholder loyalty scheme

On 9 September 2020, Richemont announced the temporary suspension of its proposed shareholder loyalty scheme in order to study the potential impact of cancelling the Company's depository receipt programme in South Africa and delivering Richemont A shares to holders of South African depository receipts. Having successfully completed its study, the Board of Directors is pleased to announce that it will proceed with the issuance of tradeable warrants to shareholders, allowing them either to trade the warrants or, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrants, acquire new Richemont A shares in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price.

The exercise price of the tradable warrants proposed in the scheme will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares before the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), thereby allowing those shareholders who hold the warrants until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares during the lifetime of the warrants. 

The revised terms of the warrants will be described in the updated information memorandum to be published on the Company's website on 19 October 2020 and will contain clauses allowing the Company to transition away from its depository receipt programme, if and when it decides to do so. The final terms of the warrants, including the exercise price, will be published after the EGM.


Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the warrants, shareholders will be asked to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of shareholders on 17 November 2020 to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision in the articles of association and to authorise the issuance of a maximum of 22 000 000 new A shares (and an identical number of B shares) upon exercise of the warrants.

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association will be found in the updated information memorandum to be issued on 19 October 2020.


Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)

Richemont also confirms that the EGM will be held at 10.00 a.m. at its registered office on 17 November 2020. Given the continued uncertainties linked to Covid-19 and related health and safety concerns, the Board of Directors has decided it prudent, pursuant to Article 27 of the Ordinance 3 of the Swiss Federal Council 'on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19)', to hold the meeting without the attendance of shareholders.

Shareholders are invited to submit voting instructions through the Company's registrar, Computershare Schweiz AG, or by sending them directly to the independent representative of the shareholders, Etude Gampert and Demierre, Notaires. Detailed instructions on how to vote can be found in the meeting notice which will be posted on Richemont's website on 19 October 2020.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

Please note that Computershare have received refunds from the Swiss Federal Tax Authority for which they have been unable to make payment. If you have previously made a claim and have not received your refund, please contact Computershare (contact details as above), who will be able to advise you if your payment is pending. Please further note that any long outstanding payments older than ten years, which Computershare have been unable to pay, will become forfeit at the end of February 2021.

RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME


The Board of Directors of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (Richemont) announces its intention to study the possibility of delivering Richemont A shares to holders of South African depository receipts, thereby cancelling the Company's depository receipt programme in South Africa. The contemplated simplified structure is intended to reduce administrative complexity and facilitate cross-border trading in Richemont A shares between investors on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Consequently, the Board has taken the decision to temporarily postpone the issuance of warrants under the proposed shareholder loyalty scheme, to study the possible impact of this contemplated change in cross-border trading.

The Board will therefore no longer propose the creation of a conditional capital as listed under Item 3 (""Creation of a conditional share capital"") in the notice of meeting dated 12 August 2020, at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) due on 9 September 2020. The Board's proposal under Item 3 will therefore be withdrawn from the agenda of the AGM.

The Board will submit a revised proposal on the matter at an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders, which will be held later this year.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS IN RESPECT OF UNDERLYING COMPAGNIE FINANCIERE RICHEMONT SA 'A' SHARES ('CFR DRs') 


The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand. 

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.00 per share.  It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on 9 September 2020 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 percent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 0.65 per share. 

A number of major banks (Absa, Nedbank, RMB and Standard Bank) have notified clients that they will be discontinuing the use of cheques as a means of payment. We expect this to become the norm for all banks by 2021. We therefore suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure that they have provided them with account details and the information held in the Strate system is correct.

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 percent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 23 September 2020, at the time of the payment of the dividend. In the past, certain CFR DR Holders may have lost their opportunity to reclaim the withholding tax due to incorrect contact information being supplied to Strate. We suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure the information held in the Strate system is correct. In completing last year's withholding tax reclaim, claimants may have included their email address. For all of those who provided this information, the withholding tax reclaim form will be sent by email to you. For those who have not provide email details we would ask you to contact Computershare at the following address WHT.Richemont@Computershare.co.za Once received
Computershare will email the withholding tax reclaim form to you for your completion. We hope that this may alleviate the postal difficulties some claimants have experienced in the past. If you do not have an email address, please contact Computershare on 0861 100 935, to arrange a withholding tax reclaim form to be posted to you.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling was obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those CFR DR holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:


                                                        Net dividend
                                    Swiss               in Swiss francs
                 Gross dividend     withholding tax     before South
                 per CFR DR         at 35%              African
                 in Swiss francs    in Swiss  francs    dividend tax

Total            0.1000             (0.03500)           0.06500

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 18.27540: Swiss franc 1. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per CFR DR after South African dividend tax is ZAR 109.65240 cents, as set out in the table below:

Gross dividend    Swiss withholding  South African    
Per CFR DR        tax at 35%         withholding tax    Net dividend

Total 182.75400   (63.96390)        (9.13770)           109.65240 

Under the withholding tax recovery programme, qualifying SACMA residents will currently be entitled to recover the equivalent of CHF 0.0200 per CFR DR. The amount recovered will be converted into rand and will be remitted to CFR DR holders who participate in the programme once the reimbursement of the tax has been received from the Swiss Federal Tax Authorities ('SFTA'). Your attention is drawn to the fact that the refunds are to be paid by the SFTA in Swiss francs and that the SFTA imposes a maximum time period of three years after the dividend payment in which to make your claim. The Swiss francs received by Richemont Securities SA will be converted into rand at the rand: Swiss franc exchange rate ruling at the time of receipt. Bearing in mind the fluctuating rand: Swiss franc exchange rate, the effective rate used to arrive at the rand refund payment to CFR DR holders will differ from that applicable to the dividend payment itself.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA | EQUITY-BASED LOYALTY SCHEME CORRECTION TO THE SPECIFIED NUMBER

1. Introduction

Holders of Richemont Securities Depositary Receipts (""DRs"") (""DR Holders"") are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 7 August 2020 wherein Richemont Securities advised DR Holders that the board of directors of Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re Richemont SA, Switzerland (""Richemont"" or ""CFR"") (the ""Board"") has proposed an equity based shareholder loyalty scheme whereby it will issue tradable warrants to its shareholders. Richemont will issue A warrants to holders of Richemont A shares (""A Warrants""), B warrants to holders of Richemont B shares (""B Warrants"") collectively the ""Warrants"" and the Company will issue A warrant receipts to DR Holders (""A Warrant Receipts""). Richemont shareholders and DR Holders will be able to either trade the A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts or, subject to the terms and conditions of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts, acquire new Richemont A shares or DRs respectively, in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. DR Holders will receive 
two A Warrant Receipts for every DR held.


2. Correction to the Specified Number

The Specified Number is the number of A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts, as the case may be, required to be exercised to purchase one CFR Share or one DR, as the case may be during the Exercise Period. The Specified Number in paragraph 7 of the SIM was incorrectly described as ""The Specified Number of A Warrant Receipts giving the right to Eligible Holders to subscribe for one DR during the Exercise Period will be equal to the Rand amount of the Exercise Price"". The following paragraph is hereby substituted for the description of Specified Number in paragraph 7 of the SIM, ""The Specified Number of A Warrant Receipts giving the right to Eligible Holders to subscribe for one DR during the Exercise Period will be equal to the Specified Number as defined in the IM and the terms of the A Warrants.""

The impact of the correction to the Specified Number is that Eligible Holders will require fewer A Warrant Receipts to be exercised to purchase one DR during the Exercise Period. The illustrative calculation in paragraph 6 of the SIM that provides an example of the potential financial calculation of the A Warrant Receipts has also been updated.


3. Supplementary information memorandum

Information on the loyalty scheme, the information memorandum (""IM"") for Richemont shareholders and the supplementary information memorandum (""SIM"") for DR Holders, was made available on the Company's website (https://www.richemont.com/media-cfr/company-announcements.html?view=article&id=806) on 7 August 2020, and was posted to DR Holders on 12 August 2020.

An updated version of the SIM containing the correct description of the Specified Number and the updated illustrative calculation will be available on the Company's website as at the date of this announcement and an Erratum will be distributed to DR Holders on or about 24 August 2020.

NOTICE OF MEETING

The Annual General Meeting ('AGM') of shareholders of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (the 'Company') will be held at 10.00 a.m. at the registered office of the Company, Chemin de la Chênaie 50, 1293 Bellevue, Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, 9 September 2020.

Agenda

1. Annual Report
The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting, having taken note of the reports of the auditor, approve the consolidated financial statements of the Group, the financial statements of the Company and the directors' report for the business year ended 31 March 2020.

2. Appropriation of profits
On 31 March 2020, the retained earnings available for distribution amounted to CHF 6 203 709 317. The Board of Directors proposes that a dividend of CHF 1.00 be paid per Richemont share. This is equivalent to CHF 1.00 per 'A' registered share in the Company and CHF 0.10 per 'B' registered share in the Company. This represents a total dividend payable of CHF 574 200 000, subject to a waiver by Richemont Employee Benefits Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, of its entitlement to receive dividends on an estimated 9 million Richemont 'A' shares held in treasury. The Board of Directors proposes that the remaining available retained earnings of the Company at 31 March 2020, after payment of the dividend, be carried forward to the following business year.

3. Creation of a conditional share capital
The Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting to create a conditional capital having a maximum aggregate amount of CHF 24 200 000 and allowing the Company to issue not more than 22 000 000 'A' shares and not more than 22 000 000  'B' shares upon issuance of shareholder warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries, and to amend the articles of association of the Company to that effect as follows:

""5a. Conditional Share Capital

A' shares
The share capital of the Company shall be increased by a maximum aggregate amount of SFr 22 000 000 through the issuance of not more than 22 000 000 'A' shares of one Swiss franc (SFr 1.00) each, which shall be fully paid-in, upon the exercise of warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to holders of 'A' shares (the 'shareholder warrants A'). The transfer of the new 'A' shares to be issued upon exercise of shareholder warrants A shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Art. 6 I

'B' shares
The share capital of the Company shall further be increased by a maximum aggregate amount of SFr 2 200 000 through the issuance of not more than 22 000 000 'B' shares of one tenth of one Swiss franc (SFr 0.10) each, which shall be fully paid-in, upon the exercise of shareholder warrants to be issued by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to holders of 'B' shares (the 'shareholder warrants B'). The transfer of the new 'B' shares to be issued upon the exercise of shareholder warrants B shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Art. 6 II.""

Common provisions
Preferential subscription rights of shareholders are excluded for what regards the issuance of 'A' shares and 'B' shares pursuant to this Art. 5a. The Board of Directors shall determine the terms of the shareholder warrants A and of the shareholder warrants B and of the issuance of the new 'A' shares and 'B' shares contemplated in this Art. 5a.

Information on the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the Company's articles of association can be found in the information memorandum (the 'Information Memorandum') dated 7 August 2020 established by the Company.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA | EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME


1. Introduction

Holders of Richemont Securities depositary receipts (""DRs"") (""DR Holders"") are referred to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News Service on 15 May 2020 wherein Richemont Securities advised DR Holders that the board of directors of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland (""Richemont"" or ""CFR"") (the"" Board"") has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.0000 per Richemont A share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of Richemont at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday, 9 September 2020 in Geneva (""CFR AGM""). As DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont A share, the gross dividend entitlement per DR is CHF 0.1000.

Following a review of practical, legal and fiscal considerations, Richemont is pleased to announce that it will issue tradable warrants to its shareholders. Richemont will issue A warrants to Richemont A shareholders (""A Warrants""), B warrants to Richemont B shareholders (""B Warrants"") collectively the ""Warrants"" and the Company will issue A warrant receipts to DR Holders (""A Warrant Receipts"").  Richemont shareholders and DR Holders will be able to either to trade the A Warrants or A Warrant Receipts or, subject to the terms and conditions of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts, acquire new Richemont A shares or DRs respectively in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. The exercise price of the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts (""Exercise Price"") will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares and DRs respectively prior to the CFR AGM, thereby allowing those Richemont shareholders and DR Holders who hold the A Warrants and A Warrant Receipts until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares and DRs during the lifetime of the Warrants. DR Holders will receive two A Warrant Receipts for every DR held.

Under the deposit agreement entered into on 18 December 1992, most recently amended on 26 March 2014 (""Deposit Agreement""), Richemont will deposit A Warrants attributable to the DR Holders with Richemont Securities (""Depositary"") which will in turn issue back-to-back A Warrant Receipts to DR Holders, which will represent the underlying A Warrants issued by Richemont.

Commenting on the shareholder loyalty scheme, Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""We are currently facing an unprecedented global health crisis. Predicting the likely scope and timing of a recovery in demand remains difficult, if not impossible. A surge in Covid-19 cases has forced countries to reverse reopenings and to reimpose restrictions. Therefore, amid the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding broader economic conditions, the Board of Directors has decided that it is appropriate to retain an extra liquidity buffer with a reduced dividend level while awarding shareholders a supplementary benefit that will allow them to capture any ultimate improvement in global conditions. Due to the prevailing uncertainty, we have decided to set the maturity of the warrants at three years, to capture the potential future upside in the market price of Richemont shares, once all the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic will have hopefully been overcome.""


2. Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the Warrants, Richemont shareholders will be asked at the CFR AGM to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision in the articles of association authorising the issuance of a corresponding number of new Richemont A shares and Richemont B shares upon exercise of the Warrants.


3. Supplementary information memorandum

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association can be found in the information memorandum (""IM"") for Richemont A shareholders and supplementary information memorandum (""SIM"") for DR Holders, both of which will be published on the Company's website (https://www.richemont.com/media-cfr/company-announcements.html?view=article&id=806) on 7 August 2020, posted to DR Holders on 12 August 2020 and referenced in the invitation to the CFR AGM.

RICHEMONT
COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT
7 AUGUST 2020

RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES EQUITY-BASED SHAREHOLDER LOYALTY SCHEME, CONDITIONAL SHARE CAPITAL INCREASE, BOARD NOMINATION AND AGM ARRANGEMENTS


Shareholder loyalty scheme

On 15 May 2020, Richemont announced that its Board of Directors would propose a dividend of CHF 1.00 per A share / CHF 0.10 per B share at the upcoming Annual General Meeting and that it was considering an equity-based shareholder loyalty scheme.

Following a review of the practical, legal and fiscal considerations, Richemont is pleased to announce that it will issue tradable warrants to shareholders, allowing them either to trade the warrant or, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrants, acquire new Richemont A shares in three years at a potentially beneficial exercise price. The exercise price will be set on the basis of the volume-weighted average market price of the Richemont A shares before the 2020 Annual General Meeting, thereby allowing those shareholders who hold the warrants until maturity to benefit from any potential upside in the market price of the Richemont A shares during the lifetime of the warrants.


Conditional share capital increase

In connection with the issuance of the warrants, shareholders will be asked at the 2020 Annual General Meeting to approve the creation of conditional capital through the inclusion of a new provision  in the articles of association and to authorise the issuance of a corresponding number of new shares upon exercise of the warrants.

Commenting on the shareholder loyalty scheme, Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""We are currently facing an unprecedented global health crisis. Predicting the likely scope and timing of a recovery in demand remains difficult, if not impossible. A surge in Covid-19 cases has forced countries to reverse reopenings and to reimpose restrictions. Therefore, amid the unprecedented effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding broader economic conditions, the Board of Directors has decided that it is appropriate to retain an extra liquidity buffer with a reduced dividend level while awarding shareholders a supplementary benefit that will allow them to capture any ultimate improvement in global conditions. Due to the prevailing uncertainty, we have decided to set the maturity of the warrants at three years, to capture the potential future upside in the market price of Richemont shares, once all the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic will have hopefully been overcome.""

Information on the loyalty scheme, the rationale for the creation of the proposed conditional share capital and the proposed amendment of the articles of association can be found in the information memorandum dated 7 August 2020 which will be published on the Company's website on 7 August 2020 and referenced in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting.


Board nomination

Richemont also announces the nomination of Wendy Luhabe for election to the Board of Directors. Her appointment is subject to the approval of shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. She will serve as a Non-Executive Director and become a member of the Board's Nominations Committee.

Wendy has extensive experience in luxury goods and a long relationship with Richemont, chairing Vendôme South Africa (Richemont's subsidiary in South Africa) from 2001 to 2011.

Ms Luhabe is a social entrepreneur and economic activist with multiple honours for her pioneering contribution to the economic empowerment of women in South Africa. She is the founding Chair of Women in Infrastructure Development and Energy (WINDE) which focuses on the economic empowerment of women. Ms Luhabe founded 'Bridging the Gap', an organisation which equips black graduates with corporate skills, as well as Women Private Equity Fund (WPEF), South Africa's first private venture capital fund for women. She is also a founding member of Women Investment Portfolio Holdings (WIPHOLD) which empowers women to become investors in the South African economy. 

Ms Luhabe has over 25 years of Board experience across diverse industries and companies, including Tiger Brands, Vodacom, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the International Marketing Council (IMC), Alliance Capital, and the IMD and ESSEC business schools. She is currently on the Boards of Pepkor, as a Non-Executive Director, and Libstar, which she chairs. 

Ms Luhabe has worked tirelessly to contribute to the development of women and to educate and mentor younger generations. She created the Wendy Luhabe Foundation and established a scholarship at the University of Johannesburg. She holds a degree in commerce from the University of Lesotho and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Fort Hare. 


2020 Annual General Meeting

Richemont also announces that the Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be held at 10.00 a.m. at its registered office on Wednesday, 9 September 2020. Given the continued uncertainties linked to Covid-19 and related health and safety concerns, the Board of Directors has decided it prudent, pursuant to Article 27 of the Ordinance 3 of the Swiss Federal Council 'on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19)' of 19 June 2020, to hold the meeting behind closed doors. 

Shareholders are invited to submit voting instructions through the Company's registrar, Computershare Schweiz AG, or by sending them directly to the independent representative of the shareholders, Etude Gampert & Demierre, Notaires. Detailed instructions on how to vote can be found in the notice of meeting posted on Richemont's website on 12 August 2020.

TRADING UPDATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED 30 JUNE 2020


Financial highlights

• Strong impact from Covid-19, with sales for the quarter down by 47% at actual and constant exchange rates compared to the prior year period

• Double digit sales decline across all regions, distribution channels and business areas due to widespread temporary store and distribution centre closures, a halt in tourism and subdued consumer sentiment in many markets; at actual rates
  o Decreases were less pronounced in the Middle East and Africa and in Asia Pacific, the latter benefiting from 47% sales growth in China
  o Online retail sales showed stronger resilience than sales in other channels; excluding Online Distributors, online sales contributed 8% of Group sales compared to 2% in the prior year period
  o Jewellery Maisons and Online Distributors fared better than the other business areas 

• As of 30 June, all distribution centres and most stores have reopened with exceptions in the Americas and travel retail

• The Group's gross and net cash positions at 30 June 2020 amounted to EUR 7.9 billion and EUR 1.8 billion, respectively

Review of trading for the three-month period ended 30 June 2020 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

During the quarter under review, the Group's trading and operations were strongly impacted by Covid-19. Sales contracted significantly across all regions, channels and business areas, notwithstanding a 49% increase in China.

Performance reflected unprecedented levels of disruption and widespread temporary closures of internal, franchise or multi-brand retail partner stores, as well as the closure of Online Distributors' fulfilment centres. The pandemic affected regions to varying degrees, depending on the duration of closures, reliance on tourist spending and the 'feel good factor' of their domestic clientele. In Europe, sales were 59% lower than in the prior year period, with all markets impacted by public health protection measures, as well as subdued local demand and a lack of international tourism when stores gradually reopened during the quarter. Sales in Asia Pacific were the most resilient. The 29% sales decrease across the region reflected declines across all markets, with the exception of China, which delivered triple digit online sales growth and very strong domestic retail sales in the absence of overseas purchases from the Chinese clientele from the mainland. Sales in the Americas contracted by 61%, with business areas impacted significantly by the temporary store and distribution centre closures. In Japan, sales declined by 64% as stores were closed for most of the quarter under review. The year-on-year sales decline in the Middle East and Africa was contained to 38%, partly reflecting the recent internalisation of operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as well as advanced purchases in anticipation of the Kingdom's VAT increase on 1 July.

Retail and wholesale sales decreased by 43% and 65%, respectively, due to temporary store closures, severely reduced tourism and generally weak consumer sentiment. Retail sales were lower across geographies, with the exceptions of strong increases in China and the local South Korean market. Online retail sales decreased by 22%, largely due to the temporary closure of the Online Distributors' fulfilment centres, following strong double digit growth in the comparative prior year period. Of note, quarterly online retail sales exceeded wholesale sales in the period, reaching 25% of Group sales compared to 17% in the prior year period. Excluding Online Distributors, the contribution of online sales rose to 8% of Group sales from 2% in the prior year period, fuelled by strong demand across all business areas.

The 41% decrease in sales at the Jewellery Maisons reflected lower sales across all product lines and regions, with Asia Pacific recording a lower rate of decline than the business area average. In China, sales increased by 68% over the period. This was particularly driven by increased online and offline retail spend and the contribution of the recently opened Cartier flagship store on Tmall Luxury Pavilion. Sales at the Specialist Watchmakers decreased by 56% due to the aforementioned negative factors, accentuated by a strong reliance on multi-brand retail partners, a comparatively low exposure to China and low online retail penetration worldwide. During the quarter, the Specialist Watchmakers launched a number of online initiatives and participated in the Watch Show on the Cloud to introduce their creations to the Chinese market. Online Distributors recorded a 42% sales decline as a result of temporary distribution centre closures and a highly competitive pricing environment. The Group's other businesses posted a 59% sales reduction, with all Maisons impacted by temporary store and distribution centre closures.

""The significant interest from investors demonstrates recognition of our strong cash generation profile and unique business model around Maisons with centuries of heritage as well as digital native businesses. Whilst Richemont has a robust balance sheet and more than adequate cash resources, we view it prudent to secure additional liquidity to weather potentially tougher times ahead. This bond transaction will support the long term development of our Maisons and businesses.""

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA - DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('CFR DR')


The foreign dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. 

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register. 

The board of directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.0000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday 9 September 2020 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 0.6500 per share.  South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent Swiss withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. 

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

           Gross dividend        Withholding tax
           per CFR DR            at 35%               Net dividend
           in Swiss francs       in Swiss francs      in Swiss  francs
Total      0.1000                (0.0350)             0.0650

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to Rand as at 8 September 2020, for payment of the dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday 8 September 2020, being the finalisation date.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""          Tuesday,15 September 2020
 
Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from the

Review of trading in the three month period ended 31 December 2019 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

During the quarter under review, sales progressed by 4%, with growth in all regions except Japan. Sales in Europe grew by 9%, benefiting from favourable comparative numbers and strong sales in most markets. Sales in Asia Pacific increased by 2%, driven by strong double digit sales growth in China and Korea, which more than offset a severe sales contraction in Hong Kong SAR, China and contrasted performances in other Asian markets. Sales in the Americas rose by 5%, led by good performances in the US that compensated for declines in other markets. The 3% sales increase in the Middle East and Africa reflected a good performance of retail (both online and offline) and favourable comparative numbers in a soft economic environment. Sales in Japan decreased by 7%, impacted by lower tourist spending given a comparatively stronger Japanese yen and the October 2019 value added tax increase that benefited first half sales.

The retail channel posted a 5% increase in sales, notwithstanding the negative impact of temporary store closures in Hong Kong SAR, China during most of the period under review. Sales were particularly noteworthy in China. The online retail channel saw a mid-single digit sales progression, with strong demand in the US. Sales in the wholesale channel were broadly in line with the prior year period, reflecting good performance of franchise stores, notably in Korea, partly offset by the impact of ongoing cautious watch inventory management and distribution optimisation initiatives which have now reached completion. 

The 6% sales progression at Jewellery Maisons was broad-based, driven by jewellery and watches across collections. The performance of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati was particularly noteworthy given the negative impact of Hong Kong SAR, China. Sales grew in all regions except Japan. The Specialist Watchmakers registered modest sales growth, notwithstanding a challenging situation in Hong Kong SAR, China, with higher sales in directly operated boutiques and wholesale sales broadly in line with the prior year period. At the Online Distributors, an increasingly competitive pricing environment in online retail and disruption caused by storm damage to MR PORTER's Landriano warehouse facilities limited sales growth to 2%. The Group's other businesses recorded a 3% decline in sales, reflecting challenging trading conditions for our Fashion & Accessories Maisons with the exception of Peter Millar which continued to show strong momentum in the US. 

The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 2.4 billion (2018: EUR 2.3 billion).


Trading in the nine month period ended 31 December 2019

Sales over the nine month period to December increased by 8% at actual exchange rates and by 5% at constant exchange rates, broadly in line with the trend seen in the first six months of the financial year. They are presented in Appendix 1a. 

As a reminder, sales for the prior year period included eight months of sales for YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP and seven months of sales for Watchfinder & Co.


 
Corporate calendar
The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 15 May 2020, and its annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 9 September 2020 in Geneva.

In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2019 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the current three month period, the current nine month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.

The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand. 

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 2.00 per share.  It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on 11 September 2019 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 percent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.30 per share. 

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 percent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 26 September 2019, at the time of the payment of the dividend.

* YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP and Watchfinder have been consolidated in the Group's financial statements since 1 May 2018 and 1 June 2018 respectively  


Review of trading for the three month period ended 30 June 2019 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

Starting with the financial year ending 31 March 2020, the Group provides a trading update for its first quarter ended 30 June. Sales for the first five months will therefore no longer be reported in September. 

As a reminder, sales for the previous year's first quarter included two months of sales for YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP and one month of sales for Watchfinder & Co. When comparing on a full quarter base, Online Distributors posted double digit growth in sales in the period under review. 

In order to provide more meaningful comparison to the prior year period, the comments below relate to current period sales excluding Online Distributors.
 
During the quarter under review, sales expanded in Asia Pacific and Japan, showed modest growth in the Americas, and contracted in Europe and the Middle East and Africa. In Europe, sales were 1% lower compared to the prior year period as good momentum at the Jewellery Maisons was more than offset by a slower performance in the other business areas, with contrasted performance among markets. In Asia Pacific, the 9% increase in sales reflected double digit sales growth in its key markets, with the exception of Hong Kong. Growth was led by mainland China, where strong sales were supported by lower VAT and custom duty rates; sales in Hong Kong retreated, additionally impacted by the relative strength of the Hong Kong dollar and the recent street protests. Sales in the Americas rose by 1% as growth at the Jewellery Maisons and the Other business area outweighed lower sales at the Specialist Watchmakers. In Japan, the 6% progression in sales was driven by good domestic and tourist spending, and the full year impact of recently opened directly operated boutiques. Unfavourable currency movements and the severance of selected wholesale relationships weighed on sales in the Middle East and Africa, which decreased by 12% over the period.  

Following strong double digit growth in the prior year period, the retail channel registered a 6% increase in sales, driven by the Jewellery Maisons and to a lesser extent the Specialist Watchmakers. Ongoing cautious watch inventory management and distribution optimisation initiatives continued to negatively impact the wholesale channel, which posted a 2% decrease in sales. The online retail channel delivered a strong double digit increase in sales.

The 7% sales progression at Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels was supported by jewellery and watches. Sales grew in all regions with the exception of the Middle East and Africa. Specialist Watchmakers' sales were 2% lower than in the prior year period, partly due to the initiatives mentioned above and to the phasing of product launches, most of them being due in the second quarter of this financial year. The 3% sales reduction in the Group's other businesses included the impact of the disposal of Lancel (June 2018). Excluding this impact, sales decreased by 1% as the strong performance of Peter Millar contrasted with that of the other Maisons. 

The Group's net cash position at 30 June 2019 amounted to EUR 2.4 billion (2018: EUR 2.2 billion).
 

Corporate calendar
The Group's annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 11 September 2019 in Geneva, and its interim results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 8 November 2019.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA - DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('CFR DR')

The foreign dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares.

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register.

The board of directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 2.0000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday 11 September 2019 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.3000 per share.  South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent Swiss withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

                Gross dividend      Withholding tax
                per CFR DR          at 35%                Net dividend
                in Swiss francs     in Swiss francs       in Swiss francs
Total           0.2000              (0.0700)              0.1300

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to Rand as at 10 September 2019, for payment of the dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday 10 September 2019, being the finalisation date.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows: 

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""     Tuesday,17 September 2019

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from the
commencement of business on           Wednesday,18 September 2019

CFR DR dividend record date           Friday, 20 September 2019

CFR DR dividend payment date          Thursday, 26 September 2019

CFR DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of CFR DRs between Wednesday, 18 September 2019 and Friday, 20 September 2019 both days inclusive, nor will transfers to/from the South African branch register be permitted between 18 September 2019 and 20 September 2019 (both dates inclusive)

Chairman's commentary

Overview of results
The year under review has been one of transition and consolidation. We have continued our transformation journey with the successful tender offer on the shares we did not already own in YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP (YNAP), the leading global online luxury and fashion retailer, and the acquisition of Watchfinder & Co. (Watchfinder), a leading omni-channel platform for premium pre-owned timepieces.

In a relatively supportive environment, sales increased by 27% at actual and constant exchange rates, reflecting growth across all business areas and distribution channels. Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder - collectively referred to as our ‘Online Distributors' - sales for the period grew by 8% at both actual and constant exchange rates. Jewellery Maisons and the retail channel posted the strongest performance. Most of our markets were in positive territory, led by double digit increases in the US and in all the main markets of Asia Pacific.

Across the business areas, we are starting to see the benefits of recent initiatives targeting the qualitative improvement of our distribution network, the right-sizing of watch inventories at our multi-brand retail partners, and the adjustment of supply to the true level of end-customer demand.

The Jewellery Maisons performed strongly. Cartier benefited from the successful launch of the rejuvenated iconic 'Santos de Cartier' watch line, and the enduring appeal of its jewellery collections, notably 'Juste un Clou'. The unveiling of the new jewellery collection 'Clash de Cartier' in April 2019 illustrates the Maison's unrelenting creativity. Van Cleef & Arpels celebrated the 50th anniversary of its emblematic 'Alhambra' collection with much success, and continued to enrich its jewellery offer, notably with additional 'Frivole' creations.

The Specialist Watchmakers have shown good progress, with double digit growth in sales in their directly operated stores. The Maisons generally enjoyed strong retail performance, with Vacheron Constantin, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC being particularly noteworthy. By shifting to a business model in which supply is matched to end-customer demand and sales are increasingly generated in mono-brand stores, online or with fewer but stronger multi-brand retail partners, we are confident that our Specialist Watchmakers are laying a solid foundation for sound and sustainable growth.

We have worked on integrating the Online Distributors which have joined the Group this year. A compelling go-to destination for online luxury and fashion, YNAP increased sales at a double digit rate. We have also defined a multi-year integration roadmap with a view to developing robust omnichannel capabilities for our Maisons. Last October, we announced the intention to establish a joint venture with Alibaba Group to extend the in-season offerings of YNAP to Chinese consumers; the discussions are progressing. Watchfinder has delivered satisfactory performance, building on its leading position in the UK market. Its internationalisation has begun, with an initial market entry in France.
 
Our Maisons grouped under 'Other' have delivered varied performances. All Maisons saw higher sales, led by Montblanc and Peter Millar. Chloé and Alfred Dunhill increased sales with encouraging early results for the new Chloé leather offer and for Alfred Dunhill's latest product offerings; challenges nonetheless remain. The Fashion & Accessories Maisons' focus is now on improving sell-through and cash flow, developing capabilities in leather goods and increasing their digital reach.

Profit for the year rose by 128% to EUR 2 787 million, mainly due to a post-tax non-cash accounting gain of EUR 1 378 million on the revaluation of the YNAP shares held before the tender offer. Net cash totalled EUR 2 528 million at 31 March 2019.

Dividend
Reflecting the performance seen during the year, the Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 2.00 per share, up from CHF 1.90 per share last year.

Annual General Meeting and Senior Executive Committee
At last year's Annual General Meeting in September 2018, the shareholders of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA elected Ms Sophie Guieysse as a new director to the Board.

Board Committee composition was also strengthened with the appointment of two additional non-executive directors: Dr Keyu Jin joined the Compensation Committee and Dr Vesna Nevistic was appointed to the Audit Committee.

No further changes to the Board of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA have been proposed this year.

Mr Jérôme Lambert was appointed to the role of Group Chief Executive Officer in September 2018.

Outlook
We are determined to ensure that our unique Maisons remain attractive and compelling both with the timeless and unique creations they design, craft and sell as well as the way they engage with clients through memorable service and experiences, in both the physical and digital worlds.

We will continue to encourage an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset among our colleagues. We will foster a collaborative and inclusive working environment where talent thrives and sustainability is embedded across all our operations.

In today's uncertain environment, the strength of our balance sheet and the agility, creativity and skills of our 33 800 employees allow us to remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term ambitions. I am truly grateful for their passion, integrity and commitment.

Financial review

The results of YNAP and Watchfinder have been included in the Group's financial statements with effect from 1 May and 1 June 2018, respectively. They are grouped under the business area Online Distributors. The acquisition and first-time consolidation of Online Distributors has had a material impact on sales, operating profit, cash flow and net cash.

Online retail regroups the sales of YNAP as well as the online sales portion of both Watchfinder and the Group's Maisons. Retail now only incorporates sales from the Group's directly operated boutiques.

Sales
Sales for the year increased by 27% at actual and constant exchange rates.

Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, sales for the year rose by 8% at constant exchange rates, with all regions showing growth with the exception of the Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific and the Americas posted double digit sales increases driven by mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea and the US. 

The 8% growth at constant exchange rates in the Group's directly operated boutiques was driven by solid jewellery and watch sales. The 7% increase in wholesale sales reflected successful watch launches and favourable comparatives. Excluding the prior year's EUR 203 million watch inventory buy-backs from multi-brand retail partners, wholesale sales were moderately up on prior year at constant exchange rates.

Further details on sales by region, distribution channel and business area are given under Review of Operations.

Gross profit
Gross profit grew by 20% to EUR 8 645 million. The consolidation of Online Distributors has contributed to the increase in gross profit but has diluted the Group's gross margin to 61.8% compared to 65.2% a year ago.

Excluding Online Distributors, gross margin improved by 110 basis points to 66.3%, driven by manufacturing efficiency gains, a larger share of retail, both online and offline, and a relatively weaker Swiss franc.

Operating profit
Operating profit rose by 5% to EUR 1 943 million. Excluding one-time net charges of respectively EUR 118 million in the year under review and EUR 208 million in the prior year, as well as this year's first time consolidation of Online Distributors, operating profit for the year would have increased by 13%. The current year's one-time charges primarily relate to previous year's inventory buy-backs and portfolio transactions. Operating margin amounted to 13.9% compared to 16.7% a year ago. Excluding the consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder, and the before mentioned one-time net charges, operating margin improved to 19.5%.

Net operating expenses increased by 26% on a reported basis. Excluding Online Distributors and the above mentioned charges, operating expense growth was limited to 7%.

The 11% growth in selling and distribution expenses was largely attributable to the consolidation of Online Distributors and also reflected the accelerated renovation of our global distribution network. Communication expenses rose by 21% to represent 9.6% of Group sales, reflecting the consolidation of Online Distributors and higher communication investments at the Jewellery Maisons. Fulfilment expenses of EUR 229 million at the Online Distributors were recorded in the year. Administrative expenses grew by 36%, mainly driven by the first-time consolidation of the Online Distributors and, at the Group's Maisons, by continued expenditure in IT and digital initiatives. Other operating expenses amounted to EUR 280 million, primarily driven by amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition, and by the previously mentioned acquisition and disposal-related charges.

Profit for the year
Profit for the year rose by 128% to EUR 2 787 million. This increase reflected a EUR 1 378 million post-tax non-cash accounting gain on the revaluation of the YNAP shares held prior to the tender offer. Excluding this amount, profit for the period grew by 15%, primarily driven by a higher operating profit. Net finance costs, at EUR 183 million, were EUR 33 million higher than the prior year as they included EUR 69 million of interest expense relating to the corporate bond issued in March 2018.

Earnings per share (1 A share/10 B shares) increased by 128% to EUR 4.927 on a diluted basis.

To comply with the South African JSE Limited Listings Requirements of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2019 was EUR 1 467 million (2018: EUR 1 339 million). Basic HEPS for the year was EUR 2.600 (2018: EUR 2.373), diluted HEPS for the year was EUR 2.596 (2018: EUR 2.367). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 29 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operating activities decreased by EUR 392 million to EUR 2 331 million. The reduction reflected a EUR 764 million increase in working capital requirements which was primarily related to lower creditors - following the use of credit notes granted as part of the prior year's inventory buy-back programme - and higher inventories both at the Group's Maisons and Online Distributors.

Net investment in tangible fixed assets amounted to EUR 633 million. This predominantly reflected investments in the renovation and relocation of existing boutiques in the Maisons' store network and increased investment in IT systems as well as YNAP's and the Group's logistic platforms.

The 2018 dividend of CHF 1.90 per share (1 A share/10 B shares) was paid to shareholders and to South African Depository Receipt holders, net of withholding tax, in September 2018. The overall dividend cash outflow in the period amounted to EUR 926 million (2017: EUR 918 million).

During the year under review, the Group acquired some 2.3 million 'A' shares to hedge commitments under its executive share option plan. The cost of these purchases, which was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of share options by executives and other activities linked to the currency hedging programme, led to a net cash outflow of EUR 74 million.

Balance sheet
Following the acquisition of Online Distributors, inventories increased by EUR 1 243 million to EUR 6 186 million (2018: EUR 4 943 million) as at 31 March 2019. They represented 17.7 months of cost of sales (2018: 20.8 months), an improvement of 3.1 months compared to the prior year. Excluding Online Distributors, inventories rose by 7% and represented 21.1 months of cost of sales.

At 31 March 2019, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 2 528 million (2018: EUR 5 269 million). Most of the decrease versus the prior year can be attributed to the completion of the YNAP and Watchfinder acquisitions (altogether EUR 2 894 million). The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated money market funds, short-term bank deposits and short-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars.

At 61%, shareholders' equity represented a higher share of total equity and liabilities compared to the prior year (2018: 57%).

Acquisition of the YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP
In March 2018, Richemont launched a voluntary tender offer for all issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YNAP that the Group or its affiliates did not already own. On 10 May 2018, Richemont announced that the offer had become unconditional. During May and June, control of all of the remaining shares was obtained and on 20 June 2018, the delisting of YNAP from the Milan Stock Exchange became effective.

Richemont has booked a post-tax non-cash accounting gain of EUR 1 378 million on its 49% equity-accounted interest in YNAP within 'Share of equity-accounted investments' results' in its financial statements. The gain was generated by the differential between the fair value of Richemont's stake immediately before acquisition and the EUR 1 097 million carrying value at the same date.

The completion of the YNAP acquisition has resulted in the recognition of a EUR 2 877 million goodwill. In addition, intangible assets amounting to EUR 2 434 million were recognised following completion of the acquisition accounting. The goodwill balance, which is subject to annual impairment testing, has led to no impairment for the year ended March 2019. The intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis with useful life from 3 to 20 years, resulting in an amortisation charge of EUR 158 million for the year under review.
 
Proposed dividend
The Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 2.00 per A share/10 B shares.

The dividend will be paid as follows:

+--------+------------------+-----------------+------------------+

The dividend will be payable following the Annual General Meeting which is scheduled to take place in Geneva on Wednesday, 11 September 2019.

The last day to trade Richemont 'A' shares and Richemont South African Depository Receipts cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 17 September 2019. Both will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 18 September 2019.

The dividend on the Compagnie Financière Richemont SA 'A' shares will be paid on Friday, 20 September 2019. The dividend in respect of the 'A' shares is payable in Swiss francs.

The dividend in respect of Richemont South African Depository Receipts will be payable on Thursday, 26 September 2019. The South African Depository Receipt dividend is payable in rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in Swiss francs to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African Depository Receipt holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 17 May 2019 on SENS, the Johannesburg stock exchange news service.

The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates unless otherwise stated.

Europe
Sales in Europe grew by 37%, supported by the first-time consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder which have a strong presence in Europe. The region accounted for 29% of Group sales compared to 27% a year ago.

Excluding Online Distributors, sales in the region increased by 1%, reflecting further optimisation of the wholesale distribution network, the disposal of Lancel in June 2018 and social unrest in France, which led to temporary store closures. Performance was varied in terms of countries and channels. Sales were in line with prior year in the United Kingdom; they progressed in Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, in France. Wholesale sales decreased moderately whilst retail sales grew low-single digit. Sales' growth was driven by the Jewellery Maisons and, to a lesser extent, by the Specialist Watchmakers.

Asia Pacific
Sales in Asia Pacific, which accounted for 38% of Group sales, posted a 20% growth.

Excluding Online Distributors, sales in the region were 14% higher. This performance was broad based, driven by double digit growth in all main markets, including mainland China and Hong Kong. The retail channel, supported by 20 net new store openings, as well as the wholesale channel registered double digit growth, driven by strong performances at the Jewellery Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers.
 
Americas
Sales in the Americas grew by 40%, benefiting from the inclusion of YNAP, which has a strong sales base in the US. The region's contribution to Group sales therefore increased to 18%, compared to 16% a year ago.

Excluding Online Distributors, sales progressed by 11%, sustained by double digit increases in all business areas. All channels enjoyed growth, led by retail.

Japan
Sales in Japan progressed by 16%. Excluding Online Distributors, sales increased by 8%, benefiting from higher purchases from the domestic and tourist clientele. All business areas and distribution channels registered higher sales, led by double digit growth at the Specialist Watchmakers and high single digit growth at the Jewellery Maisons.

Japan accounted for 8% of Group sales, compared to 9% in the prior year.

Middle East and Africa
Sales in the Middle East and Africa increased by 8%. Excluding Online Distributors, sales in the region decreased by 2%, as the wholesale distribution network was further optimised and currency movements continued to be relatively unfavourable. Growth at the Jewellery Maisons and the Fashion & Accessories Maisons, driven by local spending and internalisation of stores, partly mitigated a contraction in sales at the Specialist Watchmakers.

Middle East and Africa represented 7% of Group sales, compared to 8% a year ago.

The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates unless otherwise stated.

Retail
The 8% retail sales growth was driven by double digit increases at Jewellery Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers, notwithstanding temporary store closures in France and the Group's divestment of Lancel. Retail sales benefited from the reopening of a number of renovated stores, the full year impact of the internalisation of external points of sales in the Middle East in late calendar year 2017 and the first-time consolidation of Watchfinder stores.

All regions experienced growth, with double digit increases in Asia Pacific and the Americas.

The Maisons' 1 099 directly operated boutiques contributed 53% of Group sales, compared to 61% in the prior year. The lower contribution reflected the inclusion of the new distribution channel, online retail, as detailed hereafter.
 
Online retail
This newly reported distribution channel regroups all sales of YNAP (from May 2018 onwards) and the online sales portion of both Watchfinder (from June 2018 onwards) and the Group's Maisons.

Online retail accounted for 16% of Group sales.

Wholesale
The Group's wholesale business, which includes sales to franchise partners and multi-brand retail partners, posted a 7% sales increase. The performance was contrasted between regions, with Asia Pacific and Japan registering double digit increases, while Europe and the Middle East and Africa registered lower sales.

All business areas generated higher wholesale sales. At the Specialist Watchmakers, the non-recurrence of the prior year's inventory watch buy-backs provisioned in March 2018 mitigated the impact of the ongoing focus on aligning sell-in with sell-out and the continued qualitative optimisation of the watch wholesale network.

The contribution of the Group's wholesale channel accounted for 31% of Group sales, compared to 37% a year ago, impacted by the first-time presentation of the new online retail sales channel.

At actual exchange rates, the 10% sales progression at Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels was underpinned by double digit growth in jewellery and watches. Jewellery sales were supported by the continued success of the iconic Love and Juste un Clou collections at Cartier, and emblematic Alhambra and Perlée collections at Van Cleef & Arpels. Watch sales benefited from the successful launch of the rejuvenated Santos de Cartier and from the enduring appeal of both the Cartier Panthère and Van Cleef & Arpels' Poetic Complications watch collections. Performances in the Americas and Asia Pacific were strong.

Operating results increased by 16% compared to the prior year. The EUR 303 million improvement primarily reflected higher sales, continued manufacturing efficiency gains and good cost control. The Jewellery Maisons accelerated investments in both store renovations and communication initiatives. These investments included the renovation of the Cartier flagship store in London New Bond Street, the relocation of the Van Cleef & Arpels IFC Pudong store in Shanghai, the new Cartier corporate campaign and the Van Cleef & Arpels campaign celebrating Alhambra's 50th anniversary. Operating margin gained 160 basis points to 31.5%.

The 10% growth in Specialist Watchmakers' sales compared to the prior year was broad based, with nearly all Maisons enjoying higher sales. Regionally, performance was varied, with Asia Pacific, Japan and the Americas showing the strongest momentum. Sales in the Specialist Watchmakers' directly operated boutiques enjoyed a double digit increase with notable performances from Vacheron Constantin, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC. The high single digit growth in wholesale sales is largely explained by the non-recurrence of last's year inventory buy-backs, which offset the impact of ongoing control of sell-in and distribution optimisation initiatives. Excluding last year's inventory buy-backs, wholesale sales contracted slightly.

Higher sales, a larger share of retail, the non-recurrence of the prior year's inventory buy-backs, manufacturing efficiencies and good cost control led to a 44% increase in the operating results to EUR 378 million, notwithstanding stock provisions linked to the physical returns of inventory buy-backs. Consequently, the operating margin for the period rose 300 basis points to 12.7%.

Sales of Richemont Maisons' products through YNAP are reported under both the Maisons and YNAP, for business area reporting purposes. In Group sales, these are eliminated as Intersegment sales. Sales for YNAP and Watchfinder related to the period from 1 May and 1 June 2018, respectively.

Online Distributors generated a double digit increase in sales. At YNAP, all business lines and regions experienced double digit growth. At Watchfinder, persisting uncertainty around Brexit and the temporary closure of its London Royal Exchange flagship store for renovation led to a single digit growth in sales.

Overall, Online Distributors recorded a EUR 264 million operating loss, including a EUR 165 million amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition. Operating results reflected an increase in operating expenses, mostly linked to THE OUTNET and MR PORTER's global technology and logistics platform migration. On an EBITDA basis, the business area was slightly contributive.

* Prior period comparatives have been re-presented to include royalty income received within total sales.


Review of trading in the three month period ended 31 December 2018 at constant exchange rates versus the prior year period

With the consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder regrouped for the first time under the newly created Online Distributors business area, Group sales grew by 24%.

YNAP posted double digit growth across all regions with solid performances across all its business lines. Watchfinder's sales expanded more moderately.

In order to provide meaningful comparisons to the prior year period, the comments below relate to current period sales excluding YNAP and Watchfinder.

Sales grew in all regions, with the exception of the Middle East and Europe. During the latter part of the quarter, sales in Europe were affected by social unrest in France which negatively impacted tourism and led to store closures for six consecutive Saturdays. The disposal of Lancel in June 2018 also weighed on the year-on-year comparison. A 10% increase in sales in Asia Pacific reflected double digit sales growth in mainland China and good increases in other main markets. Sales growth in Hong Kong slowed, primarily due to the strength of the Hong Kong dollar versus the renminbi that resulted in lower tourist spending. Sales in the Americas rose by 9%, benefitting from good performance by the Jewellery Maisons and the Other business area. In Japan, a 7% expansion in sales was driven by continued domestic and tourist spending as well as the impact of newly opened directly operated boutiques. Unfavourable currency movements and a strong basis of comparison weighed on sales in the Middle East and Africa, which decreased by 13% over the period.  

The retail channel posted a 5% increase in sales, with growth slowing in December due to the above mentioned temporary store closures in France and a strong comparative base for high jewellery. The wholesale channel registered a 1% growth in sales, reflecting ongoing cautious watch inventory management and distribution optimisation initiatives. 

The 8% sales progression at Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels was driven by jewellery and watches. Specialist Watchmakers' sales were in line with the prior year period, with lower wholesale sales offset by higher sales in the Specialist Watchmakers' directly operated boutiques. The 1% sales increase in the Group's other businesses included the impact of the disposal of Lancel. Excluding this impact, sales rose by a mid-single digit rate.

The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 2.3 billion (2017: EUR 5.1 billion) with a gross cash position at EUR 6.6 billion following the EUR 4.0 billion corporate bond issued in March 2018.


Trading in the nine month period ended 31 December 2018

Sales over the nine month period to December increased by 23% at actual exchange rates and by 24% at constant exchange rates, broadly in line with the positive trend seen in the first six months of the financial year. They are presented in Appendix 1a. Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, sales for the nine month period rose by 6% at actual exchange rates and by 7% at constant exchange rates.

 
Corporate calendar

The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 17 May 2019, and its annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 11 September 2019 in Geneva.

In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2018 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the current three month period, the current nine month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.

Chairman's commentary 

During the past six months, Richemont strengthened its portfolio with two strategic investments aimed at offering our discerning and globally dispersed clientele more options in how, when and where they engage with and purchase from our Maisons. We now fully own YOOX NET-A-PORTER, the leading online luxury retailer, and Watchfinder, a leading omni-channel platform for premium pre-owned timepieces. As part of the continual assessment of our portfolio, we divested Lancel. These strategic changes have had a material impact on our operating profit and net cash position in the period under review.

Serving our customers is our priority. At the same time, Richemont will ensure that YNAP remains committed to offering brand partners and their clients the best service and we are determined that YNAP remains the neutral, open and compelling go-to destination for online luxury.
 
More recently, on 26 October 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba Group, the preferred online marketplace for Chinese consumers, aiming at becoming a significant and sustainable online destination in luxury shopping for the important Chinese clientele. YNAP and Alibaba will establish a joint venture to bring the in-season offerings of YNAP to Chinese consumers, be it in China or whilst travelling abroad. This new chapter in the history of Richemont reflects the potential we see in China and the confidence we have in Alibaba with whom we share an ambition to set new standards for the future of luxury online, for the benefit of YNAP's brand partners and customers as well as our Maisons and their clients.

Over the six month period ended 30 September 2018, sales increased by 21% at actual rates to EUR 6.81 billion. Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, collectively the Online Distributors, sales for the period grew by 6% at actual exchange rates and by 8% at constant exchange rates. 

Excluding Online Distributors, sales growth was primarily driven by strong performance of the Jewellery Maisons and double digit increases in the Maisons' directly operated boutiques and online stores. Robust retail sales in jewellery and watches more than offset a 2% decline in wholesale sales, which was mainly due to the Specialist Watchmakers' ongoing prudent inventory management and upgrade of the wholesale distribution network. Excluding Online Distributors, all regions with the exception of Middle East and Africa enjoyed higher sales, with notable double digit increases in Hong Kong, Korea and the USA. 

In our Jewellery Maisons, watch sales grew strongly in Cartier's stores, benefiting from the successful Panthère and relaunched Santos collections. Jewellery pieces continued to outperform, notably with the iconic Cartier Love and Van Cleef and Arpels Alhambra collections. The muted sales growth of the Specialist Watchmakers reflected the previously mentioned initiatives. Here, retail was strong and overall there was good momentum at Vacheron Constantin, Roger Dubuis and Jaeger-LeCoultre. Most of our Maisons grouped under 'Other' saw higher sales, led primarily by Montblanc and Peter Millar. 

The 3% reduction in operating profit to EUR 1.13 billion reflected an increase in costs which more than offset the improvement in gross profit. These higher costs were primarily attributable to the first-time consolidation of Online Distributors and their related acquisition charges as well as disposal-related charges. The operating margin decreased to 16.6%, but improved to 21.1% excluding Online Distributors. 

Profit for the period rose to EUR 2.25 billion, primarily due to a post-tax non-cash gain of EUR 1.38 billion on the revaluation of existing YNAP shares. Net cash amounted to EUR 1.58 billion at 30 September 2018 after a EUR 3.75 billion cash outflow related to the YNAP and Watchfinder acquisitions and dividend payment. 

Richemont's governance structure continued to evolve with the appointments of Mr Jérôme Lambert to the role of Group Chief Executive Officer and Mr Eric Vallat to the newly created role of Head of Fashion and Accessories Maisons. 

Amidst growing volatility in consumer demand, partly attributable to an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, we maintain confidence in our ability to realise our long term ambitions, supported by the strength of our balance sheet. 

Our ambition remains to ensure that we continue to create, manufacture and sell exquisite products with a high level of beauty, craftsmanship, patrimony and passion while maintaining continued engagement, relevance and appeal for our clients.

Financial review

The results of newly acquired YNAP and Watchfinder have been included in the Group's financial statements with effect from 1 May and 1 June 2018, respectively. They are grouped under Online Distributors, a newly formed business area. The acquisition and first-time consolidation of Online Distributors has had a material impact on sales, operating profit, cash flow and net cash. Online retail, the newly reported distribution channel, regroups the sales of YNAP as well as the online sales portion of both Watchfinder and the Group's Maisons. Retail now incorporates only sales from the Group's directly operated boutiques.

Sales
In the six month period, sales increased by 21% at actual exchange rates and by 24% at constant exchange rates. 

Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, sales for the period increased by 8% at constant exchange rates, with most regions posting higher sales. This was led by double digit progression in the Americas and in Asia Pacific, the latter benefiting from strong performances in Hong Kong, Korea and Macau. The Group's directly operated boutiques saw double digit growth, both in jewellery and watches. Wholesale sales were 1% higher compared with the prior year period. The wholesale performance reflected the optimisation of external points of sales and the Group's ongoing focus on aligning inventories with end-client demand.  

Further details on sales by region, distribution channel and business area are given in the Review of Operations.

Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 16% to EUR 4 256 million. The consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder has diluted the Group's gross margin to 62.5% versus 65.5% in the prior year period.

Excluding Online Distributors, gross margin progressed to 66.6%. The 110 basis point improvement related in part to manufacturing efficiency gains, a larger share of online and offline retail and, overall, supportive currencies.

Operating profit
The EUR 36 million reduction in operating profit to EUR 1 130 million reflected higher sales and gross profit, but also higher costs, as detailed below. Operating margin was 16.6% compared to 20.7% a year ago. Excluding the consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder, operating margin for the period improved to 21.1%.

The 24% increase in total operating expenses included EUR 159 million of acquisition and disposal-related charges. These charges can be broken down into EUR 77 million one-time charges, primarily attributable to the disposal of Lancel, and EUR 82 million charges principally related to the amortisation of YNAP and Watchfinder's intangible assets identified on acquisition. Excluding Online Distributors, total operating expenses grew by 8% and, when excluding the above one-time charges, operating expense growth was limited to 4%. 

The 10% increase in selling and distribution expenses resulted mainly from the consolidation of Online Distributors. Excluding those businesses, the increase in selling and distribution expenses was limited to 4% compared to the prior year period. Communication expenses rose by 17%, largely explained by the integration of Online Distributors and, to a lesser extent, by communication initiatives by the Jewellery Maisons. Fulfilment expenses of EUR 91 million at the Online Distributors were recorded in the period. Administration costs grew by 34%, again mainly driven by the first-time consolidation of the Online Distributors and, at the Group's Maisons, by expenditure in IT and digital initiatives. Other operating expenses include the previously mentioned acquisitions and disposal-related charges.

Profit for the period
Profit for the period rose by 131% to EUR 2 253 million. The increase reflected the EUR 1 378 million post-tax non-cash accounting gain on the revaluation of existing YNAP shares. Excluding this amount, profit for the period was EUR 875 million, a 10% decline following the previously mentioned acquisition and disposal-related charges. Net finance costs for the period amounted to EUR 47 million, compared to a EUR 72 million net income in the prior year period. Unfavourable foreign exchange movements on monetary items led to a net loss of EUR 38 million, compared to an EUR 84 million net gain in the prior year period. In addition, finance costs in the period included EUR 35 million of interest expense relating to the corporate bond issued in March 2018.

Earnings per share (1 A share/10 B shares) increased by 132% to EUR 3.987 on a diluted basis.
 
To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the period ended 30 September 2018 would be EUR  932 million (2017: EUR 1 000 million). Basic HEPS for the period was EUR 1.653 (2017: EUR 1.773). Diluted HEPS for the period was EUR 1.649 (2017: EUR 1.767). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 11.3 of the Group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operating activities amounted to EUR 733 million, a reduction of EUR 375 million compared to the prior year period. This year-on-year decrease reflected a higher absorption of cash for working capital needs, primarily related to higher inventories both at our Maisons and newly acquired businesses.

Net investment in tangible fixed assets during the period amounted to EUR 201 million, predominantly relating to the renovation and relocation of existing boutiques in the Maisons' store network, upgrades of external points of sale with our multi-brand retail partners and the further investment into the Group's central logistics centre in Switzerland. The Group also continued to invest in IT infrastructure, including in YNAP's enterprise platform.

The 2018 dividend of 1.90 per share (1 A share/10 B shares) was paid to shareholders and to South African Depository Receipt holders, net of withholding tax, in September. The 35% withholding tax on all dividends was remitted to the Swiss tax authorities in September. The overall dividend cash outflow in the period amounted to EUR 926 million. 
 
The Group acquired 2.3 million 'A' shares during the six month period to hedge executive stock options. The cost of these purchases was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities related to the hedging programme, leading to a net outflow of EUR 74 million.

Balance sheet
At 30 September 2018, and after the inclusion of Online Distributors, inventories of EUR 6 014 million were EUR 1 071 million higher than at 31 March 2018. Excluding Online Distributors, inventories represented 22 months of cost of sales. 

At 30 September 2018, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 1 584 million. This position was EUR 3 685 million lower than at 31 March 2018, primarily due to the completion of the YNAP and Watchfinder acquisitions and the annual dividend payment, which altogether resulted in a total cash outflow of EUR 3 751 million. The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated money market funds, short-term bank deposits and short-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars.

Acquisition of the YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP
In March 2018, Richemont launched a voluntary tender offer for all issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YNAP that the Group or its affiliates did not already own. On 10 May 2018, Richemont announced that the offer had become unconditional. During May and June, control of all of the remaining shares was obtained through sell-out and squeeze-out procedures. On 20 June 2018, delisting of YNAP from the Milan Stock Exchange became effective.

As announced on 18 May 2018, Richemont has booked a post-tax non-cash accounting gain of approximately EUR 1.4 billion on its 49% equity-accounted interest in YNAP within 'Share of post-tax results of equity-accounted investments' in its financial statements for the half year ended 30 September 2018. The gain was generated by the differential between the fair value of Richemont's stake immediately before acquisition and the EUR 1.1 billion carrying value at the same date. 

The completion of the YNAP acquisition has resulted in recognition of goodwill of EUR 2.9 billion. In addition, intangible assets amounting to EUR 2.4 billion were recognised following provisional completion of the acquisition accounting. The goodwill balance will be subject to annual impairment testing. The intangible assets will be amortised on a straight line basis with useful life from 3 to 20 years, resulting in an annual amortisation charge currently estimated at EUR 180 million.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current period and the comparative period at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2018.
** Prior period comparatives have been re-presented to include royalty income received within total sales.

The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates.

Europe
With the first-time consolidation of YNAP and Watchfinder, both having a strong presence in Europe, sales in the region grew by 28%. Europe accounted for 30% of Group sales, compared to 29% a year ago. Excluding Online Distributors, sales in the region increased by 1% over the prior year period, reflecting mixed performances in terms of markets, product lines and channels as well as the disposal of Lancel. 

Increasing retail sales more than offset declining wholesale sales, which were impacted by tight management of inventory at the external points of sale of the Group's multi-brand retail partners and optimisation of the wholesale distribution network. Sales in the United Kingdom contracted following a double digit increase in the prior year period while sales in France and Switzerland increased.

Whereas watch sales were broadly in line with the prior year period, jewellery sales enjoyed a double digit increase. Sales development of the other product lines was varied.

Asia Pacific
Sales in Asia Pacific increased by 20% over the period, with the region accounting for the Group's largest sales share at 37% of Group sales. 

Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, the 14% increase in sales was driven by twenty net new store openings, high single digit growth in mainland China and double digit increases in other main markets, notably Hong Kong, Macau and Korea. Both the retail and wholesale channels saw double digit growth, with strong performances in jewellery and watch sales. 

Americas
The Americas posted a 42% increase in sales, benefiting from the inclusion of YNAP which has a strong customer base in the region. Excluding Online Distributors, sales grew by 13%, driven by higher sales in all product categories and distribution channels. The growth was led by jewellery, clothing and the retail channel. 

The region's contribution to Group sales amounted to 18%, compared to 16% in the prior year period.

Japan
The 14% growth in sales was driven by higher domestic and tourist spending, which benefited from a comparatively weaker yen. Excluding Online Distributors, sales in the region increased by 8%, led by a double digit growth in watch sales and the net opening of five directly operated boutiques. 

The country represented 8% of overall sales, in line with prior years.

Middle East and Africa 
Middle East and Africa accounted for 7% of Group sales. The inclusion of Online Distributors led to a 4% increase in sales, with strong growth in writing instruments and clothing. Excluding YNAP and Watchfinder, sales in the region declined by 4%, adversely impacted by lower tourist spending, given unfavourable local currencies and geopolitical uncertainties.

** Prior period comparatives have been re-presented to include royalty income received within total sales and to consistently show online retail.

The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates unless otherwise stated.

Retail
Retail sales increased by 13%, with growth in all regions, and double digit increases in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Middle East and Africa. Growth was particularly strong at the Jewellery Maisons and the Specialist Watchmakers. Retail sales benefited from the internalisation of external points of sales in the Middle East in late calendar year 2017. The number of Maisons' directly operated boutiques was reduced by 33 to 1 090, mostly in relation to the disposal of Lancel. 

The Maisons' directly operated boutiques contributed 52% of Group sales, compared to 57% in the prior year period. The reduced contribution reflected the presentation of a new distribution channel, online retail, as detailed below.

Online retail
This newly reported distribution channel regroups the sales of YNAP (from May 2018 onwards) as well as the online sales portion of both Watchfinder (from June 2018 onwards) and the Group's Maisons. Online retail accounted for 14% of Group sales.

Wholesale
With the first-time consolidation of the newly acquired businesses, the contribution of the Group's wholesale business, which includes sales to franchise partners and multi-brand retail partners, stood at a third of Group sales, compared to 41% a year ago. 

Overall, wholesale sales were 1% above the prior year period, as growth in Asia Pacific, Japan and the Americas offset declines in other regions. An ongoing focus on aligning sell-in with sell-out and continued qualitative improvements in the watch wholesale network weighed on the Group's wholesale business. The Jewellery Maisons, Montblanc and the Fashion and Accessories Maisons saw higher wholesale sales in contrast to the Specialist Watchmakers.

+-------------------+------------------+------------------+--------+

At actual exchange rates, the 9% sales increase at Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpels was driven by double digit growth in jewellery and high single digit growth in watches. Momentum at Cartier was sustained by jewellery and the Panthère and relaunched Santos watch collections and, at Van Cleef and Arpels, by the Alhambra collection's 50th anniversary launches. Performances in Asia Pacific, the Americas and at the Jewellery Maisons' directly operated boutiques were particularly strong. 

Operating results improved by 19% compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of higher sales and manufacturing efficiency gains. Investments into Jewellery Maisons continued, notably in communication at Cartier for the relaunch of the Santos watch collection and at Van Cleef and Arpels to celebrate Alhambra's anniversary. Operating margin gained 280 basis points to 33.8%.

|Operating margin   |             18.5%|             19.3%|-80 bps|
+-------------------+------------------+------------------+-------+

The Specialist Watchmakers' sales were 2% higher than in the prior year period. Double digit growth in directly operated boutiques more than offset lower wholesale sales, which were impacted by ongoing control of sell-in and distribution optimisation initiatives. Performance was varied across Maisons and regions, with good momentum at Vacheron Constantin, Roger Dubuis and Jaeger-LeCoultre and, regionally, in Asia Pacific.

Stock provisions, linked to the physical returns of inventory buy-backs, led to a 3% reduction in the operating result to EUR 286 million, notwithstanding a larger share of retail and tight cost control. Consequently, the operating margin for the period was down 80 basis points to 18.5%.

Sales of Richemont Maisons' own products made by YNAP are reported under both the Maisons and YNAP for business area reporting. In Group sales, these are eliminated as Intersegment sales. Sales for YNAP and for Watchfinder related to the period from 1 May and 1 June 2018, respectively. 

Online Distributors recorded a EUR 115 million loss, mostly related to the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisitions.

'Other' includes Montblanc, the Group's Fashion & Accessories businesses, its watch component manufacturing and real estate activities. 

Richemont's other businesses reported a 1% sales growth, partly impacted by the disposals of Lancel (June 2018) and Shanghai Tang (July 2017). Excluding the impact of such disposals, sales increased by a mid-single digit rate. Almost all Maisons enjoyed growth, regionally driven by Europe and the Americas.  

The EUR 46 million operating losses included the above mentioned one-time charges related to the disposal of Lancel.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT

26 OCTOBER 2018

RICHEMONT AND ALIBABA GROUP ANNOUNCE 
GLOBAL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP

Companies to form a joint venture to launch luxury retail platform for Chinese consumers

Partnership to provide luxury brands enhanced access to vast Chinese market 


Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods group, and Alibaba Group today announce a global strategic partnership to bring the retail offerings of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (YNAP), the world's leading online luxury retailer, to Chinese consumers.

Under the partnership, YNAP and Alibaba will establish a joint venture (JV) to launch two mobile apps for YNAP's NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER multi-brand, in-season online stores for consumers in China. Alibaba will provide technology infrastructure, marketing, payments, logistics and other technology support to the JV. The partnership will also leverage YNAP's strong relationship with leading luxury brands, some 950 of them being currently distributed through YNAP in China.

In addition, the JV will launch NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER online stores on Alibaba's Tmall Luxury Pavilion, an exclusive platform dedicated to the world's leading luxury brands. Launched in 2017, the Tmall Luxury Pavilion aims to create the same brand exclusivity and tailored shopping experience that customers shopping offline typically enjoy. It enables brands to deliver highly personalised shopping experiences through curated homepages, customised brand pages, product recommendations and exclusive VIP awards.

YNAP and Alibaba will also explore future offerings that enable the JV's customers to enjoy unique and seamless online and offline shopping experiences through digitising and fully integrating the retail value chain from merchandising and marketing to payments and last-mile delivery. The JV will focus on serving consumers in China and will extend to Chinese consumers travelling abroad.

Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said: ""Chinese customers at home and abroad are an increasingly important customer base for Richemont and for the broader luxury industry. Our digital offering in China is in its infancy and we believe that partnering with Alibaba will enable us to become a significant and sustainable online player in this market. Alibaba has become the preferred online destination in China, with world-class teams in technology, logistics and marketing. Through this joint venture, we look forward to opening the important Chinese market to NET-A-PORTER, MR PORTER and the luxury brands they offer their clientele. To this end, we will work with Alibaba to ensure NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER's continuing expansion as neutral, open and sophisticated platforms.""

Federico Marchetti, CEO of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP, said: ""YOOX NET-A-PORTER has always built long-term relationships with its brand partners, protecting and nurturing the finest luxury names online. Together with Alibaba, we will offer our brand partners the same quality and reliability for the Chinese online market. Leveraging NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER, luxury brands can access a neutral and powerful platform to maximize China's immense potential.""

Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group, said: ""This multi-faceted partnership will bring Chinese consumers unprecedented access to the world's leading luxury brands. Chinese consumers are expected to account for nearly half of the global luxury market by 2025, and through this partnership, Alibaba and YNAP will be even better positioned to capture this compelling market opportunity. As Chinese consumers continue to upgrade their lifestyles, we want to meet the desires of Alibaba's more than 600 million users. By integrating online and offline commerce through our New Retail technologies, we will be able to deliver a seamless experience to consumers as well as better enable these leading brands to engage their customers in new and innovative ways. We believe this announcement is just the beginning of a long-term partnership, and together we are committed to exploring many more opportunities to collaborate in the future.""

Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS IN RESPECT OF UNDERLYING COMPAGNIE FINANCIERE RICHEMONT SA 'A' SHARES ('CFR DRs')


The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand. 

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.90 per share.  This dividend was approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting held on 10 September 2018 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 percent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.2350 per share. 

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 percent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 27 September 2018, at the time of the payment of the dividend. In the past, certain CFR DR Holders may have lost their opportunity to reclaim the withholding tax due to incorrect contact information being supplied to Strate. We suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure the information held in the Strate system is correct. In completing last year's withholding tax reclaim, claimants may have included their email address. For all of those who provided this information, the withholding tax reclaim form will be sent by email to you. For those who did not provide email details we would ask you to contact Computershare at the following address WHT.Richemont@Computershare.co.za Once received Computershare will email the withholding tax reclaim form to you for your completion. We hope that this may alleviate the postal difficulties some claimants have experienced in the past. If you do not have an email address, please contact Computershare on 0861 100 935, to arrange a withholding tax reclaim form to be posted to you.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling was obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 15.45820: Swiss franc 1. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per CFR DR after South African dividend tax is ZAR 176.22348 cents, as set out in the table below:

+-----+---------------+-----------------+---------------+---------------+

Under the withholding tax recovery programme, qualifying SACMA residents will currently be entitled to recover the equivalent of CHF 0.038 per CFR DR. The amount recovered will be converted into rand and will be remitted to CFR DR holders who participate in the programme once the reimbursement of the tax has been received from the Swiss Federal Tax Authorities ('SFTA'). Your attention is drawn to the fact that the refunds are to be paid by the SFTA in Swiss francs. The Swiss francs received by Richemont Securities SA will be converted into rand at the rand: Swiss franc exchange rate ruling at the time of receipt. Bearing in mind the fluctuating rand: Swiss franc exchange rate, the effective rate used to arrive at the rand refund payment to CFR DR holders will differ from that applicable to the dividend payment itself.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

*  Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current five-month period and the comparative period at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2018
 
The following commentary on the Group's performance refers to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates.

Double digit sales growth during the first five months was primarily driven by strong performance by the Jewellery Maisons, where sales grew 14%, and the first-time consolidation of Online Distributors. For this new business area, which regroups YNAP and Watchfinder, sales grew at a double digit rate.

In order to provide meaningful comparisons to the prior year period, the comments below relate to current period sales excluding YNAP and Watchfinder.

All regions, with the exception of the Middle East, posted growth, led by solid momentum in Asia Pacific and the Americas. Hong Kong, Korea and Macau all generated double digit increases while China showed good growth. Europe had mixed performances throughout the region and was impacted by the strength of the euro and a challenging year-on-year comparison in the United Kingdom. In Japan, growth reflected both higher domestic and tourist spending.

Retail sales increased by 14%, with growth in all regions, most notably in Asia Pacific and the Americas. Retail sales were driven by strong performances by the Jewellery Maisons and the Specialist Watchmakers. Wholesale sales increased 2%, reflecting our continued focus to align inventories with end-client demand.

Richemont's other businesses reported a 4% sales growth, partly impacted by the divestments of Lancel and Shanghai Tang. Most Maisons performed positively, led primarily by Peter Millar and Azzedine Alaïa, and a solid performance from Montblanc. 

The results for the six months ending 30 September 2018 will be announced on 9 November 2018.

ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 50-QUINQUIES, PARAGRAPH 5, OF CONSOB REGULATION NO. 11971 OF 14 MAY 1999

FINAL RESULTS OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE TUF


Capitalised words, unless otherwise defined, have the meaning ascribed in the offer document (the ""Offer Document"") approved by Consob resolution no. 20335 of 14 March 2018 and published on 18 March 2018, and in the Press Release on the Offer Results published on 17 May 2018.

This company announcement follows the company announcement published on 8 June 2018, whereby Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (""Richemont""), the Swiss luxury goods group, announced the provisional results of the procedure for the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF (the ""Sell-out Procedure"") by RLG Italia Holding S.p.A. (the ""Offeror"") on the ordinary share capital of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (the ""Issuer"" or ""YNAP"").

In particular, the Sell-out Procedure was directed to: (i) 4,646,879 YNAP Shares (i.e. the YNAP Shares which were not tendered during the Acceptance Period and the YNAP Shares issued by YNAP upon exercise of the Stock Options after the end of the Acceptance Period until the beginning of the Sell-out Period); and (ii) the maximum 3,250,174 YNAP Shares that might be issued upon exercise of the Stock Options and of the Change of Control Stock Options (together, the ""Remaining YNAP Shares"").

1. FINAL RESULTS OF THE SELL-OUT PROCEDURE

With reference to the Sell-out Procedure, whose period agreed with Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (“Borsa Italiana”) to submit the Requests for Sale started on 21 May 2018 and ended on 8 June 2018 inclusive, Richemont announces that the Requests for Sale have been submitted in relation to 3,194,570 Remaining YNAP Shares, corresponding to 68.747% of the Remaining YNAP Shares and to 3.327% of YNAP's ordinary share capital at the end of the Sell-out Period (represented by 96,008,530 YNAP Shares).

As communicated to the market on 25 May 2018, on the same date the Offeror purchased 3,144,146 newly issued YNAP Shares, arising from the exercise by the relevant beneficiaries of their respective Stock Options and Change of Control Stock Options. This was in execution of a series of put and call agreements entered into with the Offeror by each of the relevant beneficiaries.

Based on the final results of the Sell-out Procedure communicated by Banca IMI S.p.A., in its capacity as Intermediary Appointed to Coordinate the Collection of Acceptances, Richemont confirms that, on the Consideration for the Purchase Obligation Payment Date, the Offeror, and the Persons acting in Concert, will come to hold, also through purchases made outside of the Sell-out Procedure as mentioned above, 94,466,221 YNAP Shares corresponding to 98.394% of YNAP's ordinary share capital at the end of the Sell-out Period.

The Consideration for the Purchase Obligation, equal to the Consideration (i.e. Euro 38.00 per Remaining YNAP Share), will be paid in cash by the Offeror on 15 June 2018 (the ""Consideration for the Purchase Obligation Payment Date"").

The Consideration for the Purchase Obligation will be paid by the Offeror through the Intermediary Appointed to Coordinate the Collection of Acceptances, to the Appointed Intermediaries that will transfer the funds to the Depository Intermediaries for crediting to the accounts of their respective customers, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Requesting Shareholders in the Requests for Sale.

The Offeror's obligation to pay the Consideration for the Purchase Obligation shall be deemed to have been fulfilled when the respective consideration has been transferred to the Appointed Intermediaries. The Requesting Shareholders will bear the entire risk that the Appointed Intermediaries or the Depository Intermediaries fail to transfer such amounts to the parties entitled thereto or delay such transfers.

At the Purchase Obligation Payment Date, the Remaining YNAP Shares tendered in the Sell-out Procedure will be transferred to the Offeror on its securities account.

2. PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 1, OF THE TUF AND EXERCISE OF THE SQUEEZE-OUT RIGHT

As a consequence of Richemont reaching 95% of YNAP's ordinary share capital, as indicated in the company announcement dated 25 May 2018 and in the Offer Document, the requirements for the exercise of the Squeeze-out Right pursuant to Article 111, of the TUF, and of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF are fulfilled.

Therefore the Offeror will carry out the Joint Procedure targeting a maximum of 1,558,337 YNAP Shares, and more precisely all the 1,542,309 YNAP Shares still outstanding at the date of this company announcement, corresponding to 1.606% of YNAP's ordinary share capital, and an additional maximum 16,028 YNAP Shares, which might be issued to service the Stock Options (together, the ""Additional Remaining YNAP Shares"").

The consideration for each Additional Remaining YNAP Share to be paid at the end of the Joint Procedure will be equal to the Consideration (i.e. Euro 38.00 per Additional Remaining YNAP Share).

On 20 June 2018, the Offeror, in order to carry out the Joint Procedure, will confirm to the Issuer the deposit of an amount equal to the consideration for the Additional Remaining YNAP Shares (the ""Consideration for the Squeeze-out Right"") into the escrow account in the name of the Offeror itself at Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. bank, and the availability of such amount.

On such date, pursuant to Article 111, paragraph 3, of the TUF, the transfer of the acquired Additional Remaining YNAP Shares will be effective and consequently the Issuer will make the relevant entries in the shareholders' ledger.

Pursuant to Article 2949 of the Civil Code, after the expiration of the prescribed five year term from the date on which the Consideration for the Squeeze-out Right has been deposited, the Offeror will have the right to obtain the repayment of the sums deposited as consideration for the Squeeze-out Right which will not have been cashed in by the entitled shareholders.

As indicated in the company announcement dated 25 May 2018, and as agreed with Borsa Italiana, the exercise of the Joint Procedure will be completed on 20 June 2018.

3. DELISTING

Notice is hereby given that by resolution no. 8464 of 25 May 2018, Borsa Italiana ordered the Delisting from the Milan Stock Exchange effective as of 20 June 2018, suspending the YNAP Shares (ISIN CODE IT0003540470) from listing and trading on 18 and 19 June 2018, pursuant to Article 2.5.1, paragraph 6, of the Stock Exchange Regulation.

RICHEMONT ACQUIRES WATCHFINDER.CO.UK LIMITED


Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods group, is pleased to announce that it has reached agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Watchfinder.co.uk Limited (""Watchfinder"" or ""the Company""), the leading pre-owned premium watch specialist, in a private transaction with its shareholders.

Established in 2002 in the United Kingdom, Watchfinder has grown organically under the careful stewardship of co-founder Stuart Hennell to become the leading platform to research, buy and sell premium pre-owned watches, both online and through its seven boutiques. In addition, Watchfinder operates a highly qualified customer service centre and employs c.200 employees worldwide. 

Commenting on the transaction, Mr Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""Sixteen years ago, Watchfinder's founders foresaw the need for an online marketplace for premium pre-owned timepieces. Watch enthusiasts themselves, they established Watchfinder to provide excellence in customer experience. We believe there are substantial opportunities to help grow the Company further. Today, Watchfinder operates both as an 'online' and 'offline' business in a complementary, growing, and still relatively unstructured segment of the industry. 

Together with YOOX NET-A-PORTER and our stake in Dufry, the acquisition of Watchfinder is another step in Richemont's strategy. It will enable us to better serve the sophisticated needs of a discerning clientele. 

We welcome Stuart Hennell and his team, and look forward to ensuring Watchfinder remains the compelling destination for premium pre-owned timepieces.""

The transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2018 and will have no material impact on Richemont's consolidated net assets or operating result for the year ending 31 March 2019.

RICHEMONT REACHES 95% OF YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.P.A.'S ORDINARY SHARES


Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (""Richemont""), the Swiss luxury goods group, with reference to the offer launched by RLG Italia Holding S.p.A. (the ""Offeror"") pursuant to Article 102 and Article 106, paragraph 4, of the TUF for all the issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (the ""Issuer"" or ""YNAP"") other than those that the Offeror and the persons acting in concert with the Offeror already own (the ""Offer""), announces that yesterday, as a result of the YNAP ordinary shares tendered in the sell-out procedure for the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF, the 95% threshold of YNAP's ordinary share capital has been exceeded.

Capitalised words have the meaning ascribed in the offer document (the ""Offer Document"") approved by Consob resolution no. 20335 of 14 March 2018 and published on 18 March 2018, and in the Press Release on the Offer Results published on 17 May 2018.

In particular, based on the information communicated by Banca IMI, the Offeror informs that since the beginning of the Sell-out Period, acceptances have totalled no. 13,999 YNAP Shares from 34 Requesting Shareholders, which added to the no. 64,940,119 YNAP Shares already held by the Offeror at the end of the Acceptance Period, together with the 23,187,386 YNAP Shares already held by Richemont UK, Person Acting in Concert with the Offeror, total 88,141,504, corresponding to 95.006% of YNAP's ordinary share capital as of 24 May 2018 (represented by no. 92,774,384 YNAP Shares).

In light of the above, the requirements for the exercise of the Squeeze-out Right pursuant to Article 111, of the TUF, and of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF are deemed already fulfilled.

Therefore, at the end of the currently ongoing Sell-out Procedure, the Offeror will carry out the Joint Procedure targeting all the Additional Remaining YNAP Shares still outstanding at the Consideration for the Purchase Obligation Payment Date on 15 June 2018.

For additional information on the ongoing Sell-out Procedure, and on the Joint Procedure, please see the Press Release on the Offer Results. As described therein, on 8 June 2018 the Offeror will issue a company announcement on the provisional results of the Sell-out Procedure, and the following information will be provided: (i) the amount of Additional Remaining YNAP Shares (either as a number of YNAP Shares or as a percentage of the overall ordinary share capital of the Issuer); and (ii) the procedures and the terms pursuant to which the Offeror will comply with the Squeeze-out Right and will fulfil, within the same procedure, the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF, as well as the timing for the Delisting.

Upon the Delisting, please note that the shareholders of YNAP who have not tendered their YNAP Shares to the Offer will hold financial instruments that are not traded on any regulated market, with resulting difficulty in liquidating their investment.

The above information will be subsequently confirmed in the company announcement on the final results of the Sell-Out Procedure, to be issued on 13 June 2018.

The Offeror announces that, as agreed with Borsa Italiana, the exercise of the Joint Procedure will be completed on 20 June 2018 and that pursuant to Article 2.5.1, paragraph 6, of the Stock Exchange Regulation, Borsa Italiana will order the Delisting from the Milan Stock Exchange effective as of 20 June 2018, suspending the YNAP Shares from listing and trading on 18 and 19 June 2018.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('CFR DR')

The foreign dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. 

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register. 

The Board of directors have recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.9000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on Monday 10 September 2018 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.2350 per share.  South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent Swiss withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. 

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

          Gross dividend per CFR DR    Withholding tax at 35%    Net dividend
          in Swiss francs              in Swiss francs           in Swiss francs
Total     0.1900                       (0.0665)                  0.1235

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to Rand for payment of the dividend will be confirmed in a separate announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday 11 September 2018, being the finalisation date.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""         Tuesday,18 September 2018

Trading commences ""ex-dividend"" from the
commencement of business on               Wednesday,19 September 2018

CFR DR dividend payment date              Thursday, 27 September 2018

CFR DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of CFR DRs between Wednesday, 19 September 2018 and Friday, 21 September 2018 both days inclusive.

Chairman's commentary

Overview of results
An improved macroeconomic environment, steady progress on Richemont's transformation agenda and a mixed currency environment marked the year under review. Sales increased by 3% at actual exchange rates, driven by high single digit growth in retail and double digit growth in Asia Pacific, with particular strength in our main markets, namely China, Hong Kong, Korea and Macau. Strong overall retail performance reflected solid jewellery and watch sales. 

At the Jewellery Maisons, jewellery continued to perform strongly while watches benefited from easier comparatives and the successful relaunch of the 'Panthère' line, introducing one of Cartier's most iconic creations to a new generation. The Specialist Watchmakers continued to focus on optimising their distribution network and adapting their structures accordingly. Our approach to the grey market remains uncompromising. Over the period, we implemented further inventory buy-backs and strengthened the approach to managing sell-in versus sell-out at our multi-brand retail partners. Our Maisons grouped under 'Other' have focused on strengthening their leather and clothing offers, with first time collections launched under new creative directors at both Chloé and Dunhill.

An improvement in gross profit and tight cost control led to a 5% increase in operating profit. Excluding the one-time items in this year and the prior year, operating profit for the year would have increased by 10%. Profit for the year was broadly in line with prior year. Cash flow from operations improved to EUR 2 723 million. Following the acquisition of investment properties and a stake in travel retail specialist Dufry, net cash totalled EUR 5.3 billion at 31 March 2018.

Richemont's voluntary tender offer for the world's leading online luxury retailer YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP aims to accelerate our ability to satisfy today's sophisticated and globally dispersed clientele and demonstrates our commitment to developing a robust omnichannel proposition. Reflecting our view that travel retail spending will increase over time, we also invested in Dufry, a leading travel retail specialist listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. In addition to continuing to address the challenges that affect our watch businesses, we further focused on developing our capabilities in leather goods.

Richemont continued to reinforce its teams and build expertise to ensure we have the depth of knowledge and skills needed to achieve its transformation. While we have recruited external capabilities where appropriate, the Group has also been able to leverage internal talent across Maisons and segments. These moves will play a critical role in preparing Richemont to meet the complex demands of a rapidly changing environment.

Dividend
In view of the cash flow generated and the strong net cash position, the Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 1.90 per 1 A share/10 B shares, up from CHF 1.80 per 1 A share/10 B shares last year.

Annual General Meeting 
At last year's Annual General Meeting in September 2017, a number of long-serving non-executive members of the Board, together with former senior executives, did not stand for re-election. As a result, shareholders of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA elected eight new directors to the Board, whose biographies may be found in the annual report. Following the changes on the Board level, Board Committee composition was reviewed.

The Audit Committee welcomed Mr Clay Brendish and Mr Guillaume Pictet as non-executive directors, given that Mr Yves-André Istel and Lord Renwick of Clifton did not stand for re-election. 

The Compensation Committee is now composed of three new non-executive directors: Mr Clay Brendish (Committee Chairman), Mr Guillaume Pictet and Ms Maria Ramos, following the decisions of Lord Renwick of Clifton, Mr Istel and the Duke of Wellington not to stand for re-election.

At the Strategic Security Committee, Prof Schrempp and Lord Renwick of Clifton were succeeded by Mr Clay Brendish (as Chairman), Mr Anton Rupert, and Mr Jan Rupert.

No further changes to the Board of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA have been proposed this year.

Outlook
In line with Richemont's prudent balance sheet policy, we have recently taken advantage of a low interest rate environment to raise long-term debt to fund the development of our businesses as we continue to adapt and evolve. The support received from investors for Richemont's EUR 4 billion inaugural bond issue in March 2018 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and confidence in the quality of our assets and long-term growth opportunities. 

While Richemont's unique portfolio of Maisons and other assets are well-positioned, our long-term approach does not preclude us from targeting strategic investments and divestments, as we have demonstrated over the past year. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet ensure we are equipped to realise the Group's full potential over the next 30 years.

I would like to thank Richemont's over 28,000 employees for the creativity, integrity and engagement they bring to the Group and its Maisons. We have grown considerably over the past three decades, thanks in no small part to our employees' individual contributions.

As I conclude this commentary, I would like to pay tribute to Azzedine Alaïa. We have lost a dear friend and colleague, and the industry has lost an exceptional talent. A source of inspiration to many, he has left an enduring creative legacy.

Financial review

Sales
Sales for the year increased by 3% at actual exchange rates and by 8% at constant rates, mainly driven by jewellery. Excluding exceptional watch inventory buy-backs from multi-brand retail partners, amounting to EUR 203 million in the year under review and EUR 278 million in the prior year, sales at constant exchange rates rose by 7%. 

At constant exchange rates all regions grew, with the exception of Europe. Asia Pacific enjoyed double digit growth; the Americas and Japan posted mid to high single digit sales increases before accounting for adverse exchange rate impacts. Retail performance was strong, reflecting solid jewellery and watch sales; wholesale sales declined.

Further details of sales by region, distribution channel and segment are given in the Review of Operations. 

Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 5% to EUR 7 150 million in value terms. The gross margin improved by 120 basis points to 65.1%, with higher capacity utilisation and a larger share of retail compensating for a buy-back related charge of EUR 135 million. Adverse currency effects negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points compared to the previous year.

Operating profit
Operating profit grew by 5% with an operating margin of 16.8%. Excluding one-time net charges of respectively EUR 208 million in the year under review and EUR 109 million in the prior year, operating profit for the year would have increased by 10%. The current year's one-time charges primarily relate to inventory buy-backs and portfolio transactions. 

Net operating expenses increased by 5% on a reported basis. When including the above mentioned charges, but excluding the prior year’s gain on the sale of investment properties of EUR 178 million, net operating expenses increased by 2%. The 2% growth in selling and distribution expenses reflects strong retail sales, with associated higher variable expenses driving the expansion of the cost base, fixed selling and distribution expenses being in line with the previous year. Communication expenses declined by 1% and administrative expenses grew by 3%. 

Profit for the year
Profit for the year rose by 1% to EUR 1 221 million. This increase reflects a higher operating profit and a higher effective tax rate. Net finance costs, at EUR 150 million, were broadly in line with the prior year.

Earnings per share (1 A share/10 B shares) increased by 1% to EUR 2.158 on a diluted basis.
To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2018 would be EUR 1 339 million (2017: EUR 1 079 million). Basic HEPS for the year was EUR 2.373 (2017: EUR 1.913). Diluted HEPS for the year was EUR 2.367 (2017: EUR 1.909). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 28 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operations rose by EUR 827 million to EUR 2 723 million. The increase reflects a higher operating profit and lower working capital requirements (EUR 234 million inflow compared to a EUR 29 million absorption in the prior year). In addition, the non-recurrence of a EUR 268 million one-time contribution made in the prior year to a defined benefit pension plan for UK-based employees contributed favourably.

Net investment in tangible fixed assets amounted to EUR 436 million. This is predominantly a result of selective investments relating to the renovation of existing boutiques in the Maisons' store network and investments in external points of sale with our multi-brand retail partners. The Group continued to invest in manufacturing operations, its central logistic centre in Switzerland and IT infrastructure.

The 2017 dividend of CHF 1.80 per A share and CHF 0.18 per B share was paid in September 2017 and amounted to CHF 1 016 million or EUR 918 million (2016: EUR 878 million).

During the year under review, the Group acquired some 1.9 million 'A' shares to hedge commitments under its executive stock options programme. The cost of these purchases, which was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities linked to the currency hedging programme, led to a net cash outflow of EUR 71 million.

Balance sheet
Inventories at the year-end amounted to EUR 4 943 million (2017: EUR 5 302 million), representing 20.8 months of cost of sales, an improvement of 1.6 months compared to the prior year. 

At 31 March 2018, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 5 269 million (2017: EUR 5 791 million). Most of the decrease versus the prior year can be attributed to an investment in Dufry, a Swiss leading travel retail specialist, the acquisition of investment properties as well as the internalisation of wholesale activity and external points of sales in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated money market funds, short-term bank deposits and short-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars. Bank loans to finance local operating entities are denominated in their local currency. 

Following the EUR 4 billion bond issue completed in March 2018, shareholders' equity represented 57% of total equity and liabilities, to be compared with 77% in the prior year.
 
Acquisition of the YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP
In March 2018, Richemont launched a voluntary tender offer for all issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP (YNAP) that the Group or its affiliates do not already own. On 17 May 2018, Richemont announced that the total number of YNAP shares tendered in the offer, together with those shares already held by the Group, amounted to 94.999% of YNAP's ordinary share capital. As such, the minimum acceptance level condition has been exceeded and the material adverse change condition (section 2 of Richemont's 17 May company announcement) being fulfilled, the offer is now unconditional.

As a result, Richemont will book a one-time, non-cash, accounting gain of approximately EUR 1.4 billion on its 49% equity-accounted interest in YNAP in its financial statements for the half-year ending 30 September 2018. The gain has been generated by the differential between the fair value of Richemont’s stake and the EUR 1.1 billion carrying value on the balance sheet. The non-cash gain will be reported under share of post-tax results of equity accounted investments. 

Proposed dividend
The Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 1.90 per 1 A share/10 B shares. 

The dividend will be paid as follows:

+--------+-------------------+---------------------+--------------------+
|        | Gross dividend per|   Swiss withholding |     Net payable per|

+--------+-------------------+---------------------+--------------------+

The dividend will be payable following the Annual General Meeting which is scheduled to take place in Geneva on Monday, 10 September 2018.

The last day to trade Richemont 'A' shares and Richemont South African Depository Receipts cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 18 September 2018. Both will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 19 September 2018.

The dividend on the Compagnie Financière Richemont SA 'A' shares will be paid on Friday, 21 September 2018. The dividend in respect of the 'A' shares is payable in Swiss francs.

The dividend in respect of Richemont South African Depository Receipts will be payable on Thursday, 27 September 2018. The South African Depository Receipt dividend is payable in rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in Swiss francs to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African Depository Receipt holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 18 May 2018 on SENS, the Johannesburg stock exchange news service.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current year and the comparative year at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
 
The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates unless otherwise stated.


Europe
In the year under review, Europe accounted for 27% of overall sales. Full year sales declined by 2%, adversely impacted by the relative strength of the euro, inventory buy-backs in the fourth quarter of the year, tight inventory control at the external points of sale of the Group's multi-brand retail partners and the optimisation of the wholesale distribution network. Sales in France contracted and were in line with prior year in Switzerland. The United Kingdom enjoyed good growth. Sales of all product lines were broadly in line or positive, compared to prior year, with the exception of watches. Retail sales growth was subdued, whilst sales in the wholesale channel declined.

Asia Pacific
Sales in Asia Pacific registered strong broad-based double digit growth. This performance was led by China, Hong Kong, Korea and Macau, and, at product level, driven by jewellery and watches. Both retail and wholesale channels saw double digit growth.

The region accounted for 40% of Group sales. 

Americas
Sales in the Americas grew by 8%, driven by strong retail sales, supported by jewellery and clothing. Retail sales also reflected increased online sales and the favourable full year impact of the reopening of the Cartier flagship store in New York in September 2016. Wholesale and watch sales both declined, impacted by inventory management initiatives. The region's contribution to Group sales amounted to 16%.

Japan
Japan posted a 6% increase in sales, favourably impacted by increased tourism purchases. The year under review also benefited from softer comparative figures and the full year contribution from the reopened Cartier and the newly opened Piaget and Van Cleef and Arpels flagship stores, all in Ginza, Tokyo.

Good sales growth in jewellery, watches as well as in the retail channel more than offset the decline in wholesale sales.

Middle East and Africa
Sales in the Middle East and Africa increased by 2%, benefiting primarily from higher tourist spending but were adversely impacted by inventory buy-backs and geopolitical uncertainties. Jewellery, watches and writing instruments posted moderate growth.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current year and the comparative year at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
 
The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates unless otherwise stated.

Retail
The contribution of retail sales, through the Maisons' online stores and 1 123 directly operated boutiques, has increased to 63% of Group sales, up from 60% in the prior year.

The double digit growth generated in the retail channel was fuelled by jewellery and watches with six net store openings including the internalisation of external points of sales.

All regions experienced double digit growth, with the exception of Europe, which posted subdued growth. 
 
Wholesale
The Group's wholesale business, including sales to franchise partners, reported a 1% decline. All regions other than Asia Pacific showed lower sales. Sales were impacted by the previously described watch inventory management initiatives. 

 
Sales and operating result by segment

Jewellery Maisons

+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
|in EUR millions |31 March 2018|31 March 2017|Change  |
+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
|Sales           |6 447        |5 927        |+9%     |
+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
|Operating result|1 926        |1 682        |+15%    |
+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
|Operating margin|29.9%        |28.4%        |+150 bps|
+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+

At actual exchange rates, sales at Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpels were driven by high single digit growth in jewellery and double digit growth in watches, on the back of the prior year's exceptional inventory buy-backs and the success of the relaunched Panthère collection, both at Cartier. The performance of the Jewellery Maisons' directly operated boutiques and, regionally, Asia Pacific and the Americas were particularly noteworthy. 

The EUR 244 million increase in operating result reflects robust sales and cost control as well as the non-recurrence of the EUR 151 million one–time charges in the prior year. Consequently, operating margin improved by 150 basis points to 29.9%. 

Specialist Watchmakers

+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
|Operating margin|         9.7%|         7.8%|+190 bps|
+----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+

The 6% decline in Specialist Watchmakers' sales reflects inventory control measures, including buy-backs, and distribution optimisation initiatives undertaken in the year under review. Wholesale sales registered a double digit decrease, with Europe, the Americas and Middle East and Africa particularly impacted. Excluding inventory buy-backs in both years, sales would have been broadly in line. Sales in the Specialist Watchmakers' directly operated boutiques enjoyed a double digit increase, sustained by strong demand for watches and Piaget jewellery. Sales in Asia Pacific posted growth. 

Higher capacity utilisation, a larger share of retail and tight cost control led to a 16% improvement in the operating result to EUR 262 million, notwithstanding the EUR 203 million sales reduction linked to inventory buy-backs. Consequently, the operating margin for the period increased by 190 basis points to 9.7%.

'Other' includes Montblanc, the Group's Fashion and Accessories businesses, its watch component manufacturing and real estate activities. 

Sales were broadly in line with prior year, with growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. The year was marked by continued positive performances at Montblanc and Peter Millar.

In the year under review, the operating result included one-time charges of EUR 37 million (FY17: EUR 114 million net gain), relating to the write down of assets at Shanghai Tang and Lancel. Excluding one-time items in both years, operating losses would have been EUR 28 million in the current year and EUR 4 million in the prior year.

Corporate costs represent the costs of central management, marketing support and other central functions (collectively central support services), as well as other expenses and income which are not allocated to specific business areas. The majority of corporate costs are incurred in Switzerland. Excluding transaction costs relating to portfolio investments, corporate costs grew by 3%.

(the ""Offeror"") pursuant to Article 102 and Article 106, paragraph 4, of the TUF for all the issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (the ""Issuer"" or ""YNAP"") other than those that the Offeror and the persons acting in concert with the Offeror already own (the ""Offer"").

Capitalised words have the meaning ascribed in the offer document (the ""Offer Document"") approved by Consob resolution no. 20335 of 14 March 2018 and published on 18 March 2018.

Based on the final results communicated by Banca IMI S.p.A., in its capacity as Intermediary Appointed to Coordinate the Collection of Acceptances, the YNAP Shares tendered in the Offer during the Acceptance Period totalled 64,940,119, corresponding to 70.004% of YNAP’s ordinary share capital at the end of the Acceptance Period and 93.332% of the YNAP Shares subject to the Offer.

In this respect, please note that no. 337,397 YNAP Shares have been issued to service the Stock Options and no. 400,934 YNAP Shares have been issued to Richemont UK upon exercise of Conversion requests pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 5 of the by-laws of YNAP.

2. MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE LEVEL CONDITION AND MAC CONDITION

As mentioned in the company announcement on the provisional results of the Offer and stated in Section A.1, points (ii), Warning Section, of the Offer Document, the effectiveness of the Offer is subject to, among other things, the Minimum Acceptance Level Condition.

At the end of the Acceptance Period, the 64,940,119 YNAP Shares tendered in the Offer and the 23,187,386 YNAP Shares already held by Richemont UK, Person Acting in Concert with the Offeror, total 88,127,505, corresponding to 94.999% of YNAP's ordinary share capital.

In light of the above, Richemont hereby confirms that the Minimum Acceptance Level Condition has been fulfilled, as the 90% threshold of YNAP's ordinary share capital has been exceeded.

As mentioned in the company announcement on the provisional results of the Offer and stated in Section A.1, points (iii), Warning Section, of the Offer Document, the effectiveness of the Offer is also subject to the non-occurrence, by 7:59 of the Stock Exchange Trading Day before the Consideration Payment Date, of: (a) extraordinary events or circumstances causing significant changes in national or international political, financial, economic, monetary or market situation that have a material adverse effect on the Offer or the assets, economic or financial situation of YNAP or the companies pertaining to the YNAP Group (taken as a whole) as represented in the quarterly report of YNAP as at 30 September 2017; or (b) events or circumstances related to YNAP or the YNAP Group that are not known to the market as at the Launch Date and that cause, or are reasonably likely to cause, material adverse changes to the assets, economic or financial situation of YNAP or the companies pertaining to the YNAP Group (taken as a whole) as represented in the quarterly report of YNAP as at 30 September 2017 (the ""MAC Condition"").

Richemont hereby declares that the MAC Condition is fulfilled and, therefore, the Offer is effective.

As a consequence of the above, the Offeror will: (a) purchase all the YNAP Shares tendered in the Offer during the Acceptance Period, as explained in more detail in Section 3 of this company announcement; and (b) fulfil the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF with respect to: (i) the remaining 4,646,879 YNAP Shares (i.e., the YNAP Shares which were not tendered during the Acceptance Period and the YNAP Shares issued by YNAP upon exercise of the Stock Options after the end of the Acceptance Period), corresponding to 5.009% of YNAP's ordinary share capital; and (ii) the maximum no. 3,250,174 YNAP Shares that might be issued upon exercise of the Stock Options and of the Change of Control Stock Options (together, the ""Remaining YNAP Shares""), as explained in more detail below.

Based on the above final results, the overall consideration that will be paid on the Consideration Payment Date amounts to Euro 2,467,724,522.

The Offeror's obligation to pay the Consideration under the Offer shall be deemed to have been fulfilled when the Consideration has been transferred to the Appointed Intermediaries. The Tendering Shareholders will bear the entire risk that the Appointed Intermediaries or the Depository Intermediaries fail to transfer such amounts to the parties entitled thereto or delay such transfer.

4. FULFILMENT OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE TUF

In light of the final results of the Offer, the Offeror and the Persons Acting in Concert will come to hold an overall shareholding greater than 90%, but lower than 95%, of the ordinary share capital of the Issuer. Furthermore, the Offeror already declared in the Offer Document its intention not to restore a free float sufficient to ensure the regular trading of the YNAP Shares on the Milan Stock Exchange, pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF. As a consequence, as stated in Section A.7, Warning Section, and Section G.3, of the Offer Document, the Offeror hereby announces that:

(i) in accordance with Article 40-bis, paragraph 1, letter a) of the Issuers' Regulation, the Reopening of the Acceptance Period will not occur; and

(ii) the requirements for the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF have been met and, as a consequence, the Offeror will offer to acquire the Remaining YNAP Shares, from the Issuer's shareholders so requesting, for a consideration, per YNAP Share, that will be equal to the Consideration, as explained in more detail in Section 5 of this company announcement.

As agreed with Borsa Italiana, the Sell-out Procedure for the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF, will be carried out according to the modalities and terms as set forth below.

5. CONSIDERATION FOR THE FULFILMENT OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE TUF

The Offeror will acquire the Remaining YNAP Shares from the Issuer's shareholders so requesting for a consideration, per YNAP Share, that will be equal to the Consideration (i.e., Euro 38.00 per YNAP Share) (the ""Consideration for the Purchase Obligation""), in accordance with Article 108, paragraph 3, of the TUF. In light of the number of Remaining YNAP Shares subject to the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF, the maximum consideration for the Remaining YNAP Shares will be equal to Euro 300,088,014.

Please note that, as stated in Section A.2, Warning Section, of the Offer Document, and Section G.1, of the Offer Document, the Cash Confirmation Issuing Bank has issued, on 15 March 2018, the Cash Confirmation letter, to guarantee the full and correct performance of the Offeror's payment obligations relating to the Offer, including the payment price for the Remaining YNAP Shares purchased in execution of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF.

6. SELL-OUT PERIOD

The Offeror announces that in accordance with Article 108, paragraph 6, of the TUF, as agreed with Borsa Italiana, the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF, will be carried out from 8:30 a.m. on 21 May 2018 until 5:30 p.m. on 8 June 2018 inclusive (the ""Sell-out Period"").

The holders of the Remaining YNAP Shares will be able to tender in the Offer their Remaining YNAP Shares in the course of the Sell-out Period.

7. MODALITIES FOR THE SUBMISSION OF THE REQUESTS FOR SALE

The holders of the Remaining YNAP Shares (the ""Requesting Shareholders"") will be able to tender in the Offer their Remaining YNAP Shares in the course of the Sell-out Period by submitting the request for sale form (the ""Request for Sale"") signed and duly filled out by and not later than the last day of the Sell-out Period (i.e., 8 June 2018), by simultaneously depositing the Remaining YNAP Shares therein included at the Appointed Intermediaries.

The Requesting Shareholders might also submit the Request for Sale and deposit their Remaining YNAP shares therein included at the Depository Intermediary, provided that the submission and the deposit are carried out in time to allow the Depository Intermediary to deposit the Remaining YNAP Shares at the Appointed Intermediaries by and not later than the last day of the Sell-out Period (i.e., 8 June 2018).

The Remaining YNAP Shares, in order to be tendered in the Sell-out Procedure, must be properly registered and available in a securities account of the Requesting Shareholder held by one of the Depository Intermediaries. The Remaining YNAP Shares must be free from liens and burdens of any kind and nature, whether real, obligatory or personal, and must be freely transferable to the Offeror. Furthermore, the Remaining YNAP Shares deriving from purchase transactions made on the market can be tendered in the Sell-out Procedures only after the regulation of the said transaction has been completed through the liquidation system.

Signing of the Request for Sale will be valid even as irrevocable instruction given by the individual owner of the Remaining YNAP Shares to the Appointed Intermediary or the relative Depository Intermediary at whom the Remaining YNAP Shares are deposited in securities account, to transfer the aforementioned Remaining YNAP Shares in deposits at such Appointed Intermediary or Depository Intermediary in favour of the Offeror at the Sell-out Procedure settlement date.

Upon signature of the Requests for Sale, a mandate will be given by the Requesting Shareholder to the Appointed Intermediary and the Depository Intermediary (if any) to execute all the formalities necessary and required to transfer the Remaining YNAP Shares to the Offeror who shall bear the relative cost.

The Requesting Shareholders will remain exclusively responsible for the risk that the Depository Intermediaries do not deliver the Requests for Sale to the Appointed Intermediaries by the last day of the Sell-out Period.

The Requests for Sale are irrevocable.

8. DELISTING

Pursuant to Article 2.5.1, paragraph 6, of the Stock Exchange Regulation, Borsa Italiana will order the Delisting from the Milan Stock Exchange effective as of 20 June 2018, suspending the YNAP Shares from listing and trading on 18 and 19 June 2018, taking into account, where applicable, the timing for the exercise of the Squeeze-out Right.

Upon the Delisting, please note that the shareholders of YNAP who have not tendered their YNAP Shares to the Offer will hold financial instruments that are not traded on any regulated market, with resulting difficulty in liquidating their investment.

9. SETTLEMENT DATE FOR THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE TUF AND TRANSFER OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE REMAINING YNAP SHARES TO THE OFFEROR

The Consideration for the Purchase Obligation will be paid in cash by the Offeror on the fifth Stock Exchange Trading Day following the end of the Sell-out Period and, therefore, on 15 June 2018 (the ""Consideration for the Purchase Obligation Payment Date""). The Consideration for the Purchase Obligation will be paid by the Offeror through the Intermediary Appointed to Coordinate the Collection of Acceptances, to the Appointed Intermediaries that will transfer the funds to the Depository Intermediaries for crediting to the accounts of their respective customers, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Requesting Shareholders in the Requests for Sales.

The Offeror's obligation to pay the Consideration for the Purchase Obligation Payment Date shall be deemed to have been fulfilled when the respective consideration has been transferred to the Appointed Intermediaries. The Requesting Shareholders will bear the entire risk that the Appointed Intermediaries or the Depository Intermediaries fail to transfer such amounts to the parties entitled thereto or delay such transfer.

10. PURCHASE OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 108, PARAGRAPH 1, OF THE TUF AND EXERCISE OF THE SQUEEZE-OUT RIGHT

In the event that – as a consequence of the fulfilment of the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the TUF, and of any purchase made outside of the Offer pursuant to applicable law – the Offeror and the Persons Acting in Concert hold an overall shareholding equal or greater than 95% of the ordinary share capital of the Issuer, the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF will apply.

As stated in Section A.8, Warning Section, of the Offer Document, and Section G.3, of the Offer Document, the Offeror declares its intention to exercise the Squeeze-out Right pursuant to Article 111, of the TUF over the remaining outstanding YNAP Shares (the ""Additional Remaining YNAP Shares"").

Therefore the Offeror, by exercising the Squeeze-out Right, will simultaneously fulfil the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF with respect to the shareholders of YNAP so requesting. The Offeror will carry out a single procedure (the ""Joint Procedure"") in order to fulfil the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF and exercise the Squeeze-out Right. The Joint Procedure, whose terms and conditions will be agreed with Consob and Borsa Italiana pursuant to Article 50-quinquies, paragraph 1, of the Issuers' Regulation, will be exercised over the remaining outstanding YNAP Shares at the Sell-out Procedure settlement date on 15 June 2018.

The Offeror will disclose whether or not the legal requirements for the execution of the Joint Procedure have been met in the company announcement on the provisional results of the Sell-out Procedure, and the following information will be provided: (i) the amount of Additional Remaining YNAP Shares (either as a number of YNAP Shares or as a percentage of the overall ordinary share capital of the Issuer); and (ii) the procedures and the terms pursuant to which the Offeror will comply with the Squeeze-out Right and will fulfil, within the same procedure, the Purchase Obligation pursuant to Article 108, paragraph 1, of the TUF, as well as the timing for the Delisting.

The Offeror will acquire the remaining outstanding YNAP Shares for a consideration, per YNAP Share, that will be equal to the Consideration (i.e., Euro 38.00 per Additional Remaining YNAP Share).

22 JANUARY 2018

RICHEMONT ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO LAUNCH
VOLUNTARY PUBLIC TENDER OFFER
FOR YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP ORDINARY SHARES

Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (Richemont), the Swiss luxury goods group, wishes to announce that it has notified YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A and the relevant market authorities of its intention to launch a voluntary public tender offer (the ""Offer"") to acquire all the issued and to be issued ordinary shares of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A (""YNAP"") that it or its affiliates do not already own. Under the terms of the Offer, for each ordinary YNAP share held, YNAP shareholders would receive Euro 38.00 (thirty eight) per share.

The terms, conditions and essential elements of the Offer are summarised in the official notice in accordance with Article 102, paragraph 1, of the Legislative Decree of 24 February 1998, no. 58, a translation of which is set out appended to this announcement.

YNAP has waived the standstill obligation included in the shareholder agreement entered into on 31 March 2015, which would otherwise prevent Richemont and all its affiliates from purchasing any further ordinary shares of YNAP save in certain circumstances.

Furthermore, an irrevocable undertaking to accept the offer in respect of all of his shares has been received from Mr Federico Marchetti, chief executive officer of YNAP.

Commenting on the offer, Mr Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

Quote

""Over a century ago the famous aviator, Alberto Santos-Dumont, complained to his friend, Louis Cartier, about the difficulty of checking his pocket watch whilst flying. He needed to keep his hands on the plane's controls, but instead kept having to fumble for the pocket watch. Louis Cartier listened and, Eureka!, an idea was born, which was to become the Santos-Dumont wristwatch – the first pilot watch.

Ever since then, the success of our various Maisons has been dependent on giving our clients the best possible products and service.

This client centric obsession led us to invest in very many avenues.

We are therefore proud to have participated in the growth of NET-A-PORTER since its infancy and in the creation of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP, the world's leading online luxury retailer. With this new step, we intend to strengthen Richemont's presence and focus on the digital channel, which is becoming critically important in meeting luxury consumers' needs.

We are very pleased with the results achieved by YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP's management team, led by Mr Federico Marchetti, and we intend to support them going forward to execute their strategy and further accelerate the growth of the business. Thanks to our long-term commitment and resources, we see a meaningful opportunity to strengthen further YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP's leading positioning in luxury e-commerce, growing the business in existing and new geographies, increasing product availability and range, and continuing to develop unparalleled services and content for today's highly discerning consumers. As part of our Group, YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP would continue to operate as a separate business, ensuring it remains a neutral and highly attractive platform for third party luxury brands.""

Any such purchases will not be made at prices higher than the Offer price or on terms more favourable than those offered pursuant to the Offer unless the Offer price is increased accordingly.
From the date of this announcement until settlement of the Offer, the Offeror, the companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Offeror, the relevant directors, members of auditing bodies and general managers and any persons acting in concert with the Offeror must communicate each purchase of Shares made by them, directly or through representatives, by the end of the day when the purchase is made, to the National Commission for Companies and the Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana and the market and publish the communication on the website indicated by the Offeror in this announcement for the purposes of publishing communications, announcements and documents related to the Offer.

The Offeror will provide Consob with the offer document (the ""Offer Document"") that will be published in compliance with the terms and conditions provided for by the applicable law.
The terms, conditions and essential elements of the Offer are summarised here below.

* * *

1.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND PURPOSE OF THE OFFER

1.1 Legal framework
The Offer is a voluntary tender offer for all ordinary shares of YNAP that will be issued and outstanding as at the time of the Offer and that the Offeror and its affiliates do not already own, which, as of today's date, are no. 68,463,120 ordinary shares and correspond to 75.03% of YNAP's ordinary shares, launched in accordance with Article 102 and Article 106, fourth paragraph, of the CFA and the provisions of the Issuers' Regulation.
Richemont Holdings (UK) Limited (""Richemont UK""), an Offeror's affiliate belonging to Richemont, holds:
(i)     no. 22,786,452 ordinary shares of the Issuer, representing 24.97% of its voting share capital; and
(ii)    no. 42,813,145 'B' shares without voting rights of the Issuer.
On 31 March 2015, the Issuer, Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. and Richemont UK entered into a shareholders' agreement (the ""Shareholders' Agreement"") whereby, among other things, Richemont UK undertook a standstill obligation preventing it and all its affiliates from purchasing any further ordinary shares of YNAP save in certain circumstances.
The Issuer has granted its consent to the Offeror's acquisition of the ordinary shares of the Issuer in connection with the Offer. The consent has been formalised in a written amendment agreement to the Shareholders' Agreement.
The Parties to the Shareholders' Agreement have further agreed that it be terminated upon the Offer becoming unconditional.

1.2 Purpose of the Offer
1.2.1   Strategic Rationale
Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. has been committed to the Net-A-Porter business since its infancy, becoming a minority investor first, and then a controlling shareholder in 2010. Since the Net-A-Porter merger with Yoox in 2015, Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. has continued to support the combined group as its largest shareholder, convinced of the compelling market opportunity and impressed with the quality of YNAP's management team, led by Mr Federico Marchetti.
As the digital channel becomes increasingly critical to engage with customers in the luxury industry, Richemont intends to further strengthen its commitment to this channel.
Today YNAP is the world's leading online luxury retailer and has delivered a solid track-record of growth. Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. believes that continued further investment will be required for YNAP to deliver compelling growth in the increasingly competitive e-commerce market.
Supported by Richemont's long-term commitment and resources, sophisticated and globally dispersed clientele, we see a meaningful opportunity to further strengthen YNAP's leadership in luxury e-commerce, growing the business in existing and new geographies, increasing product availability and range, and continuing to develop unparalleled services and content for its discerning clientele.
As part of Richemont, YNAP would continue to be run as a separate business alongside Richemont's other businesses, ensuring it remains a neutral and highly attractive platform for third party luxury brands. Further, Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. intends to keep YNAP's headquarters in Italy.

1.2.2   Delisting and Squeeze-Out
The Offer aims at obtaining the delisting of the Issuer's ordinary shares from the Stock Exchange Market managed and organised by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. The delisting (whose terms and conditions will be better described in the Offer Document) could result from:
YNAP's ordinary shares being tendered in the Offer, when added to those already owned by Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A. and its affiliates, exceeding 90%, as better specified below;
the merger of the Issuer into the Offeror after completion of the Offer.
In fact, in the event that, following the Offer, the Offeror, together with its affiliates, comes to hold a shareholding exceeding 90% of YNAP's ordinary shares outstanding at that time, the Offeror will not restore the free float and, in accordance with Article 108 of the CFA, will purchase the remaining YNAP's ordinary shares from any YNAP shareholder exercising the sell-out right provided by applicable law.
In the event that, following the Offer, the Offeror, together with its affiliates, comes to hold a shareholding at least equal to 95% of YNAP's ordinary shares outstanding at that time, the Offeror will exercise the purchase right provided for by Article 111 of the CFA (i.e., the squeeze-out right).

Review of trading in the three-month period ended 31 December 2017 at constant exchange rates

In Europe, the strength of the euro and challenging comparatives in the United Kingdom weighed on sales, which declined by 1%.

Double digit growth in Asia Pacific was driven by mainland China, Korea, Hong Kong and Macau. The performances of the Jewellery Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers were particularly noteworthy in this region.

The 8% growth in the Americas region reflected good performance from the Jewellery Maisons.

The 5% increase in sales in Japan was supported by strong growth from the Specialist Watchmakers and a favourable currency environment.

Sales in the Middle East and Africa rose by 11%, benefitting from favourable currencies, the internalisation of external points of sales and the anticipated introduction of a value added tax in the UAE.

Retail sales maintained strong momentum, recording double digit growth of 13%, underpinned by solid performances from the Jewellery Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers. Wholesale sales decreased by 3%, reflecting qualitative upgrades to our external distribution network and the monitoring of inventory at our multi-brand retail partners. Growth in Asia Pacific in the wholesale channel was offset by declines in other regions.

The Jewellery Maisons delivered the strongest sales progression, with an 11% increase reflecting strength in the retail channel.

The Specialist Watchmakers' performance, at +1%, was subdued, reflecting the continued monitoring of sell-in versus sell-out in the wholesale channel. Wholesale sales declined, partly offsetting double digit growth in retail.

The Other businesses posted stable sales with growth notably from Montblanc, Chloé and Lancel. Excluding the impact of the sale of Shanghai Tang, the Other businesses would have recorded moderate growth.

The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2017 amounted to EUR 5.1 billion (2016: EUR 5.2 billion).


Trading in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2017

Sales over the nine-month period to December increased by 10% at constant exchange rates and by 7% at actual exchange rates, continuing the positive trend seen in the first six months of the financial year. They are presented in Appendix 1a.


Corporate calendar

The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 18 May 2018, and its annual general meeting will be held on Monday, 10 September 2018 in Geneva.

Actual exchange rates for the period are calculated using the average daily closing rates against the euro.

In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2017 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the current three-month period, the current nine-month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.

TRIBUTE TO MR AZZEDINE ALAIA


Paying tribute to Mr Azzedine Alaïa Mr Johann Rupert, Chairman, said:

""Azzedine Alaïa was not only a colleague but a great friend, so it was with shock and enormous sadness that I heard of his untimely passing. The industry has lost an exceptional talent. He was a man of integrity and kindness who was also a true creative genius. With his unique approach to couture, he created a distinctive style that will forever set his creations apart.

Azzedine will be missed by all of us who had the good fortune to work with him. I wish to extend my sincerest condolences to his family and his friends.""


Established in 1983, the Maison Azzedine Alaïa, under the artistic control of Mr Alaïa, developed a reputation for originality in design as well as the choice and cut of materials. Each piece is unique, crafted with traditional dressmaking skills and passion in Mr Alaïa's Parisian atelier.

Chairman's commentary

The positive sales and profit performance achieved by Richemont in the first half of this financial year highlights the generally improved macro environment. The Group also benefited from easier comparative figures and favourable movements in period-end exchange rates.

Sales in the six month period increased by 10% at actual exchange rates and by 12% at constant exchange rates driven by growth across all segments, distribution channels and regions. Excluding the impact of the inventory buy-backs in the prior year period, sales would have increased by 8% at constant exchange rates. Jewellery and the retail channel posted the strongest performances. Most markets were in positive territory, led by mainland China, Korea, the United Kingdom and notably a return to growth in Hong Kong.

Operating profit on a reported basis rose by 46%, while profit for the period grew by 80% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the prior year period's one-time charges of EUR 249 million, operating profit increased by 11%. The first half of the year's results and cash flow on a comparative basis have been exceptional, primarily due to weak results in the prior period. While we cannot predict the environment for the full year, it is clear that the full year results on a comparative basis will not see the exceptional level of growth reported in the period under review.

Cash flow from operations increased by 66% to EUR 1 108 million as a result of improved operating profit and continued working capital discipline, with decreased inventories. Net cash at 30 September 2017 amounted to EUR 4 610 million, slightly up compared to September 2016.

In the period under review, Richemont disclosed that it had taken a stake in Dufry, a leading travel retail specialist listed on the Swiss stock exchange, reflecting our view that travel retail spending will increase over time.

Richemont's new Board and management team bring diverse skillsets which are relevant to the challenges our business is facing. They are focused on defining the Group's transformation agenda to meet the rapidly changing demands of luxury consumers. Our solid balance sheet provides the flexibility and resilience necessary to support our Maisons through this transformation journey.

Financial review

Sales
In the six-month period, sales increased by 10% at actual exchange rates and by 12% at constant exchange rates. Excluding inventory buy-backs in the prior year period, sales increased by 8% at constant exchange rates. This performance reflected growth in all major product categories, particularly jewellery. All regions posted higher sales, led by a strong performance in Asia Pacific, benefiting from double digit progression in mainland China and Hong Kong, amongst others. Both retail and wholesale channels delivered higher sales, with the latter primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of the above mentioned buy-backs. Further details on sales by region, distribution channel and segment are given below.

Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 13%, representing 65.4% of sales. The 190 basis point margin increase versus the prior year period is largely explained by the non-recurrence of the inventory buy-backs and improved manufacturing capacity absorption.

Operating profit
Operating profit rose by 46% to EUR 1 166 million in the six-month period mainly due to improved sales and gross margin. Operating margin strengthened to 21%.

The 3% increase in total operating expenses factors in a 3% growth in selling and distribution costs linked, in particular, to higher variable rental costs, notably in mainland China. Communication expenses were broadly in line with the prior year period, while administration costs grew by 5%, the latter mainly reflecting investments in ERP and digital initiatives.

Excluding the EUR 249 million one-time items in the prior year period, operating profit for the half year increased by 11%.

Profit for the period
Profit for the period increased by 80 % to EUR 974 million. This mainly reflects a higher operating profit and a EUR 181 million reversal in net finance income. Favourable movements in period-end exchange rates on our mark-to-market cash position led to an income of EUR 72 million, compared to a net cost of EUR 109 million in the prior year period. This is detailed below under 'Financial structure and balance sheet'.

Earnings per share (1 A share/10 B shares) increased by 80% to EUR 1.721 on a diluted basis.

To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the period ended 30 September 2017 would be EUR 1 000 million (2016: EUR 530 million). Basic HEPS for the period was EUR 1.773 (2016: EUR 0.940). Diluted HEPS for the period was EUR 1.767 (2016: EUR 0.937). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 8.3 of the Group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operations amounted to EUR 1 108 million, up EUR 442 million. The year-on-year improvement reflected the above-mentioned operating profit increase and a lower absorption of cash for working capital. The latter, at EUR 360 million, was below last year (2016: EUR 417 million) as a consequence of decreased inventories.

Net investment in tangible fixed assets during the period amounted to EUR 136 million, predominantly reflecting selective investments in the Maisons' network of boutiques and in the Group logistics centre at Villars-sur-Glâne in Switzerland.

The acquisition of other non-current assets primarily relates to the acquisition of a stake in Dufry, an entity listed on the SIX Swiss exchange.

The 2017 dividend of CHF 1.80 per share (1 A share/10 B shares) was paid to shareholders and to South African Depository Receipt holders, net of withholding tax, in September. The 35% withholding tax on all dividends was remitted to the Swiss tax authorities in September. The overall dividend cash outflow in the period amounted to EUR 918 million.

The Group acquired 1.9 million 'A' shares during the six-month period to hedge executive stock options. The cost of these purchases was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities related to the hedging programme, leading to a net outflow of EUR 72 million.

Financial structure and balance sheet
At 30 September 2017, inventories of EUR 4 928 million were EUR 374 million lower than at 31 March 2017, representing 20 months of cost of sales.

At 30 September 2017, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 4 610 million. The position is EUR 1 181 million lower than on 31 March 2017, including a cash outflow relating to the annual dividend payment and the Dufry investment. The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated money market funds, short-term bank deposits and medium-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars. Bank loans to finance local operating entities are denominated in their local currencies.

Richemont's balance sheet remains strong, with shareholders' equity representing 76% of total equity and liabilities.

The following comments on Group sales refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates.

Europe
Europe accounted for 29% of overall sales. Sales in the region grew by 3%, partly impacted by the increasing strength of the Euro. Performance within the region was characterised by double digit growth in the United Kingdom, moderate growth in most major markets and stable sales in France.

Asia Pacific
Sales in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 39% of Group sales, with mainland China being the largest market in the region. Sales increased by 25% with double digit growth in most markets led by mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea and Macau. All product categories enjoyed growth. Jewellery and watch sales were particularly strong year-on-year, with the latter benefiting from the non-recurrence of the inventory buy-backs of the prior year period.

Americas
Sales in the Americas region grew by 10% on the strength of jewellery and to a lesser degree clothing. Of particular note is the performance of Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels, Piaget and Peter Millar. The reopening of the Cartier flagship store in New York in September 2016 and the opening of the Van Cleef and Arpels Design District store in Miami in March 2017 had a positive impact.

Japan
The 7% growth in sales was driven by higher domestic and tourist spending, which benefited from a weaker yen as well as easy year-on-year comparative figures. Jewellery and watches led sales growth, partly supported by the reopening of the Cartier flagship store (September 2016) and new Piaget (November 2016) and Van Cleef and Arpels (April 2017) flagship stores, all in Ginza.

Middle East and Africa
The good performance in watches and writing instruments was partly offset by weak sales in the other product categories. Overall, sales increased by 3%, affected by geopolitical uncertainties in the region.

Retail
Retail sales recorded strong growth of 13%, driven by watches and jewellery. All regions showed higher retail sales, with Asia Pacific, Japan and the Americas posting double digit growth rates. The Maisons' 1 115 directly operated boutiques and online stores contributed 59% of Group sales.

Wholesale
The Group's wholesale business, including sales to franchise partners, increased by 11%, with all major product categories showing growth. Watch and clothing sales registered double digit improvements, benefiting from the non-recurrence of the prior year period's inventory buy-backs. Most regions showed growth with Asia Pacific enjoying the strongest increase.

+------------------+------------------+------------------+---------+

The 15% increase in sales at the Jewellery Maisons included double digit growth at both Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpels, with good performance in jewellery and watches, and improvements in all regions. The higher sales were supported by the non-recurrence of the prior year period's watch inventory buy-backs at Cartier.

The operating results improved by 30% compared to the prior year period. The operating margin increased 360 basis points to 31%, a level broadly in line with the prior year period excluding the above-mentioned initiative.

+------------------+------------------+------------------+---------+

The Specialist Watchmakers' sales increased by 6% with improvements in both the retail and wholesale channels. Performance was varied among the Maisons and the regions, led by good growth in Asia Pacific. The performances of Piaget, Roger Dubuis and Officine Panerai were particularly noteworthy.

The operating results recovered to EUR 294 million driven by a return to growth, the non-recurrence of inventory buy-backs and fixed costs discipline. Consequently, the operating margin for the period increased to 19%.

'Other' includes Montblanc, the Group's Fashion and Accessories businesses and the Group's watch component manufacturing activities.

The modest growth was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe. Most Maisons showed an increase in sales, with Alfred Dunhill and Lancel returning to growth.

The increase in operating results to EUR 6 million comes after one-time items of EUR 67 million in the prior year period stemming from the inventory buy-back as well as from the optimisation of certain retail and wholesale locations.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
17 OCTOBER 2017

Significant movement in operating profit and profit for the period 
for the six months ended 30 September 2017


SIX Swiss Exchange requires that issuers make an announcement without delay where the foreseeable profit or loss for a given period is expected to deviate significantly from the profit or loss achieved in the prior year period. Both significant increases and decreases in the anticipated, unaudited profit or loss require the publication of an ad hoc notice to the market. In accordance with these requirements, Richemont makes the following announcement:

Trading for the six months ended 30 September 2017 showed sales rising 10% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. On this basis, Richemont's operating profit for the six months ended 30 September 2017 is likely to show an increase of approximately 45% against the comparative period. The corresponding profit for the period is expected to increase by approximately 80%. These increases predominantly reflect the non-recurrence of the exceptional inventory buy-backs in the prior year period, improved trading performance and the positive net impact of movements in period-end exchange rates.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

Richemont Securities SA CFR DRs are issued subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement entered into on 18 December 1992, most recently amended on 26 March 2014. By holding DR's, investors acknowledge that they are bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement. Copies of the Deposit Agreement may be obtained by investors from Richemont Securities SA or Computershare Investor Services (Pty) Limited.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current five-month period and the comparative period at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
 
The following comments on the Group's performance refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates.
 
The double digit sales growth during the first five months was primarily driven by strong performance in the Jewellery Maisons and easier comparative figures.
 
Sales increased in all regions, led by Asia Pacific. The strong performance in Asia Pacific was supported by double digit increases in most markets, including China and Hong Kong, where a large part of the exceptional inventory buy-backs took place in the comparative period. The 3% growth in Europe reflects contrasted performances within the region as well as the emerging negative impact of a strong euro on tourist spending. In the United Kingdom, however, sales grew at a double digit rate benefitting from favourable currency movements. In Japan, growth reflected higher domestic and tourist spending. Sales in the Middle East showed subdued growth, impacted by geopolitical uncertainties.

Retail sales increased in most regions, with solid growth in Asia Pacific, Japan and the Americas. Retail sales were driven by strong performances in the Jewellery Maisons and the Specialist Watchmakers as well as by the reopening of the Cartier flagship stores in New York and Tokyo a year ago. The 11% increase in wholesale sales primarily reflects the impact of the non-recurrence of the exceptional inventory buy-backs.
 
Richemont’s other businesses reported sales growth overall, with most Maisons showing continued progress.
 
The results for the six-months ending 30 September 2017 will be announced on 10 November 2017.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS IN RESPECT OF UNDERLYING COMPAGNIE FINANCIERE RICHEMONT SA 'A' SHARES ('CFR DRs')

The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand.

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.80 per share.  It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on 13 September 2017 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 percent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.170 per share. 

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 percent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 28 September 2017, at the time of the payment of the dividend. In the past, certain CFR DR Holders may have lost their opportunity to reclaim the withholding tax due to incorrect contact information being supplied to Strate. We suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure the information held in the Strate system is correct. In completing last year's withholding tax reclaim, claimants may have included their email address. For all of those who provided this information, the withholding tax reclaim form will be sent by email to you. For those who did not provide email details we would ask you to contact Computershare at the following address WHT.Richemont@Computershare.co.za Once received Computershare will email the withholding tax reclaim form to you for your completion. We hope that this may alleviate the postal difficulties some claimants have experienced in the past. If you do not have an email address, please contact Computershare on 0861 100 935, to arrange a withholding tax reclaim form to be posted to you.

Following the increase in the South African dividends tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent a revised binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, those depository receipt holders who are not exempt from the South African dividends tax will be subject to a rate of 5 percent South African tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. Those depository receipt holders who qualify for exemption from the South African tax (e.g. South African companies and non-residents of South Africa) must ensure that they have filed the relevant exemption forms with their brokers/ banks in order to ensure that no South African tax is withheld.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 13.49527: Swiss franc 1. Accordingly, the net dividend payable per CFR DR after South African dividend tax is ZAR 145.74892 cents, as set out in the table below:

Under the withholding tax recovery programme, qualifying SACMA residents will currently be entitled to recover the equivalent of CHF 0.036 per CFR DR. The amount recovered will be converted into rand and will be remitted to CFR DR holders who participate in the programme once the reimbursement of the tax has been received from the Swiss Federal Tax Authorities ('SFTA'). Your attention is drawn to the fact that the refunds are to be paid by the SFTA in Swiss francs. The Swiss francs received by Richemont Securities SA will be converted into rand at the rand: Swiss franc exchange rate ruling at the time of receipt. Bearing in mind the fluctuating rand: Swiss franc exchange rate, the effective rate used to arrive at the rand refund payment to CFR DR holders will differ from that applicable to the dividend payment itself.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""      Tuesday, 19 September 2017

Trading commences ""ex-dividend""

CFR DR dividend payment date           Thursday, 28 September 2017


CFR DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of CFR DRs between Wednesday, 20 September 2017 and Friday, 22 September 2017 both days inclusive, nor will transfers to/from the South African branch register be permitted between 20 September 2017 and 22 September 2017 (both dates inclusive).

Richemont Securities SA
South African Dividend Tax

Further to our communication to depositary receipt ('DR') holders on 13 March 2017, Richemont Securities SA is still in the process of clarifying the treatment of the revised South African dividend tax with the South African Revenue Service ('SARS'). However, in the interim phase we would like to advise you that non-South African tax resident DR holders should, if they have not already done so; complete the prescribed dividend exemption form (SARS exemption form DTD (EX)). Previously, due to the ruling obtained by Richemont from SARS, DR holders were exempt from completing this document. Once this form has been completed and returned to your regulated intermediary, such as your bank or broker, qualifying non-South African DR holders will be exempt from the 20 per cent South African dividend tax. We recommend that these holders contact their bank or broker to ensure this exemption form is completed well in advance of the dividend payment in September 2017.

South African tax resident DR holders who are exempt from the dividend tax should also confirm with their bank or broker that the exemption forms are in place.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH
AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS (‘CFR DR’)

The foreign dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities’ CFR
DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area (‘SACMA’) is
derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA,
Switzerland (‘CFR’) to holders of Richemont ‘A’ shares.

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand
and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all
dematerialised   holdings  and   Computershare  Investor   Services
Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register.

The Board of directors have recommended a total dividend of
CHF 1.8000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that
this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual
general meeting to be held on Wednesday 13 September 2017 in Geneva.
The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax
of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.1700 per share.
South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of
the 35 per cent Swiss withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend.

However, the South African dividend tax rate was increased from 15
percent to 20 percent effective 22 February 2017. The new South
African dividend tax rate may impact the amount of South African tax
to be levied (after taking into account the rebate for the Swiss tax
paid). Accordingly, Richemont is in discussion with the South African
Revenue Service (SARS) to seek a ruling to clarify the approach to
be taken.


As CFR DR’s trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont ‘A’ share,
the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

                Gross   dividend   Withholding tax
                per CFR DR         at 35%               Net dividend

Total           0.1800             (0.0630)             0.1170

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to
Rand for payment of the dividend will be confirmed in a separate
announcement to be released on SENS on Tuesday 12 September 2017,
being the finalisation date.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African
CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade “cum dividend”           Tuesday,19 September 2017

The income statement for 2016 reflects the results of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP as a discontinued operation.

Chairman's commentary

Overview of results
The past year posed challenges for Richemont. The Group responded to changes in demand, which particularly affected our watch businesses, and shifting patterns of consumption. The Group has addressed those challenges by taking significant measures which, while having weighed on short term financial performance, will ensure Richemont is well positioned for the future.

In the year under review, Richemont reported a limited decrease in sales reflecting growth in retail sales offset by a decline in wholesale sales. The second half of the year saw an improvement overall. The USA, Richemont's largest country, resumed growth while Mainland China, now the Group's second largest country, enjoyed strong growth along with Korea, the United Kingdom and Macau. Excluding exceptional initiatives to improve inventory at our multi-brand retail partners and to optimise certain retail and wholesale locations, the decline in sales would have been contained to 2% at constant exchange rates.

Growth in jewellery, leather goods and writing instruments partly mitigated weak wholesale sales which were largely affected by the above mentioned initiatives. Cartier watches, within the Jewellery Maisons, and the Specialist Watchmakers were impacted by exceptional buy-backs and capacity adjustment measures. Montblanc, Chloe and Peter Millar reported good progress.

Our Maisons have continued to adjust their fixed cost bases and manufacturing structures to a sustainable level of demand. Accordingly, significant one-time charges were recorded in operating profit, which decreased by 14%.

Profit for the year was well below the prior year's level. Excluding the one-time gain on the merger of the NET-A-PORTER and YOOX Groups in the prior year, profit for the year would have decreased by 24%.

Good working capital management limited the decline in cash flow from operations whilst cost control and the disposal of investment properties contributed to an increase in net cash to EUR 5.8 billion at 31 March 2017.

Dividend
Based upon the cash flow generation and the increase in net cash, the Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 1.80 per share; up from CHF 1.70 per share last year.

As announced in November 2016, we are in a period of senior management change. My valued colleague, Mr Richard Lepeu, retired from his position as Chief Executive Officer on 31 March this year. He has played an invaluable role over the past 38 years in building Richemont to its current size and strength through his involvement with Cartier for the first 22 years, and at Group level for the last 16 years. I am pleased to say that Richard will be advising me on Group and Maison developments going forward.

I should also like to thank Mr Gary Saage for his contribution to ensuring financial discipline across the Group in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer. Richemont's strong cash position is due in no small measure to Gary's strict management of working capital – something that I know his successor will continue to pay close attention to. Gary returns to the US and hands over his position at the end of July this year. However, he will remain as a non-executive director on the Board.

Richemont's new senior management team comprises Mr Georges Kern, who is responsible for our watchmaking businesses, digital and marketing and Mr Jerome Lambert, who has responsibility for the Richemont regional platforms and services and for our other businesses other than Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels and the specialist watchmakers. They both took up their new roles formally at the beginning of April, having benefited from a handover period with Richard. Mr Cyrille Vigneron continues to oversee Cartier and Mr Nicolas Bos Van Cleef and Arpels. Mr Burkhart Grund took on the role of Deputy Group CFO last year and will take over from Gary with effect from 1 August this year.

Annual General Meeting
The following board members will not be standing for re-election at the annual general meeting to be held in September: Mr Yves Andre Istel, Mr Bernard Fornas, Mr Richard Lepeu, Mr Simon Murray, Mr Norbert Platt, Lord Renwick of Clifton, Prof Juergen Schrempp and The Duke of Wellington. We will miss the contribution from those former senior executives and non-executive directors and I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of them for their loyal and valuable support. Their wisdom and knowledge of Richemont's businesses will, however, not be lost to the Group, as they will continue to support your Board in an individual advisory capacity in the future.

At the annual general meeting, shareholders will be asked to elect nine new directors to the Board: Messrs Nicolas Bos, Burkhart Grund, Georges Kern, and Jerome Lambert would serve as executive directors; Messrs Clay Brendish, Nikesh Arora and Anton Rupert, my son, as well as Dr Keyu Jin and Dr Vesna Nevestic would serve as non executive directors. Their biographies may be found in the annual report.

Mr Clay Brendish, a graduate of Imperial College London, qualified as a Chartered Engineer. His professional background is in the Information Technology and Telecommunications industry, having founded Admiral plc in 1979. Clay currently serves as an advisor to Richemont's Strategic Security Committee. If elected, Clay will serve as a non-executive director and will serve as lead independent director, a position he is extremely well-qualified to fill.

Dr Keyu Jin is an Associate Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics. From Beijing, Keyu holds a BA, MA and a PhD from Harvard University. Her specific areas of expertise are international macroeconomics, international finance and the Chinese economy. Keyu will bring a new dimension to the Board and we look forward to her nomination being approved.

Mr Anton Rupert's proposed appointment to the Board would bring further insight into changing consumer behaviour in our target markets, in particular in the areas of digital marketing and web-based commerce. Anton has had extensive exposure to the all of Group's businesses over the past eight years.

Mr Nikesh Arora has had a distinguished career as a senior executive, an advisor and non-executive director. From India, Nikesh moved to the USA and held a number of senior positions in the finance and technology sectors. He was Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer of Google up to 2014 and was most recently Vice-Chairman of Softbank, the global telecommunications and technology company, and President and CEO of its internet and media operations. Nikesh will bring his great intellect and broad-based understanding of international business to the board and I look forward very much to his contribution to Richemont's future development.

Dr Vesna Nevistic has gained extensive experience in international consulting and finance having been a partner at McKinsey and Goldman Sachs. From 2009 to 2012 Vesna was a Group Managing Director at UBS and part of the team which restructured the bank's operations following the financial crisis. She holds Swiss and Croatian citizenship and has a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Vesna is currently an independent consultant, offering advice on corporate strategy and restructuring.

We also sincerely thank the over 28 000 employees of the Group for the talents and skills that they bring to Richemont as well as their commitment and hard work, especially during the challenging times the Group has faced in recent years.

Outlook
Volatility and uncertainty in the geopolitical and trading environments are likely to prevail. Our attention is focused on transitioning the Group to adjust to operating in a more sustainable growth environment, by adapting our product offer, communication and distribution to new consumption patterns while allocating resources primarily towards research and innovation, digital marketing, online sales platforms and training in all of our Maisons.

Richemont has a strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet that enables us to focus on value creation for shareholders over an extended time horizon. This approach allows our Maisons, which have significant brand equity and heritage, to plan and grow in what we continue to believe is a unique business with excellent long-term prospects.

Financial review

Sales
Sales for the year at both actual and constant exchange rates decreased by 4%. Excluding exceptional inventory buy-backs mostly related to the repurchase of slow moving watches from multi-brand retail partners, sales at constant rates decreased by 2%. Sales of jewellery, leather goods and writing instruments grew whilst watch sales declined, in part due to the buy-back initiative.

At constant exchange rates, sales in the Americas grew by 2%, were in line in Asia Pacific and declined in the other regions. The retail channel enjoyed growth, thereby continuing to outperform the wholesale channel.

Further details of sales by region, distribution channel and business area are given in the Review of Operations.

Gross profit
Gross profit declined by 4% to EUR 6 799 million in value terms. Gross profit for the year has been influenced by the inventory buy-back programme, which reduced sales by EUR 278 million. Overall charges to gross profit associated with the buy-back programme and other capacity adjustments amounted to EUR 253 million. If these two effects were neutralised, the gross margin would have been 64.6%. The gross margin benefited from a favourable currency environment which added 30 basis points compared to the previous year.

Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by 14% with an operating margin of 16.6%. Excluding one-time net charges of respectively EUR 109 million this year and EUR 97 million last year, operating profit for the year would have declined by 13%. The one-time net charges primarily comprise EUR 287 million in inventory buy-backs, distribution channels' optimisation and capacity adjustment measures, which were partly offset by a EUR 178 million gain on the sale of investment properties.

Including the above mentioned charges but excluding the gain on the sale of the investment properties, growth in total operating expenses was contained to 3%. Higher depreciation charges and variable rentals as well as the reopening of the Cartier New York and Ginza flagship stores led to a 3% growth in selling and distribution costs. These charges also partly reflect the net closing of 38 internal stores during the course of the year under review and net opening of 22 during the prior year. Both communication expenses and administration costs grew by 2%.

Profit for the year
Profit for the year decreased by 46% to EUR 1 210 million. This reduction reflects the non-recurrence of the EUR 639 million non-cash gain resulting from the merger of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP with YOOX Group in October 2015, the lower operating profit and a reversal in net finance costs. Net finance costs amounted to EUR 160 million compared to a net finance income of EUR 2 million in the prior year, principally due to the effects of the Group's currency hedging programme.

Earnings per share on a diluted basis decreased by 46% to EUR 2.141.

To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2017 would be EUR 1 079 million (2016: EUR 1 626 million). Basic HEPS for the year was EUR 1.913 (2016: EUR 2.882). Diluted HEPS for the year was EUR 1.909 (2016: EUR 2.873). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 28 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operations amounted to EUR 1 896 million, down from EUR 2 419 million in the prior year. The reduction reflects a lower operating profit and a EUR 268 million one-time contribution to a defined benefit pension plan for UK-based employees for the purpose of entering into an annuity agreement with a third party insurance company. The absorption of working capital of EUR 29 million compares favourably to the prior year (2016: EUR 171 million).

Net investment in tangible fixed assets amounted to EUR 521 million. This is predominantly a result of selective investments in the Maisons' network of boutiques, primarily existing stores under renovation, together with investments in the Group's central logistic and IT infrastructure.

The 2016 dividend of CHF 1.70 per share was paid in September 2016 and amounted CHF 959 million or EUR 878 million (2015: EUR 854 million).

During the year, the Group acquired some 1.8 million 'A' shares to hedge executive stock options. The cost of these purchases was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities linked to the currency hedging programme, leading to a net cash outflow of EUR 48 million.

Balance sheet
Inventories at the year-end amounted to EUR 5 302 million (2016: EUR 5 345 million), representing 22 months of cost of sales, broadly in line with the prior year.

At 31 March 2017, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 5 791 million (2016: EUR 5 339 million). It includes proceeds of EUR 370 million relating to the sale of investment properties in France.  The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated Money Market Funds, short-term bank deposits and short-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars. Bank loans to finance local operating entities are denominated in their local currency.

Richemont's balance sheet is strong, with shareholders' equity representing 77% of total equity and liabilities.

Proposed dividend
The Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 1.80 per share.

The dividend will be paid as follows:

           Gross dividend    Swiss withholding          Net payable
                per share            tax @ 35%            per share
Dividend        CHF 1.800            CHF 0.630            CHF 1.170

The dividend will be payable following the Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Geneva on Wednesday, 13 September 2017.

The last day to trade Richemont 'A' shares and Richemont South African Depository Receipts cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 19 September 2017. Both will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 20 September 2017.

The dividend on the Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA 'A' shares will be paid on Friday, 22 September 2017. The dividend in respect of the 'A' shares is payable in Swiss francs.

The dividend in respect of Richemont South African Depository Receipts will be payable on Thursday, 28 September 2017. The South African Depository Receipt dividend is payable in rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in Swiss francs to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African Depository Receipt holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 12 May 2017 on SENS, the Johannesburg stock exchange news service.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current year and the comparative year at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2016.

Europe
Europe accounted for 29% of overall sales. Compared to a 10% increase in the prior year, full year sales declined by 8% at constant exchange rates, having improved from a 17% decline in the first half of the year. France and Switzerland registered the largest contractions while the United Kingdom enjoyed a double digit growth rate in sales following the EU referendum. All product lines showed positive momentum with the exception of watches.

Asia Pacific
Sales in the Asia Pacific region were broadly in line with last year, at both actual and constant exchange rates, accounting for 37% of Group sales. Mainland China, now the Group's second largest market, Korea and Macau enjoyed strong sales.

Of note is the growth of watches in our internal stores as well as continued growth in jewellery, leather goods and writing instruments in the region. Clothing sales were impacted by 90 internal and franchise net store closures across the region.

Americas
The Americas returned to growth at constant exchange rates, driven by good sales in jewellery, leather goods and clothing. Sales were also supported by the reopening of the Cartier flagship in New York last September. The region's contribution to Group sales increased slightly to 17%.

Japan
The reopening of the Cartier flagship store in Ginza partially mitigated mixed exchange rate effects on tourist spending and the high comparative sales growth figures of 20% reported in the prior year. At constant exchange rates sales decreased by 12%, with all product categories being impacted. At actual exchange rates, Japan registered a 2% sales decline.

Middle East and Africa
Sales in the Middle East and Africa declined by 10% at constant exchange rates, with negative currency movements weighing both on tourist and local spending.

Retail
For the full year the retail channel generated a 4% sales increase, after a decline in the first half of the year. Strong retail sales in mainland China, Korea, the United Kingdom and the USA compensated for declines in Hong Kong and France. Retail sales were impacted by the net closing of 38 internal boutiques, leading to a total network of 1 117 internal stores.

The contribution of retail sales, through the Maisons' directly operated boutiques and online stores, has increased from 55% of Group sales, a year ago, to 60%.

Wholesale
The Group's wholesale business, including sales to franchise partners, reported lower sales for the year. Sales were partially impacted by inventory buy-backs, the majority of which occurred in the first half of the year.

All regions and most countries declined with the notable exception of the United Kingdom and Korea.

Sales and operating result by segment

Jewellery Maisons

+-----------------+--------------+--------------+---------+
|in EUR millions  |31 March 2017 |31 March 2016 |Change   |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+---------+

|Operating margin |28.4%         |31.3%         |-290 bps |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+---------+

Good growth in jewellery sales at Cartier and Van Cleef and Arpels partly offset weakness in watch sales, thereby limiting the Jewellery Maisons' sales decline to 2%. Excluding the exceptional buy-backs, sales would have increased slightly.

The operating result was 11% lower than in the prior period, pressured by lower sales and the EUR 151 million one-time charges associated with the exceptional inventory buy-backs and capacity adjustments.

Specialist Watchmakers

+-----------------+--------------+--------------+---------+
|in EUR millions  |31 March 2017 |31 March 2016 |Change   |

|Operating margin |7.8%          |16.1%         |-830 bps |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+---------+

The Specialist Watchmakers' sales decreased by 11%, reflecting a difficult environment for watches in the wholesale channel.

The lower demand for fine watches together with the adverse impact of buy-backs and production capacity adjustments led to a 57% reduction in the segment's operating result. One-time charges in the current year amounted to EUR 72 million (2016: EUR 24 million). Consequently, the operating margin for the period declined to 8%.

|Operating margin |6.0%          |-5.2%         |n/a    |
+-----------------+--------------+--------------+-------+

'Other' includes Montblanc, the Group's Fashion and Accessories businesses and its watch component manufacturing activities. The segment was impacted by 105 net internal and franchise store closures. The 2% sales growth was driven by the continued positive performances at Montblanc, Chloe and Peter Millar.

The operating result included one-time charges of EUR 64 million (2016: EUR 33 million) stemming from the optimisation of certain retail and wholesale locations that were more than offset by a gain of EUR 178 million relating to the disposal of investment properties. As a result, the operating contribution rose to EUR 110 million. Excluding one-time items in both years, operating losses would have been EUR 4 million in the current year and EUR 61 million in the prior year.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA ? CHANGES TO SOUTH AFRICAN DIVIDEND TAX

We refer to the announcement by the Minister of Finance on 22 February 2017, that the South African dividends tax has been increased from 15 percent to 20 percent. In the case of entities listed on the JSE, the increase is effective for all dividends paid on or after 22 February 2017.

With regard to the Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA dividend in respect of its 31 March 2017 financial year, payable in September 2017, we are in discussions with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to seek a ruling to clarify the approach to be taken. As such, we advise depositary receipt holders to obtain professional advice regarding their own positions until SARS has advised on this matter.

Review of trading in the three-month period ended 31 December 2016 at constant exchange rates
In Europe, sales increased by 3% in the third quarter, in contrast with the 17% decline registered in the first six months of the year. This improvement was
primarily driven by robust local sales and tourist purchases in the United Kingdom as well as strong jewellery sales across the region.
The 10% growth in sales in the Asia Pacific region reflected strong performances in mainland China and Korea, mitigated by continued declines in Hong Kong and
Macau.
Sales in the Americas region grew by 8%, supported by jewellery and the reopening of the Cartier Mansion in New York.
The decline in Japan was limited to 1% thanks to the resilience of the domestic clientele and the reopening of the Cartier flagship store in Tokyo. The Middle
East and Africa continued to be subdued.
Retail sales grew by 12%, compared to the 5% decline in the first six months of the current year, underpinned by solid jewellery sales, positive watch sales and
the reopening of the two Cartier stores mentioned above. In the wholesale channel, the decline in sales was limited to 3%.
Good demand for jewellery products and positive watch sales in retail contributed to the 8% sales increase at the Jewellery Maisons.
The Specialist Watchmakers' sales were down by 2%: positive growth in the retail channel was offset by continued weakness in the wholesale channel, albeit at a
lower rate.
The other businesses posted good growth, mainly driven by Chloe, Montblanc and Peter Millar.
The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2016 amounted to EUR 5.2 billion (2015: EUR 5.1 billion).

Trading in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016
Sales over the nine-month period to December declined by 6% at constant exchange rates and by 7% at actual exchange rates. They are presented in Appendix 1a.

Results for the year ending 31 March 2017
Net profit for the year will face a challenging comparative due to the prior year's inclusion of the EUR 639 million non-cash gain relating to the merger of
The NET-A-PORTER GROUP with YOOX Group.

Corporate calendar
The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 12 May 2017.
The Company's annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 13 September 2017 in Geneva.

Actual exchange rates for the period are calculated using the average daily closing rates against the euro.
In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2016 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the
current three-month period, the current nine-month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.

CHANGES TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT

4 NOVEMBER 2016


The Nominations Committee and Board of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA met yesterday and, inter alia, considered succession planning issues. The Board considered the impact on the Group's management structure of the impending retirement of key executives. It also considered the composition of the Board itself, recognising that rapidly changing technologies bring significant challenges to traditional business models.

Mr Richard Lepeu, Chief Executive Officer, has intimated his intention to retire with effect from 31 March 2017, when he will have reached retirement age. Mr Gary Saage, Chief Financial Officer, will re-join his family in the United States and retire from his current role effective 31 July 2017.

The Board has therefore decided to restructure the responsibilities of senior management in the Group, recognising the need to be able to react quickly to the challenges facing businesses in general and the luxury industry at this time.

Mr Johann Rupert will remain as Executive Chairman of the Group. The following senior executives will be nominated to the Board of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA for shareholder approval at the annual general meeting to be held in September 2017:

Mr Nicolas Bos, who will join the Board in his capacity as CEO of Van Cleef and Arpels;

Mr Burkhart Grund, currently Deputy Chief Financial Officer, who will become Chief Financial Officer;

Mr Georges Kern, currently CEO of IWC Schaffhausen, who will be Head of Watchmaking, Marketing and Digital;

Mr Jérôme Lambert, currently CEO of Montblanc, who will be Head of Operations responsible for central and regional services and all Maisons other than jewellery and watchmaking.

Further nominees to the Board of Directors of the Company may be intimated ahead of the annual general meeting to be held in 2017.

The following directors will retire from the Board of Directors of Compagnie Financière Richemont SA at the 2017 annual general meeting: Mr Yves-André Istel, Mr Bernard Fornas, Mr Richard Lepeu, Mr Simon Murray, Mr Norbert Platt, Lord Renwick of Clifton, Professor Juergen Schrempp and The Duke of Wellington.


Recognising the importance of continuity in the decision making process, the Board wishes to retain the wealth of knowledge that long-serving members and former executives bring to the decision-making process. Mr Istel, Mr Murray, Lord Renwick, Professor Schrempp and The Duke of Wellington will join a new International Advisory Council. The function of the Council will be to act as a sounding board for the Board of Directors, drawing on the significant expertise of its members. Messrs Fornas, Lepeu and Platt, together with Mr Alain-Dominique Perrin, will be appointed as senior advisors to Group management, liaising directly with the Executive Chairman and senior executives.

Mr Burkhart Grund, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, and Mr Frank Vivier, Chief Transformation Officer, will join the Group Management Committee with immediate effect.

Commenting on the proposals, Mr Johann Rupert, Chairman, said:


Quote

We are presenting today a series of changes to the way in which the Group operates which will take effect over the coming year. This reflects the retirement of some of our senior colleagues, as anticipated, which we have used as an opportunity to re-think the way in which the senior management group is structured. The changes we have proposed today will strengthen the Group's ability to respond to the dynamic markets in which we operate, especially in the developing field of digital marketing and e-commerce.

I would like to thank both Richard Lepeu and Gary Saage for their invaluable contribution to Richemont over the past 30 or so years in the case of Richard and some 28 years for Gary. Both have been loyal and hard-working colleagues. Richard has earned his retirement and I thank him sincerely for his valuable contribution across our luxury goods businesses, including at Vendome and Cartier as well as here at Richemont. Gary's family live in the USA and he has commuted across the Atlantic to visit them for almost 10 years. He has wanted to retire for some time and I have repeatedly persuaded him to stay. Now it is time for him to move back, having established a highly professional team in Geneva and a strong finance function across all our platforms. That the Group's cash flow, even in these difficult times, has been so strong is a tribute to Gary's management of the balance sheet. His contribution to the Group and his unwavering loyalty and support should never be underestimated.


Our senior board members are also retiring but their expertise will not be lost to the Group. Richemont has benefited from their wisdom and input over the years and I look forward to continuing to work with them all in an advisory capacity either as members of the International Advisory Council or as senior advisors to management. In these challenging times, their contribution will continue to be highly valued.

Chairman's commentary

Sales and profits for the six-month period ended 30 September 2016 were significantly below the prior year's level, reflecting the difficult global environment, the exceptional inventory buy-backs and challenging comparative figures in the first half of the previous financial year.

Retail sales generated in our owned boutiques and online stores have generally outperformed the wholesale business. Positive developments in accessories and resilience in jewellery partly mitigated poor watch sales. From a geographic perspective, most markets experienced a slowdown in sales with the notable exceptions of mainland China, the UK and Korea.

A number of Maisons proactively assisted their multi-brand retail partners in order to improve the quality of their inventory by buying back slow moving pieces. This initiative, together with the optimisation of certain retail and wholesale locations, led to one-time charges of EUR 249 million. These, combined with lower sales and lower gross profit, contributed to a 43 % decline in operating profit. Excluding these one-time charges, operating profit would have declined by 25 %. Net profit is down 51 % compared to the prior period.

Richemont acted cautiously, protecting Group cash flow. Working capital requirements have been kept under control, limiting the decline in cash flow from operations. Net cash at 30 September 2016 amounted to EUR 4 552 million. Concerning watches, we will look to deal with overcapacity issues, adapting manufacturing structures to the level of demand.

We remain convinced of the long-term prospects for high quality products, in particular for watches and jewellery. Our Maisons stand for timelessness, quality and craftsmanship - values that are particularly sought after in uncertain times. Richemont, with its portfolio of long-established Maisons, strong balance sheet and worldwide geographic footprint, is well positioned to weather the current difficult environment and emerge stronger when global circumstances improve.

Financial review

SALES
In the six-month period, sales decreased by 13 % at actual exchange rates or by 12 % at constant exchange rates. Excluding buy-backs, sales decreased by 8 % in constant terms. The decrease reflected the weak demand for watches in general, as well as historically high comparatives and the impact of exceptional inventory buy-backs. The decline in watch sales was partly mitigated by demand for accessories and, to a lesser degree, for jewellery. While all regions posted lower sales, Asia Pacific reported a softer rate of decline, benefitting notably from good momentum in mainland China and Korea. Overall, the retail channel was more resilient than the wholesale channel. Further details of sales by region, distribution channel and business area are given below.

GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit decreased by 15 %, representing 64 % of sales. The 150 basis points margin decrease versus the prior period is largely explained by the inventory buy-backs. This negative impact was partly offset by the growing proportion of retail sales and a favourable exchange rate environment.

OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit declined to EUR 798 million in the six-month period and the operating margin decreased to 16 %

The 2 % increase in total operating expenses factors in a 1 % growth in selling and distribution costs linked, in particular, to higher rental and depreciation charges. These charges followed last year's net opening of 22 boutiques. Communication expenses increased by 4 % while ”administration and other” costs grew by 1 %, inclusive of one-time charges of EUR 31 million.

Excluding all one-time charges of EUR 249 million relating to inventory buy-backs and distribution channels' optimisation, operating profit for the half year would have declined by 25 %.

PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD
Profit for the period decreased by 51 % to EUR 540 million. This reflects the reduction in operating profit and a reversal in net finance costs, which amounted to EUR 109 million compared to a net income of EUR 76 million in the prior period.

Earnings per share decreased by 51 % to EUR 0.955 on a diluted basis. To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the period ended 30 September 2016 would be EUR 530 million (2015: EUR 1 112 million). Basic HEPS for the period was EUR 0.940 (2015: EUR 1.972). Diluted HEPS for the period was EUR 0.937 (2015: EUR 1.968). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 10.3 of the Group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

CASH FLOW
Cash flow generated from operations amounted to EUR 666 million. At EUR 417 million, the absorption of cash for working capital in the current period was below last year (2015: EUR 558 million).

The net investment in tangible fixed assets during the period amounted to EUR 210 million, reflecting predominantly selective investments in the Maisons' network of boutiques.

The 2016 dividend of CHF 1.70 per share was paid to 'A' and 'B' shareholders and to South African Depository Receipt holders, net of withholding tax, in September. In the prior year, the equivalent dividend was paid to South African Depository Receipt holders in early October due to timing differences. The 35 % withholding tax on all dividends was remitted to the Swiss tax authorities in September. The cash outflow in the period amounted to EUR 878 million.

The Group acquired some  1.76 million 'A' shares during the six-month period to hedge executive stock options. The cost of these purchases was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities related to the hedging programme, leading to a net outflow of EUR 67 million.

FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND BALANCE SHEET
At 30 September 2016, inventories, at EUR 5 390 million, were broadly in line with the prior period representing 24 months of cost of sales.

At 30 September 2016, the Group's net cash position amounted to EUR 4 552 million. Compared with 31 March 2016, the position is EUR 787 million lower, partly reflecting the annual dividend payment.  The Group's net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated Money Market Funds, short-term bank deposits and medium-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars. Bank loans to finance local operating entities are denominated in their local currency.

Richemont's balance sheet remains strong, with shareholders' equity representing 73 % of total equity and liabilities.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current period and the comparative period at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2016.

EUROPE
Europe accounted for 31 % of overall sales. European countries saw a decline in sales after a strong performance in the prior period.  France was particularly affected by a significantly lower level of tourist activity. The UK, however, enjoyed double digit growth rates in sales following the EU referendum.

ASIA PACIFIC
Sales in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 35 % of the Group total, with Hong Kong and mainland China being the two largest markets. The rate of sales decline has continued to soften to 8 % compared to a 17 % decrease in the prior period. The inventory buy-backs from retail partners weighed heavily on sales in the region. The overall decline was partly offset by continuing growth in mainland China and positive retail, jewellery and accessories sales in the region.

AMERICAS
The Americas experienced a 5 % decline in sales partly due to a strong US dollar.  The weak performance of watch sales was somewhat mitigated by a positive momentum in accessories and resilient jewellery sales.

JAPAN
The strength of the yen, that weighed on tourist spending in the country, and the very high comparative figures of 44 % in the first half of last year contributed to a 22 % decline in sales. All product categories were impacted.

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
Sales declined by 10 %, impacted by lower sales mainly as a result of strong currencies.

RETAIL
The contribution of retail sales, through the Maisons' directly operated boutiques and online stores, has increased from 54 % of Group sales, a year ago, to 58 % given the relative strength of jewellery and accessories that are primarily sold through the Maisons' own boutiques.

Retail was affected by trading in Europe and Japan while Asia Pacific and the Americas showed muted growth. Overall, sales in the Maisons' 1 154 boutiques declined by 5 %.

WHOLESALE
The Group's wholesale business, including sales to franchise partners, declined by 20 %, particularly impacted by the above mentioned one-time items.

+-------------------+------------------+------------------+--------+

The 13 % decline in sales at the Jewellery Maisons – Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels and Giampiero Bodino – is primarily attributable to watches, significantly impacted by the initiative to assist multi-brand retail partners worldwide. Resilient jewellery sales limited the decline.

The operating result was 31 % lower than in the prior period, pressured by lower sales and the costs associated with the exceptional inventory buy-backs. This led to an operating margin of 27 %. Excluding these costs, the operating margin would have been 32 %.

+-------------------+------------------+------------------+-------+

The Specialist Watchmakers' sales decreased by 17 %. This largely reflected a difficult environment for watches, in particular in the wholesale channel.

The lower demand for fine watches, together with the adverse impact of inventory buy-backs and a relative fixed cost base, combined to reduce operating results by 53 %. Consequently, the operating margin for the period declined to 13 %.

Following the merger of the Net-A-Porter Group with YOOX S.p.A in October 2015, the figures in the table above exclude The Net-A-Porter Group's sales in the prior period.

As expected, sales for the five-month period ended 31 August 2016 were below the prior year's level, reflecting the challenging comparative figures in 2015, the repurchase of slow moving watch inventory and the difficult global environment. Overall currency movements also adversely impacted the Group's sales.

The following comments on the Group's underlying performance refer to year-on-year movements at constant exchange rates.

Sales in the United Kingdom have shown growth since the weakening of sterling against most currencies at the end of June following the EU referendum. Elsewhere in Europe, sales were down, particularly in France, due to a significantly lower level of tourist activity. The Americas saw positive momentum in both jewellery and accessories but saw an overall decline in sales due to a weaker performance in watches. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth in mainland China and Korea was more than offset by the continuing weakness of the Hong Kong and Macau markets. The policy of buying back inventory to assist our multi-brand retail partners was primarily focused on these two markets. Japan reported significantly lower sales against very high comparative figures. The strength of the yen also depressed tourist spending in the country, with a noticeable impact on sales.

Retail declined overall, primarily due to Europe and Japan. All other regions' sales declines were low single digits, supported by jewellery and accessories. The marked decrease in wholesale sales reflected the continuing negative trend overall, and the above mentioned watch inventory buy backs.

Richemont's other businesses, as a whole, reported sales growth, thanks to positive performances at Montblanc, Chloe, Azzedine Alaia and Peter Millar.


Outlook

We consider that the difficult trading conditions are likely to continue during September. Operating profit for the six months ending 30 September 2016 is therefore expected to be approximately 45% below the prior year's level, reflecting the effect of one-off restructuring charges of approximately EUR65 million, and the additional effect of the product buy-backs.

Consequently, we anticipate profit for the period for the six months ending 30 September 2016 will also be impacted at a broadly similar level to the decline in operating profit. Profit for the period reflects not only the movement in operating profit but also the impact of movements in period-end exchange rates, interest, taxation and discontinued operations and therefore cannot be determined absolutely at this time. The results for the six months ending 30 September 2016 will be announced on 4 November 2016.

We are of the view that the current negative environment as a whole is unlikely to reverse in the short term. However, we remain convinced of the long-term prospects for luxury goods globally, and in particular for watches and jewellery. Richemont is well positioned, with a strong balance sheet and a portfolio of long-established Maisons.

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – EXCHANGE RATE APPLICABLE FOR DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS IN RESPECT OF UNDERLYING COMPAGNIE FINANCIERE RICHEMONT SA 'A' SHARES ('CFR DRs')

The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares. The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in rand.

The Board of Directors has recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.70 per share. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on 14 September 2016 in Geneva.  The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.105 per share.

Richemont Securities SA will operate a programme for South African tax residents, who will generally be eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend. Full details of the programme will be mailed to holders of CFR DRs on 26 September 2016, at the time of the payment of the dividend. In the past certain CFR DR Holders may have lost their opportunity to reclaim the withholding tax due to incorrect contact information being supplied to STRATE. We suggest that CFR DR Holders contact their CSDP or stockbroker in advance of the payment to ensure the information held in the STRATE system is correct. In completing last year's withholding tax reclaim, claimants may have included their email address. For all of those who provided this information, the withholding tax reclaim form will be sent by email to you. For those who did not provide email details we would ask you to contact Computershare at the following address WHT.Richemont@Computershare.co.za Once received Computershare will email the withholding tax reclaim form to you for your completion. We hope that this may alleviate the postal difficulties some claimants have experienced in the past. If you do not have an email address, please contact Computershare on 0861 100 935, to arrange a withholding tax reclaim form to be posted to you.

As confirmed previously, a binding class ruling has been obtained from the South African Revenue Service. In terms of this ruling, depository receipt holders are not subject to additional South African withholding tax because of the credit available in respect of the Swiss withholding tax paid. It is also confirmed that there is no need for the depository receipt holders to make any declarations in order to qualify for the exemption from the South African withholding tax.

As CFR DR's trade in the ratio of 10 DRs to each Richemont 'A' share, the dividend entitlement per CFR DR is as follows:

                  Gross dividend     Withholding tax
                  per CFR DR         at 35%            Net dividend
                  in Swiss francs    in Swiss francs   in Swiss francs
Total             0.1700             (0.0595)          0.1105

The exchange rate applicable for the conversion of Swiss franc to rand for payment of the dividend is ZAR 14.69460: Swiss franc 1. Accordingly the net dividend payable per CFR DR is ZAR 162.37533 cents, as set out in the table below:

                  Gross dividend     Withholding tax
                  Per CFR DR         at 35%            Net dividend

Total             249.80820          (87.43287)        162.37533

Under the withholding tax recovery programme qualifying SACMA residents will currently be entitled to recover the equivalent of CHF 0.034 per CFR DR. The amount recovered will be converted into rand and will be remitted to CFR DR holders who participate in the programme once the reimbursement of the tax has been received from the Swiss Federal Tax Authorities ('SFTA'). Your attention is drawn to the fact that the refunds are to be paid by the SFTA in Swiss francs. The Swiss francs received by Richemont Securities SA will be converted into rand at the rand: Swiss franc exchange rate ruling at the time of receipt. Bearing in mind the fluctuating rand: Swiss franc exchange rate, the effective rate used to arrive at the rand refund payment to CFR DR holders will differ from that applicable to the dividend payment itself.

The payment dates for the dividend in respect of the South African CFR DRs are anticipated to be as follows:

Last date to trade ""cum dividend""       Tuesday, 20 September 2016

Trading commences ""ex-dividend""
from the commencement of business on  Wednesday, 21 September 2016

CFR DR dividend payment date             Monday, 26 September 2016

CFR DR holders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their holding of CFR DRs between Wednesday, 21 September 2016 and Friday, 23 September 2016 both days inclusive, nor will transfers to/from the South African branch register be permitted between 21 September 2016 and 23 September 2016 (both dates inclusive).

RICHEMONT SECURITIES SA – DIVIDEND DATES IN RESPECT OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS ('CFR DR')

The dividend payable to holders of Richemont Securities' CFR DRs resident in the South African Common Monetary Area ('SACMA') is derived from the dividend paid by Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, Switzerland ('CFR') to holders of Richemont 'A' shares.

The CFR DR dividend payable to SACMA residents is payable in Rand and will be effected via CSD participants in Strate for all dematerialised holdings and Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited for those on the certificated register.

The Board of directors have recommended a total dividend of CHF 1.7000 per share from income reserves. It is anticipated that this dividend will be approved by shareholders of CFR at the annual general meeting to be held on Wednesday 14 September 2016 in Geneva. The dividend payable by CFR will be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35 per cent, resulting in a net dividend of CHF 1.1050 per share. As South African tax residents are eligible to recover 20 per cent of the 35 per cent withholding tax levied on the CFR dividend, the effective tax rate is 15 per cent. This is equivalent to the South African withholding tax rate and as such depository receipt holders will not be subject to additional South African withholding tax.

The issued share capital of CFR at the declaration date, including treasury shares, comprises the listed 'A' shares of 522'000'000 with a par value of CHF 1.00 each and the unlisted 'B' shares of 522'000'000 with a par value of CHF 0.10 each.

Chairman's commentary

Overview of results
In the first six months of the year under review, Richemont reported double-digit growth, followed by a decline in the second half. Our concerns over geopolitical risks and the impact on the behaviour of our clients proved justified. Europe turned negative in mid-year and trading conditions in Hong Kong and Macau remained difficult. Only mainland China showed good growth. Overall, full year Group sales rose by 6%, helped by favourable exchange rate effects.

Against this background of difficult trading conditions and events, the Maisons have worked to respond to changing market demands. The Jewellery Maisons delivered sales growth and profit resilience through successful jewellery lines and favourable currencies. For the Specialist Watchmakers and Cartier watches, the impact of the stronger Swiss franc on watch manufacturing costs, together with lower capacity utilisation, combined to depress gross margins. Montblanc, Chloé and Peter Millar reported good sales growth. Other fashion Maisons faced difficult trading conditions throughout the year.

In this environment our Maisons adjusted their fixed cost bases. Accordingly, related restructuring and one-time charges of EUR 97 million were recorded against operating profit during the year under review. Excluding these charges and the gain realised on the sale of a real estate property in the comparative year, operating profit decreased by 11%.

On 5 October 2015, Richemont announced the completion of the merger of the NET-A-PORTER GROUP with the YOOX GROUP which generated a one-off, non-cash pre- and post-tax accounting gain of EUR 639 million in the current year. At that point, Richemont owned 50% of the enlarged group but chose to limit its voting rights to 25%. Following the completion of a EUR 100 million rights issue entirely subscribed by the Emaar Properties Group, owner of the Dubai Mall, Richemont’s equity interest is now 49%.

In the comparative year, Richemont reported a gain on the sale of a real estate property, but also incurred significant non-cash losses stemming from the revaluation of the Swiss franc. Including the impact of the significant one-off items in both years, Richemont’s net profit increased by 67% over the prior year's level.

Important to the Board and shareholders are the Group’s operating and free cash flows. Both remain solid and stable over the two-year period. At the end of March 2016, the Group’s balance sheet was exceptionally strong, with net cash amounting to EUR 5 339 million and shareholders’ equity representing 75% of total equity and liabilities.

Dividend
Based upon the results for the year and in keeping with its stated objective to grow dividends steadily over the long term, the Board has proposed a dividend of CHF 1.70 per share; up from CHF 1.60 per share last year.

Outlook
April sales declined by 18% and 15% on a reported and constant rates basis. All regions reported a decline in sales. At constant exchange rates, only the Middle East and Africa posted growth. This performance was largely anticipated. Asia Pacific remained weak due to no recovery in Hong Kong and Macau, only partially offset by continued improvement in mainland China, which was up 26% on a constant rate basis. Retail sales continued to outperform the wholesale channel. The challenging comparatives will persist through September.

In the near term, we are doubtful that any meaningful improvement in the trading environment is to be expected. We are notably addressing the challenges faced by the watch industry. Cash flow generation is a key priority. We are tightly monitoring costs, working capital requirements and allocating resources in a highly selective manner. Nevertheless this will be accompanied by continued investments in our Maisons to ensure long term value creation. The Group will look to consolidate its global retail presence, particularly in mainland China, and will invest further in jewellery.

We are confident in the long term demand for high quality products. The Group remains committed to supporting its Maisons to conceive, develop, manufacture and market products of beauty, individuality and the highest quality. These values are enduring and will see Richemont well positioned to benefit from an improved market in the years to come.

Chairman


Financial review

Sales
The 6 % increase in sales at actual exchange rates, or 1% decrease at constant exchange rates, reflected growth in jewellery, leather goods and clothing. Regionally, demand grew in Europe, the Middle East, Americas and Japan.

The retail channel performed better than the wholesale channel, although sales through both channels remained volatile. The volatility was highlighted by the contrasted first and second half of the year under review for all regions and channels. 

Further details of sales by region, distribution channel and business area are given in the Review of Operations.

Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 4%. The gross margin percentage was 180 basis points lower at 64.3% of sales. The significant increase in the value of the Swiss franc versus other currencies, which followed the Swiss National Bank’s decision in January 2015 to remove the euro / Swiss franc ‘peg’, had a negative impact on the cost of sales throughout the year under review. The gross margin was also negatively impacted by lower capacity utilisation and one-time charges of EUR 67 million related to various Maisons and manufacturing facilities in Switzerland. 

Operating profit
Operating expenses increased by 14% during the year amid adverse exchange rate effects. Compared to the 13% increase in sales through the Maisons' own boutique networks, selling and distribution expenses were 16% higher, including depreciation charges linked to the opening of new boutiques in the prior year as well as higher fixed rental costs. Communication expenses rose by 8% and continued to represent between 9% and 10% of sales. Administration and other expenses grew by 16%, largely driven by the stronger Swiss franc. Included within operating expenses are further one-time charges of EUR 30 million, primarily relating to asset impairment and restructuring charges.

Operating profit was 23% below the prior year at EUR 2 061 million. Excluding the restructuring and one-time charges in the current year and the gain realised on the sale of a real estate property in the comparative year, operating profit decreased by 11%.

Profit for the year
Profit for the year increased by 67% to EUR 2 227 million. In value terms, the significant increase in net profit primarily reflects the non-recurrence of a non-cash financial charge related to the Swiss National Bank’s actions in January 2015; and a non-cash gain arising from the merger of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP with YOOX Group in October 2015.

In the prior year, net financial costs amounted to EUR 953 million. Of those net costs, a non-cash financial charge EUR 652 million stemmed from the appreciation of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies in January 2015. Since January 2015, the value of the Swiss franc has depreciated somewhat relative to the euro. Accordingly, the Group has recorded translation gains on certain cash and short-term money market investments during the year under review. The size of those gains is less than the losses in the prior year due to the relative movement in exchange rates and a greater diversification in the Group's investments. Compared to January 2015, a larger proportion of the Group's liquid assets are now held in instruments denominated in US dollar and the Swiss franc. 

On 5 October 2015, the merger of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP with YOOX Group was completed. The all-share transaction generated a non-cash gain amounting to EUR 639 million. This gain was partly offset by the operating results of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP until the merger date. At 31 March 2016, Richemont held 50% of the publicly traded ordinary shares in YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP SpA, but capped its voting rights in those shares at 25%. Accordingly, Richemont equity-accounts its share of the results from that investment: the results for the year ended 31 March 2016 include a post-tax gain of EUR 3 million for the period from 5 October to 31 December 2015. Further details regarding the accounting treatment of the merger transaction and subsequent reporting may be found in notes 10 and 28 of the consolidated financial statements.

Earnings per share on a diluted basis, including discontinued operations, increased by 67% to EUR 3.935.

To comply with the South African practice of providing headline earnings per share ('HEPS') data, the relevant figure for headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2016 would be EUR 1 626 million (2015: EUR 1 208 million). Basic HEPS for the year was EUR 2.882 (2015: EUR 2.143). Diluted HEPS for the year was EUR 2.873 (2015: EUR 2.133). Further details regarding earnings per share and HEPS, including an itemised reconciliation, may be found in note 29 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Cash flow
Cash flow generated from operations was EUR 2 419 million, broadly in line with the prior year. This solid cash generation principally reflected a limited increase in working capital, broadly offsetting the decrease in operating profit. Inventories increased by EUR 139 million in the year under review compared with an increase of EUR 506 million in the comparative period. 

The net acquisition of tangible fixed assets amounted to EUR 613 million, reflecting further investment in manufacturing facilities, largely in Switzerland, as well as selective investment in the Group’s worldwide network of boutiques, including refurbishments.

The 2015 dividend, at CHF 1.60 per share, was paid to 'A' shareholders in September 2015. The cash outflow in the year amounted to CHF 903 million or EUR 854 million (2014: EUR 650 million).

During the year, the Group acquired 1.8 million 'A' shares to hedge executive stock options. The cost of these purchases was partly offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by executives and other activities linked to the hedging programme, leading to a net cash outflow of EUR 94 million.

Financial structure and balance sheet
Inventories at the year-end amounted to EUR 5 345 million (2015: EUR 5 438 million) and the year-end inventory position represented 22 months of gross inventories. The inventory rotation rate remained stable, reflecting disciplined management by all Maisons.

At 31 March 2016, the Group’s net cash position amounted to EUR 5 339 million (2015: EUR 5 419 million). The net cash position includes highly liquid, highly rated Money Market Funds, short-term bank deposits and medium-duration bond funds, primarily denominated in Swiss francs, euros and US dollars. Bank loans to finance local operating entities are denominated in their local currency. 

Richemont's financial structure remains strong, with shareholders' equity representing 75% of total equity and liabilities.

Proposed dividend
The Board has proposed a cash dividend of CHF 1.70 per share.

The dividend will be paid as follows:

The last day to trade Richemont 'A' shares and Richemont South African Depository Receipts cum-dividend will be Tuesday, 20 September 2016. Both will trade ex-dividend from Wednesday, 21 September 2016.

The dividend on the Compagnie Financière Richemont SA 'A' shares will be paid on Friday, 23 September 2016. The dividend in respect of the 'A' shares is payable in Swiss francs.

The dividend in respect of Richemont South African Depository Receipts will be payable on Monday, 26 September 2016. The South African Depository Receipt dividend is payable in rand to residents of the South African Common Monetary Area ('CMA') but may, dependent upon residence status, be payable in Swiss francs to non-CMA residents. Further details regarding the dividend payable to South African Depository Receipt holders may be found in a separate announcement dated 20 May 2016 on SENS, the Johannesburg stock exchange news service.

* Movements at constant exchange rates are calculated by translating underlying sales in local currencies into euros in both the current year and the comparative year at the average exchange rates applicable for the financial year ended 31 March 2015.

Europe
Europe accounted for 31% of overall sales. Due to both the exchange rate environment and a change in sentiment from November 2015, tourism flows were significantly lower in the second half of the year. Those flows were reflected in first-half sales growth of 26%, whereas the second half-year sales were 5% lower than the comparative period. For the year as a whole, sales in the region increased by 10%.

Middle East and Africa
Markets in the Middle East and Africa continued to report strong growth throughout the year. Those markets benefit from a resilient domestic clientele and now account for 8% of Group sales.

Asia-Pacific
Sales in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 36% of the Group total. Hong Kong and Macau saw significantly lower sales throughout the year, most notably affecting the watch category and the wholesale channel. However, those decreases were partly offset by growth in other important markets, including mainland China.

Americas
The Americas region, which accounted for 16% of Group sales, was subdued throughout the year. Domestic demand for jewellery largely offset soft demand for watches.

Japan
In Japan, sales to tourists increased during the year, partly reflecting exceptionally favourable exchange rate effects for incoming visitors. The high rate of sales growth reported in the first half of the year was tempered during the second half-year period.

Retail
Sales through the Maisons' directly operated boutiques and e commerce accounted for 55% of Group sales. During the year as a whole, sales through those channels increased by 13% and continued to outperform the more volatile wholesale channel. In the first half-year period, retail sales increased by 26%, whereas sales in the second half-year were just 2% higher than the comparative period. 

The growth in retail sales partly reflected the addition of 22 internal boutiques to the Maisons’ network, which reached 1 155 stores. 

Wholesale
The Group’s wholesale business, including sales to franchise partners, reported lower sales for the year. In the first half-year period, wholesale sales increased by 4%, whereas sales in the second half-year were 6% lower than the comparative period.

The year's performance partly reflected the caution of our Maisons' business partners in general, particularly in Hong Kong, Macau and, in the second half of the year, Europe.

The Jewellery Maisons – Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels and Giampiero Bodino – reported a 7% growth.

The Maisons saw good demand for their jewellery collections, but overall demand for watches collections suffered due to a challenging environment in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions. Despite a number of flagship closures for renovation, the boutique networks reported growth, whereas wholesale sales were lower than the comparative period.

At 31%, the operating margin was 360 basis points lower than the prior year, partly reflecting one-time charges of EUR 24 million.

+-----------------+-------------+-------------+--------+

The Specialist Watchmakers' sales increased by 3% overall.

Operating contribution was 29% lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting negative sentiment and a difficult environment in Hong Kong, Macau and the Americas region as well as the impact of a strong Swiss franc on the cost of goods sold. The operating margin for the year was 16%, partly reflecting one-time charges of EUR 24 million.

'Other' includes Montblanc, the Group's Fashion and Accessories businesses and its watch component manufacturing activities. The operating results for the prior year included a one-time, pre-tax gain of EUR 234 million stemming from a real estate property disposal. Excluding that gain, operating losses increased from EUR 64 million to EUR 94 million, largely attributable to the performances at Alfred Dunhill and Lancel. The overall losses were partly offset by improved profitability at Montblanc, Chloé and Peter Millar. One-time charges amounted to EUR 33 million.

Corporate costs represent the costs of central management, marketing support and other central functions (collectively central support services), as well as other expenses and income which are not allocated to specific business areas. Included in central support services costs in the current year is a goodwill impairment charge relating to a fashion business amounting to EUR 16 million. The majority of corporate costs are incurred in Switzerland. On a constant currency basis and excluding the goodwill impairment charge, central support services grew by 6%.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CHANGES TO THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

18 MARCH 2016


Compagnie Financière Richemont SA announces the retirement of Mr Bernard Fornas from his current role as Co-Chief Executive Officer with effect from 31 March 2016. He will also retire from Richemont's Senior Executive Committee and the Group Management Committee.

From 1 April, Mr Fornas will continue to serve on the Board of Directors as a Non-Executive Director and will serve on its Nominations Committee. He will stand for re-election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting ('AGM').

Mr Fornas has served as Co-Chief Executive Officer, alongside Mr Richard Lepeu, since April 2013 and as a member of the Board since September 2013. He joined Cartier in 1994 and, over the following 22 years, has made an outstanding contribution to the profitable growth of that Maison and to the Group in general. The Board looks forward to his contribution in the years ahead.

Mr Johann Rupert, Chairman of Richemont, said:

""Bernard Fornas has contributed hugely to the development of Cartier, and latterly the larger Richemont group, over the past 22 years. Through his understanding of luxury, his leadership skills and his keen eye for detail, he has been a major figure in the significant growth that the Group has enjoyed over the past decade.

As the luxury goods domain evolves around us, Richemont's Board is delighted that Bernard has chosen to serve Richemont's shareholders for many more years to come.""

Richemont also announces that Mr Cyrille Vigneron, Chief Executive Officer of Cartier, will become a member of the Senior Executive Committee with effect from 1 April 2016. He will continue to be a member of the Group Management Committee. As previously announced, Mr Vigneron will stand for election to the Board of Directors at the next AGM.

*Sales in the comparative period have been re-presented to reflect discontinued operations: The NET-A-PORTER GROUP
 
 
Review of trading in the three-month period ended 31 December 2015 at constant exchange rates
 
In Europe, the decline in the third quarter, which contrasted with the very strong sales growth seen in the first six months of the year, began in November and primarily reflects lower levels of tourism in the region.
 
Trading in the Asia Pacific region remains challenging, impacted by the continued contraction in watch demand. In terms of specific markets, the rate of sales growth continued to improve in mainland China, whereas Hong Kong and Macau both reported significantly lower sales.
 
Sales in the Americas region continued to be subdued. Jewellery continued to show growth, partially offsetting soft demand for watches.
 
Sales growth in Japan continued, albeit at a lower rate than during the first six months of the current year, largely due to increasingly challenging comparatives and seasonal factors, in particular Chinese tourism. The Middle East and Africa continued to show limited growth.
 
Retail sales continued to significantly outperform the wholesale channel. Compared to the first six months of the current year, the slowdown in sales through our Maisons’ own boutiques reflected the regional factors described above.
 
Good demand for jewellery products contributed to the Jewellery Maisons' performance. This limited the decline for the segment as a whole, given the relatively weak demand for watches.
 
The decline in sales by the Group's Specialist Watchmakers reflected caution in the wholesale channel, most notably in Hong Kong, Macau and the Americas region.
 
The other businesses posted modest growth, mainly driven by Chloé, Montblanc and Peter Millar.
 
The Group's net cash position at 31 December 2015 amounted to EUR 5.1 billion (2014: EUR 4.9 billion).
 
Trading in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015
 
Sales growth over the nine-month period to December were flat at constant exchange rates, but increased by 11 % at actual rates. Sales for the nine months ended 31 December 2015 are presented in Appendix 1a.
 
Results for the year ending 31 March 2016
 
The challenging trading environment is likely to prevail in the final quarter to 31 March 2016. Operating profit for the year as a whole will also be negatively affected on a comparative basis by the property disposal gain of EUR 234 million recorded in the year ended 31 March 2015.
 
Net profit for the year will benefit on a comparative basis from the non-cash gain of some EUR 620 million announced in October 2015 relating to the merger of The NET-A-PORTER GROUP with YOOX Group. Additionally, should the Swiss franc remain at current levels versus the euro, the non-cash financial charge of EUR 652 million recorded in the prior year relating to the Swiss National Bank's actions in January 2015 will not recur in the current year.
 
 
Corporate calendar
 
The Group's results for the current financial year will be announced on Friday, 20 May 2016.
 
The Company’s annual general meeting will be held on Wednesday, 14 September 2016 in Geneva.

Actual exchange rates for the period are calculated using the average daily closing rates against the euro.
 
In terms of sales at constant exchange rates, average exchange rates for the year ended 31 March 2015 are used to convert local currency sales into euros for the current three-month period, the current nine-month period and comparative figures. Exchange rate translation effects are thereby eliminated from the reported sales performance.
